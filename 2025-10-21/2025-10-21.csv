Thieves stole “priceless” jewelry from the Louvre in Paris in an audacious seven-minute raid that took place just after the world's most-visited museum opened on Sunday. Former jewel thief Larry Lawton says the heist was well-planned, but the thieves made a few mistakes that may help investigators.

Telegram founder Pavel Durov has offered to buy the French crown jewels stolen from the Louvre.

On Sunday, four thieves broke into Paris' most famous museum in broad daylight and ran off with eight artifacts, including necklaces, earrings, and a tiara owned by 19th-century royals.

“Happy to buy the stolen jewelry and donate it back to the Louvre. I mean Louvre Abu Dhabi, of course; no one steals from Louvre Abu Dhabi,” the Russian-born tech entrepreneur, who lives in Dubai, wrote on X on Tuesday.

Opened in 2017, the Louvre Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island is a joint project between France and the UAE.

Durov said he was “not at all surprised” by the Paris heist. “It's another sad sign of the decline of a once-great country, where the government has perfected the art of distracting people with phantom threats instead of confronting the real ones,” he wrote.

Not at all surprised by the Louvre heist. It's another sad sign of the decline of a once great country — where the government has perfected the art of distracting people with phantom threats instead of confronting the real ones.

Durov has previously accused the French government of trying to force him to impose political censorship on Telegram. Last year, he was detained at a Paris airport on charges of failing to remove illegal content from his platform before being released on bail.

Footage has appeared showing former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni holding hands while walking to a car that will take him to Paris' La Sante prison, where he will start a five-year sentence on Tuesday.

Sarkozy, who led France between 2007 and 2012, was convicted by a Paris court last month over a 2005 plot to obtain secret campaign funds from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, against whom he led a NATO-backed regime change operation that destroyed the country.

A crowd of supporters applauded and chanted “Nicolas, Nicolas” as the 70-year-old hugged his spouse and got into the black vehicle.

The former president, who denies any wrongdoing, issued a statement on X later on Tuesday, claiming that the case against him had been launched based on a forged document and vowing “to continue to expose this legal scandal.”

US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese struck a deal on Monday aimed at expanding America's access to critical minerals.

Under the agreement Washington and Canberra will each invest over $1 billion in mining and processing projects in Australia over the next six months, part of Washington's strategy to reduce reliance on China for key resources. 

China accounts for nearly 70% of the global production of critical minerals, which are essential for advanced technologies, including electric vehicles, semiconductors and weapons systems.

The White House indicated that these investments would focus on critical mineral deposits valued at $53 billion, though specifics regarding the types or locations were not disclosed. 

“In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them,” Trump told reporters.

Australia has an $8.5 billion “pipeline that we have ready to go,” Albanese said at the meeting with Trump at the White House.

The deal comes amid ongoing tensions between the US and China over rare-earth supplies. Earlier this year, Beijing retaliated against Trump's trade policies by imposing export restrictions on critical minerals. 

In early October, China announced new export controls on certain strategic minerals that have dual-use in military applications, citing national security. While the policy does not explicitly target the US, American high-tech companies remain heavily reliant on Chinese rare-earth supplies.  

The increased supply uncertainty has fueled US efforts to establish alternative production capabilities. In response to Beijing's imposition of export controls on rare earths Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting in November, escalating tensions.

Commenting on the standoff with the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian reiterated last week that “tariff wars and trade wars have no winners” and urged for resolution through “consultation on the basis of equality, respect, and mutual benefit.”

Earlier this year, Trump significantly raised “reciprocal tariffs” on China, with some exceeding 100%. However, he later suspended the increase to facilitate trade talks, extending the pause until November 10. The current baseline tariff for China stands at 10%, though certain goods face higher rates.

WASHINGTON, October 21. /TASS/. The meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which had been in the works for the past few days, has been postponed indefinitely, CNN reported, citing its sources in the White House.

According to the TV channel, the planned meeting has been postponed for the time being. However, CNN noted that it is unclear why the meeting will not take place this week.

On Monday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that no agreement had been reached on the time and place of the meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, and that everything was still under consideration.

According to CNN sources, Lavrov and Rubio disagree on how to peacefully settle the Ukrainian conflict. In addition, CNN stated that the impact of postponing their meeting indefinitely on the talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Budapest is still unclear.

After a telephone conversation between the top diplomats, CNN noted that US officials concluded Russia's position on Ukraine had not changed. At this point, Rubio is unlikely to recommend that Putin and Trump meet next week. However, he and Lavrov may speak by phone again this week.

The Russian Foreign Ministry previously stated that Lavrov and Rubio discussed potential concrete steps to implement the understandings reached during Putin's October 16 telephone conversation with Trump. Following his conversation with Putin, Trump said they had agreed to meet soon in Budapest. Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov noted that Moscow and Washington would immediately begin preparations for a new meeting between the leaders, which could be held in the Hungarian capital.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, October 21. /TASS/. Russia is ready to cooperate ""with open arms"" with everyone who intend to build relations on the basis of equality and mutual respect, but not dictate, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

Flight returned to Omaha airport minutes after departing for Los Angeles, after intercom was left on by accident

Pilots aboard a US commercial jet mistakenly thought someone was trying to invade the cockpit on Monday, leading the flight to return to the Omaha airport fewer than 40 minutes after departing for Los Angeles.

The misunderstanding on American Airlines Flight 6469 came about because the intercom that pilots and flight attendants use to speak to each other had been left on by accident, an American Airlines spokesperson said. The pilots heard some static sound over this intercom, and they mistakenly thought it meant someone was trying to break in.

According to video shot after the plane's landing and reported on by KABC, passengers onboard were confused as the flight's captain sought to explain what had happened.

“We weren't sure if something was going on with the airplane, so that's why we're coming back here,” the captain said, according to the video. “It's going to be a little bit – we have to figure out what's going on.”

Cockpit doors on passenger jets are generally locked during flights, and they were reinforced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks involving hijacked planes.

Monday's flight was operated by SkyWest, which flies regional routes for American and other airlines. The plane was an Embraer ERJ 175, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.

The Omaha Airport Authority said there was no security-related incident at the airport and referred questions to American.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ingrassia, Trump's pick to lead the office of special counsel, allegedly described himself as having ‘a Nazi streak'

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump's nomination of a conservative attorney and commentator to oversee federal whistleblower protections appeared to be collapsing after his racist text messages surfaced this week and the Republican Senate leader suggested the White House should withdraw the pick.

Paul Ingrassia, currently a White House liaison at the Department of Homeland Security, previously advocated for making 6 January a national holiday and publicly questioned whether the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack was a “psyop”. But the fans were flamed again on Monday after Politico reported text messages in which Ingrassia allegedly described himself as having “a Nazi streak” and suggested Martin Luther King Jr Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell”.

When reporters asked whether the administration should pull Ingrassia's nomination to lead the office of special counsel, John Thune, the Senate majority leader, responded on Monday: “I think so. He's not going to pass”.

At least three GOP senators on the homeland security committee indicated they will vote against Ingrassia when his confirmation hearing proceeds on Thursday: Rick Scott of Florida, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and James Lankford of Oklahoma.

“I don't plan on voting for him,” Scott told reporters. “I can't imagine how anybody can be antisemitic in this country”.

The nominee can afford to lose only three Republican votes on the homeland security committee, which Republicans control by a single seat. Democrats are expected to vote unanimously against the confirmation.

Edward Paltzik, an attorney representing Ingrassia, questioned the authenticity of the messages to Politico, and suggested they could be AI-generated. He labeled them as “self-deprecating” and “satirical humor”, adding that his client is “the furthest thing from a Nazi”.

Politico also reported earlier this month that Ingrassia faced a harassment investigation involving a junior colleague, though the complaint was subsequently withdrawn. Paltzik also denied the allegations.

The office of special counsel protects federal employees from retaliation for whistleblowing. While the position can't prosecute crimes, it can pursue disciplinary action against federal workers.

Joni Ernst, a senator from Iowa, stopped short of outright opposition but said the nominee faces an “uphill battle”. When asked about her biggest concerns, she replied: “Where do I start?”

Impeachment and 25th amendment offer routes for removal – but experts say the system is set up to protect the president

Donald Trump looked out across the White House ballroom at his audience of wealthy donors and business figures – people who had given millions of dollars to his extravagant plan to build a vast ballroom attached to the building's East Wing.

The president, 79, told the crowd he had enjoyed a “really historic trip” to the Middle East, and indulged in some of his familiar patter: saying his tariffs were successful, and claiming that under Joe Biden, countries were “literally emptying out insane asylums into our country”.

As his speech, given last Wednesday, labored on, Trump turned to ballroom specifics.

He said: “So I just wanna say, thank you all. Uh, simply, behind me, so, is a knockout panel. This panel, the next time you come here, will be opened up and gone. No – uh, no problem with any of the surrounding areas. These, this room will be fixed. This will be like a cocktail – the whole floor will be cocktails or pre-briefings or whatever it may be, lots of different things. So the entire floor. So you come in, the entire floor sets up. We didn't have to do any of that. Usually, you have to do that. You need different rooms to go along with a ballroom.”

The speech, with its confusing false starts and repeated tangent-veering, was typical of many addresses Trump, the oldest person to be inaugurated president, has given recently. The president frequently appears to lose his train of thought, before retreating to the verbal safe ground of repeating frequently incorrect claims about the current success of the US.

Republicans seem happy to ignore Trump's odd speeches and claims. But his performances in public settings, whether a lengthy soliloquy about how former president Barack Obama walks down the stairs – “Da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop,” Trump told a room full of generals in September – or his focus on water pressure – “The water's dripping out and that's no good for me. I like this hair lace and [sic] – I like that hair nice and wet,” the president said at a roundtable discussion about immigration in July – has slowly begun to raise questions from experts, Democrats, and the general public.

Among those: what guardrails exist to remove an impeded commander-in-chief from office?

“The system is really set up to protect the president. It's really hard to get rid of a president between elections,” said Brian Kalt, a professor at Michigan State University College of Law and author of Unable: The Law, Politics, and Limits of Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.

There are essentially two ways a US president could be removed from office: through impeachment and conviction by the Senate, and through the aforementioned section 4. No president has ever been removed by either measure – although three presidents have been impeached: including Trump, twice.

A simple majority of the House of Representatives has to vote to impeach a president for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors”, and the president is then tried in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required to convict. In 2021, 57 of the 100 senators voted to convict Trump – 10 short of the 67 votes required.

Given there are 53 Republican senators, it is hard to imagine Trump being convicted and removing office.

That leaves section 4 of the 25th amendment, designed to be used when a president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. This month, JB Pritzker, the governor of Chicago, who has repeatedly clashed with Trump, called for the amendment to be invoked against the president, claiming “there is something genuinely wrong with this man”.

It came as Trump bizarrely reposted to Truth Social an AI-generated fake video which featured himself making an announcement about “med-bed hospitals”, and after he spoke confusingly of “certain elements of genius that can be given to a baby” during a speech at the White House.

Speaking about grants awarded to investigate autism, Trump added: “They have to move quickly. They, they – when the alternative is that nothing bad can happen, let's do it now. I was just saying to Bobby [health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr] and the group, let's do it now. Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen.”

The examples keep coming. At a press conference last week Trump repeated himself several times when talking about immigration, in one case appearing to become confused on the issue of so-called legal immigration.

“We've got the strongest border of anybody – nobody has a border. We have a border where the numbers just came out again, you saw zero people came in illegally. Now we do take people into our country legally, but zero people,” Trump said. Approximately 7 million people entered the US from abroad during the first three months of 2025 alone.

Section 4 of the 25th amendment is designed for when a president is “not just doing a bad job, but not doing anything at all – like can't function”, Kalt said. For it to be invoked, JD Vance and a majority of Trump's cabinet would have to agree that Trump is unable to perform the duties of president. But even then, Trump could disagree, which would force a vote in the House and the Senate. A two-thirds majority in both would be required to remove the president – a higher bar than impeachment. Kalt said it's a deliberately high bar.

“It's not just about protecting the president, although that is the most direct manifestation of it. It's really about protecting the system of elections. So once the people elect a president, it's supposed to be four years before they get to say anything again – their choice is respected, is put in place,” Kalt said.

Despite the White House claiming earlier this year that Trump's “mental sharpness is second to none”, the examples of unusual behavior keep stacking up. There was an incident this summer where Trump invented an entire story about his deceased uncle having met the Unabomber. The time in July when he went on a sudden rant about windmills driving whales “loco”, during a meeting with the European Commission president. The occasion when he derailed a cabinet meeting by talking, unprompted, for 13 minutes about the decor of the room.

Last month, Democratic congresswoman Madeleine Dean made national news after she confronted the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, in an exchange about Trump's health recorded by MSNBC.

“The president is unhinged. He is unwell,” Dean told an uncomfortable-looking Johnson. His reply was a strong indicator that there is zero appetite among Republicans to subject their leader to scrutiny.

“A lot of folks on your side are too,” Johnson said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Associated Press

12:44 JST, October 21, 2025

NEW YORK (AP) — When slugger Joe Carter hit the last World Series pitch thrown in Canada over the left-field wall to win the Toronto Blue Jays' second consecutive title, it was 8 1/2 months before Shohei Ohtani was born.

The Blue Jays are back in baseball's championship round for the first time since 1993 and will host Ohtani and the Dodgers in Friday night's opener as Los Angeles tries to become the first repeat winner in a quarter century.

When the World Series was last north of the border, the Steroids Era was just starting, advanced analytics were science fiction and complete games were thrown about twice a month.

While the Dodgers may be the favorite, the Blue Jays have an entire country behind them.

“You always feel the weight of the world in decisions you make but when you're kind of feeling a country, it kind of gets a little dicey at times,” Toronto manager John Schneider said early in the postseason. “Sixth inning with the bases loaded and nobody out and Aaron Judge hitting, you feel like people in Nova Scotia want to come murder you.”

Toronto hosts the opener because it finished the regular season with 94 wins, one more than the Dodgers.

“They just got all their guys rolling. They're scoring seven, eight runs, 10 runs a game, so that's tough to slow down,” Los Angeles shortstop Mookie Betts said. “They're doing all three facets of the game.”

Seeking the franchise's ninth title and eighth since bolting Brooklyn for Los Angeles after the 1957 season, the Dodgers have overrun opponents during the postseason. Ohtani is starring at the plate and on the mound, a performance that would be deemed CGI if not witnessed by thousands in person.

“Sometimes you've got to check yourself and touch him to make sure he's not just made of steel,” teammate Freddie Freeman said.

Before his three-homer at the plate and 10-strikeouts, six-scoreless innings mound show Friday night, Ohtani's bat had been slumping.

He's hitting .220 with five homers and nine RBIs in the postseason and is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in a pair of pitching starts, striking out 19 and walking four in 12 innings.

Los Angeles is the first defending champion to reach the Series since the 2009 Philadelphia Phillies, who lost to the New York Yankees in six games. No team has won consecutive titles since the Yankees took three in a row from 1998-2000. The gap is the longest in baseball history, topping the previous high between the 1977-78 Yankees and the 1992-93 Blue Jays.

In other U.S. major leagues, the longest Super Bowl title gap was between the 2004-05 New England Patriots and the 2023-24 Kansas City Chiefs, the longest in the NBA was between the 1968-69 Boston Celtics and the 1987-88 Los Angeles Lakers, and the lengthiest in the NHL was between the 1997-98 Detroit Red Wings and the 2016-17 Pittsburgh Penguins.

“Realizing how hard it is to do last year, realizing how hard it was in '20, it's special,” Dodgers catcher Will Smith said. “Trying to get back-to-back is even more special.”

Toronto pitcher Max Scherzer was on the 2021 Dodgers team that fell short, losing to Atlanta in the National League Championship Series. Hall of Famers Rickey Henderson and Fred McGriff also played for both franchises, along with Justin Turner.

Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman has dual American-Canadian citizenship — his parents were born in Canada.

The Triple-A Montreal Royals were the Dodgers' top farm team from 1939-60 — Jackie Robinson started his Dodgers career there in 1946, a year before he broke the major league color barrier.

Los Angeles entered the postseason with a big league-high $341.5 million payroll, according to Major League Baseball's latest tabulation, and is projected to pay nearly $168 million in luxury tax, easily a record. Counting the $6.5 million signing bonus in rookie Roki Sasaki's minor league contract, the Dodgers' player cost this year totals $516 million — with final numbers to be calculated during the offseason.

Including Sasaki's signing bonus, the 13 pitchers on the Dodgers' NLCS roster alone cost $124.5 million.

Toronto has the fifth-highest payroll at $252.7 million and is on track to spend $266 million including just over $13 million in luxury tax. No small-market team has won the title since the 2015 Kansas City Royals.

“Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball,” manager Dave Roberts shouted to the crowd after Friday night's National League pennant clincher. “Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!”

Los Angeles pitchers are 9-1 with a 2.45 ERA in 10 postseason games, including 7-1 with 1.40 ERA for starting pitchers totaling 64 1/3 of 82 innings. Led by Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Dodgers starters were 3-0 with a 0.63 ERA in the NLCS and their staff held the Milwaukee Brewers to a .118 batting average during the four-game sweep, lowest in a postseason series of at least three games.

LA's four postseason starters totaled 73 starts and 372 1/3 innings during the regular season. Their closer threw 36 1/3 innings.

That's because Snell, Tyler Glasnow and Sasaki all hurt their pitching shoulders and Ohtani didn't return to the mound until June 16 after recovering from elbow surgery in 2023.

If the Blue Jays win

Toronto, which started play in 1977, could become the 15th of the 30 teams to win three or more titles. That would be more than Cleveland, the New York Mets and Philadelphia, teams that have been around much longer.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ""won certain property"" during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and should be expected to take Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired Oct. 19. 

The interview was taped a few days earlier, directly following his phone conversation with Putin on Oct. 16. The call came ahead of Trump's White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — talks that ended in disappointment for the Ukrainian delegation, with no promise of Tomahawk missiles. 

Prior to the call with Putin, Trump had taken a harsher tone with Russia in public comments. But in comments to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, who asked whether Putin would accept a peace deal without territorial concessions, Trump was cavalier about the loss of Ukrainian lands.

""Well, he's going to take something,"" Trump said. ""I mean, they fought and uh, he has a lot of property. I mean, you know, he's won certain property, if you say that, he's won certain property."" 

Trump made no mention of Ukraine's sovereignty or international law, taking it as a given that an invading force has a right to ""property"" it seizes through strength of arms. 

""We're the only nation that goes in and wins a war and then leaves,"" he said. ""You know like we did under President Bush in the Middle East. We go in, we blast the hell out of everybody, destroy the place, and then we leave. ... You know, it doesn't make sense. Never made sense.""

Following his meeting with Zelensky, Trump echoed these sentiments on social media, writing that Ukraine and Russia should make a peace deal ""with property lines being defined by war and guts."" 

In an interview with NBC after his talks with Trump, Zelensky said he took this to mean Ukraine and Russia could freeze the war along the current line of contact, but that Kyiv is not interesting in surrendering ""additional"" territory to Putin. 

""We will give nothing to the aggressor,"" Zelensky later said in his nightly address on Oct. 19.

Russia, however, is reportedly seeking full control of Donetsk Oblast as part of a deal to end the war. 

Putin told Trump he was willing to give up parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, both partially occupied by Russian forces, in exchange for the entirety of Donetsk, the Washington Post reported on Oct. 18, citing two senior U.S. officials.

The Financial Times (FT) later reported that Trump pushed Zelensky to accept these terms during their meeting. 

In a conversation that at times turned into a shouting match, Trump told Zelensky that Russia was winning the war and would destroy Ukraine if Kyiv didn't make a deal, a European official with knowledge of the meeting told FT. 

""If (Putin) wants it, he will destroy you,"" Trump reportedly told Zelensky. 

The U.S. president parroted a number of Kremlin propaganda points during the meeting, the European official claimed. Trump said Putin told him that the invasion of Ukraine was a ""special operation, not even a war."" Trump also said the Russian economy is ""doing great."" 

According to the official, Trump also grew frustrated with Ukraine's battlefield map and tossed it aside, saying he was ""sick"" of seeing these maps. 

""This red line, I don't even know where this is. I've never been there,"" Trump allegedly said. 

Reuters reported later on Oct. 19, citing its sources, that Trump suggested providing security guarantees to both warring parties, leaving the Ukrainian delegation taken aback.

Later in the evening on Oct. 20 while answering reporter questions on Air Force One, Trump denied telling Zelensky Ukraine would need to cede the Donbas in order to secure a ceasefire.

""We never discussed that. We think that what they should do is just stop at the lines where they are, the battle line... the rest is very tough to negotiate,"" Trump said.

""I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia. You leave it the way it is. They can negotiate something down the line,"" Trump added.

Putin's latest proposal marks a shift from his earlier position in April, when he insisted that any peace deal must grant Russia full control over Crimea plus the full four regions that are partially occupied now: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson.

While a small concession, it would require Ukraine to hand over territory that Russia has failed to seize after years of fighting despite significant advantages in manpower and military equipment. 

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Oct. 19 that Ukraine should not be pressured to give up its territory. 

""None of us should put pressure on Zelensky when it comes to territorial concessions,"" Tusk wrote on X. 

""We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace.""

Trump, for his part, has continued to delay imposing sanctions on Russia in an attempt to bring Putin to the negotiating table.

On Oct. 20, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Congress was ""hitting the pause button,"" on a Senate bill that proposes to impose tariffs of up to 500% on countries that buy Russian oil, amid Trump's planned meeting with Putin.

The White House has not yet indicated that it would like to see the bill brought to a vote on the Senate floor.

Hi, this is Yuliia Taradiuk reporting from Kyiv on day 1,336 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU)  has ""destroyed"" two Russian light aircraft used for intercepting drones, the service said on Oct. 21.

According to SBU, planes were placed at airfields in a Russian-occupied territory and used to shoot down Ukrainian long-range drones.

The video footage released by the SBU shows the moment the planes were struck in an operation by the SBU's Special Operations Center ""A.""

""This work to 'clear the way' for our long-range drones ensures uninterrupted strikes on Russian rear areas,"" the SBU said.

""The SBU continues to strike the occupiers with all available means. They will pay justly for every crime they commit!""

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

Russia has not officially commented on the reported strikes.

Explosions occurred at oil refineries in Romania and Hungary on the evening of Oct. 20, both of which have links to Russia, local media reported on Oct. 21.

Russian oil remains a key source of revenue for Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. Despite the European Union's push to fully phase out Russian energy, several member states continue to receive supplies.

A midday explosion occurred at the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiesti, southern Romania, on Oct. 20.

The facility, owned by a subsidiary of Lukoil, one of Russia's largest privately owned oil and gas companies, had reportedly been offline since Oct. 17 due to a planned technical inspection, according to Hungarian newspaper Vilaggazdasag.

An explosion also occurred at Hungary's largest oil refinery, located in the city of Szazhalombatta, which receives crude oil from Russia, according to Hungarian media outlet Telex.

The Danube Refinery, situated 27 kilometers (about 17 miles) from Budapest and owned by the Hungarian oil company MOL, caught fire on the evening of Oct. 20 following the explosion. Firefighters managed to contain the blaze by the morning of Oct. 21.

No injuries or fatalities have been reported.

The exact cause of the incident remains under investigation. The Szazhalombatta facility, considered the most advanced in Hungary's oil refining sector, may now face a temporary shutdown.

The refinery is supplied with crude oil from Russia through the Druzba pipeline.

Russian drone attacks on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy and on a city in Chernihiv Oblast killed at least four people and injured 16 on Oct. 21, local authorities said.

Russia attacked Novhorod-Siverskyi, Chernihiv Oblast, with Shahed-type drones, and about 20 sites were hit, Governor Viacheslav Chaus wrote on Telegram.

Four civilians were killed – two men and two women. Seven people were injured, including a 10-year-old girl.

""(The girl) is being transported to the regional children's hospital. One of the injured is in serious condition, while the others are in moderate condition,"" Chaus said. ""There is a lot of destruction in the city.""

Nine civilians were injured in a drone attack on Sumy, Governor Oleh Hryhorov said on Oct. 21.

""A drone strike targeted the crossroad. Cars and civilian infrastructure were damaged. All victims are receiving the necessary medical assistance,"" Hryhorov said. He added that emergency services are working at the site of the attack.

Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts, which border Russia to the north, have been a repeated target of Russian incursions and shelling since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Belgium still plans to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets but they won't arrive for at least one year, Belgium Defense Minister Theo Francken told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Oct. 21.

Speaking at the European Policy Center (EPC) forum, Francken said it will give F-16s to Ukraine after it receives and commissions newer U.S.-made F-35 jets. The first three F-35s were delivered on schedule.

""Now (F-35s) have to become operational, which I think will take a year or a year and a half,"" Franken said. ""Once we have operational capability, we will be able to transfer our F-16s to Ukraine."" 

He said that the F-35 rollout process is ""a very important phase"" for the Belgian Air Force and is directly linked to the transfer of F-16s to Ukraine. 

Francken also added that Belgium is part of NATO's nuclear deterrent, so its transition to the F-35 is of strategic importance.

Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said on Aug. 26 that the first F-16s could be delivered to Ukraine in the coming months. As of Oct. 21, Kyiv hasn't received any F-16s from Belgium.

Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fighter jets last year from Denmark and the Netherlands.

Russia is intensifying attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as international pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin begins to ease, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 21.

Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy sector in recent months, just as a cold snap drives up demand and puts additional strain on the country's power infrastructure.

""In Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts, restoration work is underway across all affected areas following Russian strikes on our energy infrastructure. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, (Russian forces) even used FPV drones to target transformers,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram.

Zelensky added that every region has the necessary resources to restore energy infrastructure, and that special services are doing everything they can — as should diplomats and political leaders.

""Just a few weeks ago, Putin was under real pressure and facing the threat of Tomahawk missiles, and he immediately showed a willingness to return to diplomacy. But as soon as that pressure eased even slightly, the Russians began backing away from diplomacy and trying to delay dialogue,"" Zelensky said.

Less than a week ago, hopes that the U.S. would provide Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles and place real pressure on Russia were high, but were derailed by a phone call from Putin to the White House.

The U.K. is ready to deploy troops to Ukraine if U.S. President Donald Trump secures a peace deal with Russia, Sky News reported on Oct. 21, citing British Defense Secretary John Healey.

Healy gave a lecture at London's Mansion House, where he said the U.K. is prepared to spend over £100 million on a potential deployment of British troops to Ukraine.

""So, as President Trump leads the push for peace here in Europe, we are ready to lead the work to secure it in the long-term,"" Healey said.

""For our Armed Forces, I am already reviewing readiness levels and accelerating millions of pounds of funding to prepare for any possible deployment into Ukraine,"" he added.

The defense secretary's plan involves preparing military personnel to join a multinational force that would assist in securing Ukraine's borders, after a potential ceasefire.

Healey also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin considers Britain his ""number one enemy"" due to the country's support for Ukraine. Additionally, he warned of a ""new era of threat"" and mentioned that the likelihood of a broader conflict in Europe has not been this high since the end of the Second World War.

The Ukrainian parliament on Sept. 17 ratified a 100-year partnership agreement with the U.K., marking a deepening relationship between the two countries.

A fire at the ATAN oil depot in the village of Hvardiiske, located in Russian-occupied Crimea, reignited with increased intensity, the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported on Oct. 21.

The facility had been previously targeted by Ukraine's Special Operations Forces on Oct. 17, sparking a blaze that sent smoke billowing for dozens of kilometers.

Light smoke was still rising from the site by noon on Oct. 20, with three fire trucks actively dousing a burning tank. By the following morning, the fire had grown more intense, with a thick column of smoke visible above the facility, Crimean Wind said, citing local residents.

Residents also reported hearing air defense systems and spotting drones flying over the village on the night of Oct. 21.

It remains unclear whether the renewed fire is connected to the reported drone activity, according to Crimean Wind.

Ukrainian drones launched a ""massive air attack"" on Russia's Bryansk and Rostov oblasts overnight on Oct. 21, local authorities claimed, injuring two people and causing limited damage.

Three cars were damaged, alongside the exterior of two apartment buildings in the Russian city of Klintsy as a result of a Ukrainian drone attack, Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz said in a post to Telegram.

Residents were evacuated from a residential building in Rostov Oblast's Bataysk as authorities worked to determine if the structural integrity of the property was intact following damage, Slyusar said, later adding that residents were allowed to return to their homes afterwards.

The details could not be immediately verified by the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine's army regularly strikes military infrastructure within occupied territories and deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine.

On Oct. 19, Russia's Orenburg gas processing plant was forced to halt gas intake from Kazakhstan following a Ukrainian drone attack on the facility, Kazakhstan's Energy Ministry announced.

The Kremlin has refused to agree to a ceasefire and, in recent days, reportedly continued to insist that Ukraine surrender all of Donetsk Oblast as a precondition for a peace as the White House pushes to broker a settlement to end Russia's war.

On Oct. 20, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow's position regarding the possibility of ceasing hostilities along the current front lines in Ukraine has not changed.

The Russian comments follow a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House on Oct. 17.

Two sources familiar with the matter told the Kyiv Independent that the meeting was effectively derailed by Russian President Vladimir Putin's phone call with Trump a day earlier.

During the call, Putin again demanded that Ukraine hand over full control of Donetsk Oblast to Russia as a condition for ending the war, the Washington Post reported.

Trump and Putin are set to meet in Budapest in the coming weeks. No date has been publicly announced, but U.S. and Russian officials are expected to meet this week for the first stage of a planned summit between the two leaders.

George Springer reacts after hitting a three-run home run against the Seattle Mariners.David J. Phillip/The Associated Press

When the Toronto Blue Jays signed former Houston Astro George Springer as a free agent in 2021, it was a big moment for the club. It showed they were finally getting serious about winning. 

It may have been less of one for Springer. He was leaving the best team in baseball to join one that perpetually failed to get over the hump. 

Springer waited a few years. Then he pushed the Jays over it himself. 

His seventh-inning three-run blast on Monday night fits somewhere between Jose Bautista's bat-flip effort and Joe Carter's 1993 game-ender in the taxonomy of greatest-ever Jays home runs. 

He put it near to where Carter's landed in the left-field bleachers, to the same sort of hysterical reaction. Springer will never pay for a drink in Toronto again. 

Blue Jays players celebrated for hours on the field at Rogers Centre and in a beer-and-champagne-soaked party in their clubhouse.

The Canadian Press

That hit propelled his team to a 4-3 win, and into their first World Series in over 30 years. 

“I'm just so happy for everybody here – our fans, our city, our country. This is for them,” Springer said on the field immediately after the victory. 

The Jays will now face the one that got away, Shohei Ohtani, and the Los Angeles Dodgers in that championship. It begins Friday in Toronto.

This was the sort of game the Toronto we've grown to know since the '90s heyday was supposed to lose. 

A post shared by MLB ⚾ (@mlb)

It started with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. being filmed entering the building in a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. Don't these people talk to each other? Bringing a Leafs sweater to a Game is like wearing a red satin poncho to the bullfights.

The Jays shook in the first inning, giving up an early run. They rattled again in the third when Julio Rodriguez hit a solo home run.

When Seattle's finisher, Cal Raleigh, hit another solo shot in the fifth, the crowd got quiet. They'd spent the night swinging from mood to mood, but that one got them doubting. 

Then Seattle made the sort of small error that has turned games in this series. They sent Bryan Woo, one of their cult heroes and a repurposed starter, out to pitch the fifth. That went fine.

He was back in the sixth. Not great, but fine again.

He was still there in the seventh to face the bottom third of the Jays order. That's when things went wrong. The first two men reached base. The third moved them over to second and third. Woo was yanked, but the pin in the Mariners' season had already been pulled. 

I'm sure Eduard Bazardo is a nice guy, but he's the new Mitch Williams around these parts. He tossed up the meatball that Springer planted over the wall. The reaction wasn't pandemonium because that word suggests disorder.

This was organized chaos. This was three decades of expecting the worst and usually getting it being released. 

Whatever the Jays end up accomplishing in the next week and a bit, they have already shed their reputation as a team that doesn't quite measure up. For the foreseeable future, they will be automatically considered a force in Major League Baseball. 

At that point, it was a matter of turning things over to a series of fill-in starters, ending in closer Jeff Hoffman. Hoffman has been a wild ride all season long, but not on Monday. He struck out the side. It was the first time he'd done that in two months. 

Los Angeles Dodgers two-way player Shohei Ohtani awaits in the World Series, which starts Friday in Toronto. Ohtani is coming off of a Game 4 win against Milwaukee in the NLCS that may have been the greatest individual performance ever in a baseball game.Ashley Landis/The Associated Press

The Dodgers aren't a mountain to climb. They're a cliff that peels away backward once you start trying to pull yourself up it. 

They've played 10 playoff games and lost only one. In their most recent series, against Milwaukee, they gave up four runs total. In the game that closed the sweep, Ohtani had what was probably the greatest individual performance ever in a baseball game. Ten strikeouts as a pitcher, three home runs as a hitter.

The Blue Jays won't be underdogs in this World Series. They'll be whatever you'd find under an underdog. The underrug or the undercushion or the underflooring. 

That didn't feel like it mattered as the Jays took their victory lap after Monday's game. They remembered to get everyone tangentially involved in the club, including owner Edward Rogers, up on the dais before they went back to pop the champagne. They wanted to make sure they got at least one proper celebration in before things get hard. The fans who remained – every single one of them – lapped it up. 

Should the Jays beat the Dodgers? Absolutely not. Every one of L.A.'s starting pitchers is better than all of their Jays' counterparts. L.A.'s line-up features a front three who've all won MVP awards. They have Dodger Stadium, which is as close as baseball gets to a gladiator arena. 

Thousands of Blue Jays fans poured into the streets of Toronto on Monday night celebrating the team's first World Series berth in more than thirty years.

The Canadian Press

But can the Blue Jays beat L.A.? Of course. Toronto has proven that they are more than the sum of their parts, though the parts are increasingly formidable. They lost one of their best players, Bo Bichette, to injury and got better. Guerrero wasn't even a factor in Game 7 and it didn't matter. This team wins when events suggest it should not. 

When he came to the Jays, Springer had the reputation as a click-and-play Mr. October. He'd been a World Series MVP in 2017. 

But the Jays couldn't get anywhere in October, and Springer, 36, started to slow down. This year, he was asked to play less in the field, and had a resurgence at the plate as a result. 

Still, you would have said that his contract – at one point the largest in team history – was a minor bust. Until Monday. If he never plays again, his place in Toronto sports lore is assured. 

A team like that? As long as there are games to play, they have a chance.

Why?","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canada-is-the-only-g7-country-to-sell-off-all-its-gold-reserves-why/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

murboy/The Globe and Mail

Talk to any gold bug long enough, and eventually you'll hear the same indignant lament: The Bank of Canada was foolish to sell off its gold holdings over the years, leaving it as the only G7 country without any of the shiny metal in its reserves. The staggering surge in bullion prices—gold topped US$3,815 per ounce in late September, up more than 40% over the past year and double where it was five years ago—has only reinforced that sentiment.

Indeed, if the Bank of Canada still held the same amount of gold it did in 1965—around 32.9 million ounces—that stash would now effectively equal the value of all of Canada's international reserves, at roughly US$125.5 billion.

The Bank of Canada unloaded the last gold coins in its reserves in 2016, but the Bank began the process in the 1970s, arguing it made no sense to hold such an illiquid asset in a world where countries no longer fixed their currencies to the price of gold. By the mid-1990s, roughly 90% of the 1965 gold hoard was gone, replaced with more liquid foreign currency deposits and interest-bearing bonds. “I know this will drive the gold bugs crazy, but gold isn't necessary to conduct modern monetary policy,” says Ian Lee, an associate professor at Carleton University's Sprott School of Business. Yes, the 1965 gold holdings would be worth a lot of money, he says, “but the government's job is not to maximize asset prices.”

Still, with the United States running massive deficits, and the Trump administration pursuing flailing tariff policies and attempting to seize control of the Federal Reserve, it's raised questions about the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. As of September, roughly 54% of Canada's reserves were held in U.S.-dollar-denominated assets.

Here, too, Lee says such fears are overblown. “When you look at the totality of the foreign reserve market, there is no other currency that could replace the U.S. dollar,” he says. “My argument is not that the U.S. is wonderful; they're just the least dirty shirt in the world for currency holdings.”

We're not going back to the gold standard, Lee adds. “The U.S. dollar will be the reserve currency for the rest of the century.”

Chancellor Merz has insisted that his center-right CDU will not work with the far-right party, despite its rising popularity. Meanwhile, Germany wants more F-35 jets as its boosts defense spending. DW has more.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats (CDU) wrapped up a two-day meeting that focused on the party's strategy toward the populist party, with Merz reiterating the CDU's rejection of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

The leader of CDU's sister party in Bavaria, the CSU's Markus Söder, said the AfD is the ""enemy of the system.""

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius intends to order more F-35 jets from US company Lockheed Martin as Germany steps up its military expenditure.

The AfD wants to make US President Donald Trump an honorary citizen of the southwestern district where his grandparents were born.

Here is a roundup of headlines and analysis from and about Germany on Monday, October 20, 2025:

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has once more vowed that his conservative CDU/CSU alliance would distance itself ""clearly and explicitly"" from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of five state elections next year.

""We will now also be very clear and very explicit about where the AfD stands in terms of content, and we will distance ourselves from them very clearly and explicitly,"" he said after a party conference in Berlin.

He also once more stressed that his party would not cooperate with the AfD — under the so-called firewall — despite the far-right party's strong presence in both the federal and some state legislatures, which would facilitate the passing of some bills put forward by mainstream parties.

""This party has declared its intention to destroy the CDU. It wants a different country,"" Merz said.

""It is not just details that separate us. We are separated from the AfD by fundamental issues and fundamental political convictions,"" he added.

Referring to the AfD's regular offers to cooperate, Merz said ""the hand that the AfD repeatedly extends is in reality a hand that wants to destroy us.""

The AfD received a record 20.8% of the vote at February general elections and is polling at around 40% in the two former communist East German states of Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

Some of its branches have been declared right-wing extremist by German intelligence services, while a move to reclassify the whole AfD as such is currently on hold pending a court decision on a lawsuit brought by the party. 

State elections will be held in Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Baden-Württtemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Berlin in 2026.

The leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, has rejected any form of cooperation with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).

In remarks that echo recent comments by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, with whose Christian Democrats (CDU) his party forms a conservative alliance known in Germany as the ""Union,"" Söder said it was ""very clear that the AfD is not any old rival but an enemy of the system.""

""I do not want the Union to be the stirrup holders for the AfD's climb to power under any circumstances,"" Söder said after a meeting of his party's executive board in the Bavarian capital, Munich.

He warned that the AfD wanted to take the place of the CDU/CSU bloc.

""Anyone who thinks they can work together with the AfD in any form is mistaken,"" he said.

Söder went on to days that the conservative bloc was ""a bastion to strengthen and save democracy.""

His and Merz's remarks come after some conservative politicians called on the CDU/CSU to abandon the so-called firewall against the AfD.



Following a two-day meeting of his Christian Democrats (CDU) to discuss its strategy toward the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stressed that the political center as represented by his government is capable of dealing with weighty issues at home and abroad.

When asked by DW's chief political editor Michaela Küfner how he would define his personal role regarding the far-right AfD, he said: ""I define my role as I have always said. I am the chancellor of a federal government of the political center, and we will show that this political center can solve problems in Germany and that it also contributes to solving problems together in Europe that concern us in Europe and around the world:""

Mentioning ""serious"" problems such as American trade policy, the war in Ukraine, and ""the authoritarian leadership of the People's Republic of China,"" Merz said his government was ""determined to resolve these issues in the interests of our country.""

You can watch a video of his response here.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has proposed that US President Donald Trump be made an honorary citizen of the Bad Dürkheim district in southwestern Germany, from where his grandparents emigrated to New York in the late 19th century.

""The reason for our motion in the district council is that Donald Trump has brought peace to the Israel-Gaza conflict and ensured the release of the Israeli and eight German hostages,"" local AfD group leader Thomas Stephan told the DPA news agency.

The district council has confirmed receipt of the proposal, which it will discuss at an October 29 meeting.

However, the district administrator, Hans-Ulrich Ihlenfeld, from Chancellor Merz's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), said he felt it was unlikely that the proposal would gain a majority.

""Regardless of whether one would even want an honorary citizen Donald Trump, the question of honorary citizenship and the possible criteria for it must be discussed thoroughly in the district committees,"" he told DPA.

Trump's family traces its roots to Kallstadt, a small wine-growing village that is part of Bad Dürkheim in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

 

A controversial remark by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, in which he seemed to many to suggest that migrants and refugees had a negative impact on German ""cityscapes,"" has received the backing of his conservative ally, Christian Social Union (CSU) leader Markus Söder.

""Of course Merz is right,"" Söder said on Monday, saying that despite a drop in asylum applications at Germany's borders, there were ""still challenges in our inner cities — at main railway stations, public swimming pools, several marketplaces.""

For this reason, Söder said, it was right to have a migration policy that aimed to send people who had no ""temporary toleration"" status or residency permit back to their home countries.

The comment by Merz last week — that despite the drop in refugee numbers ""we still have this problem in the cityscape, and that is why the interior minister is working to carry out large-scale deportations"" — drew widespread criticism both from leftist opposition parties and coalition partner the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).
 

The co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) Alice Weidel has voiced her support for an upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest.

""There is no better place in the world than Budapest to talk about how peace in Europe can be created and a renewed division of our continent can be prevented and overcome,"" Weidel said in a speech in the Hungarian capital.

If a meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest happens ""very soon,"" this would be ""the best proof that Hungary is on the right path,"" Weidel said.

Unlike the rest of the European Union, Budapest under long-time prime minister Viktor Orban, has maintained cordial ties with Moscow and questioned Western support for Kyiv.

The latest Trump-Putin summit in August in Alaska, held under the slogan ""Pursuing Peace"" failed to achieve a major breakthrough.

Germany's federal drug commissioner, Hendrik Streeck of the Christian Democrats (CDU), has called for a return to stricter cannabis regulations, warning of abuse and health risks among young people.

To curb misuse, Streeck told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the government should consider allowing medical cannabis only in the form of drops or capsules rather than for smoking. He said the CDU would roll back parts of the cannabis legalization enacted by the current coalition.

""I am quite sure that the CDU will reopen the cannabis law,"" Streeck said, arguing that the partial legalization ignores evidence that people under 25 can suffer long-term psychological effects.

He also criticized the legal possession limit of 25 grams as far too high, noting it exceeds allowances in other EU countries.

Germany's last ""traffic light"" coalition government legalized limited possession and home cultivation of cannabis on April 1 last year, with strict restrictions remaining in place.

Rheinmetall, Germany's largest weapons manufacturer, has said it will receive €3 billion ($3.5 billion) as part of a deal concluded with Artec, the company's joint venture with French-German tank maker KNDS.

The order for 222 Jackal wheeled infantry vehicles, destined for the armed forces of Germany and the Netherlands, is worth €3.4 billion, meaning that Rheinmetall will take the lion's share.

The contract includes a logistics package with spare parts, training equipment and special tools. There is also an option for up to 248 additional vehicles. 

An initial 150 units will go to the German armed forces.

Monday's news prompted a sharp rise in the value of Rheinmetall shares.

Europe's defense industry has seen a massive increase in orders against the background of the security threat posed by Russian aggression.

Companies in Germany have hired about 325,000 people over the past three years to cope with growing bureaucratic demands, such as those deriving from the EU's data protection regulations, a study has shown.

The study by the Nuremberg-based Institute for Employment Research (IAB) said that many more companies were rating their administrative burden as ""very high"" in 2025 than in 2022, with a jump to 14% from 4% three years ago.

The most frequent source of added administrative tasks cited by the nearly 10,000 companies in the study were rules from the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.  
 
Around 30% of large firms with at least 250 employees and 30% of medium-sized companies with 50 to 249 employees said they had taken on more administrative staff since 2022.

Just 16% of smaller firms with 10 to 49 employees and 7% of microenterprises with fewer than 10 workers reported doing so.
 

Germany is relying increasingly on China for its supply of key ingredients used in medications, opening the possibility of disruptions if Beijing moves to exploit the dependency to gain political leverage, a pharma lobby group said in a report issued on Monday.

The report from German generics association Pro Generika warned that China might use its dominant position as a major supplier of raw materials for pharmaceuticals in the same way as it has done with rare earths in trade disputes with the US.

If the delivery of active ingredients for generic medicines were to be interrupted, Germany would suffer major shortages in the drugs sector, the report said.

Antibiotics, diabetes drugs and pain medications would be most affected, according to the group.

Pro Generika managing director Bork Bretthauer urged the government to act to reduce dependency on China.

""Policymakers must not allow us to end up in the same position as we did with Russian gas,"" he said.

The report was authored by experts from the German Economic Institute (IW) and the EU.

Pro Generika represents the interests of generic drug producers, who make cheaper versions of off-patent medicines.
 

The 83-year-old German film director Werner Herzog has said he would like to travel into space and even make Mars the backdrop for a film, while acknowledging that the Red Planet might be an ""uncomfortable"" place to work and that his age could be a hindrance.

""A trip to Mars is technically difficult, time-consuming and actually rather pointless,"" Herzog told DPA, but said ""yes"" when he was asked if he would still like to do it.

He said, however, that he had twice applied to go on space flights but had been rejected.

""I'm simply too old,"" he said. ""Let's face it.""

For his dozens of films, which include many documentaries, he has often traveled to remote locations, such as Antarctica for ""Encounters at the End of the World"" (2007).

Among his most noted works are ""Fitzcarraldo"" and ""Grizzly Man.""

His new film, ""Ghost Elephants,"" follows South African biologist Steve Boyes in a search for a possibly undiscovered species of elephant in Angola.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius plans to order 15 F-35 fighter jets from US manufacturer Lockheed Martin in addition to the 35 that have already been requested, the news magazine Spiegel has reported.

The jets are intended to replace Germany's 85 aging Tornado fighters and like these could carry US nuclear bombs stored in Germany if a conflict broke out.

The additional aircraft are expected to cost some €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion), a source told Reuters news agency, citing confidential documents prepared for parliament's budget committee.

The news comes as Germany significantly expands its defense budget in response to the threat of Russian aggression.

The DW newsroom in Bonn wishes all readers a schönen guten Tag!

In another sign of the changing security situation in Europe against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany is reportedly planning to order more US-made F-35 fighter jets from its expanded military budget.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has been classified as partly right-wing extremist, has made news with its proposal to make US President Donald Trump an honorary citizen of the district of Bad Dürkheim, the birthplace of his grandparents.

And the leadership of the conservativeChristian Democrats (CDU) of Chancellor Friedrich Merz will wrap up a meeting that centered on the party's approach to the AfD amid calls from some members to drop a ban on cooperating with the populists.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","White House demolition work for new ballroom begins — Trump","https://www.dw.com/en/white-house-demolition-work-for-new-ballroom-begins-trump/a-74433247","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 00:26:23 GMT","

Donald Trump has said the ""big, beautiful"" ballroom will come at no cost to the US taxpayer. The ballroom will be the biggest addition to the US presidential residence in over 100 years.

Demolition work has begun to tear down part of the White House's East Wing, US President Donald Trump said Monday.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said, ""ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom.""

The ballroom is expected to have the capacity of 1,000 people, with its cost expected to reach some $250 million (€214.7 million).

It will be the biggest addition to the US presidential residence in over a century.

Trump said the East Wing was being ""fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!""

The US president's office is in the White House's West Wing, while Trump and his wife Melania live in the Executive Mansion. The East Wing is the traditional location of the First Lady's offices.

Trump says the ballroom is needed to host large state dinners and other events, which currently have to be held in a tent.

A celebratory dinner was held last week for the donors to the ballroom. Representatives from the world's biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Meta and Google were all in attendance.

Many of the companies that attended the dinner have government contracts or have other dealings with the Trump administration.

In his Truth Social post, Trump said the ""much-needed project"" would come at ""zero cost to the American Taxpayer!""

""The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies and yours truly,"" Trump said, also adding it will be ""happily used for generations to come.""

After returning to office in January, the US leader ordered several makeover steps at the White House, including covering the Oval Office with gold decor and paving over the Rose Garden.

Plans for a so-called ""Arc de Trump,"" a huge arch in Washington, have also been revealed by the former reality TV star.

The heist at the Louvre in Paris has shocked the art world, though such spectacular thefts have a long tradition. What drives the perpetrators, and where might the loot end up?

The cultural heritage stolen from Paris' Louvre Museum on October 19 is priceless: the tiaras, brooches and necklaces from the time of Napoleon III are pieces of French history.

The trail of the thieves who boldly robbed these French crown jewels remains cold. Investigators are examining links to Eastern European stolen goods networks that procure art objects on behalf of wealthy collectors — or use them as currency in illegal trade.

Tim Carpenter, head of the art protection organization, Argus Cultural Property Consultancy, was the long-time head of the FBI's art crimes division. He told DW that ""traditional artworks"" like paintings or prints that are well-known are ""difficult to monetize"" and resell in the market.

The situation is different with precious metals and stones, which Carpenter says ""have been increasingly targeted by thieves, particularly in Europe.""

""Of course they can melt those materials down,"" he explained, adding that it's a ""terrible loss of cultural heritage.""

In the case of the Louvre, however, Carpenter does not believe the loot will be destroyed: ""These are very important pieces and my guess is these criminals will want to keep them together. They're very highly identifiable.”

But while the audacious Louvre robbery is a shock, the heist is the latest in a long line of brazen art thefts.

On November 25, 2019, two masked men broke into the Dresden Royal Palace in Saxony, Germany. Using an axe, they smashed the display cases in the Green Vault museum and stole 21 pieces of jewelry that included over 4,000 diamonds worth around €113 million ($131.6 million).

Members of the Remmo clan were behind the coup, the Berlin crime syndicate having already attracted attention for spectacular robberies. Parts of the loot were recovered in 2022 after confessions were made, however many jewels remain missing.

The case shows how clan structures have turned art theftinto a professional business that is organized, precise — and ruthless. Despite the difficulties in selling the stolen goods, the theft of historical jewelry sets has become highly lucrative, notes art historian Ulli Seeger.

""Internationally networked gangs are increasingly focusing on objects that have a high material value – gold, precious stones, coins,"" Seeger noted. ""These are easier to sell than works of art that appear in every catalog.""

However, jewelry in particular would have to be completely altered first, as otherwise it could be immediately identified by its historical cut, the expert explained.

Two years before the Dresden heist, members of the Remmo clan broke into the Bode Museum in Berlin through a window at night and stole a 100-kilogram gold coin, the ""Big Maple Leaf."" Material value: around 3.75 million euros. The thieves were only interested in the gold and turning it into cash, so the Canadian coin was destroyed and melted down.

In 2010, Vjeran Tomic, known as ""Spider-Man” for his climbing skills, climbed into the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris. His haul: five masterpieces by Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, Braque, and Leger – worth a total of around 100 million euros.

Tomic was caught but claimed to have been acting on behalf of a collector. The paintings are still missing today – presumably destroyed to eliminate evidence.

In March 1990, two men in police uniforms entered the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. They tied up the security guards and stole 13 works of art — including paintings by Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Degas. Value: over $500 million.

The case remains unsolved to this day. Investigators suspect that the works are circulating in mafia circles as ""underground securities."" The case is legendary – and the subject of numerous documentaries.

Art has unlimited appreciation potential and is difficult to trace. For criminals, it can be the perfect currency.

Art theft is playing an increasingly important role in organized crime which has a high level of logistical expertise and well-established structures, especially in Germany.

In Southern and Eastern Europe, art is used as a commodity in the drug and arms trade.

Of course, there are also lone perpetrators, especially insiders such as security guards or employees who know the weak points in museum security systems.

And finally, although rare and often romanticized in Hollywood films, there could be private collectors around the world who simply want to own a work of art and will hire thieves to procure it for them.

According to Interpol, artworks worth over $6 billion are stolen every year – only about 10% ever reappear.

The coup at the Louvre is yet another reminder that art is not only beautiful, but also vulnerable – and that the black market for cultural goods is booming.

Donald Trump no longer plans to meet Vladimir Putin in Hungary, the White House confirmed.

The US president will not meet the Russian leader in the “immediate future” after a phone call between negotiators to prepare for peace talks turned sour.

On Thursday, Mr Trump announced he would hold a second summit with Putin in Budapest after a two-hour phone call with the Russian yielded “great progress”.

However, preparations for a summit between the two leaders stalled when Moscow cancelled an in-person preparatory meeting between Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.

Mr Trump wanted officials from each side to convene in Hungary to prepare for his summit with Putin.

Mr Lavrov and Mr Rubio spoke by phone on Monday. According to reports, the call did not go well.

Mr Lavrov is believed to have told Mr Rubio that Russia would not accept freezing the frontline in Ukraine in the tense phone call.

However, on Tuesday the White House described the call as “productive”, adding: “Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the secretary and foreign minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future.”

Mr Lavrov refused to compromise on Moscow's maximalist position in discussions with Mr Rubio.

“I want to officially confirm: Russia has not changed its position compared to the understandings that were reached during the Alaska summit,” Mr Lavrov told reporters in Moscow after reports of his call with his American counterpart.

On the scrapped talks between Mr Trump and Putin, a Western official told The Telegraph: “I see it as a positive development. Russia has been clear their position has not changed so why the meeting?”

Ukraine has long accepted it would have to cede territory already occupied by Moscow as the price for peace.

But Russia has been pushing for further concessions, including the complete surrender of Donetsk, which Mr Trump said was only 78 per cent occupied by Russian forces.

During a two-hour phone call on Thursday, Putin told Mr Trump that he would relinquish claims over unoccupied parts of the Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in exchange for a complete Ukrainian surrender of the Donbas.

Steve Witkoff, the US president's peace envoy, who has regularly met with Putin, told Volodymyr Zelensky that Russia had a constitutional claim to these lands.

The Ukrainian president publicly rebutted this notion because Putin had written the regions into Russia's constitution following sham referendums after the launch of the full-scale invasion.

On Tuesday, Mr Zelensky wrote on social media: “The front line can be the beginning of diplomacy. Meanwhile, Russia is once again doing everything to avoid diplomacy.”

And in a veiled dig at Mr Trump's refusal to sell long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, Mr Zelensky added: “The more Ukrainian long-range capabilities there are, the greater Russia's readiness to end the war. These weeks have confirmed this once again.

“The discussion about Tomahawks turned out to be a strong investment in diplomacy – we forced Russia to show that Tomahawks are exactly the card they are paying attention to.”

Mr Trump ultimately rejected the request during their White House meeting on Friday after Putin had earlier told him deliveries of Tomahawks would damage US-Russia relations.

Ukrainian and European sources were buoyed by the Russian refusal to negotiate amid fears Mr Zelensky would be pressured to cede territory to Moscow as the price for peace.

In a statement published on Tuesday, Mr Zelensky and his supporters in the Coalition of the Willing argued any future peace talks with Putin must be held on the basis that “the current line of contact should be the starting point”.

“We remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force,” they added.

The Coalition of the Willing, chaired by Britain and France, seized on the heated call between Mr Rubio and Mr Lavrov, accusing Russia of “stalling tactics”.

Sir Keir Starmer has convened a meeting of its 30 members in London on Friday, which Mr Zelensky will attend in person.

The Coalition of the Willing, a group of allied European nations, said: “We can all see that Putin continues to choose violence and destruction.”

Ukraine and its European allies will discuss a 12-point peace plan, The Telegraph understands.

Sources said the proposal is modelled on Mr Trump's peace deal for Gaza, which gave him renewed impetus to end the fighting in Ukraine.

Jonathan Powell, Britain's National Security Adviser, has been credited with the idea of playing on the American's ego.

The plan for Ukraine involves points such as the return of children kidnapped by Russia, a pathway to European Union membership and reconstruction of the war-ravaged country.

Mark Rutte, Nato's secretary-general, will present the plan to Mr Trump on Wednesday. 

The former Dutch prime minister has become the king of using flattery to keep the US president onside with both the Western military alliance and Ukraine.

Since meeting the US president in Alaska, Putin has demanded that Ukraine withdraws from its eastern Donbas regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, as a precondition for peace.

Mr Trump reportedly pressured Mr Zelensky to accept this proposal in a bruising encounter in the White House on Friday.

However, the surrender of Donetsk, which Moscow has failed to fully occupy since 2014, remains a red line for the Ukrainian president, who has said he would only negotiate on the basis of the current front lines.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Trump appeared to row behind the Ukrainian position, insisting he wanted to see the fighting “stop at the lines where they are, the battle lines”.

On Tuesday, the Kremlin pointed out that no clear date had been set for Putin's meeting with Mr Trump.

“Listen, we have an understanding of the presidents, but we cannot postpone what has not been finalised,” Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said. “Neither President Trump nor President Putin gave exact dates.”

Speaker Johnson's ongoing refusal to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva prevents her from serving her constituents.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) finally seems receptive to swearing in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), who won a special election last month, but says he won't do so until Democrats agree to end the government shutdown.

There is no legal reason why Grijalva can't be sworn in during the stalemate over funding the government — in fact, doing so would allow her vote, on behalf of her constituents in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, to be counted in a future continuing resolution bill. Swearing her in would also have myriad benefits for her constituents.

Despite vowing to swear in Grijalva, Johnson chastised the representative-elect for her social media posts criticizing him for the delay; in those posts, Grijalva suggests that the delay is because hers is the last vote needed to force a bipartisan vote on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, which Johnson has opposed. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“I will administer the oath to her, I hope, on the first day we come back. I am willing and anxious to do that,” Johnson claimed in comments to the press on Monday. “In the meantime, instead of doing TikTok videos, she should be serving her constituents.” 

Much of Grijalva's videos are about the fact that Johnson could swear her in right now but is refusing to do so. 

“She could be taking their calls, she can be directing them, trying to help them,” Johnson added.

The speaker also dismissed the idea of a federal lawsuit, filed last week by Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D), to compel the swearing-in of Grijalva. Despite that lawsuit suggesting that Johnson was in “violation of the Constitution” and citing multiple Supreme Court precedents, Johnson ridiculed Mayes by suggesting she was only suing him as a “publicity stunt.”

Johnson's inference that Grijalva should focus on her constituents is wrongheaded for one major reason: She cannot do most of the work he suggests she should do for her voters until she is sworn in.

Until she becomes an official representative, Grijalva has no congressional allowance allocated to her to provide services for her constituents. She also can't log into congressional computer systems, as only fully-fledged representatives and their office teams are granted access to such systems. And each day she enters the Capitol, she spends valuable time she could be in her office having to wait in the same line that visitors to the building use, rather than being able to bypass the line and get to work right away, as all other members of Congress can.

“Every day that I am not sworn in is another day that my constituents are blocked from critical constituent services and excluded from debates happening right now that affect their lives,” Grijalva said at a press conference last week. 

Grijalva was elected in a special election nearly one month ago. It is unusual for a representative-elect to be forced to wait this long to be sworn in; indeed, several Republican lawmakers were given the privilege of a speedier process earlier this year, even while the House of Representatives was out of session.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

The move follows death threats against Mark Bray, who is among 22 Rutgers professors on Turning Point USA's “watchlist.”

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

On Friday, October 17, the Rutgers University Senate overwhelmingly approved a resolution in support of academic freedom, spurred by the recent attacks on History Professor Mark Bray.

The University Senate is made up of more than 200 members, representing faculty, students, staff, administrators, and alumni.

Bray, the author of Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook, says he began to receive death threats after President Trump signed an executive order declaring “Antifa” a terrorist organization. The student chapter of Turning Point USA also launched a campaign to have Bray fired, falsely claiming that the professor is “a prominent leader of the antifa movement on campus.”

Fearing for their safety, he relocated his family to Europe.

Trump and other far-right extremists routinely accuse those who disagree with the president's fascist agenda of being part of “Antifa,” which stands for anti-fascist and, as many have already noted, is not an organization.

Bray is on Turning Point USA's “Professor Watchlist,” along with 21 other Rutgers professors. The group makes the baseless accusation that those on the list “discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” Turning Point, the right-wing extremist organization founded by Charlie Kirk, says it has more than 800 college chapters and over 1,000 high school chapters.

The Rutgers resolution does not name Bray or Turning Point, but states, in part:

A faculty member in the Department of History at Rutgers-New Brunswick, has been targeted by a Rutgers student organization, which launched a petition calling for his dismissal based on disagreement with the political content of his scholarship and public engagement.

The resolution continues: “[T]his campaign has created widespread concern among Rutgers faculty and governance bodies about institutional support for academic freedom and free expression under intensifying political pressure, as well as threats to any Rutgers faculty and their family's safety.”

The University President's office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Bray has received widespread support from his colleagues. The professors' unions, representing tenure-track, tenured, and adjunct teaching staff, posted a statement in solidarity with Bray, stating, in part, that they “proudly stand with” Bray and his wife, Dr. Yesenia Barragan,” who is also a Rutgers professor.

“Turning Point's attack is part of an escalating effort by the far right to suppress the speech, teaching, and scholarship of faculty who do not conform to their movement's politics,” the unions said. “Silence in the face of these assaults will only embolden the far right.”

Court filings show the administration is pushing to eliminate jobs at several wildlife and conservation departments.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Court documents released Monday show that the Trump administration is exploiting the ongoing government shutdown to pursue mass firings at the US Fish and Wildlife Service amid the nation's worsening extinction crisis.

The new filings came as part of a legal fight between the administration and federal worker unions, which took emergency action earlier this month to stop the latest wave of terminations.

While the unions secured a victory last week in the form of a temporary restraining order against the new firings, the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court has repeatedly proven willing to permit large-scale job cuts that labor unions and legal experts say are patently illegal and dangerous.

Tara Zuardo, a senior campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Monday that the newly revealed administration push to terminate dozens of staffers at the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is “really sad and troubling.” The court filings show that the administration has proposed eliminating positions at the FWS Migratory Birds Program, Office of Conservation Investment, Fish and Aquatic Conservation, National Wildlife Refuge System, and other areas.

“The Trump administration's extremely short-sighted effort to gut the Fish and Wildlife Service will throw gasoline on the raging fire that is the extinction crisis,” said Zuardo. “We've lost 3 billion birds since 1970, yet the administration is slashing funding for migratory birds. It's incredibly cynical to cut programs that help struggling fish and other aquatic animals and assist landowners in conserving endangered species habitats.”

The latest firing push is part of the Trump administration's sweeping effort to terminate thousands of jobs at the US Interior Department, which oversees FWS.

The attempted terminations come months after the Trump administration issued a proposal that would eviscerate habitat protections for endangered species in the United States — a push that closely aligns with the far-right Project 2025 agenda. More than 150,000 Americans used the public comment process to express opposition to the Trump administration's plan.

The Center for Biological Diversity said Monday that the proposed mass elimination of jobs at FWS would “deliver devastating blows to programs put in place to protect, restore, and conserve bird populations and their habitats.”

“Court disclosures also report severe cuts to additional agencies including the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Geological Survey, and others,” the group noted.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

 What America Needs to Win the Innovation Race

 Ben Buchanan and Tantum Collins



The United States' lead in artificial intelligence might seem unassailable. U.S. companies—Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI—are out in front across almost all assessments of the technology's general capabilities. American AI models are outperforming doctorate-level scientists on challenging questions in physics, chemistry, and biology. Just a few American AI and chip giants are worth more than the entire Chinese stock market, and investors from across the world are plowing ever more resources into the American AI ecosystem.

This breakneck progress is, in many ways, a testament to the strengths of the model of American AI development that has dominated for the last decade: letting the private sector operate on its own, with remarkably little direct government meddling or resourcing. This approach is quite different from those that ushered in past breakthrough technologies. Nuclear weapons and power, space travel, stealth systems, personal computing, and the Internet emerged either directly from U.S. government efforts or on the back of significant public funding. AI also has roots in government-funded science, including in personal computing and the Internet, and it benefits from ongoing government-supported research. But scaling up AI has been essentially a private-sector activity.

Yet there is reason to think the American way of developing AI is reaching its limits. Those limits will likely become increasingly evident in the coming months and years, and they will start to erode—and perhaps even end—U.S. dominance. Eventually, they will place the United States at a disadvantage against China, which has an alternative approach to the AI contest.

To avoid that outcome, Washington will need to embrace new ways of advancing AI development, ones that demand much tighter mutual support between the private sector and the state. Further progress now depends on resources and capabilities that only the government can provide or facilitate: the energy to power ever-larger data centers, a pipeline of international talent, and effective defenses against sophisticated foreign espionage efforts. The U.S. government, for its part, will need the cooperation of the private sector to integrate AI into the national security apparatus and to make sure the technology does not undermine democracy across the world.

The new American model of AI, in other words, must rest on a grand bargain between the tech industry and the government. The tech sector can help the state make sense of and deploy AI. The state can help the tech sector continue to grow in a way that advances everyone's interests.

It is easy to see why Washington's light-touch approach to AI has, by and large, paid dividends. Past revolutionary technologies, such as nuclear weapons and space flight, did not have immediate commercial applications. But the business case for modern AI is already highly compelling. AI firms have found huge user demand, resulting in skyrocketing revenues, and they have promised to automate myriad valuable tasks, such as coding. As a result, capital markets are funding AI projects at scales that would historically have required government resources. Moreover, the computation-centric nature of today's AI means that it builds neatly on the cloud computing infrastructure that the private sector, not the government, has mastered.

The sufficiency of private-sector capital in enabling AI advances is wonderful for taxpayers, but the limits of this approach are becoming apparent. To see why, look at infrastructure. The vast fleets of computer chips needed to develop and use today's AI require extraordinary amounts of energy, so U.S. companies will need more power to fuel the data centers they plan to build in the coming years. An analysis by Anthropic estimated that the United States will need to produce 50 gigawatts of new power just for AI by 2028—roughly equivalent to what the entire country of Argentina uses today. (One of us, Buchanan, advises AI and cybersecurity companies, including Anthropic.) By then, data centers could consume up to 12 percent of American electricity production. Without more electricity, the AI build-out will stall. Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, for example, has labeled power the “single biggest constraint” to AI progress. And building this level of new infrastructure will require government help.

For too long, Washington did too little to add new power to its grid. From 2005 to 2020, the United States added close to zero net new power. After U.S. President Joe Biden took office, in 2021, and passed a law subsidizing the construction of clean energy infrastructure, the country added more than 100 gigawatts in new capacity. In the last days of his term, he signed an executive order specifically aimed at further expediting the AI and clean energy build-out. But although his successor, Donald Trump, has said the right things about building new energy infrastructure for AI, he has not delivered. He signed an executive order to accelerate federal permitting for data centers, but implementation remains nascent. Worse yet, his signature “One Big Beautiful Bill,” passed in July, and other executive actions gutted key parts of Biden's energy expansion efforts, such as vital transmission projects. An area that could have been a bipartisan success fell prey to politics and has now become a major concern for business and AI competitiveness.



Executed well, an AI-fueled energy boom would have benefits far beyond AI development itself. Leading AI companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure build-outs, creating employment opportunities. They have committed to carbon-free operations and demonstrated a willingness to pay higher prices for clean energy. These massive investments can accelerate the domestic development of better energy sources, many of which have bipartisan appeal, such as advanced geothermal power and next-generation nuclear facilities. Powerful AI models could also accelerate climate-related research.

If the United States does not construct more energy capacity, however, American AI firms will feel pressure to outsource the development of strategically critical facilities—likely to oil-rich regions such as the Gulf that run on dirtier fuel. For Washington, any prospect of offshoring AI should set off alarm bells. An American company shifting advanced AI training to a foreign country, especially an autocratic one, would pose huge risks as AI begins to power more of the U.S. economy and to play an integral role in defense. If a host country became unhappy with American behavior, it could punish Washington with the flick of a switch. A failure to build domestic energy capacity would thus echo outsourcing mistakes of past decades in other important industries, such as semiconductors, in which the United States is now dependent on foreign suppliers.

The United States has the technology and industrial capacity needed to build new energy facilities. But it remains inhibited by a thicket of government and utility regulations and by procedural delays—some backed by good reason, some not. These restrictions impose huge delays in interconnection (the process of connecting a new power source or data center to the grid) and require years-long environmental assessments. On top of federal and utility hurdles, state and local policies can be cumbersome, especially for projects that cross multiple states, such as transmission lines. Companies—not citizens—should pay for the energy build-out, but government policies must make it possible for them to undertake these projects on reasonable timelines.



Infrastructure is not the only domain in which American policies hold back the AI sector. AI progress depends as much on talented people as it does on technology and computing power, which is why the Biden administration acted aggressively to enable people of extraordinary technical ability to come to the United States from all over the world. This effort included elevating AI and other high-tech fields as priority areas for visas, as well as updating eligibility criteria to welcome top-tier scientists.

Here, too, Trump has sometimes said the right things but always fallen short in practice. During his 2024 presidential campaign, he declared that when foreign students graduate from U.S. colleges, they should “automatically” get a green card. Instead, under his leadership, the United States has begun shutting itself off to foreign workers and students, intimidating even those who have visas and are in the country legally. In September, the administration even said it would slap a $100,000 fee on applications for H1-B visas—the visas most commonly given to high-skilled immigrants. Such actions are already having adverse effects. For example, preliminary research by NAFSA, a nonprofit association of international educators, suggests that in 2025, American universities will suffer a 30 to 40 percent reduction in international enrollment.

If Washington cuts itself off from foreign-born scientists or sends them back home, the consequences will be catastrophic. The United States leads the AI race in large part because it attracts experts from across the world. According to a Georgetown University study that looked at AI research from 2010 to 2021, 70 percent of top U.S.-based AI researchers were born abroad. Sixty-five percent of leading U.S.-based AI companies, as ranked by Forbes, have at least one immigrant co-founder. Before the current Trump presidency, 70 percent of the students enrolled in American AI graduate degrees hailed from abroad. Historically, the vast majority of these students have stayed, often making critical contributions to American industry and academia. But thanks to Trump's policies, many of today's students might instead return home. Some could head to China, which has spotted an opportunity to recruit AI experts—and which poses the most significant challenge to the United States' AI interests.

Protecting American AI leadership is not just a matter of pride. It is essential to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness. China has been making strides in AI development, and although none of its firms can yet match the best American ones, they do not lack for technical talent.

China faces one devastating disadvantage in this competition: its inability to make large quantities of advanced AI chips, a weakness exacerbated by U.S. export controls that began in the first Trump term and that Biden greatly expanded. But after heavy lobbying by industry, the second Trump administration has started dismantling this area of bipartisan consensus. In July, for example, it reversed its April decision to cut China off from newer AI chips, and the president indicated plans to undo other Biden-era controls, as well. Such moves will almost certainly accelerate Chinese AI development.

Beijing has acted decisively to ensure that, if it gains access to such chips, the rest of its AI ecosystem will supplant the United States'. Consider energy. Beijing has made extraordinary investments in power plants, energy storage, and energy transmission. As a result, China now produces more than twice as much electric power as the United States, and its lead is expanding. In some individual months, the country has installed over 90 gigawatts of new, clean energy capacity—almost double the amount of energy American AI firms will need in the next several years.

Beijing has also gained an edge by fusing its AI industry with its national security apparatus. The U.S. Department of Defense has said that major Chinese AI companies, such as Tencent, are key pillars of China's military-civil fusion strategy. AI systems like these have broad utility to military and intelligence agencies: they can support weapons development, cyber-operations, and domestic surveillance, among other tasks. In exchange, the Chinese government has provided technology firms with extensive policy and security support. Historically, this assistance has included defense services and passing along industrial secrets stolen from American businesses.

Losing AI leadership to China would also cause tremendous global harm. Today, consumers across the world benefit from the rigor and transparency of U.S. regulations and standard setting, often developed in concert with other democracies, in many technological domains. For example, new technologies such as electric vehicle charging have required global collaboration on standards. AI will require similar partnerships, and it is in Washington's interest to take the lead. Otherwise, there is a risk that autocracies will unilaterally set the standards. If Washington cannot establish more and better relations with its AI sector and secure its global AI leadership, the Chinese national security apparatus might shape global standards to adhere to Chinese censorship rules.

Right now, strong partnerships between AI firms and U.S. national security agencies are few and far between, and those that do exist are in the early stages. To address this deficiency, the government will need a better understanding of what AI is and how it functions. The government can help U.S. industries, but only in sectors it comprehends deeply, and today AI is not among them. In our time in government, we worked with some truly tech-savvy civil servants and military officers who drove bureaucratic change. The Biden administration hired hundreds of AI experts to bolster their ranks. But many have been fired or have left government in recent months, including many of its top technical staffers. Washington will have to do a better job of securing AI talent and reverse the trends that Trump has set in motion.

Industry leaders, meanwhile, must make sure U.S. officials understand their work—and they will have to be more responsive to Washington's needs. AI leaders in Silicon Valley might be reluctant to cooperate more closely with the government, given its technical ignorance and bureaucratic sluggishness and given that they have enjoyed such success flying solo. But executives should remember that collaboration between industry and Washington often works out well for everyone. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt's administration teamed up with Ford Motor Company in the run-up to World War II to produce the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber, generating both revenue for Ford and much-needed aircraft for the military. The Manhattan Project would not have succeeded without DuPont, General Electric, Chrysler, and other corporate stalwarts, all of which profited by providing help. And the invention and refinement of radar, satellites, jet aviation, microprocessors, and the Internet all flowed from corporate-government teamwork.

One critical area in which the government can help companies is security assistance. Because AI is increasingly essential to national security, foreign intelligence services are redoubling their efforts to steal innovations from U.S. tech businesses. In March 2024, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Linwei Ding, a Google software engineer, for allegedly passing Google's AI chip designs to China. Beijing has also worked hard to smuggle in advanced American technology products, such as AI chips themselves.

Chinese spies will grab whatever AI secrets they can from American businesses. But they have good reason to focus on stealing model weights—the numbers that encode a trained AI model. Chinese companies can then avoid the training costs, as well as cut down on the time it takes to develop models. For example, AI companies work hard to discover algorithmic tricks that enable them to use their computing power more efficiently. For China, with its severe constraints on computational power, such multipliers are almost certainly incredibly valuable. These multipliers are likely far less well defended than the core secrets of past eras, such as during the atomic and space ages, simply because the government has been largely uninvolved in their development.



AI companies bear the primary responsibility for defending their networks and organizations. But despite the recent loss in expertise, the U.S. government has cybersecurity capabilities that businesses cannot match, and it should provide significant assistance, as it does today to firms in the defense industrial base and critical infrastructure sectors. Such aid could include intelligence about foreign hacking attempts, support in vetting international talent, and guidance on security procedures. Companies that work directly with the U.S. government on national security should meet stringent standards, akin to those imposed on other defense contractors.

To meet their side of the grand bargain, AI businesses should help the United States incorporate their technologies into the national security apparatus. This lack of integration is a persistent area of weakness for Washington. American companies may lead the world in inventing AI, but without such cooperation, the country will fall behind in adapting AI for military purposes, which could prove devastating in a conflict. Time and again throughout military history, states that fail to integrate new technology into their armed forces have wound up suffering. France and the United Kingdom, for example, invented the tank during World War I but paid a heavy price when the Germans were the first to master its use, enabling their powerful blitzkrieg offensives of World War II. To guard against a similar outcome, the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies must procure and use frontier AI systems, and they will need hands-on guidance from private-sector technical experts to do so effectively.

Biden created an outline for how such cooperation might function in October 2024, when he signed a national security memorandum directing the government to bolster its use of AI for national security purposes. This document included strict guardrails to ensure that the technology does not enable human rights abuses, domestic surveillance, or other unethical activity—protections essential to earning the trust of private-sector AI developers and the general public. Unlike with many of Biden's other executive actions, Trump has not yet repealed it. But the president has made little progress on its many important provisions and has ousted some of the senior nonpolitical experts vital to its implementation.

As government and industry develop a better national security partnership, they will need to pay particular attention to how AI can solve pressing problems in Washington's competition with Beijing. There are, for example, many ways the United States could use AI in cyber-operations, as illustrated by the AI Cyber Challenge conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The country that more quickly and effectively integrates AI into the cyber-domain will likely prove better able to protect its own networks and penetrate others', unlocking a huge intelligence advantage. AI could also improve Washington's capabilities in other security domains, such as geospatial intelligence, signals intelligence, logistics, and weapons design. But nothing will happen without clear direction from government and meaningful engagement by American AI firms.

There is a final reason why the U.S. government and leading AI companies need to build closer ties: together, they will have to weigh tradeoffs between upsides and risks. Within the technology world, almost everyone agrees that although AI could offer tremendous benefits to humanity—curing diseases, advancing clean technology, eliminating grunt work—it could also cause massive harm. Some of these risks, such as the use of AI by authoritarian states to reshape the global order, can be avoided by preserving and expanding Washington's lead over competitors. But other dangers are trickier to mitigate. Several top AI thinkers, for instance, believe it is plausible, or even likely, that a single malicious user could someday harness powerful AI to engineer a deadly novel pathogen. Others worry that even in benevolent hands, powerful algorithms might cause catastrophic accidents by taking actions that their creators do not intend. Then there are less fantastical but still dire outcomes, including massive unemployment, acute concentration of economic power, and discrimination in sectors such as health care because of biased models and training data.

From a policy perspective, any one of these scenarios would pose a challenge of historic proportions and force difficult tradeoffs. For example, in a hypothetical world in which a single AI user can cause catastrophic harm, the government will have to consider sweeping regulations on the development and use of sophisticated systems, even if that slows innovation. And if AI automates away a large share of human work, the government may have to spend large sums of money retraining the workforce, or it might have to facilitate a restructured economy. Given the pace of AI progress, policymakers will have to make these consequential decisions under exceptionally tight timelines—all concerning a technology that government is not inventing and about which it knows worryingly little.



Deeper collaboration between the public and private sectors, as well as with civil society, does not guarantee that the state will make the right calls. But it does give Washington a fighting chance of securing a net-positive outcome. With a stronger technical foundation, officials can better understand how reliably AI systems follow instructions, how they handle dangerous tasks, in which areas they can replace human labor, and to what extent they favor offense versus defense in security and safety domains.

The rise of the Center for AI Standards and Innovation at the Department of Commerce (founded as the AI Safety Institute under the Biden administration) represents a valuable initial step to build meaningful collaboration. Since its inception, CAISI has brought together government officials and companies to collaborate on safety issues. It has also aided in the development of standardized testing mechanisms for AI. CAISI has worked alongside other agencies with domain-specific expertise to carry out additional voluntary testing on particularly critical topics, such as partnering with the Department of Energy and the AI company Anthropic to assess whether frontier AI models have dangerous knowledge about nuclear weapons. CAISI featured prominently in Trump's AI Action Plan, and the administration must empower it to carry out voluntary collaboration with companies, to set standards, and to conduct safety testing.

Thanks to CAISI's work and the voluntary commitments that leading AI companies made to the Biden White House, AI firms have already promised to conduct independent safety testing of their models, often based on CAISI guidance. In some cases, companies have even agreed to grant CAISI access to new systems before they are released and have praised the government for the national security–specific expertise it has offered in return. Both sides should deepen this collaboration, spending more time and resources building high standards and conducting rigorous assessments of new models.

Grand bargains often work better as tag lines than as policy, and getting the right kind of deal when it comes to AI is easier said than done. The technology, after all, is rapidly progressing along an unpredictable path. As AI improves, ever-larger amounts of infrastructure, power, and money will be required; the need for improved security from foreign intelligence threats will increase; and the urgency of collaboration with the defense apparatus will grow. So will the risks of misuse, prompting new policy tradeoffs. More startups will arrive on the scene, and legacy companies that today look unstoppable may fall by the wayside. Everyone involved in the AI world should prepare for constant renegotiation and rebalancing. U.S. officials, for their part, will almost certainly have to remain agile, experimenting with different AI policies as time goes on.

But amid this uncertainty, it is imperative that Washington take a more active role in enabling and shaping the American AI ecosystem. The technology does not need to develop as nuclear weapons did—under strict state control—but Washington cannot sit this one out. Instead, AI should perhaps evolve as the American railroads did in the 1800s. The private sector handled most planning and construction, but the government played a vital role, as well. It organized laws and permits for building the infrastructure. It passed carefully calibrated, common-sense government safety requirements—such as standardized track gauges, rules for the use of air brakes, and requirements for car coupling—which all helped make trains both faster and safer. The collaboration was not perfect, but it worked: American railroads became a national asset that increased the United States' security and prosperity. Advanced AI, too, can promote U.S. power and interests, provided it is developed in the right way and under the right set of arrangements. Now, as before, it is time for the public and private sectors to stand shoulder to shoulder.

 America Must Link Its Atlantic and Pacific Strategies

 Julianne Smith and Lindsey Ford



On October 28, 2024, a group of South Korean intelligence officials briefed NATO members and the alliance's three other Indo-Pacific partners—Australia, Japan, and New Zealand—on a shocking development in the war in Ukraine: North Korea's deployment of thousands of its troops to Russia's Kursk region to aid Moscow's war effort. The fact that Seoul sent its top intelligence analysts to Brussels for the briefing was nearly as stunning as North Korea's decision to enter the war in Ukraine.

Both developments reflected a new reality. The United States' adversaries are coordinating with one another in unprecedented ways, creating a more unified theater of competition in Eurasia. In response, U.S. allies are coalescing. For a few years, the United States led that effort. In 2021, it formed AUKUS, a security arrangement with Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2022, NATO began inviting Asian countries to participate in its annual summits. And in 2024, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the EU created a coalition to loosen China's grip over pharmaceutical supply chains.

Today, however, the United States appears to be dispensing with a transregional approach to great-power competition. In May, Elbridge Colby, the undersecretary of defense for policy, dissuaded British officials from sending an aircraft carrier on a scheduled deployment to the Indo-Pacific. The gist of Colby's position, according to an anonymous source quoted by Politico, was simple: “We don't want you there.” He urged them to focus instead on threats closer to home—namely, Russia.

Washington is now encouraging its Asian and European allies to stick to their neighborhoods—a throwback foreign policy that is ill suited to the current moment. China and Russia are synchronizing their transgressions and sharing weapons and know-how. Together, they pose a threat more formidable than any the United States has faced in decades. The lines between Asia and Europe are blurring, and crises on one continent have spillover effects in the other. The United States should try to influence the new networks its allies are crafting, not resist them. Otherwise, Washington may find itself on the fringes of a new global order.

American primacy depends on Asian and European security. In the 1940s, the political scientist Nicholas Spykman argued the importance of commanding the coastal edges, or rimlands, of Eurasia. “Who controls the rimland rules Eurasia,” he wrote. “Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.”

Since then, every U.S. president—with the exception of Donald Trump—has shared Spykman's conviction. They have also shared a belief that the United States should never again allow the emergence of a powerful Eurasian bloc that could threaten American interests. Any alignment of regional powers, whether as allies or in coordinated opposition to the United States, could pose a threat to U.S. preeminence. When that happened in the 1910s and again in the 1930s, the United States was drawn into two devastating world wars. Thus, while American leaders firmly committed themselves to both Asian and European security after World War II, they also spent most of the next 50 years trying to keep U.S. adversaries divided and U.S. allies apart.

This approach sustained American dominance for decades. But it is no longer fit for purpose. The United States now faces the prospect of an emerging Eurasian military-industrial bloc. China, the world's largest economy by purchasing power parity, is building a partnership with Russia that is an alliance in all but name. Both countries have formidable militaries and years of experience carrying out hybrid operations, such as cyberattacks, maritime disruptions, and disinformation campaigns. Last year, Russia signed a mutual defense treaty with North Korea. China has conducted joint military exercises with Belarus and Serbia. Meanwhile, China and Russia use institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS, a group named after its first five members—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—to provide a veneer of legitimacy to their plans.

Although this loose coalescing of adversaries is driven more by shared grievances than by common interests, the United States cannot ignore it. Washington must unify its alliances by investing in cross-regional ties. U.S. President Joe Biden recognized that need and sought to build “the muscle of democratic alliances.” The AUKUS pact, for example, was an ambitious effort to forge connections among allied defense industries across the Atlantic and the Pacific in fundamentally new ways.



With Chinese technologies and North Korean troops aiding Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, European partners know they can't sit on the sidelines of Asian geopolitics. And Indo-Pacific partners understand that what happens in Ukraine today could influence how China approaches Taiwan tomorrow. As Japan's former foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi has put it, security in Europe and security in the Pacific “are not separable.” Over the past seven years, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the EU all drafted new Indo-Pacific strategies that stress the importance of working with Asian democracies to build resilient supply chains and protect freedom of navigation. In 2021, Germany and the Netherlands deployed frigates to the Indo-Pacific for the first time in decades. And according to the Kiel Institute, a German think tank, Japan has sent more bilateral economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine than have Finland, France, or Poland.

Since January, the United States has resisted the growing ties between its Asian and European partners. In September, Trump said that he was “not concerned at all” about a Chinese-Russian axis forming against the United States. At the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's largest annual defense conference, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called for the United States' European allies to “maximize their comparative advantage” on their own continent and reminded them that “the N in NATO stands for ‘North Atlantic.'” Readouts of meetings between Pentagon officials and European allies no longer mention Indo-Pacific security, as they frequently did over the past few years. And meetings between the United States and Asian countries have stopped referring to the importance of peace in Ukraine. In June, for the first time in three years, Indo-Pacific leaders were absent from NATO's summit, despite their countries' significant contributions to European defense.

The Trump administration seems to want its allies, especially those in Europe, to stick to their own backyard so that they can shoulder a larger responsibility for their own security. The United States is focused on maintaining order in the Western Hemisphere, defending the homeland, and limiting U.S. commitments abroad. U.S. adversaries, however, are sharing their technological and military resources in ways that could wear down individual U.S. allies and prolong regional conflicts. Moreover, China and Russia are deploying cyber, space, and other tools around the globe, reducing the chance that any one crisis will be contained within a single geographic region.

Walling off Asian and European allies from one another would leave the United States and its friends weaker. The risk of a multitheater crisis is growing. Washington and its allies need to prepare to deter multiple adversaries in different regions. Their ability, or lack thereof, to muster a unified front will shape the calculus of leaders in Beijing and Moscow. The United States' friends and foes are realigning. Washington can sit on the sidelines or try to mold the emerging order to its favor.

China and Russia are collaborating in ways that the United States is not prepared for. The two countries are leveraging their relationship and also their respective partnerships with North Korea and Iran to cause trouble. In Asia and Europe, Beijing and Moscow are using “gray zone” operations to bully U.S. allies, weaken their militaries, and call into question the unity and capability of democratic groups such as the EU, the G-7, and NATO. For instance, China and Russia have tried to intimidate Japan and South Korea by conducting joint air patrols off their coasts. European officials have investigated Chinese- and Russian-linked ships for sabotaging undersea cables in the Baltic Sea. And according to the European Policy Center, Chinese and Russian online disinformation campaigns now “increasingly converge in both tactics and objectives.” For example, Chinese and Russian state media have amplified each other's narratives, including by blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine and spreading conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic.

China and Russia are also integrating their capabilities in ways that will shape future wars. Russian President Vladimir Putin's years-long bombardment of Ukraine would not have been possible without access to Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean weapons, technologies, and personnel. And U.S. officials have said that Moscow is repaying Beijing and Pyongyang by sending them stealth, submarine, missile, and satellite technologies it had previously been unwilling to share. The U.S. intelligence community's most recent threat assessment warns that this greater alignment of adversaries “increases the chances of U.S. tensions or conflict with any one of these adversaries drawing in another.” In 2024, a bipartisan congressional commission of former senior civilian and military officials similarly concluded that the United States “should assume that if it enters a direct conflict involving Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea, that country will benefit from economic and military aid from the others.”

China and Russia are making themselves more capable of sustaining regional conflicts for a longer time. The United States and its allies will not be prepared to manage this challenge unless they also collaborate militarily. Fortunately, Washington's friends are already doing so. Just as Russia has relied on Chinese and North Korean assistance to keep up its assault on Ukraine, NATO has been able to sustain Ukrainian defenses because Australia, Japan, and South Korea have been quietly backfilling U.S. stocks of 155-millimeter artillery rounds and Patriot missiles. Similarly, European deployments to the Indo-Pacific theater, although limited, have helped maintain allied presence around the South China Sea and in the Taiwan Strait, especially as U.S. ships have been redeployed to the Middle East and elsewhere.



These initiatives are a good start, but the United States and its allies will have to do much more to counter China and Russia. The potential for China or Russia to come to each other's aid also increases the risk of a multitheater conflict. In July, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned that, in the event of a crisis over Taiwan, China could ask Russia to keep Washington and its partners “busy in Europe by attacking NATO territory.” Moscow could also distract or dissuade countries from helping Taiwan through nonkinetic means, such as by launching a cyberattack on European power grids. Allied militaries and defense planners will need to address the prospect of a multitheater war collectively. The United States and its partners should begin by expanding real-time information sharing between their capitals, reducing vulnerabilities in their critical infrastructure, planning for shocks to the energy market, and integrating their space and cyber capabilities.

The United States and its friends should also coordinate defense industrial production to fill gaps in one another's arsenals. They should aim to double their overall production of long-range strike weapons, munitions, and drones within the next five years. If the United States and its allies don't pool their resources, they could face critical shortages in a future conflict. War games conducted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies have suggested that the United States could run out of munitions within the first eight days of a war with China over Taiwan. The United States and its partners would need to share resources to take on Beijing's military-industrial capacity alone. If Russia were to send munitions to China, the need for U.S. allies to leverage their collective resources would be even greater.

Washington should work to build munitions factories across the European and Indo-Pacific theaters, thereby reducing the chance that U.S. adversaries could sever supply lines. It should establish more maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities for U.S. platforms in allied countries, which would enhance the readiness and preparedness of American forces during a crisis. Washington and its partners also need practice when it comes to surging capabilities across theaters. The United States should, for example, include more European and Indo-Pacific allies in Mobility Guardian, a biennial exercise in which Australia, Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States practice moving troops and weapons over long distances.

U.S. allies have already grasped the need to work more closely together. Indeed, Asian and European partners have long turned to one another as a way to hedge against the United States. When Washington is unreliable or unpredictable, ties between Asia and Europe tend to strengthen. The first Trump administration's retreat from free trade prompted the EU to sign comprehensive trade deals with Japan and Vietnam. Under the second Trump administration, the EU is finalizing new trade deals with India and Indonesia. Standing next to Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto in July, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that “when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together.”

Because of Chinese-Russian cooperation and the United States' erratic foreign policy, countries in the Atlantic and the Pacific are aligning on security issues at a scale not seen before. In 2023, Japan and the United Kingdom signed an agreement that opens the door to joint training and rotational deployments. France and the Philippines are considering a similar deal. That same year, Australia became the first non-NATO member of the Movement Coordination Centre Europe, a logistics organization that allows its members to pool military ships and planes for transport. In November 2024, the EU signed new security and defense partnerships with both Japan and South Korea, the first time Brussels has done so with Asian partners.

Rather than resisting or dismissing this cooperation, Washington should shape it. European leaders have already signaled their interest in eventually joining Asia's Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a move that could leave Washington outside a trade bloc representing roughly 30 percent of global GDP. The United States can still steer the direction of international trade by offering attractive alternatives or harmonizing standards with partners and allies, such as for data-privacy rules or AI regulation.



A more integrated bloc of friendly countries should be a boon for Washington. Its allies are finally stepping up to share international burdens. France, India, and the EU, for example, are collaborating to improve maritime surveillance in the Indian Ocean. Germany is offering maritime training to countries, such as the Philippines, facing Chinese aggression in the South China Sea. And Australian troops have trained Ukrainian military recruits in the United Kingdom.

But other forms of coordination among allies could prove risky for the United States. Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom are jointly designing a new fighter plane—a test bed for future projects. For decades, allied interoperability has centered on American technologies. If Asian and European allies make their own, such integration could become more difficult. And without American expertise, allied assets could be less competitive.

If the United States abstains from new groups or institutions formed by its allies, it will lose its chance to set the terms for international trade and security. The EU and members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership have already expressed interest in aligning rules on digital trade across Asia and Europe without U.S. input. Such networks could eventually align more directly against U.S. policy or soften their resistance to Chinese or Russian objectives. Countries in Asia and Europe could create more permissive environments for Chinese investments and technologies, halt their nascent cooperation with Taiwan, or temper their support of Ukraine. They could also adopt Chinese telecommunications infrastructure, such as for 5G and 6G networks, that would make them vulnerable to Chinese espionage or create leverage for Beijing. Washington has the capacity to prevent some of these more troubling outcomes if it keeps its seat at the table.

The realignment of U.S. allies and adversaries could undermine the institutions that have enabled American primacy. Although the United States' industrial heartland provided the muscle to win World War II, it was Washington's ability to set the terms of international rules that reinforced U.S. dominance throughout the Cold War. China and Russia understand this power and seek it for themselves. Cross-regional institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the BRICS have supplanted international bodies, including the United Nations, as venues for multilateral collaboration. Through these institutions, China and Russia are building new financial tools and state-led cybersecurity models.

The SCO's Tianjin summit in September laid bare what's at stake for the United States. At the meeting, which was attended by more than 20 world leaders and the UN secretary-general, Chinese leader Xi Jinping made clear that his government is unwilling to let “the house rules of a few countries” dominate global affairs. SCO countries announced the formation of a new development bank, which will join the ranks of a similar BRICS-led institution and also China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, as well as new regional centers to coordinate law enforcement, counterterrorism, and antidrug campaigns. Beijing also used the meeting to announce its Global Governance Initiative, an effort to dilute Western influence in global institutions.

Bodies such as the SCO and the BRICS have been in place for decades, but because they have yielded mixed results for China and Russia, they have been easy to dismiss. Central Asian member states are hesitant to rely too much on either Beijing or Moscow. And members are not always aligned. India and Pakistan, for example, both belong to the SCO but remain bitter rivals. Despite these limitations, cross-regional bodies give China and Russia a leg up in building a new world order.



China and Russia have much more power over the organizations they lead than the United States has over the United Nations or the G-20. Beijing and Moscow use Eurasian-centric institutions as laboratories to refine new counter-Western initiatives and to give a sheen of global legitimacy to their ideas. Both the SCO and the BRICS have brought on new dialogue partners in recent years that allow China and Russia to claim leadership and influence not only throughout Eurasia but also across the so-called global South.

The practical effects of these institutions can sometimes be hard to see. But their endurance and growth reflect the fact that Beijing and Moscow are steadily harnessing disaffection with Western standards and trade practices. Beijing has gained tremendous influence by directing development spending across Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the world is far from ditching the U.S. dollar, the SCO and the BRICS are trying to accelerate de-dollarization. Their members are swapping currencies and signing cross-border payment agreements.

Chinese and Russian efforts to remake the world order have worried American allies and spurred them to come together in new and powerful ways. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, NATO deepened its relationships with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. The Five Eyes intelligence alliance—comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States—has taken steps to enhance information sharing and to bolster the security of supply chains. And the G-7 has regularly invited Australia, India, and South Korea to participate in its summits.



The Trump administration can take advantage of this momentum to encourage allies to assume more responsibility. The G-7 Plus, an intergovernmental organization of conflict-affected countries, could become a forum for cooperation on securing critical minerals or countering drug traffickers. A combined meeting of the two Quads to which the United States belongs—in the Indo-Pacific with Australia, India, and Japan, and in Europe with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom—could help the two regional groups coordinate their export controls, industrial policies, and technology development.

U.S. allies will continue to work with one another whether or not the United States joins them. But they can't reach their full potential without Washington's involvement. Eighty years ago, it took bold U.S. leadership and diplomacy to create the global order. It will take equally innovative leadership to remake it. The U.S. alliance system, built for a previous era, must be overhauled to reflect the new reality of adversarial alignment. Trump has shown little interest in revitalizing or redesigning alliances beyond pushing partners to spend more on defense. U.S. allies are now stronger as a result but still lack a clear strategy for integrating their new capabilities. Without U.S. leadership, allied coalitions might not have the muscle to successfully counter Beijing and Moscow.

On its own, the United States cannot manage Chinese-Russian alignment. But neither can Washington ignore any conflict in Eurasia that comes from it. American allies are rapidly transforming their relationships whether Washington likes it or not; these networks can either serve or undermine U.S. interests depending on how Washington engages with them. If the United States fails to reset ties with Asian and European partners, it risks being left on the sidelines of a rapidly changing world order.

 Why Beijing Can't Overcome Overcapacity

 Lizzi C. Lee



China's role as the world's factory—producing and exporting goods across the globe—has entered a new phase. In the past decade, China has made a concerted effort to move its manufacturing sector up the value chain, producing a deluge of cheap, green technology in the process, including electric vehicles, batteries, and solar panels. It now makes EV models that sell for under $10,000—most of the low-cost models in the United States start at around $30,000—and it dominates roughly 80 percent of the global solar supply chain.

But rather than welcome the influx of renewable energy products, the world's two largest consumer markets have lambasted these Chinese imports as a structural threat to fair competition. In May 2024, the Biden administration imposed tariff hikes of up to 100 percent on a variety of Chinese goods, which were justified as a defensive response to Beijing “flooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports.” The European Commission followed suit, imposing duties on Chinese electric vehicles in October 2024 and complaining that China's “unfair government subsidies” were causing “a threat of economic injury” to EU producers. Regardless of the efficacy of such trade remedies, the message is unambiguous: China makes more than the world can take.

This tension, of course, is not new. China's “overcapacity”—the shorthand term for producing more than demand calls for—has long led other governments to complain. In the past, China produced too much steel, coal, cement, and other goods, which crowded out competitors elsewhere and drove global prices to unprofitable lows. China's tendency toward overcapacity has traditionally been blamed on a fundamental mismatch in its economy; government subsidies and investment in manufacturing and infrastructure are unusually high compared with those in other advanced economies, and the country's household consumption as a share of GDP is unusually low. Simply put, China lacks enough domestic demand to soak up what the country's factories produce, which then causes a glut of exports.

But China's green tech boom is exposing a more sinister and systemic aspect of the country's political economy. In reality, today's Chinese overcapacity does not result from domestic demand that has peaked or excessive subsidies. Consider the solar power industry. China is still seeing significant demand for solar installations. In 2024 alone, China installed 277 gigawatts of new solar capacity—more than twice the total cumulative capacity ever installed in the United States—and 2025 is on track to match or surpass that record. At the same time, the notion that subsidies are propping up China's solar growth is outdated; China ended central government subsidies for solar in 2021. Meanwhile, in the EV and battery sectors, demand among Chinese consumers is still booming, and direct purchase subsidies have been phased out.

The real challenge, then, lies not in weak domestic demand or excessive state handouts but in an extraordinary and seemingly uncontrollable surge in supply—one that Beijing is struggling to get its arms around. Since mid‑2024, central government authorities have warned repeatedly about “blind expansion” in solar power, batteries, and EVs. This summer, after a brutal price war in the solar industry saw prices fall around 40 percent year-over-year, Chinese leaders directed officials to tackle overcapacity and “irrational” pricing in key industries, including solar. Shortly thereafter, high-level officials met with industry leaders to collectively urge companies to curb price wars and strengthen industry regulations.

But Beijing's efforts won't make much of a dent in the problem. Unlike earlier bouts of overcapacity, today's top offenders are private companies, not state-owned enterprises. If Beijing were to step in and force consolidations or shutter factories, it would risk sparking unemployment and potentially stall local growth engines that depend on these industries. Moreover, exports have become one of the few remaining bright spots in otherwise slowing GDP performance. If Beijing were to meaningfully curb production and exports, it could cause significant damage to China's overall economy.

The fundamental problem is that by rewarding speed and scale over productivity and differentiation, the internal plumbing of China's political economy incentivizes businesses to produce too much stuff. Although that has always been the predictable outcome of China's political and financial system, the dysfunction was kept in check during much of China's spectacular rise. Changes in the Chinese economy since 2020, however, including the cratering real estate market and a crackdown on private businesses and investments, have compounded the structural incentives that lead to overcapacity.

The result is not only damage to China's trade relationships but also plummeting company profits, significant deflationary pressure, and constraints on innovation. Over time, cutthroat price wars also spill into the labor market, with firms freezing wages or cutting jobs, which weakens household spending, deepens China's structural slowdown, and makes growth even harder to sustain. Without significant reforms, China risks repeating earlier missteps as it tries to move further up the value chain and into advanced fields such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology—potentially with even greater consequences for its economy.

China's tendency to overproduce starts in an unlikely place: the Chinese Communist Party's performance and promotion system. In the CCP bureaucracy, local officials are evaluated primarily on their ability to deliver growth, employment, and tax revenues. But China's largest single tax, the value-added tax (VAT), is split evenly between the central government and the local government of the place where a good or service is produced, not the place where it is consumed. Since the system allocates tax revenue to regions based on production, it rewards the decision to build larger industrial bases. Local Chinese officials try to retain as much upstream and downstream activity as they can to expand their tax base. (The U.S. tax code, by contrast, apportions much of the corporate tax base to where companies' customers are, rather than where firms produce goods, so the tax base is more evenly spread across jurisdictions.) This feature of the Chinese tax system explains the proliferation in China of “full stack” industrial clusters: EV assembly lines are located near battery production facilities, and solar panel factories are integrated with raw material and component suppliers.

This system effectively encourages provincial and municipal leaders to act like industrial investors or venture capitalists. And in many cases, it has produced profound efficiencies. Over the past decade, for instance, Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, has poured about $25 billion of state capital into various struggling companies, including the EV maker Nio and the flat-panel display manufacturer BOE, to great effect. By acting as an early investor and bearing the initial risk, Hefei stimulated about $96 billion in follow-on investment and generated around $9 billion in tax revenues. The Hefei model has since been widely imitated, with other provinces racing to assemble their own industrial clusters.



But Hefei's success rested on unique conditions—namely, that the city invested in companies that were relatively mature already. When other provinces have tried to replicate the model, especially in high-tech sectors that Beijing has signaled support for, they have often lacked the same foundation; as a result, many of the projects have underperformed, creating fiscal stress for local governments. But provincial officials have continued to rush into these industries because earmarked subsidies from the central government effectively make Beijing a co-financier. Provinces pour in matching funds, offer discounted land and utilities, and guarantee quick regulatory approvals to secure money from Beijing and eligibility for central government support. After Beijing released its 14th Five-Year Plan, in 2011, which designated EVs, solar panels, and batteries as “strategic emerging industries,” provincial five-year plans started to read like carbon copies of one another, each promising the same clusters in the same industries. This is the logical outcome of a tax and subsidy system that rewards scale over selectivity.

For much of the past three decades, however, the bureaucratic incentives feeding this copy-and-paste system were mitigated by the role of real estate in China's political economy. Because the state owns all urban land in China and leases it to developers, local officials relied on land sales to provide a third or more of their budgets—meaning they did not have to be singularly focused on attracting industrial investment. Land development was the primary engine of local revenue and growth. In 2021–22, however, China's real estate bubble popped; Evergrande, one of the country's largest developers, defaulted on more than $300 billion in liabilities and entered liquidation proceedings. Local governments saw revenues from land sales plunge from $1.3 trillion in 2021 to $670 billion in 2024.

At the same time, as Beijing tightened oversight of the financing tools that led to the bubble in the first place—such as special-purpose bonds and short-term rollovers—local governments found themselves without any way to fill their revenue gaps. With fiscal space highly constrained, expanding industrial capacity became the last reliable lever local officials could pull to secure growth, generate new jobs, and expand their tax bases. For risk-averse bureaucrats staring at a looming fiscal crisis, the safest bet was to hop on the bandwagon.

Just as the structure of China's tax code helps explain why capacity has expanded so quickly in China, the structure of the country's financial system helps explain why that capacity is often duplicative and inefficient. Over and over, credit flows reinforce the same bias—build fast, build visibly, and build with state backing.

China's state-dominated banking system has long favored tangible, government-endorsed projects over private ventures that pursue long-term or high-risk paybacks, such as drug development and other biotech pursuits. Chinese banks often face strict regulations on their lending and investments, so they prefer to make loans to lower-risk projects that have physical assets that can serve as collateral and that already have regulatory permits and government sponsorship. From a risk-management perspective, this preference is understandable. But the result is a system that diverts scarce capital into factories, production lines, and physical infrastructure, which tend to generate relatively low profits.

This is one reason why, in an earlier era, China came to dominate the global manufacturing of clothes, toys, and electronics—and why, today, it dominates in EVs, solar panels, and batteries. But the consequence is an economy with world-class build-out speed but chronically thin profitability. When demand softens or the market becomes crowded, firms slash prices and expand exports to keep production running, further eroding their margins. China's automakers, for instance, saw average profit margins decline from 5.0 percent in 2023 to 4.4 percent in 2024, as they chased market share via heavy discounting.



Persistently low profit margins also mean companies have little cash to reinvest in product development and hiring; that in turn depresses household income growth and consumer demand. In this way, overcapacity becomes more than just a sectorial problem: it acts as a drag on China's broader economy, locking it into a cycle of low profits, weak investment, sluggish job creation, and consistently weak demand.

Firms rarely close down operations altogether, however, because the state-backed banks prefer to roll over existing loans so that the firms appear solvent on paper. That way, even if those companies are only servicing their interest payments and not generating strong returns, the banks avoid having to book immediate losses—and avoid potentially contributing to the collapse of a large local employer. Credit keeps flowing into these “zombie” sectors and companies with declining productivity even as they are dragging down the broader economy in the long run.

Private firms not chasing government-backed industries, meanwhile, have long struggled to access affordable bank credit, which means they tend to seek capital from costly nonbank channels, such as venture capital, private equity, and initial public offerings. These channels helped fuel much of China's record growth in the first two decades of the twenty-first century: by October 2020, 217 Chinese companies were listed on major U.S. exchanges with a combined $2.2 trillion market cap, illustrating how deeply private firms tapped global equity markets. Leading venture capital platforms scaled as well. Sequoia's China arm (now HongShan), for instance, backed hundreds of private firms, including some of China's most prominent success stories, such as the social media company ByteDance and the transportation platform Didi.



But in the past five years, private firms have seen such options dry up. Starting in late 2020, Beijing launched a sweeping crackdown on tech platforms, private tutoring, and other high-growth sectors that had previously attracted huge amounts of venture capital. This had a chilling effect. Investors suddenly realized that entire industries could be upended overnight by regulatory fiat. That uncertainty made private investors more cautious, and many began pulling back capital. In the first quarter of 2024, private companies in so-called Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, raised just $12 billion, down 42 percent from the previous quarter. (The overall global decline during that period was just 12 percent.) Foreign venture capital firms have also pulled back, with cross-border investment into China collapsing from $67 billion in 2021 to just $19 billion in 2023. U.S. investors, in particular, have been absent from the largest deals.

The CCP has tried to fill the financing gap, but has yet to deliver. Official statistics, for instance, suggest that from 2023 to 2024 the average balance of inclusive loans to small and microbusinesses was about $67,000, which barely covers the working capital needs of most such borrowers, let alone multiyear innovation projects that are better positioned to deliver sustained, high-quality returns. (By comparison, in fiscal year 2024, the U.S. Small Business Administration's flagship 7(a) loan program provided average financing of $448,400.) Private enterprises also still face significantly higher borrowing costs compared with their state-owned counterparts.

Beijing's attempts to fill the venture capital and private equity gap with state-backed funds have been similarly ham-handed, since they rely on vehicles that demand guarantees, include onerous buy-back clauses, and concentrate capital in a handful of sectors. Officials managing these state-backed funds are also reluctant to make bold bets because any failure could be seen as misusing public money—or worse, corruption. Even in strategic sectors such as semiconductors and biotech, private Chinese companies looking to innovate face limited access to capital. Although Beijing's recent push to promote “new quality productive forces”—industries that China sees as the next drivers of growth—has been genuine in political ambition, it has been underpowered in financing support for the private sector.

The incentives that shape the behavior of local governments and financial institutions also filter down to firms. In China's most contested sectors, entrepreneurs operate within a brutally rational framework: copy quickly, scale up even faster, and price aggressively.

Entrepreneurs tend to copy one another in large part because China's incredibly high tax and contribution burden discourages risk-taking. Chinese companies not only have to pay high taxes but also face mandatory contributions to pensions, health insurance, unemployment insurance, and housing funds. According to data from the World Bank and PwC, China's total tax and contribution rate for a typical midsize firm was 59.2 percent of profits in 2019. (In the United States, the rate was 36.6 percent of profit.)

Firms tend to expand rapidly, meanwhile, because doing so buys them leverage in price negotiations with upstream suppliers and grants them visibility with lenders, who tend to equate large scale with low risks. By expanding quickly, firms also hope to win preferential treatment from local officials eager to showcase large industrial champions.

Finally, many firms end up slashing prices because they become trapped in a death spiral: once one firm cuts prices, others must follow to defend their market share, even if it erodes everyone's margins. Take the EV industry. In 2022, Chinese automakers cut prices on 95 passenger vehicle models. In 2023, that number rose to 148, and by the end of 2024, it was 227. Even as BYD's overseas sales continue to grow, the company's net profit in the second quarter of 2025 fell 29.9 percent year on year.

These firm-level calculations are reinforced by the same structural pressures that shape local officials' thinking. Local governments are reluctant to let duplicative or unprofitable firms exit the market, especially as property revenues decline. Even unprofitable firms, after all, contribute to local coffers through the VAT, payroll taxes, and mandatory social security contributions. This helps explain why local governments prop up firms that lose money, at least on paper: a failing factory still employs workers, thus paying labor-related taxes and social contributions; it still buys inputs, which generate VAT; and it still adds to industrial output statistics that matter for cadre evaluation. In other words, unprofitable firms remain fiscally valuable not because they generate profits but because they generate taxes.

If companies, financiers, and local officials are all behaving rationally within the system and the result is overcapacity, then the only way to change course would be to change the system. So far, however, Beijing is merely making tweaks. Recently, for instance, officials introduced draft legislation that would ban companies from using algorithms to dynamically adjust prices based on demand, costs, or competitors. Beijing also introduced new regulations that require large firms to settle payments with small and medium-sized suppliers within 60 days—a response to the EV pricing war, which saw firms financing their discounts by stretching out payments to their suppliers. And in July, the CCP published a draft amendment to a 1998 pricing law—the first major revision to the law—which would, among other things, prohibit below-cost pricing that is intended to eliminate rivals, clarify penalties for unfair pricing, and ban forced bundling or data-driven discounting.

But the price wars are a mere symptom of the overcapacity problem. Beijing can't hope to make meaningful progress without reengineering the underlying incentive structure that is causing overcapacity. Consider, for example, how the CCP evaluates local officials. At present, cadres are promoted largely based on how much growth they deliver; that means judging them based on how much new factory space they build and how many roads or industrial parks they pave. Such measures favor scale over quality. If China wanted to dismantle the barriers and redundancies that waste capital and sap productivity, it would instead use metrics that judge officials on concrete targets for new business formation as well as on survival; not only how many private firms are registered each year, for instance, but also how many remain operational over a longer time horizon.

But new metrics alone would not be enough. China's taxation system would also need to be overhauled. Some reforms have been debated in Beijing, such as shifting more tax revenue from the central government to the provinces or restructuring local government debt, but so far, the CCP has not made any changes that have altered the behavior of local officials. As long as land and factories keep local governments solvent, overcapacity will remain an attractive fallback.



If the CCP wants to make good on its oft-repeated slogan “Invest early, invest small, invest long-term, and invest in hard tech,” then it will also need to significantly retool the financial system. Regulators would have to require, for instance, that big banks dedicate long-term lending portfolios to technology companies. China's stock and bond markets, meanwhile, would need to mature quickly to become genuine alternatives to collateral-heavy bank loans. That means speeding up slow approval queues and strengthening accounting rules and investor protections so that entrepreneurs and investors alike see public markets as reliable. Currently, bonds and stocks account for just 31 percent of all the funds available from both bank and nonbank sources in China—less than half that available from equivalent sources in the United States.

To unlock more financing, China would have to develop financial tools for raising and recycling capital. Common tools in the United States—such as convertible bonds, loans that can turn into shares if a company succeeds, or venture debt (credit for startups without hard collateral)—are practically nonexistent in the world's second-largest economy. And yet China is sitting on a vast pool of domestic savings; household deposits and gross savings rank among the highest in the world, amounting to a colossal 43 percent of GDP as of 2023. Building a more active secondary market for private equity stakes, encouraging corporate acquisitions of startups, and restoring confidence in public listings would ensure that capital keeps cycling back into the next wave of young firms.

Finally, if Beijing wants to see innovation as opposed to just imitation, it would have to design and enforce a competition policy that rewards originality. The draft reforms to China's pricing law and new rules on algorithmic discounting are steps in the right direction, but without more robust enforcement of intellectual property rights and fair competition laws, copycats will continue to proliferate. China's intellectual property enforcement is weak: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranked China 24th out of 55 economies in its 2024 International IP Index. Curbing predatory pricing and coercive platform tactics will help firms with little capital, but protecting intellectual property raises the return on genuine innovation.

The Chinese system has produced some extraordinary innovation. But breakthroughs in China often come from sheer technical ingenuity and determination. DeepSeek, for instance, the AI firm that stunned global observers with its advances in large language models, built much of its momentum because of internal resourcefulness and a highly disciplined engineering culture. The fact that it didn't rely on mainstream financing channels underscores the weaknesses of the system rather than its strengths.

The same pattern is visible in other sectors. China's new semiconductor challengers, for instance, are pushing against the dominance of the U.S. tech company Nvidia by exploiting narrow technical edges, tapping the country's deep engineering ecosystem, and reacting to urgent market demand for domestic alternatives. Robotics startups, likewise, are advancing through lean operations, rapid prototyping, and close integration with local supply chains. Some observers see these developments through a positive lens and have concluded that China's tech ecosystem is efficient and competitive. But the Chinese firms that are succeeding are the ones that can persevere in an environment that is rigged against them. In the industrial robot sector, for instance, there are already signs that overcapacity will undermine progress: some sales prices are reported to be even lower than the cost of materials, eroding margins before firms have even turned a profit.

To create a more sustainable model—one that encourages innovation but doesn't spiral into overcapacity—China will have to undergo an institutional reckoning. The logic of speed over quality, of scale over innovation, and of investment volume over returns is deeply embedded in the system. Reversing that logic means making long-deferred tradeoffs and moving past the structures that once powered China's incredible rise.

In this sense, unwinding overcapacity is not just an economic adjustment. It is the ultimate test of Beijing's ability to self-correct—and of whether the Chinese model has reached a plateau or can once again soar to new heights.

            The North Carolina Senate approved a new congressional map aimed at helping Republicans eke out an additional GOP seat to help shore up the party's majority in the US House after next year's midterm elections.
    


            The vote came one day after Republican lawmakers who control North Carolina's legislature formally opened debate on the map. It targets a House district currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis – one of three Black members of Congress from the state. The new district lines aim to give Republicans the advantage for 11 out of 14 US House seats from North Carolina.
    


            The GOP currently controls 10 seats under the map used in last year's elections.
    


            The map next moves to the North Carolina House, which is expected to give it final approval this week. State law does not give Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, veto power over redistricting legislation – although litigation over the map is likely.
    


            North Carolina is the latest GOP-controlled state to accede to President Donald Trump's demands to take up drawing new district lines to prevent Democrats from flipping the US House. Off-year elections generally favor the party out of power in the White House, and Democrats need to gain just three more seats to gain control of the chamber.
    


            A Democratic-controlled House could thwart Trump's agenda and launch investigations during the final two years of his presidency into his actions and those of his administration.
    


            Battles over congressional districts are underway around the country – after Trump kick-started the fight by pushing Republicans in Texas to craft new maps to help the party pick up five more seats. Democrats in California, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, have responded with their own redistricting push that asks voters next month to replace the state's current congressional maps with new ones that aim to net the party five US House seats.
    


            During the debate this week, North Carolina Republicans made clear their political goals.
    


            If Democrats take back the House, they will “torpedo President Trump's agenda,” said state Sen. Ralph Hise, the Republican helping oversee the map legislation. He claimed that Democrats across the country had gerrymandered maps to favor their party in previous redistricting cycles.
    


            “North Carolina is fighting fire with fire,” he added in a statement. “If Gavin Newsom and his Democrat cronies want to try and take control of Congress to force their liberal agenda on the American people, then we're going to respond in kind.”
    


            North Carolina Senate leader Phil Berger also defended the vote, arguing that Democrats across the country have “spent decades” gerrymandering states they control.
    


            “North Carolina Republicans will not sit quietly and watch Democrats continue to ignore the will of the people in an attempt to force their liberal agenda on our citizens,” Berger said in a statement. “This new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times.”
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, accused GOP lawmakers of bowing to Trump's demands without regard for the state's voters.
    


            “Clearly, this new congressional map is beyond the pale,” Davis said in a statement, noting that the district elected him and voted for Trump in 2024.
    


            “What is happening today … is a response from a president who has demanded fealty from members of his party who control legislatures across this country,” Democratic state Sen. Julie Mayfield said during the floor debate on Tuesday.
    


            Another Democrat, state Sen. Michael Garrett, cast Tuesday's vote as a perilous moment for American democracy.
    


            “Future historians will look back at 2025 and ask, ‘When democracy was openly under assault, when a president demanded states rig their elections, when millions took to the street, begging their leaders to protect their rights, what did those in power do?'” Garrett said. “Did they stand with the people or did they stand with the powerful?”

            It took a day without Amazon Web Services for Americans to realize how reliant the internet is on a single company.
    


            It's not just that people couldn't place mobile orders for coffee at Starbucks or ask Alexa for the weather. Hospitals said crucial communications services weren't working, and teachers couldn't access their planned lessons for the day. Chime, a mobile banking service, was down, too, leaving people without access to their money. Ring and Blink cameras, along with most smart home devices, stopped working.
    


            AWS is one of a small group of cloud computing juggernauts that form the backbone of the internet, providing businesses with backend computing tools needed to power crucial parts of their daily operations. That includes everything from storage to virtual servers that companies can use to develop and deploy apps without investing in their own hardware.
    


            While other cloud providers exist, they lack the scale and reach of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These three power the majority of the world's cloud services, around 60% of the market, Roy Illsley, chief analyst at Omdia, told CNN. But among those three, AWS is the largest with roughly 37% of the market, according to research firm Gartner. AWS has a customer base of 4 million, according to an HG Insights report published this year.
    


            So when a platform like AWS goes down, it has a cascading effect.
    


One expert already estimated the total impact of the disruption will be in the billions of dollars.
    


            “It creates a very large single point of failure that then impacts operations at warehouses, deliveries, people being able to sell their goods and services on websites,” Jacob Bourne, an analyst at eMarketer, told CNN.
    


            Debi Dougherty and her husband were affected by the AWS fallout on nearly every stop of their Monday morning errands in and around New Albany, Indiana.
    


            To start the day, Dougherty was pinged with Ring alerts that there was a car in her driveway, but she couldn't view the camera. She figured it was a Ring issue.
    


            However, when at the doctor's office for her husband's first radiation therapy appointment, the scheduling software was so spotty that it took 40 minutes to book the next 25 days of appointments – something that usually only takes a few minutes.
    


The internet just had another global outage. Why does this keep happening?



            The next stop at Kohl's brought more delays. The line was backed up because the credit card reader was on the fritz.
    


            The Doughertys then stopped for lunch at Cattleman's Roadhouse, where the manager offered to pay for their meal because the restaurant was unable to process cards.
    


            “He said, ‘This is no fault of yours, and you're already eating. I don't guess you all have cash?'” Debi Dougherty said. “And we both looked at each other, and I'm like, ‘Not enough to cover this meal.'”
    


            Still, she said, the Monday morning experience was “frightening” to say the least, knowing how dependent society is on technology.
    


            “(The businesses) put all their eggs in one (AWS) basket, because it's affected so many different industries,” she said. “And, perhaps, that's not the smartest thing to do.”
    


            Cattleman's, which uses the Toast point-of-sale system that's reliant on AWS, was grateful that the outage happened on a Monday, and not a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, said Cameron Sharp, the New Albany location's general manager.
    


            “If this goes into multiday, or heaven forbid – and let me find some wood here so I can knock on it – goes into the weekend, we're in trouble,” Sharp said.
    


            Sharp ultimately had to comp just the one meal Monday before realizing that one Toast terminal at the restaurant could store the transactions.
    


            “Our entire economy is based on e-commerce,” he said. “Because we're so tied together, this (AWS outage) is going to screw with a lot of folks.”
    


Amazon says systems are back online after global internet outage



            Over in the broader Houston area, Dia Giordano was spending her Monday trying to untangle the mess that the outage made for her three businesses: an Italian restaurant, eight mental health clinics and a couple of rental properties.
    


            DoorDash was “blowing up” her phone starting at 2 a.m., warning that the online ordering system, which is run through Toast, was down.
    


            “What that means is one-third of my business is gone for the day,” she told CNN. “At least with the publicity (of the outage), people might be understanding, but I'm still getting messages asking if we're open, because the website is just gone. It's just not there.”
    


            Toast, when reached Monday, declined comment.
    


            At Giordano's mental health clinics, her practitioners and administrative staff members were unable to validate clients' insurance information because the online clearinghouse for that information wasn't working.
    


            And on top of that, Venmo was down, meaning she couldn't receive the rental payments she normally would.
    


            “We're just kind of playing it by ear, moment by moment,” she said.
    


            But in the meantime, regarding the reliance on tech, “it's frightening,” she said.

            An edge comes to Michael's voice when he speaks about his time serving in Afghanistan and his struggles living with post-traumatic stress disorder.
    


            A hardened Marine veteran, Michael — who asked to use the pseudonym to speak candidly about sensitive health issues — describes in tones that are measured but laced with irritation what he saw in conflict: vehicles being blown up, children being exploited, cellphones that could trigger unexpected detonations.

            Some Veterans Affairs hospitals, including the one where Michael gets his care, have stepped up enforcement of a policy in recent years that limits the number of long-term therapy sessions available to individuals, according to half a dozen mental health providers and VA patients     at locations across the country who spoke to CNN.
    


            Under the policy, put in place under earlier administrations, patients initially get a certain number of one-on-one therapy sessions, which can vary between four and 24 sessions, depending on the type of treatment.
    


            Mental health care providers at four facilities have told CNN that, whereas in the past they had discretion to extend the number of sessions based on their assessments of their patients, the VA is now pressing them to stop one-on-one sessions at the end of the allotted series, and more broadly reduce the number of patients who get this long-term care — without consideration for whether this is clinically appropriate. The providers asked not to be named for fear of retribution.



            In some cases, providers told CNN that if they pushed back on the policy, they faced disciplinary consequences, which could result in their privileges to practice therapy at VA facilities being removed. CNN has viewed some of these documents discussing disciplinary measures. Some providers said they had to justify extending care to more sessions in writing — a change from previous practice at their VA facility.
    


            Contacted by CNN, the VA denied veterans aren't getting the care they need.
    


            A spokesperson for the department said it was not aware of providers facing disciplinary reviews for challenging a policy to limit sessions.
    


            “There are no limits on the number of VA appointments a Veteran can have in mental health or any other areas,” Peter Kasperowicz, the spokesperson, said.
    


            The VA “works with Veterans over an initial eight to 15 mental health sessions and collaboratively plans any needed follow-on care,” he said. “As part of this process, Veterans and their health care team decide together how to address ongoing needs, including whether to step down to other types of care and self-maintenance, or continue with VA therapy.”
    


            “The goal is recovery, healing and helping Veterans achieve greater independence and resilience.”
    


            While some providers who spoke to CNN said they are given some flexibility to extend care, all said there has been a draconian effort to move patients out of individual therapy more quickly since President Donald Trump took office in January and installed Doug Collins as VA secretary.
    


            “It's really, really frustrating. These people need help,” one provider said. The person stressed that some mental health conditions are “chronic,” and those patients would need treatment for life.
    


            Another provider described having to inform one of their patients that sessions would be ending, saying: “It was terrible. The timing wasn't right. There were still things we were working on.”
    


            “It felt like it was a moral failing on my part, even though it wasn't my fault,” the provider said. “It's re-traumatizing for the veteran. It almost feels like I'm a perpetrator of that, having to carry out those orders.”
    


            Michael, the combat veteran, said that finding out his therapy sessions were to stop felt “like being abandoned — you're thrown away like yesterday's trash.”
    


            “I'm not ready to address all my issues on my own yet,” he said. “It feels like they took the training wheels off before I'm ready.” He has re-applied for one-on-one care and is in the middle of a monthslong waiting period.
    


            Some providers said they were told the rationale for the renewed push to limit therapy sessions is to free up room for more veterans to enter the VA system and receive mental health treatment, and to move patients through the system more rapidly.
    


Some studies do suggest that shorter-term, limited sessions can work well for particular veterans.
    


            And the practice of limiting longer-term mental health care for some patients is also commonplace in the private sector. “Larger hospitals and health care systems do sometimes place limits,” said Caitlin Thompson, a former VA psychologist who oversaw the Veterans Crisis Line  and suicide prevention program and now works in the private sector. “It depends on what's clinically appropriate,” she added.
    


            One former VA mental health care provider, who is now in the private sector and didn't want to give their name, said: “When insurance is paying for mental health care, utilization review is standard practice. It's not open-ended. There are weigh stations.” It is often important to set goals and timeframes in treatment to track progress, they added.
    


            However, VA providers who spoke to CNN said there were problems with how the limits were being implemented at their VA facilities.
    


            One provider said that while they agreed with the objective to bring more veterans into the system to access care, “it should be agreed upon between the patient and the therapist” regarding when treatment should end — and not be imposed by the institution.
    


            Another mental health care provider at a VA facility in the western US said that because of the intensified push to limit sessions, “we have been hemorrhaging staff  ” as some mental health providers quit in frustration over the policy — at a time when the VA already has a severe shortage of psychologists, according to a recent VA Inspector General report.



            Stephen Long, a former VA psychologist at the Northport VA Medical Center on Long Island, told CNN that he retired in 2024, in part because he was told to limit one-on-one sessions with patients.
    


            Longer-term, more open-ended therapy builds more trust between veterans and their therapists, he said. “If you can't have this kind of therapy, you'll miss opportunities to develop that trust.”
    


            Some veterans will need therapy for the rest of their lives, Long said. Treatment needs for physical illnesses would never simply be cut off — “If you need insulin for your diabetes, you don't stop it,” he said — and mental illnesses should be treated the same. Some providers who spoke to CNN also said veterans often have issues that lend themselves to needing longer-term care.
    


            Mark Jorges, a former psychotherapist and mental health counselor at the VA hospital in Temple, Texas, says he resigned this May in part because of his frustrations over the mandate to limit sessions.  “I brought it up all the time” to leadership at his hospital, Jorges told CNN.
    


            He says from the time he started working at that VA facility in 2021, there have been various attempts to have therapists limit sessions.
    


            But setting a set number of sessions “as a directive is not appropriate clinically, because veterans have different pathologies according to what they've been through,” Jorges said. “You could be talking about someone with PTSD, depression, anxiety, acute stress disorder … that's the majority of patients I saw. You can't put a cap on it. It's just not appropriate.”
    


            The American Psychological Association, the largest scientific and professional organization for psychologists in the US, told CNN it is aware of reports from VA psychologists of mental health visits being limited for some veterans, and is looking into them.
    


            “Veterans deserve individualized, recovery-oriented care based in shared decision-making between the provider and the Veteran,” Katherine McGuire, the APA's chief advocacy officer, said in a statement.
    


            “The VA has a great history of providing excellent mental health care by exceptionally skilled providers apt at assessing veterans' needs and appropriate treatment options.”
    


            Patients were offered other options for treatment, such as group therapy or the chance to re-apply for one-on-one treatment.
    


            But some veterans who have come to depend on their trusted therapists say those are not palatable options.
    


            Michael said he was offered group therapy, but does not want to take it as he feels uncomfortable speaking about his issues in a group setting. Even when he is approved for one-on-one treatment, which can take months, he is not assured of seeing the same therapist.
    


            He feels uneasy about potentially seeing another therapist, he said. “It took me a long time to open up” to his trusted therapist, he said.
    


            Jake Pannell, an Army veteran who's been receiving one-on-one mental health treatment for PTSD and anxiety at a VA facility in Washington state for several years, told CNN that in recent months, providers have told him that “unless there's an active crisis, they are no longer going to do just check-in visits.”
    


            “I've continuously received one-on-one treatments at the VA for many, many years,” Pannell said. “And as we're starting to get notified of these things, even the providers that are taking care of these veterans are telling us that, regardless of what the condition is, or regardless of what the veteran's going through at the time, they are limiting a certain time frame down to 8 to 12 visits.”
    


            Pannell, who now works for a federal workers union, has himself previously worked as a VA behavioral health counselor specializing in drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
    


            “We've got veterans with severe PTSD, drug and alcohol issues. And that requires continuous maintenance,” he said. “Once that crisis happens, so — we have to wait ‘till veterans threaten to kill themselves before they get care?” he asked. “I'm scared to death. I'm scared to death for my veterans.”
    


            “We just want the care that we were promised,” the Afghanistan combat veteran said. His main concern as he's waiting for a new set of therapy sessions, he says, is “just lettin' everything take back over.”

Hannah Hidalgo of Notre Dame, Lauren Betts of UCLA and Madison Booker of Texas headline The Associated Press All-America women's college basketball team released Tuesday.

The trio were first-team All-Americans last spring after having stellar seasons. They were joined on the preseason team this year by UConn's Sarah Strong and South Carolina's Ta'Niya Latson. Latson transferred to the Gamecocks this year after spending the first three years of her career at Florida State.

Hidalgo and Betts each earned 29 votes from from the 31-member national media panel that chooses the AP Top 25 each week. Strong garnered 28 votes while Booker had 23 and Latson 14.

Hidalgo is coming off a season that saw the talented guard become just the fourth sophomore to earn All-America honors in her first two years. USC's JuJu Watkins also accomplished that feat last season, but is out for this year while she's recovering from a torn ACL she suffered in the NCAA Tournament. Courtney Paris and Maya Moore were also All-Americans their first two seasons.

Hidalgo averaged 23.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists for the Fighting Irish last season. She will take on a bigger role this season with the loss of the other four starters to either the WNBA or the transfer portal.

“I know the weight of that is heavy, the crown is super heavy,” Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey said. “But I feel like she has done a great job of surrounding herself with the right network, the Notre Dame network, but also her family. She is very grounded with her family and her faith.”




Betts, a senior, helped UCLA reach No. 1 in the AP Top 25 for the first time in school history last season. The 6-foot-7 center averaged 20.2 points and 9.5 rebounds to get the Bruins to their first Final Four before they lost to Strong and UConn.

Strong had a sensational freshman season for the Huskies, helping them win the school's 12th national championship. She averaged 16.4 points and 8.9 rebounds, and coach Geno Auriemma has said she is even better this year. UConn is No. 1 in the preseason Top 25.

“Every day, there isn't a day that goes by that one of the coaches and I don't look at each other and go, ‘Man, there's just something about her right now,'” Auriemma said. “I can't wait. I look forward to going to practice just to see what might happen next, some things she might pull off.”

Latson led the country in scoring at Florida State last season, averaging 25.2 points a game. With one year left of eligibilty, it's not just about trying to win a national championship but getting prepared for the WNBA. Coach Dawn Staley has had a lot of success producing pros, including four-time WNBA MVP A'ja Wilson.

Latson will have to face Booker at least once this season in the SEC. The Longhorns' junior wing averaged 16.0 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.6 assists last season. Booker helped Texas reach the Final Four last season before the Longhorns lost to South Carolina.

Betts, Hidalgo and Booker were all first-team All-Americans last spring while Latson and Strong were on the second team. The AP began releasing a preseason All-America team before the 1994-95 season.

CHICAGO (AP) — The music begins low and ominous, with the video showing searchlights skimming along a Chicago apartment building and heavily armed immigration agents storming inside. Guns are drawn. Unmarked cars fill the streets. Agents rappel from a Black Hawk helicopter.

But quickly the soundtrack grows more stirring and the video — edited into a series of dramatic shots and released by the Department of Homeland Security days after the Sept. 30 raid — shows agents leading away shirtless men, their hands zip-tied behind their backs.

Authorities said they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, though they also said only two of the 27 immigrants arrested were gang members. They gave few details on the arrests. 

But the apartments of dozens of U.S. citizens were targeted, residents said, and at least a half-dozen Americans were held for hours. 

The immense show of force signaled a sharp escalation  in the White House's immigration crackdown and amplified tensions in a city already on edge. 

“To every criminal illegal alien: Darkness is no longer your ally,” Homeland Security said in a social media post accompanying the video, which racked up more than 6.4 million views. “We will find you.”

But Tony Wilson, a third-floor resident born and raised on Chicago's South Side, sees only horror in what happened. 

“It was like we were under attack,” Wilson said days after the raid, speaking through the hole where his door knob used to be. Agents had used a grinder to cut out the deadbolt, and he still couldn't close the door properly, let alone lock it. So he had barricaded himself inside, blocking the door with furniture. 

“I didn't even hear them knock or nothing,” said Wilson, a 58-year-old U.S. citizen on disability.

The raid was executed in the heart of South Shore, an overwhelmingly Black neighborhood on Lake Michigan that has long been a tangle of middle-class dreams, urban decay and gentrification.

It's a place where teams of drug dealers troll for customers outside ornate lakeside apartment buildings. It has some of the city's best vegan restaurants but also takeout places where the catfish fillets are ordered through bullet-proof glass.

It has well-paid professors from the University of Chicago but is also where one-third of households scrape by on less than $25,000 a year.

The apartment building where the raid occurred has long been troubled. Five stories tall and built in the 1950s, residents said it was often strewn with garbage, the elevators rarely worked and crime was a constant worry. Things had grown more chaotic after dozens of Venezuelan migrants arrived in the past few years, residents said. While no residents said they felt threatened by the migrants, many described a rise in noise and hallway trash. 

Owned by out-of-state investors, the building hasn't passed an inspection in three years, with problems ranging from missing smoke detectors to the stench of urine to filthy stairways. Repeated calls to a lead investor in the limited liability company that owns the building, a Wisconsin resident named Trinity Flood, were not returned. Attempts to reach representatives through realtors and lawyers were also unsuccessful.

Crime fears spiked in June when a Venezuelan man was shot in the head “execution-style,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. Another Venezuelan was charged in the death. 

Days after the raid, the doors to dozens of the building's 130 apartments hung open. Nearly all those apartments had been ransacked. Windows were broken, doors smashed, and clothes and diapers littered the floors. In one apartment, a white tuxedo jacket hung in the closet next to a room knee-deep in broken furniture, piles of clothing and plastic bags. In another, water dripping from the ceiling puddled next to a refrigerator lying on its side. Some kitchens swarmed with insects. 

Wilson said a trio of men in body armor had zip-tied his hands and forced him outside with dozens of other people, most Latino. After being held for two hours he was told he could leave.

“It was terrible, man,” he said. He'd barely left the apartment in days. 

Chicago, the White House says, is under siege.

Gang members and immigrants in the U.S. illegally swarm the city and crime is rampant, President Donald Trump insists. National Guard soldiers are needed to protect government facilities from raging left-wing protesters.

“Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World,” he posted on Truth Social.

The reality is far less dramatic. Violence is rare at protests, though angry confrontations are increasingly common, particularly outside a federal immigration center in suburban Broadview. And while crime is a serious problem, the city's murder rate has dropped by roughly half since the 1990s. 

Those realities have not stopped the Trump administration.

What started in early September with some arrests in Latino neighborhoods, part of a crackdown dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” has surged across Chicago. There are increasing patrols by masked, armed agents; detentions of U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal status; a fatal shooting; a protesting pastor shot in the head with a pepper ball outside the Broadview facility, his arms raised in supplication.

By early October, authorities said more than 1,000 immigrants had been arrested across the area.

The raids have shaken Chicago.

“We have a rogue, reckless group of heavily armed, masked individuals roaming throughout our city,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said after the Sept. 30 raid. “The Trump administration is seeking to destabilize our city and promote chaos.”

To Trump's critics, the crackdown is a calculated effort to stir anger in a city and state run by some of his most outspoken Democratic opponents. Out-of-control protests would reinforce Trump's tough-on-crime image, they say, while embarrassing Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, seen as a possible Democratic presidential contender.

So the South Shore raid, ready-made for social media with its displays of military hardware and agents armed for combat, was seen as wildly out of proportion.

“This was a crazy-looking military response they put together for their reality show,” said LaVonte Stewart, who runs a South Shore sports program to steer young people away from violence. “It's not like there are roving bands of Venezuelan teenagers out there.”

Officials insist it was no reality show. 

The operation, led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, was based on months of intelligence gathering, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The building's landlord told authorities that Venezuelans in about 30 units were squatters and had threatened other tenants, the official said, adding that the building's size necessitated the show of force. Immigration agencies declined further comment. 

Even before the “Midway Blitz,” Trump's election had whipsawed through Chicago's Latino communities. 

Stewart said Venezuelan children began disappearing from his programs months ago, though it's often unclear if they moved, returned to Venezuela or are just staying home.

“I had 35 kids in my program from Venezuela,” he said. “Now there's none.” 

The raid echoed through South Shore, pinballing through memories of the surge in violence during the 1990s drug wars as well as economic divides and the sometimes uncomfortable relations between Black residents and the wave of more than 50,000 immigrants, most Latino, who began arriving in 2022, often bused from southern border states.

Chicago spent more than $300 million on housing and other services for the immigrants, fueling widespread resentment in South Shore and other Black neighborhoods where the newcomers were settled.

“They felt like these new arrivals received better treatment than people who were already part of the community,” said Kenneth Phelps, pastor at the Concord Missionary Baptist Church in Woodlawn, a largely Black neighborhood.

It didn't matter that many migrants were crowded into small apartments, and most simply wanted to work. The message to residents, he said, was that the newcomers mattered more than they did. 

Phelps tried to fight that perception, creating programs to help new arrivals and inviting them to his church. But that stirred more anger, including in his own congregation. 

“I even had people leave the church,” he said.

In South Shore it's easy to hear the bitterness, even though the neighborhood's remaining migrants are a nearly invisible presence.

“They took everyone's jobs!” said Rita Lopez, who manages neighborhood apartment buildings and recently stopped by the scene of the raid. 

“The government gave all the money to them — and not to the Chicagoans,” she said.

Over more than a century, South Shore has drawn waves of Irish, Jewish and then Black arrivals for its lakeside location, affordable bungalows and early 20th-century apartment buildings.

Each wave viewed the next with suspicion, in many ways mirroring how Black South Shore residents saw the migrant influx.

Former first lady Michelle Obama's parents moved to South Shore when it was still mostly white, and she watched it change. A neighborhood that was 96% white in 1950 was 96% Black by 1980.

“We were doing everything we were supposed to do — and better,” she said in 2019. “But when we moved in, white families moved out.”

But suspicion also came from South Shore's Black middle-class, which watched nervously as many housing projects began closing in the 1990s, creating an influx of poorer residents.

“This has always been a complex community,” Stewart said of those years. 

“You can live on a block here that's super-clean, with really nice houses, then go one block away and there's broken glass, trash everywhere and shootings,” he said. “It's the weirdest thing and it's been this way for 30 years.”

An AP investigation found more than 420 anti-science bills attacking longstanding public health protections – vaccines, milk safety and fluoride – have been introduced in statehouses across the U.S. this year. Anti-vaccine bills were the most common. (AP Video: Laura Bargfeld/Mary Conlon/Cody Jackson)

Two advisers to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sat on a stage in California this spring, addressing an audience at a natural products industry trade show that drew tens of thousands of people from food brands, investment banks, supplement sellers and other companies.

Their message: The goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement will help your bottom lines.

“It blows my mind that I'm going to watch the Republicans carry the supplement industry and the holistic health industry and chiropractors and the acupuncturists into the promised land,” said Del Bigtree, according to video of the remarks obtained by The Associated Press. At the time, Bigtree was leading MAHA Action, one of the groups an AP investigation found pushing anti-science bills in states.

Powerful anti-vaccine advocates and people selling potentially harmful goods such as raw milk are profiting from the push to write anti-science policies into law across the U.S. They object to the term “anti-science” and portray the MAHA movement as grassroots. But it's fueled by a web of well-funded national groups led by people who've profited – financially and otherwise – from sowing distrust of medicine and science.

Whether by advancing their careers or selling more products, these leaders are finding ways to benefit.

One way activists promote those ideas is through state legislation. Supporters argued that making money or increasing sales for businesses — such as dairy farmers — was a reason to pass some of the bills that would remove consumer protections, AP found. In at least one case, that reasoning was spelled out in the text of the bill.

A core criticism Kennedy and his allies repeat about big pharmaceutical companies and the medical establishment is that they are motivated by profits. But the $1.5 trillion global wellness market is big business, too, and it's benefiting them. Surgeon general nominee Casey Means has made money promoting dozens of health and wellness products, including a blood testing service, and she cofounded a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app. Her brother, Calley Means, a close Kennedy aide, continues his involvement in TrueMed, a company that promotes wellness alternatives.

Bigtree spoke at ExpoWest in a session aimed at the supplement industry. Market research presented during the session showed the industry reached $69.3 billion in sales in 2024.

In Delaware, a bill legalizing raw milk sales last year said it “may increase profits for Delaware dairy producers.” Several farmers testified in favor, with one calling it “a $15.6 million economic opportunity.” The bill's synopsis cited the Raw Milk Institute saying raw milk producers can earn a profit nearly 10 times that of regular, pasteurized milk. Pasteurization destroys dangerous bacteria that can make people sick.

The Raw Milk Institute was founded by California farmer Mark McAfee, who said his Raw Farm LLC is the world's largest producer of raw milk. AP found McAfee has testified in more than half a dozen states to increase access to raw milk. A bill in Missouri would allow retail sales of raw milk from farms approved to be listed by the Raw Milk Institute.

But McAfee's own operation demonstrates how difficult it is to protect raw milk from contamination. It has had eight recalls related to raw milk products since 2015, according to the state, though McAfee said four of those are not related to illness.

That history didn't come up when McAfee testified in favor of the Delaware bill, not even that just a few months before the hearing, his farm was identified as the source of a salmonella outbreak that state records last year showed sickened at least 165 people. 

McAfee disputed that number and defended the omission. He had only 90 seconds to testify, and said he did so on behalf of the institute and not his farm. Still, video shows he identified himself as being from both the Raw Milk Institute and Raw Farm.

As raw milk gains broader acceptance, McAfee's operation has grown from $8 million in annual sales in 2012 to an expected $32 million this year.

“We're doing great,” he told AP.

During the Delaware hearing, one lawmaker pointed to federal recommendations against drinking raw milk because of concerns around bird flu. In response, microbiologist Peg Coleman testified there was “no scientific basis” for the recommendations. She has disclosed in the past that her work had been financially supported by the Raw Milk Institute and the Weston A. Price Foundation, which is among the groups AP found pushing anti-science bills.

Many of the people involved in groups pushing anti-science bills have built lucrative careers on their stance and benefited from the millions of dollars that flow through the movement.

One of Bigtree's companies was paid $350,000 working on Kennedy's presidential campaign in 2023 and 2024. A second was paid $184,000 from another Kennedy-affiliated group, the MAHA Alliance, from October to December of last year. In 2023, another anti-vaccine group he leads, the Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, paid him $234,000.

After Kennedy was picked as health secretary, Kennedy gave the MAHA trademark to a company managed by Bigtree. Kennedy's ethics disclosure said he transferred ownership for “no compensation” after making $100,000 in licensing fees from it in the few months he had the trademark.

In an ICAN video on Facebook in August, Bigtree celebrated the group's successful lawsuit to compel Mississippi to allow religious exemptions from vaccines. Then he said they would “double down” on efforts to change the law in other states where religious exemptions aren't allowed. Bigtree asked supporters to help by buying a brick for as much as $300 to pave a terrace at ICAN's offices, where he works.

Bigtree did not respond to multiple requests for comment sent to him at ICAN. Kennedy's spokesman did not answer questions.

Tony Lyons, who runs MAHA Action and other MAHA-related groups supporting Kennedy and his agenda, leads Kennedy's longtime publisher, Skyhorse. The company has published numerous anti-vaccine books by Kennedy and others and has a publishing deal with Kennedy's former nonprofit.

Lyons told AP his books present ”a responsible argument based on rigorous research” and called the term anti-vaccine a “pharmaceutical company talking point.”

Lyons, who ran a pro-Kennedy super PAC during his presidential campaign, has recently been running Zoom calls with activists across the country where administration officials, including Calley Means, encourage them.

During his ExpoWest appearance with Bigtree, Means said the supplement industry “should be going on offense.” He said the movement's goals would benefit businesses in the room by incentivizing nutritious food or supplements people take to stay healthy, rather than pharmaceuticals. 

“The entire discussion was around a moment to put healthy food at the top of the national agenda,” he told AP via text when asked to comment for this story. 

At the expo, he said: “There is a true moment here. ... Marshaling your companies, speaking out, educating members of Congress, local lawmakers, as Del's group is doing so well, there's a real opportunity here.”

NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase unveiled its new 60-story headquarters to the public on Monday, one of the first major office buildings to be constructed after the COVID-19 pandemic and one that will remake the New York City skyline for decades.

The bronze and steel tower at 270 Park, which reportedly cost $3 billion, replaced the Union Carbide Building, which sat on a full city block between 47th and 48th Street and Park Avenue and Madison Avenue for nearly 60 years. JPMorgan expects to house roughly 10,000 of its 24,000 New York-based employees in the new building, with some employees starting their first workday at the tower at the same time as the company holds its ribbon cutting ceremony.

“For 225 years, JPMorgan Chase has always been deeply rooted in New York City. The opening of our new global headquarters is not only a significant investment in New York, but also testament to our commitment to our clients and employees worldwide,” said Jamie Dimon, CEO and chairman of JPMorgan, in a statement.

The completion of the new 270 Park is a major accomplishment for Dimon, who has been one of loudest voices calling for employees to report to an office for work. The building was designed before the COVID-19 pandemic made remote work more common. The bank held meetings to consider halting work on the building to either redesign it or scale it back, but Dimon was insistent that work should continue as designed. 

Both politicians and CEOs, particularly Wall Street CEOs, have been vocal about the need for companies to have offices. New York politicians must answer to local businesses that have existed for decades and are used by workers to eat, groom, shop and drink at.




“To have this investment at this extraordinary time is a testament to that New York audacity and ambition,” said Gov. Kathy Hochul, who attended as part of the ribbon cutting ceremony. The ceremony ended with the playing of “Empire State of Mind” by Jay-Z and Alicia Keyes.

At 1,388 feet, the new building designed by famed architect Norman Foster, is taller than the Empire State Building's roofline and is now the fourth-largest building in Manhattan. The building contains 2.5 million square feet and a block's worth of public space. The bank also commissioned five new artworks for the building, adding to the bank's already substantial art collection. The bank will house its trading operations in the building across eight floors, and has contracted out several food and coffee vendors to create a city-within-a-building concept.

The building was a major engineering and architectural undertaking by Foster, the building's lead architect and Tishman Speyer, who handled construction and engineering. The old Union Carbide building had to be systematically demolished over a period of two years, most of that demolition happening during the pandemic. Construction was complicated by the fact the site sits above the rails of the Metro North Railroad and the Long Island Railroad that run underneath Park Avenue into Grand Central Terminal. 

For years, JPMorgan has worked out of several buildings around Grand Central Terminal, a result of the bank's growth and acquisitions over the years. 

Corporate execs and investment bankers still use 383 Madison Ave, the former headquarters of Bear Stearns, and 277 Park, which housed Chemical Bank, also a predecessor of the current JPMorgan Chase. Parts of JPMorgan started using the Union Carbide Building in the mid-1990s, but the bank always struggled to fit all its operations in the building. The building was designed to house 3,000 employees when it was built in the 1960s, and JPMorgan housed more than 6,000 there within a few short years of moving in. 

With 270 Park finished, the bank says it will now start a renovation of 383 Madison. Dimon said the bank has purchased a few other adjacent properties near 270 Park to centralize its operations around its new headquarters for the long term.

PARIS (AP) — France's culture minister said Tuesday that the security apparatus installed at the Louvre worked properly during a dramatic weekend heist in which historic jewels were stolen from the world's most-visited museum.

Questions have arisen about the Louvre security — and whether security cameras might have failed — after thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, forced a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels on Sunday morning.




“The Louvre museum's security apparatus did not fail, that is a fact,” the minister, Rachida Dati, told lawmakers in the National Assembly. “The Louvre museum's security apparatus worked.” 

Dati said she launched an administrative inquiry that comes in addition to a police investigation to ensure full transparency ito what happened. She did not offer any details about how the thieves managed to carry out their heist given that the cameras were working.

But she described it as a painful blow for the nation.

The robbery was “a wound for all of us,” she said. “Why? Because the Louvre is far more than the world's largest museum. It's a showcase for our French culture and our shared patrimony.”

Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said Monday that the museum's alarm was triggered when the window of the Apollo Gallery was forced. 

Police officers arrived on site two or three minutes after they were called by an individual that witnessed the scene, he said on LCI television. 




Officials said the heist lasted less than eight minutes in total, including less than four minutes inside the Louvre. 

Nuñez did not disclose details about video surveillance cameras that may have filmed the thieves around and in the museum pending a police investigation. “There are cameras all around the Louvre,” he said. 

Sunday's theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. Alarms brought Louvre agents to the room, forcing the intruders to bolt, but the robbery was already over.




Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eugénie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Most U.S. adults are worried about health care becoming more expensive, according to a new AP-NORC poll, as they make decisions about next year's health coverage and a government shutdown keeps future health costs in limbo for millions.

About 6 in 10 Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about their health costs going up in the next year, the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds — a worry that extends across age groups and includes people with and without health insurance.

Many Americans have other health care anxieties, too. The poll found that about 4 in 10 Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about not being able to pay for health care or medications they need, not being able to access health care when they need it, or losing or not having health insurance.

Medicare beneficiaries are already shopping for next year's coverage, and open enrollment periods for many other health plans are approaching quickly in November. Federal policies have left millions of people at risk of skyrocketing health insurance premiums or of losing their health insurance altogether. The findings show that many Americans are feeling vulnerable to spiking health care costs, with some expressing concerns about whether they'll have coverage at all.

Latoya Wilson, an independent nurse consultant in Lafayette, Louisiana, currently uses a health insurance plan from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. But in the past two weeks, the 46-year-old has applied for more jobs than she had previously in her life, largely because she's concerned about her premiums going up and wants the stability of employer-sponsored insurance. 

“Even before these health care cuts came into play, I was already having a significant issue getting the care that I needed this year,” she said. “Anything worse than what I already have is pretty scary.”

About 8 in 10 U.S. adults say the issue of health care is “extremely” or “very” important to them personally. That includes about 9 in 10 Democrats and three-quarters of Republicans, and it puts health care next to the economy among Americans' top issue priorities.

That significant attention on the issue raises the political stakes in what's already been a crucial moment for federal health policy in the nation's capital.




President Donald Trump's mega-bill passed this summer cuts more than $1 trillion from federal health care and food assistance over a decade, largely by imposing work requirements on those receiving aid and by shifting certain federal costs onto the states. Republicans say the cuts will prevent people who don't need aid from gaming the system, but the cuts will ultimately result in millions of people losing health insurance coverage, according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

More urgently, a congressional deadlock over Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire this year has thrown the federal government into a shutdown that's dragged into a fourth straight week with no end in sight. Democratic lawmakers want any funding bill they sign to extend the subsidies, which have made ACA premiums less expensive for millions of people. Republicans in Congress have expressed willingness to negotiate on the issue, but only after the government is reopened.

In interviews, some Americans said they doubted government leaders would take the necessary action to address their concerns on health care.

“It is the federal government's job to provide a better way of life for its people,” said Caleb Richter, a 30-year-old certified nursing assistant in Belleville, Wisconsin, who identifies as an independent. ”Right now, it just feels like they're not trying.”

But the poll reveals a deep ideological divide over what the government's role should be, with Democrats far more likely than Republicans to say it's the federal government's job to make sure all Americans have health coverage. About 8 in 10 Democrats say this, compared with about one-third of Republicans.

Health care continues to be a weakness for Trump. Only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults approve of the Republican president's handling of health care, which hasn't changed meaningfully since September. Almost all Democrats disapprove of his approach, but so do about 8 in 10 independents and about one-third of Republicans.

Wilson, a Democrat, said she thinks Trump should be “doing things that affect the good of the group” when it comes to health care, including catering more to working-class Americans.

But Michelle Truszkowski, a disabled veteran in Sterling Heights, Michigan, who is politically conservative, said she appreciates how Trump is focused on cutting fraud and abuse in the health care system. 

“I like that people who shouldn't be getting benefits from the government are getting kicked off of them,” the 48-year-old said. “Health care is not a right. It's a privilege.”

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally.

Americans are more likely to trust their own party on health care, generally speaking, but 76% of Democrats trust their party more on health care, while only 57% of Republicans have more trust in theirs. 

Independents are especially likely to trust neither party on health care — about half of independents say this. But the remaining independents are more likely to trust the Democrats.

Richter, in Wisconsin, said he wishes Congress would put more faith and funding into hospital staffers who know how to help patients. He said he'd be fine with paying higher taxes if it meant ensuring health care for people who need it.

But instead of working toward solutions, he said, federal lawmakers are acting “like a bunch of high school kids arguing.” 

“My faith that something will get done is very, very low at this point,” Richter said. “It just feels like they don't really care.”

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and President Donald Trump's warning to Hamas if the Israel ceasefire collapses.

FIRST ON FOX: A group of House Republicans is calling on Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to deal with expiring Obamacare subsidies immediately after the government shutdown ends.

Thirteen House GOP lawmakers, led by Reps. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., and Jen Kiggans, R-Va., are sending a letter to Johnson on Tuesday thanking him for his leadership during the shutdown but maintaining that Obamacare must also be dealt with before the end of the year.

Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act (ACA), has emerged as one of the main flash points in the ongoing fiscal standoff between Republicans and Democrats.

""Every day the shutdown continues to hurt the very people we were elected to serve, including the men and women of our Armed Forces, the federal law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe, the agents who defend our nation's borders, and the public servants who provide essential services to veterans, seniors and families,"" the Republicans wrote.

""We also firmly believe that the government funding debate is not the time or place to address healthcare issues. Using the shutdown as leverage to force that debate only prolongs the harm and distracts from the immediate task of reopening the government. Once the government is reopened, however, we should immediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of healthcare affordability and the looming expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits.""

Obamacare subsidies were enhanced under the Biden administration in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic in a bid to make healthcare more available to a wider swath of Americans. Democrats voted to extend those subsidies through 2025 in 2022 via the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats are now pushing to extend those subsidies now, using the ongoing government shutdown as leverage to force Republicans to deal with the issue.

Both House and Senate GOP leaders have signaled they are willing to discuss the expiring healthcare subsidies but rejected pairing them with their bill to fund the government — a short-term extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 federal spending levels called a continuing resolution (CR).

But extending the Obamacare subsidies is expected to generate its own debates among Republicans. Conservatives like the House Freedom Caucus and their allies are skeptical of the move, arguing the enhanced healthcare credits were responsible for sending medical prices skyrocketing.

But the 13 Republicans who signed the letter maintain, ""Millions of Americans are facing drastic premium increases due to short-sighted Democratic policymaking. While we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it.""

""Allowing these tax credits to lapse without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent. Nevertheless, we must chart a conservative path that protects working families in our districts across the country who rely on these credits,"" they wrote.

The lawmakers agreed with GOP leaders that reforms are needed to the system ""to make these credits more fiscally responsible and ensure they are going to the Americans who need them most,"" but added, ""Our Conference and President Trump have been clear that we will not take healthcare away from families who depend on it. This is our opportunity to demonstrate that commitment through action.""

House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., ruled out accepting a straightforward extension of the Obamacare subsidies in comments to reporters on Monday.

""You want a clean vote on a program that potentially is $400 billion, and you want to do it without any debate, any negotiation? That's just insanity,"" Harris said.

Asked by Fox News Digital if he sees any pathway to compromise, he said, ""It all depends on what the package is, how is it paid for, what other healthcare reforms are in it?""

""But that's stuff that you're not going to negotiate in hours. It's going to take weeks to negotiate,"" Harris said.

It's also not immediately clear when the shutdown will end — while the House passed its CR on Sept. 19, Senate Democrats have sunk the bill in the upper chamber 11 times as of Monday.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker accuses USBP Chief Patrol Agent Greg Bovino of unlawful acts following the arrest of an immigrant working as a police officer on America Reports.

A federal judge in Chicago said she will allow top officials, including Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, to be deposed after chemical agents were deployed during immigration operations in Chicago, potentially violating a temporary restraining order she had put in place.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, held an emergency hearing Monday over possible violations stemming from two incidents, according to multiple reports.

Border Patrol official Kyle Harvick testified that agents used tear gas on Oct. 12 in Albany Park on the city's North Side and again on Oct. 14 in the East Side neighborhood. Harvick argued the gas was deployed because those involved were not peacefully protesting but instead interfering with an active immigration enforcement operation.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is seen during an immigration enforcement operation in Chicago. A federal judge later ordered Bovino and other officials to be deposed over the use of tear gas.

The deployment came after Ellis issued an Oct. 9 order that barred federal agents from using crowd control devices such as tear gas (CS gas) or pepper balls on protesters, journalists and clergy as long as there wasn't a threat to others, per NBC Chicago.

Harvick told the court that protesters in Albany Park were ""actively resisting"" by locking arms and blocking Border Patrol agents from leaving and that agents issued a verbal warning before deploying the gas. In the East Side incident, Harvick said people in the crowd began throwing objects at agents before gas was deployed.

""Why was it appropriate to use CS gas at Albany Park?"" Ellis asked.

Harvick replied, ""That scene was an enforcement action. This wasn't a protest.""

Ellis raised concerns about oversight and accountability as no agents had been disciplined for potential use-of-force violations. Harvick admitted that no disciplinary action had been taken since the operation, known as Operation Midway Blitz, began.

TRUMP ADMIN MAKES SUPREME COURT PLEA FOR NATIONAL GUARD IN CHICAGO AFTER JUDGE DENIES 'REBELLION' CONCERN

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers acknowledged he had not reviewed any use-of-force reports tied to an earlier September incident at the Broadview ICE Processing Center, even though his own Special Response Team (SRT) was involved.

Ellis reacted sharply to that response, saying she was ""a little surprised"" and had expected him to have reviewed those reports, given his supervisory position. She indicated that this lack of oversight helped lead her to broaden the inquiry up the chain of command to include Bovino, former ICE Chicago Field Office Director Russell Hott and CBP Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Daniel Parra, per Bloomberg Law.

Ellis also ordered officials to preserve all video evidence, including body-camera footage, even though ICE said some Broadview video may already have been overwritten. She also directed the expansion of body-camera use across both agencies.

The incidents occurred during Operation Midway Blitz, a joint immigration enforcement campaign by ICE and Border Patrol in the Chicago area aimed at apprehending criminal illegal immigrants and fugitives with prior deportation orders.

The hearing coincided with Illinois' deadline to answer the Trump administration's Supreme Court petition seeking to overturn limits on deploying the National Guard in the state.

On Monday, Illinois responded by arguing that the troop deployment violates Illinois' sovereignty and that there is no credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois.

President Donald Trump has already deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, to help curb violent crime. He has said the moves caused crime to plummet in those areas. 

Last week, the president floated the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to tackle violent crime in Chicago and urged Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker to ""beg for help"" from the federal government.

The Insurrection Act of 1807 gives the president authority to deploy active-duty military or federalized National Guard troops inside the country in limited circumstances, such as to suppress civil disorder, rebellion or obstruction of federal law. It has been invoked about 30 times by roughly 10 presidents, most recently by George H. W. Bush during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, according to The Associated Press.

‘The Five' co-hosts discuss Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's apology for suggesting President Donald Trump send the National Guard to San Francisco and more.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie on Monday rejected President Donald Trump's plan to deploy the National Guard to The City by the Bay after days of touting his administration's public safety progress. 

Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday that the National Guard is headed to San Francisco next as the Trump administration continues to crackdown on crime across the U.S., including in Chicago, Memphis and Portland. 

""I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers — and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,"" Lurie said. 

Lurie announced his rejection of the National Guard deployment in an Instagram Reel on Monday. He ousted a more than six-year incumbent when he was elected mayor in 2024 and has since made strategic use of social media to communicate his agenda, which has public safety at the forefront.

""As your mayor, my top priority every single day is keeping San Francisco safe. With the support of local law enforcement, community leaders, and the appropriate federal law enforcement partners, we're achieving that goal without compromising our values or our laws,"" Lurie said, touting that violent crime is down and the ""city is moving in the right direction.""

Lurie said the city welcomes stronger coordination with government agencies to arrest drug dealers and disrupt drug markets, but since the National Guard ""does not have the authority"" to arrest drug dealers, he said their presence will do nothing to stop the flow of fentanyl. 

In a statement shared exclusively with Fox News Digital on Monday, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said San Francisco Democrats should ""welcome the President in to clean up their city.""

""America's once great cities have descended into chaos and crime as a result of Democrat policies that put criminals first and law-abiding citizens last,"" Jackson said Monday. ""Making America Safe Again — especially crime-ridden cities — was a key campaign promise from the President that the American people elected him to fulfill.""

Without addressing the National Guard deployment plan directly, Lurie has been pointing to his administration's public safety progress for the past several days. 

""Since January, I have said that public safety is my number one priority,"" Lurie said during a public safety briefing Friday. ""Over the last nine months, we have backed that up, rebuilding the ranks of our public safety agencies, strengthening coordination across departments and strategically deploying technology. It's working.""

But the White House urged California Democrats to recognize the progress made in Memphis, Tennessee, and in Washington, D.C., where fellow Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has acknowledged the Trump administration's success cleaning up the nation's capital. 

""We're going to go to San Francisco,"" Trump said on Sunday. ""The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco. San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.""

Newsom was quick to fire back in a social media post Sunday, writing, ""Fact check: Nobody wants you here. You will ruin one of America's greatest cities.""

Newsom criticized Trump in August for ""militarizing American cities"" after the president deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to fight crime in the nation's capital.

The California governor, a frequent Trump critic who is considered a likely 2028 presidential candidate, deployed California Highway Patrol ""crime-suppression teams"" across the Golden State in August to prevent crime and promote public safety.

""While the Trump administration undermines cities, California is partnering with them and delivering real results. With these new deployments, we're doubling down on these partnerships to build on progress and keep driving crime down,"" Newsom said in a statement in August, seemingly to deter another National Guard deployment to California. 

Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles this spring during protests rejecting deportations by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in line with another Trump mandate.

President Donald Trump talks China, surveillance on Republican lawmakers and the indictment of former National Security Advisor John Bolton on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.'

China's spy agency accused the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) of hacking its national time service, alleging a yearslong cyberespionage campaign that targeted the system keeping official Beijing Time — a backbone for China's telecommunications, finance and defense sectors.

The Ministry of State Security claimed the NSA began the operation in 2022 by exploiting a text-messaging vulnerability to gain control of employee cellphones at the National Time Service Center, then used stolen credentials to access servers and implant covert tools. The alleged breach, if true, could have allowed attackers to tamper with national timekeeping — a move that experts say could disrupt communications, banking and satellite navigation across China.

The NSA said in a statement it ""does not confirm nor deny allegations in the media regarding its operations. Our core focus is countering foreign malign activities persistently targeting American interests, and we will continue to defend against adversaries wishing to threaten us.""

Chinese investigators allege the hackers deployed 42 ""specialized cyberattack weapons"" to implant sabotage capabilities.

The attackers allegedly forged digital certificates, bypassed antivirus software and used strong encryption to erase traces to conceal activity. Tampering with the National Time Service could disrupt financial transactions, communications and satellite timing.

China's national security agency said it countered the operation by cutting off the attack chain and upgrading defenses.

The Beijing statement claimed that in recent years, the U.S. has pursued ""cyber hegemony,"" launching hacking operations against China and across the globe.

But for years, U.S. officials have said the nation needs to take a more offensive approach to cyber espionage, given China's frequent intrusions into U.S. systems.

In a media statement, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said China ""is the most active and persistent cyber threat to U.S. government, private-sector and critical infrastructure networks.""

The latest claim fits into years of mutual accusations of state-sponsored cyber activity between the world's two largest powers. Beijing has frequently accused the U.S. of hacking Chinese systems, while American intelligence and private cybersecurity firms have repeatedly attributed massive data-theft campaigns – from the Microsoft Sharepoint breach to Operation Salt Typhoon – to Chinese state-linked groups.

In April, Chinese authorities accused the NSA of launching attacks against networks linked to the Asian Winter Games held in February.

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the Trump administration's vow to end the weaponization of the Justice Department after Biden-era officials reportedly tracked nine Republican lawmakers' phone calls.

FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., was one of nearly a dozen Senate Republicans allegedly probed by former Special Counsel Jack Smith, an investigation she wasn't aware of until earlier this month.

She was one of several Senate Republicans that Smith allegedly surveilled as part of his investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. But it was only revealed earlier this month by the FBI — thanks to an oversight request by Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa — that Smith allegedly requested phone records on her and others.

Blackburn told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that until the documents from Smith's ""Arctic Frost"" investigation were revealed, she had no idea that her phone records were being surveilled.

JACK SMITH INVESTIGATORS NEED TO 'PAY BIG' FOR JAN. 6 PHONE RECORDS PROBE, WARNS SEN. GRAHAM

She believed the ""common thread"" behind the former special counsel's probe, which was carried out in 2023, was because ""the eight of us are all Republicans. We all support President Trump.""

Blackburn and Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Bill Hagerty, R-Wyo., Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., and Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., were all reportedly part of Smith's investigation.  

In response, Blackburn and many of the others that were allegedly surveilled by Smith want to see him disbarred.

""This is about making certain we have one tier of justice, and that we stop this two tiers of justice,"" Blackburn said. ""And if they can do this to eight sitting U.S. senators, what could they possibly — I mean, think about how, what they must be doing to conservatives in this country.""

Last week, she and Graham, Tuberville, Sullivan and Kelly sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding an investigation into Smith, and that he be referred to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of Professional Responsibility.

The end goal of the investigation is to see Smith disbarred from both New York and Tennessee, two states where he holds a license to practice law. Blackburn argued that Smith's alleged spying on her and others was a ""First Amendment and Fourth Amendment violation.""

Her latest push against the former special counsel came on the heels of another letter sent to AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon demanding why the cellphone carriers allegedly allowed Smith and the FBI under the Biden administration to track their communications.

""You would have thought that, because of the Stored Records Act and the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment and the Speech and Debate Clause, that at least Verizon, who's my wireless carrier, would have informed me that there was a request on my records,"" she said. 

JACK SMITH TRACKED PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS, CALLS OF NEARLY A DOZEN GOP SENATORS DURING J6 PROBE, FBI SAYS

""But of course, there was nothing given to us, and it's the reason that we sent the letter to Verizon and then followed it with a letter … to the DOJ on Jack Smith,"" she continued.

Smith is one of a handful of former officials that have been targeted by the DOJ under the Trump administration. He is currently under investigation by the Office of Special Counsel for alleged Hatch Act violations, which bars government employees from participating in political activities.

Then there are federal indictments against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly making false statements and obstructing justice, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified documents.

Blackburn was one of many Republicans that railed against so-called political witch hunts against President Donald Trump when he was out of office. When asked what the difference between the indictments against Trump and his allies compared to the latest crop of former officials, she said it was about accountability.

""These need to be investigated so that this kind of stuff stops,"" Blackburn said. ""And one of the differences, I think you see between Democrats and Republicans, is Democrats repeatedly circle the wagons, and they push things under the rug, and then they want two tiers of justice. And with Republicans, the focus is on accountability and transparency, and I think that is a major, major difference.""

Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

As Britain marked the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's birth last week, Japan made history of its own on Tuesday by electing its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a self-declared admirer of the ""Iron Lady.""

Takaichi, 64, who has long cited Thatcher as a personal and political inspiration, was chosen by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), during an extraordinary session of the country's lower house, replacing former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ending several months of political turbulence that saw the party lose its upper-house majority in July.

In remarks after her election, Takaichi said she felt ""the tough work starts here"" and promised to restore public confidence and strengthen Japan's security posture. Over the years, she has praised Thatcher's ""strength and womanly warmth"" as qualities she seeks to emulate. In 2013, shortly before Thatcher's death, Takaichi met her in London — a moment she later described as ""life-changing.""

Described by some in Japanese and international media as an ultraconservative and hard-line figure, Takaichi backs strengthening Japan's defense posture, is a noted  China hawk, and supports constitutional revision to expand the role of the Self-Defense Forces. 

Economically, she praises Abenomics, the policies adopted by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and favors fiscal and monetary stimulus. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister and was assassinated in 2022 at a campaign rally, two years after leaving office.

""She's very different from the other people in the Liberal Democratic Party, and that's why she was selected this time,"" said Gordon Chang, author and Asia analyst, in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""After losing its upper-house majority, the LDP realized it needed to protect its right flank by electing someone more conservative than in the past — so the Margaret Thatcher comparison does make sense.""

Known for her hawkish stance on China, Takaichi is expected to maintain Japan's close alignment with the United States. Chang said her election could bolster Washington's strategic position in Asia, especially as tensions with Beijing remain high.

""She's a hawk on China, and that's exactly what's needed right now,"" Chang said. ""That's not going to upset President Trump — if anything, it strengthens his hand in dealing with Xi Jinping. It shows America's alliances are strong and getting stronger.""

Takaichi's rise has been hailed as a milestone for female representation, though Chang emphasized that her selection was driven more by ideology than identity.

""I don't think she was chosen because she was a woman,"" he said. ""She was chosen because the party needed to shore up its right flank — and it just so happened that the most conservative of the possible candidates was a woman.""

Even as she breaks barriers herself, Takaichi's record underscores her conservative social vision. She is among the Japanese politicians who have resisted measures to advance women's rights, supports the imperial family's male-only succession, and opposes same-sex marriage as well as allowing separate surnames for married couples.

Like Thatcher, Takaichi rose from outside her country's political elite. Her mother served in the Nara Prefectural Police, and her father worked for a Toyota-affiliated car company.

Analysts say she now faces the challenge of turning symbolism into substance. Her nationalist positions could heighten friction with China, while her expansive spending plans for the world's fourth-largest economy will be closely watched by international investors. At the same time, she must prepare to host President Donald Trump, who is expected to visit Japan next week.

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

The headlines of the past weekend's “No Kings” protests made the gatherings sound like the 2025 version of the 1969 Vietnam protest at the National Mall. 

MSNBC: ‘No Kings' isn't just a slogan. It's a call to save democracy before it's too late.

NO KINGS IS NOT ‘WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE' IN THE FOUNDERS' REPUBLICNew York Times: Republicans Know How Vulnerable Trump Is. The Attacks on No Kings Prove It.

Politico: ‘No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwide

Gee, it's as if the legacy media are taking a side here. Sarcasm aside, these protests, while large in scale, were attended by mostly older people who likely were also part of the Vietnam protests yearning for the past, but also something to feel morally superior about today. 

In this case, the cause is “saving democracy.” Or something. And these folks could not be any more hypocritical.

Back in 2024, Democrats were also screeching about “saving democracy” from Donald Trump, only to oust a sitting president from the nomination and install Kamala Harris without one single vote from the public, Soviet-style. Democrats cheered the lawfare and weaponization of the justice system in an effort to take down Trump before the election. They also supported taking him off state ballots in places such as Maine and Colorado. And when Trump was banned from most social media, they argued that censorship of conservatives was necessary to save the republic.

This is also the same group that overwhelmingly supports stacking the Supreme Court with liberal justices, adding two states, D.C. and Puerto Rico, and abolishing the Electoral College, defying the Founding Fathers' desire to strike a balance between large and small states. They believed in forcing people to take the COVID-19 vaccine — so much for “my body, my choice” — and masking children as young as 2 years old who were never at risk. 

In other words, to “save democracy,” the most essential parts of the Constitution need to be blown up in the name of one-party rule. Makes total sense.

And here's why these protests don't mean anything in the end: No Kings will not convert almost any Trump supporters to the other side. In fact, almost all moderates will be pushed further away from the far-left wing of the party. They don't like the prospect of a Mayor Zohran Mamdani, an antisemite and socialist, in New York. They don't like the embrace of a murder-fantasizing maniac like Jay Jones, who is looking to become the next attorney general of Virginia, which Democrats refuse to call on to drop out of the race. And moderates certainly do not like calling Trump and his supporters fascists and Nazis.

This may explain why the party is not happy with its only commonsense senator, John Fetterman (D-PA).

“I grew up in a conservative part of Pennsylvania. And I grew up, I knew, and I loved people that voted for President Trump,” he recently noted. “But they are not fascists. They're not Nazis. They're not trying to destroy the Constitution and those things.”

One day after making this pragmatic comment, Axios reported that Democrats have turned Democrats on him over his softened approach to Trump and are courting candidates to primary him in his next Senate reelection effort in 2028.

The party has learned nothing after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, instead opting to continue the fascist/Nazi rhetoric, which has resulted in some protesters openly cheering Kirk's death and even mocking it.

“Charlie Kirk is a piece of garbage,” one female protester told the Daily Signal in Washington on Saturday. “Hitler is dead. I'm glad Hitler's dead. Evil people have no place in my world. He was a hateful human being. It was disgusting the things he said and did.”

And what was disgusting was that a Chicago elementary school teacher, Lucy Martinez, simulated Kirk getting shot in the neck in a video that has now been viewed millions of times. 

“Let's go to when [Trump] shoots himself in the bunker,” read another No Kings sign in reference to Hitler taking his own life as Allied troops were closing in on his bunker in Berlin at the end of World War II. “You gotta grab a gun, we gotta turn around the guns on this fascist system. These ICE agents gotta get shot and wiped out. The same machinery that's on full display right there has to get wiped out,” shouted an unidentified speaker at a No Kings rally in Chicago. 

And in Portland, one woman shared that she hoped to see “the obituary that we're all waiting for tomorrow,” and confirmed to a reporter she was speaking about Trump. 

So what were these protests really about? What was the goal? That's about as clear as mud, because the whole theme of No Kings, as if we live in a country ruled by one, makes zero sense. 

Trump was duly elected. In the Electoral College, it wasn't even close over Kamala Harris (312-226). He won the popular vote as well. He can't run for a third term. And if Trump were actually a king, protests would not be permitted. 

We're hearing that these protests will hurt Trump, but his numbers keep going up during a government shutdown that Democrats are responsible for. The RealClearPolitics average of polls has him at 45.4% approval, which is higher than Obama's at this stage of his second term (43.7%) and George W. Bush's (39.7%). Compare that with the Democratic Party, which stands at just 34.7% approval. 

Popular podcaster host Joe Rogan, a former supporter of Bernie Sanders, summed up the makeup of the people who attended No Kings protests. 

“All those people that are protesting on the streets, 99% of them are losers,” Rogan said. “The other ones work for the Fed. It's FBI agents and losers, it's all it is. The whole f***ing protest is FBI agents and losers.”

Trump echoed Rogan on Air Force One on Sunday night.

“I'm not a king. I work my ass off to make our country great. That's all it is. I'm not a king at all,” Trump told reporters. “I looked at the people — they're not representative of this country.” 

No Kings held its first protest in June. Lots of hype, lots of analysis saying it was a turning point in the resistance against Trump. We're hearing the same thing about the protests this past weekend. 

But here we are, just a few days later, and they're already forgotten. The Democratic Party still is a rudderless ship with no important issue they can rally around and explain why.  

Resisting Trump probably felt good for No Kings attendees. Maybe they feel like they're making a difference, just as they did in the '60s when opposing Vietnam. 

NO KINGS IS THE DUMBEST PROTEST IN THE TRUMP ERA

The difference now, of course, is that speaking out against a pointless war had teeth. “No Kings” simply has a silly slogan fueled by blind hatred for a duly elected president.

The Department of Homeland Security posted a video on its social media on Monday that showed a participant at a “No Kings” rally calling for the shooting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

The unidentified man was at the rally in Chicago, according to the DHS social media posts. 

“You gotta grab a gun, we gotta turn around the guns on this fascist system,” the man yelled into a microphone. “These ICE agents gotta get shot and wiped out. The same machinery that's on full display right there has to get wiped out.”

The man's comments come less than a month after a sniper tried to shoot and kill ICE officers at a facility in Dallas in September and less than six weeks after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was assassinated during an event at Utah Valley University. 

The video was referred to the Justice Department, according to the DHS social media. 

“This rioter and his statements have been referred to the DOJ,” read the DHS post. “There is no place in America for psychotic incitements of unlawful violence against ICE or CBP.”

DHS warned that anyone who threatened violence against law enforcement officers would be held accountable.

“To those who threaten violence against us: we will hunt you down, we will find you, and Justice will be served,” DHS said. 

Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) condemned the protester's words in a statement on X. She also identified him as an employee at Wilbur Wright College and categorized his remarks as a “criminal threat.”

“Sickening,” Miller said. “A staff member at Wilbur Wright College is calling for ICE agents to get ‘shot' and ‘wiped out.'”

What the man who has Trump's ear learned in prison

The adult-education program at Federal Correctional Institution Danbury needed a civics teacher. Conveniently, a new prisoner with a history of intimate involvement in American politics—inmate No. 05635-509—needed a work assignment. And that is how Steve Bannon, the man who stood accused of helping orchestrate an effort to undermine American democracy and to overturn a presidential election, found himself on the federal payroll making 25 cents an hour teaching civics to fellow convicts.

Bannon's class met up to five days a week, with as many as 50 inmates showing up for the sessions. Whether that impressive attendance had more to do with Bannon's lectures or the sweltering summer heat is anyone's guess—the classes were held in one of the only buildings at Danbury with air-conditioning. In class, he taught the story of the American founding, referencing both The Federalist Papers and the writings of the anti-Federalists who believed that the Constitution gave the federal government too much power. His lesson plans described how the growth of what Bannon calls the administrative state betrayed America's founding principles. After one class on the evils of the Federal Reserve and the national debt, Bannon says one of his convict students raised his hand to ask, “And they say we're the criminals?”

The 70-year-old former chief strategist for Donald Trump had been found guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress. His crime: defying a subpoena and refusing to cooperate with the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. For four months, he would be housed in a two-story cellblock with 83 other men, all of whom shared two showers. Bannon's willingness to serve time rather than cave to Nancy Pelosi cemented his status as a towering figure in the MAGA movement. “I am proud to go to prison” if that's what it takes “to stand up to tyranny,” he'd told reporters on the day he showed up to serve his sentence.

Danbury is not the kind of prison where you would typically find someone like Bannon. But because he had another pending legal issue—he later pled guilty to one felony-fraud count in New York related to a fundraising campaign—he could not be sent to one of the minimum-security prisons, sometimes referred to as “Club Fed,” where inmates live relatively comfortably. Bannon wants you to know that he was locked up with hardened criminals in a real prison.

From the July/August 2022 issue: American Rasputin

Just a couple of weeks after his release, I sat down with Bannon in the cluttered living room of his townhouse on Capitol Hill. We spoke for nearly three hours about his time in prison. It was a dialogue that started with a phone call the day he was released, in late October 2024, and continued over dozens of telephone interviews as the former inmate resumed his role as one of Trump's most important outside advisers. As we talked about Trump's return to power, our conversations often came back to Bannon's experience behind bars.

“I wasn't in a camp like that pussy Cohen,” Bannon told me, referring to Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen. Danbury is, in Bannon's words, “a rough place”—“a fucking low-medium security with gangbangers and fucking drugs and stabbings.” Soon after he arrived, he told me he saw a group of inmates “take a shiv out and fucking rip a guy.” There was “blood everywhere.” When police officers asked Bannon what he'd seen, he refused to tell them anything. “You just can't,” he said. “You answer any question a cop asks you, and you're done.” He was eager, though, to tell me about the “murderers, fuckin' mob hitmen, who were my besties.”

Among the prison's few amenities is a small room with three TVs—“a Spanish TV, a white TV, and a Black TV”—behind a glass barrier; inmates can use handheld radios to listen to the TV of their choice. One evening in July, all three were tuned to the same channel, to the reports from a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Bannon had been in the computer room when a guy raced down to get him: “Hey, boss,” the inmate said. “Trump shot.”

“What?”

“Trump shot.”

Bannon had long feared that something like this would happen. I had spoken to him weeks before his prison sentence began, and he told me the only way Trump wouldn't return to the White House was if the election was stolen or he was assassinated. “I'm very worried,” Bannon said. The Democrats, the media, “they're giving moral justification that whoever takes [Trump] out is a hero.” In a speech that summer, he warned a crowd in Detroit, at a conference sponsored by Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA, that “between now and Election Day, they're going to try to take out so many people.” It was, he predicted, “victory or death!”

Now, watching the news through the protective glass, he was convinced his fears were coming true. The Secret Service had failed to protect Trump. A gunman had taken a shot at him. Bannon watched as a blood-flecked Trump stood up and shouted, “Fight! Fight!” Had Bannon not been in prison, he would have immediately taken to the airwaves to amplify that message.

At the time, I had one thought: America is lucky that Steve Bannon is behind bars.

For as long as Bannon has been in Trump's orbit, he has been the voice channeling the anti-establishment rage at the heart of the MAGA movement, preaching a no-compromise, screw-your-opponents, tear-down-the-institutions approach to politics. He used his post as “chief strategist” in the first Trump presidency to go after Republicans inside and outside the White House who were unwilling to do what was necessary for Trump to transform Washington. Bannon kept a list of Trump's major campaign promises on a whiteboard in his West Wing office. After seven months, only a few items were checked off, and Bannon was fired. The truly radical Trump presidency would come later.

Bannon wasn't out of Trump's good graces for long, though. And unlike many of Trump's allies, he did not waver in his support after the failed attempt to overturn the election. In fact, he became even more devoted, building his video podcast, War Room—the twice-daily dose of resentment and retribution for Trump supporters—into the center of the MAGA-media ecosystem. The show guided hard-core Trump supporters through all of the state election recounts in early 2021 and helped spread the bonkers theory that the former president could be reinstated before the next election. The plan to oust Kevin McCarthy from the speakership in 2023 had been largely hatched on Bannon's show. Trump himself was a regular viewer. At least once, Bannon interrupted an interview to answer his phone. “Hey, Mr. President,” he said. “I'm live on TV; can I call you back?”

Bannon lined up an eclectic group of about 20 guest hosts—including his daughter Maureen, Rudy Giuliani's son, and Osama Bin Laden's niece—to keep the podcast going while he was behind bars. “I'm not a journalist. I'm not in the media,” Bannon said shortly before going to prison. “This is a military headquarters for a populist revolt. This is how we motivate people. This show is an activist show. If you watch this show, you're a foot soldier. We call it the Army of the Awakened.”

But even while he was imprisoned, he found ways to wield his influence. One of the first things I talked with Bannon about after his release was the assassination attempt. If Trump had shown up to the convention declaring, “‘Fuck them, they tried to kill me,' I think the country would have been on fire,” I told Bannon. “He calmed it down.”

“He calmed it down, yes,” Bannon replied.

“But you would have been fanning the flames.”

“Throwing fucking gasoline on it. Fuck yes!” Bannon shot back. “I would have revved that thing up to a 10.”

And, he added, cryptically: “I'm not saying I didn't make that recommendation through code.”

Through code?

Yes, Bannon had a way of getting messages to the Trump campaign—and to Trump himself—while he was behind bars.

In prison, Bannon spent as much time as he could in the computer room, using one of the four PCs—equipped with a two-decade-old Windows operating system—that were shared by the 84 prisoners in his cellblock. He would sign up to use the computers for an hour, and then, after a 15-minute break, sign up again. Bannon was cognizant of “prison etiquette” about not hogging the computers, but said that he would sometimes spend 10 hours a day “working on campaign stuff.”

David A. Graham: What to cheer about in the sentencing of Steve Bannon

The devices were not connected to the internet, but he could communicate via email with a few dozen preapproved individuals. The Bureau of Prisons would review the correspondence on its way in and on its way out. His daughter Maureen, whom he calls Mo, and his chief financial officer, Grace Chong, helped him keep up with the news. “They had a system of sending me, first off, all polling data, everything like that, analytics,” he remembered. “They would send it to me, and I'd be able to comment and ask questions.” They also sent him images of various news websites so he could see what stories were online even though he didn't have direct access to the internet. “I'd have 50 stories. I couldn't click on the stories, but I said, ‘Send me boom, boom, boom.' And they'd cut and paste and drop it in there.”

Bannon claims that an investigative officer at Danbury—an official he described as “pure MAGA”—had warned him that his communications were being reviewed by “Main Justice,” otherwise known as the Biden administration. So he developed a coded system to let “the girls” know which messages were to be passed on to Trump or to those around him, in particular the aide Boris Epshteyn: “I had just a system to get to Boris, kind of in quasi-code, through Mo into Grace,” he said. Was there literally a code word? “Well, we had—” he began, before catching himself. “I don't—the Bureau of Prisons could go back through it. We had a way that they could get to him.”

And in the days following the assassination attempt, Bannon let campaign officials know that he believed they were making a huge mistake by trying to reduce tensions rather than raise them.

“Trump's going to be Trump. You're not going to have that ‘unity,'” he remembered saying. “What you're going to do is blow a huge opportunity to differentiate yourself. And quite frankly, throw down harder that they tried to assassinate him. Put it back on them. Get into the thing about the lax security. Double down, triple down on this. It's a winner.”

Fortunately, the campaign disregarded the advice. As Bannon watched speaker after speaker at the convention praise Trump's message of unity, he found himself growing angrier and angrier. “I hated the convention,” Bannon told me. “The kumbaya, the cancellation of all the guys who wanted to get up there to fucking throw fucking fists.”

“If I had been around, that would have never happened,” he said. “Ever.”

Though much of Bannon's attention for those four months was focused on the world outside Danbury, he said he learned a lot in prison.

“You can actually get a sense of where the country is in prison,” he told me. “Every Hispanic and Black family in America has someone they know that's incarcerated; that's just the reality. It may not be their son, but it's a cousin, or nephew, or a next-door neighbor. These mass incarcerations are out of control for nonviolent drug charges.”

Bannon wanted me to know he didn't hang out just with the other nonviolent offenders. One of his closest prison buddies was an Italian guy named Vito—”the single biggest Trump fan you've ever seen,” Bannon told me. “He could literally quote” Trump's speeches.

Vito is a reputed member of the Columbo crime family named Vito Guzzo. He had been locked up for nearly three decades after pleading guilty to five murders and several other crimes, including arson, racketeering, and attempted murder. When he pleaded guilty in 1998, the judge asked him to describe his crimes. He did so with no emotion. “I killed Ralph Sciulla by shooting him in the head,” he said, reading from a piece of paper. “I killed Anthony Mesi by shooting him. I shot John Borrelli.”

Vito has been a free man since April. Bannon helped him get an early release—after serving 26 years of his 38-year sentence—through the First Step Act, the criminal-justice-reform bill signed into law by Trump in 2018.

A friend captured on video the moment Vito walked out of Danbury—swaggering in a white Sergio Tacchini tracksuit, pristine tennis shoes, and dark sunglasses, his hair slicked back.

“Come on,” Vito can be heard saying as he gives his girlfriend a hug. “Let's get out of here.”

Vito's girlfriend sent the video to Bannon, who watched with gleeful pride at his friend's composure. “That guy is so impressive,” Bannon told me. “Look at that guy's tracksuit; look at the shoes; look at the hair.” Nearly three decades behind bars and he “walks out, totally precise. These guys amaze me.”

Bannon had been a critic of the First Step Act—it was one of the only things he disagreed with Trump about. The initiative, which sought to improve conditions in prison and to give inmates more opportunities for education and early release, had been pushed by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom Bannon often clashed with. Now Bannon had come around. “Jared was a genius about this. It is our ticket to a massive coalition,” Bannon told me. “Remember, in Spartacus the slave revolt starts in a prison, right?”

(Though Bannon expressed what seemed to be genuine concern for the treatment of the inmates he got to know at Danbury, his compassion for the accused was far from consistent. He had only praise for the Trump administration for flying two planeloads of alleged Venezuelan gang members, without the benefit of a hearing or reasonable notice, to the CECOT prison in El Salvador—a place that actually resembles hell on Earth. “Guess what, if there are some innocent gardeners in there? Hey, tough break for a swell guy,” Bannon said on War Room in March.)

Bannon's time in Danbury convinced him that Trump was going to win again. In his view, he told me in October, Kamala Harris was doomed by her record as a prosecutor in California. “No Black or Hispanic men are going to vote for Kamala Harris, because of the mass incarcerations,” he told me. “The Black community, the Hispanic community, they literally hate her.” Prison, he said, “is the most MAGA place I've ever been in my life, from the minorities.” (According to a Navigator Research postelection survey, Harris won 49 percent of the Hispanic-male vote and 71 percent of the Black-male vote. Directionally, though, Bannon's broader point stands: Joe Biden did 35 percentage points better than Harris among both groups in 2020.)

But the main thing Bannon learned in prison is that he doesn't want to go back there. He was released on October 29, at 3 a.m.—because prison authorities wanted to avoid the commotion of a press conference. As he walked out of the prison gate, he was met by Maureen, who ran over and gave him a hug. It was exactly one week before the 2024 election, and within hours of his release—before 6 a.m.—Bannon's phone lit up. Donald Trump was on the line.

“My Steeeeeeve! My Steeeeeve!” Trump said as they both laughed. “You're a convict.” The former president had lots of questions for Bannon about his life behind bars. If Trump lost the election the following week, there was a very real chance that he would end up in prison. How bad was it?

“Let me be blunt,” Bannon told Trump. “It's hard as shit. So we're not going there.”

Trump didn't go to prison, obviously; he went back to the White House. And his second term is proving to be far more consequential, more radical, and more lasting than his first.

He has put his personal legal team in charge of the Justice Department, squeezed top law firms to do his bidding, and upended a half century's worth of ethics and anti-corruption reforms by mixing family business deals with government business. He is attempting to use the Federal Communications Commission to police and punish television networks that he says treat him unfairly and is pressuring U.S. attorney's offices to prosecute his political enemies.

Trump hasn't always taken Bannon's advice on policy, but Trump's brazen attack on norms and on his real and perceived enemies is exactly what Bannon has been preaching. From his powerful post on War Room, Bannon is pushing the aggrieved president to use his power to not just defeat his enemies but destroy them, and Trump is pursuing that agenda to a much greater degree than he did the first time around.

The unity talk Bannon so despises is gone completely. Two days after the killing of Charlie Kirk, Bannon attacked Republicans who were calling for people to turn down the partisan rhetoric. Bannon hated it when Governor Spencer Cox stepped forward the day Kirk was killed and said we had to “stop hating our fellow Americans.”

“We're not gonna say it's a time to bring people together,” Bannon told the foot soldiers of the MAGA movement. “You know why? One side has to win here.”

At times, Trump still turns to Bannon for guidance, as if he were working down the hall from the Oval Office. Case in point: Bannon's previously unreported role in the events leading up to President Trump's remarkable confrontation with Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House in February.

On Monday of that week, President Trump convened his top national security advisers in his dining room adjacent to the Oval Office. It was a busy time. French President Emmanuel Macron had just met with Trump, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due soon. Both were pleading with Trump to continue military support for Ukraine and its president. Zelensky himself would be coming to Washington in a few days, though the visit had not yet been announced.

Trump's advisers had worked out an agreement with their Ukrainian counterparts whereby, in exchange for continued military support, Ukraine would promise the United States a share in the development of its natural resources, including its deposits of rare-earth minerals. But as Trump reviewed the draft agreement, he didn't like what he saw, believing the terms were not favorable enough to the United States. He looked out at the most important officials in his administration: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Vice President J. D. Vance. Then he turned to Waltz:

“Get Steve Bannon on the phone.”

Bannon saw Waltz calling and sent him to voicemail with a text: “The show is live. I'll call you at noon.” A few minutes later, his phone rang again. This time he could see it was Trump calling from his personal cellphone. Bannon quickly went to commercial break, telling his producer to make it a long one.

“Yes, Mr. President.”

“Hey, Steve, I've got the boys here,” Trump said. “I'm going to put you on speaker.”

For the next 30 minutes, Trump had Bannon tell his national-security team, through the little iPhone speaker, why he didn't like the deal and why he didn't trust the Ukrainian leader.

“I hear you don't love this deal,” Trump said.

“I fucking hate it,” Bannon said. “I hate everything to do with it.” He said he understood that Trump wanted to recoup the $350 billion that he estimated the U.S. had spent on Ukraine. But the deal “ties us to Ukraine.” Bannon, who knew there had been talk of a Zelensky meeting, referred to the Ukrainian president as “that punk”: “If that punk comes here, he's going to want a security guarantee,” Bannon said. “You can't trust him. You can't trust any of the Europeans. You can't trust Putin either, but these guys are really slippery.”

Read: A man who actually stands up to Trump

The rest of the saga surrounding Zelensky's visit to Washington is an extraordinary piece of U.S. history, and there's little doubt that Bannon's advice set the tone for the coming conflict.

“You're not in a good position,” Trump told Zelensky, his voice rising. “You don't have the cards right now.”

“I'm not playing cards,” Zelensky interrupted.

“You're playing cards,” Trump shot back. “You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III.”

“What are you speaking about?” Zelensky asked.

“You're gambling with World War III,” Trump repeated. “And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”

It was the kind of tough-guy language that would make a mob hitman proud.

For nearly a century, America had helped keep peace in Europe, standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies against aggressors. But there in the Oval Office, Trump was doing more than berating an American ally; he was declaring to the world that America was no longer the country that, in John F. Kennedy's words, would “pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.” Now a U.S. president was showing an ally the true meaning of “America First.”

Trump's final words before the cameras left the Oval Office made clear that, although Trump was angry, he was also enjoying himself. “All right, I think we've seen enough,” Trump said to the shocked reporters in the room. “What do you think? This is going to be great television. I will say that.”

Great television, perhaps, but, thanks in part to Trump's favorite convict, Trump is now doing far more than playing to the television cameras. He's changing America in ways that will long outlive his presidency.

Palestinians in Gaza know that they'll never return to the life they once had.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

We are a few days into something called a cease-fire. Can we even say that— “a few days into a cease-fire”? For Palestinians in Gaza, the words feel strange on the tongue. Perhaps they are supposed to connote peace, relief, and the chance to take a breath after months of suffocation. Yet I feel none of those things. I don't even feel that the war has stopped.

By now we should be experts on cease-fires. We've lived through many cycles of war and cessation. And yet I don't know what to feel. “New chapter,” I say to myself. I imagine a director with a clapboard calling, “Scene three!”—but at this point I've lost count of the takes.

I'm not alone in this unease. Among my friends and relatives, no one seems to trust this peace. We fear that it will shatter, as the agreements before it have.

Two years of war is a long time. Wounds don't heal, but fester. Hardly anyone remembers what normal feels like. Technically, the fighting has paused, but we still hear the same sounds, feel the same fear, the same absence of everything familiar. Maybe, my sister-in-law suggested to me, this is why we don't feel relief or a sense of safety: because we know that whatever comes next will not be a return to the life we had.

Life doesn't restart—it stumbles forward, uncertain and bruised. At moments like this, I think of an old Arabic saying: “The drunk has sobered, and the thought has come.” During the war, we had no time to think. The only focus was survival, hour by hour, moving from one place to another under bombardment, looking for food, water, medicine, cash, a place to exist. In such circumstances, thoughts, dreams, plans—even grief—collapse into a single instinct.

Graeme Wood: One era ends in Gaza, and another begins

With a cease-fire, the thinking returns, and with it, pain. One of my childhood friends, Shaima, was killed in an Israeli air strike along with her three children. So were her two brothers, one of them with his wife and their four children. Shaima and I studied together for eight years. Her family had the only Ping-Pong table in our neighborhood, and she used to try to teach me to play. She was a master. I never learned, but she did teach me to skip rope like a pro. We'd laugh until we fell over.

Days after Shaima was killed, her mother, in Egypt, died grieving. Many Gazans are still searching for missing loved ones whose names appear on no lists. No one knows whether these people are alive, buried under rubble, detained, or dead.

The sky over Gaza may be silent, but Shaima is still gone. A cease-fire is a moment to count the dead.

Gaza's streets are all rubble. Barely a house stands. The landscape itself feels erased. People say it will take many months just to clear the debris, and longer still to restore water, electricity, even a single functioning road. We've lived through this work before—years of halting reconstruction efforts that were never truly completed. But what we face now feels different. We've lost schools, hospitals, the streets themselves, the very veins of the city. All of our civil infrastructure has been ground to dust.

Across Gaza, education has been displaced into makeshift tents or broken classrooms, where teachers try to piece together lessons between interruptions. The lack of electricity and stable internet connection make online learning all but impossible. The rhythm of a school day—waking up early, putting on a uniform, hearing the morning bell—has become a memory from another lifetime.

I've watched my 20-year-old nephew, named after my father, sink into quiet grief. He was supposed to be in his Tawjihi year, the final stage of high school; he once dreamed of studying engineering. Instead, he has been displaced again and again, carrying his books with him, the one thing he refuses to leave behind. Sometimes he lends them to other students who lost theirs under the rubble. The Ministry of Education attempted to resume exams at one point. He went, more out of habit than hope. How can anyone study when life itself is on hold?

Even health care has been suspended. My 14-year-old niece has been waiting to get braces for nearly a year. Few dentists remain open in Gaza, and the materials for braces are scarce. No one knows whether the necessary parts are still available. We are living in war mode, where fixing a smile or a tooth no longer feels like a priority.

For young people in Gaza, time has stopped. The future hangs suspended in a place without continuity or promise.

People often say here that a cease-fire marks another kind of war—not of weapons, but of suffering. The war of the mind. The war of loss. The war of remembering. The war of reconstruction. A cease-fire means entering a fragile limbo between survival and recovery.

Sometimes during the first cease-fire this past winter, I would catch myself thinking, When the war ends, I will do this. Then I would pause—wasn't this supposed to be the end?

These days, my mind still whispers, When the war ends—as though the war is continuing inside me, even after the noise of the air strikes outside has stopped.

Israel's extremists aren't giving up on settling Gaza. Trump's regional agenda depends on restraining them.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Donald Trump arrived in Israel last week to celebrate his Gaza agreement, Israelis of all stripes fell over themselves to thank him for his efforts to end the war and bring hostages home. The Knesset was lit up in red, white, and blue; its members gave the president a two-and-a-half-minute standing ovation when he arrived. A Tel Aviv beach was decorated with a giant silhouette of his face. Isaac Herzog, Israel's president, announced that Trump would be awarded the country's Presidential Medal of Honor, its highest civilian commendation. But one notable person didn't join the festivities. In fact, she boycotted them.

The day before, Limor Son Har-Melech, a far-right member of Parliament, had declared that she was “not interested in joining the applause” and announced that she would not attend the president's Knesset speech. “President Trump presented the current deal as a peace agreement,” she wrote. “It is not. It is a shameful agreement.” Har-Melech's outrage was sharp but not surprising. Since October 7, 2023, she had been one of the chief advocates for the Israeli resettlement of Gaza. Just two months after the Hamas massacre, she said she told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that “the only image of victory in this war is that we will see Jewish homes in Gaza. Victory will be when we see the children of Israel playing in the streets of Gaza.”

Polls showed that most Israelis opposed this land-grabbing plan. But Netanyahu was beholden for his political future to the radical minority that supported it, and constantly catered to their whims. As the war in Gaza dragged on, and Israel plunged deeper into the Palestinian territory, the settler right appeared poised to obtain its prize. Trump called to “clean out” Gaza and relocate its population to make way for a “Riviera of the Middle East.” Nearly two dozen lawmakers in Netanyahu's coalition signed a letter to Israel's defense minister urging him to permit activists into Gaza itself to scout possible settlement locations.

The pieces were falling into place. That is, until Trump halted the war and imposed a peace plan that explicitly rejected any Israeli territorial designs on Gaza.

It wasn't supposed to go this way. When Trump was reelected, members of the Israeli right rejoiced, believing that he would happily facilitate their aspirations. Instead, he has begun to frustrate them. The first blow came on September 25, when the president categorically ruled out any attempt to extend Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, which Palestinians claim for their future state. “I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “It's not gonna happen.” The president's Arab allies had made clear that annexation could shatter the Abraham Accords forged in Trump's first term; faced with the potential unraveling of one of his signature achievements, the president acted quickly to curb the Israeli right's ambitions.

That intervention turned out to be just a prelude. Four days later, Trump unveiled his 20-point plan for ending the Gaza war—and punted on his prior proposal to cleanse Gaza of Palestinians. “Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough,” read point No. 2. “No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return,” added point 12. “We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.” Trump then proceeded to bully both Hamas and Netanyahu into accepting this agreement.

No wonder Har-Melech and her allies were angry. Just days before, they'd appeared ascendant. Now, thanks to Trump, they were the skunks at the party, watching the public celebrate peace without any thought of settling Gaza. While the war was at full tilt, Har-Melech's minority settler faction had been able to exercise outsize influence over Netanyahu's decision making, deepening Israel's entanglement in Gaza. As soon as the conflict began to wind down, so did the faction's ability to shape events.

But although Trump may have momentarily stuffed the far right into a locker, it will slink out as soon as he turns his attention elsewhere. “There will be Jewish settlements in Gaza,” vowed Bezalel Smotrich, a powerful far-right minister in Netanyahu's government, the day after Trump's victory speech in Israel. “We have patience,” he went on, “we have determination and faith, and with God's help, we will continue the series of victories, and the big miracles.” On Sunday, two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, and the army responded with air strikes. Smotrich gleefully posted one word on X before the shaky cease-fire was reestablished: “War!” The settler movement did not get where it is by giving up; its activists excel at exploiting every opening.

Trump's Gaza plan presents many such openings. According to the agreement, in the early stages of the current deal, Israel will remain in control of much of Gaza's uninhabited territory until Hamas is disarmed and displaced. These are precisely the areas that the far right hopes to settle and even annex to Israel. Hamas is dragging its feet on releasing the bodies of dead Israeli hostages, publicly executing Palestinians opposed to its rule, and showing no sign that it intends to give up its weapons. The Israeli army and Hamas are still skirmishing along the cease-fire line. Even if none of this is enough to capsize the accord, it will likely delay further implementation and provide a window for the settlers and their political allies to try to insinuate themselves into those parts of Gaza.

Only Trump can stop this from happening—at least until Israel holds new elections next year that could boot Netanyahu and his partners from power. The president can pressure Hamas's patrons in Qatar and Turkey to compel the group to disarm, and he can strong-arm Netanyahu into preventing settler spoilers from upending the fragile peace. What Netanyahu wants is not this peace deal or avaricious annexations, but to stay in power. And he will make whatever choice seems most likely to keep him there.

Like other political leaders with an exaggerated sense of their own importance, Netanyahu perceives himself as indispensable, and his leadership as the only thing standing between his country and catastrophe. Equating his personal interest with the national interest, he justifies every reversal and betrayal of past principles as necessary for Israel's survival. Such compromised leadership is perilous for Israel, but advantageous for Trump: As Netanyahu's only consequential friend on the international stage, the U.S. president has immense sway over the Israeli leader's choices. Left alone, Netanyahu will act however his coalition tells him to, but countermanded by Trump, he will have different incentives.

The truth is, Israel does not and has never needed Netanyahu to survive; it needs to survive Netanyahu. How Trump chooses to treat the Israeli premier and his far-right coalition will determine not just whether the president's peace plan will succeed, but whether Israel will succeed in outlasting its extremist minoritarian government.

Madagascar is reeling from political unrest. But there's another problem that no one's talking about.

Photography by Garth Cripps for Vox

BAY OF RANOBE, Madagascar — The coral reef itself was exquisite. Growing about 3 miles offshore in 50 feet of water, it was a rugged terrain of pinks, blues, and oranges, set against a backdrop of deep blue. The coral pieces, each a colony of living animals, took on a range of unusual forms, from cake platters and pencil shavings to antlers and brains.

But there was one obvious thing missing: fish. Like a city without people, the reef was mostly empty — not only of fish, but also of crabs, eels, and other typical marine life on a coral reef.

It was a sunny morning in September, and I was diving on a coral reef in southwest Madagascar, an island nation that sits east of continental Africa. And like many reefs in the region and across much of the world, it's on the verge of collapse. Overfishing has emptied the ocean here of fish, which over time will allow algae to take over and outcompete the corals. The increasing intensity of marine heat waves and cyclones, along with inland deforestation, also threatens the country's reefs, which are among the most biologically diverse in the world.

This is a major problem for people along the coast of southwest Madagascar. Their livelihood depends on fishing — catching marine critters is an essential, and often the only, source of food and income — yet as the reef collapses, so does the fishery. The reef is where fish sleep, eat, and hide from predators, and without it, they struggle to survive. It's a complicated situation: The health and well-being of people along the coast depends on fishing, yet too much fishing is a key reason why the reef, and the fishery it supports, is in decline.

Over the next few weeks, Vox is publishing a three-part series on conservation in Madagascar, supported by the BAND Foundation. This is part one.

This tension between human and wildlife survival is not unique to the coasts of southwest Madagascar. The island, home to about 33 million people, is among the poorest of poor nations, with some 80 percent of its population living on less than the equivalent of $2.15 a day. People often have no choice but to depend directly on ecosystems to meet their basic needs.

The government, meanwhile, has failed to provide even the most basic services like reliable electricity and water, let alone a pathway out of poverty and dependency on exploitation. That failure fueled weeks of youth-led protests this fall in Madagascar, where the median age is around 20. In response, Parliament impeached the president on October 14 and the military seized control of the government. What that power shift means for Madagascar, and for a generation demanding change, remains unclear.

Under the sheer weight of human need, it's no surprise, then, that many of the country's iconic ecosystems are failing, too. Research suggests that since the turn of the century the country has lost as much as half of its live coral cover, and a similar extent of native forest. Nearly every species of lemur, a type of animal that you can only find in Madagascar, is now threatened with extinction.

The government and nonprofit groups have spent decades — and hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid — trying to address these challenges, often relying on traditional environmental approaches, like setting up reserves that restrict fishing. But what Madagascar shows is that conservation projects don't usually work when they make it harder for desperately poor people to make a living. That may seem obvious, but it's one reason why many environmental projects have failed in the world's biodiversity hotspots, which are commonly found in poor nations.

Places like Madagascar underscore the need for a different conservation approach — one that truly centers people, and what they need to live healthy and fulfilling lives. That's what ultimately brought me to the Bay of Ranobe, where I spent a week in September. Guided by fishers and a team of international researchers, a small organization is trying to restore the fishery and the food it provides, without actually restricting fishing. The goal of the project is to help people. Conservation is just a byproduct.

The ocean was calm and flecked with sails when I arrived one morning at the beach in Ambolimailaky, a fishing village in the Bay of Ranobe. The sails — often made of discarded rice bags stitched together — propelled fishermen to shore in wooden canoes known as pirogues.

As the fishermen neared the beach, I saw jumbles of mosquito nets in some of their boats. In Madagascar and elsewhere in Africa, it's not uncommon for fishermen to repurpose mosquito nets — which are often donated by aid organizations to protect against malaria — to catch fish.

The fishermen showed me what they caught. Some of them had buckets of small anchovies that moved like liquid silver. Others had a bin filled up halfway with reef fish like triggerfish, lionfish, parrotfish, and baby barracudas. A group of young kids put a few that were still alive, including a clownfish, into a metal bowl to play with. A pair of school-age boys showed me a plastic bucket with a dozen juvenile octopuses they caught. The tentacles were tangled together and partially submerged in ink.

As someone from the US who doesn't fish, I felt unsettled in the face of so many dead and dying creatures. I normally encounter reef fish and octopuses in aquariums, on snorkel trips, or in the marketing materials for conservation groups. But fishermen here have a different relationship with them — and for a very good reason.

In the Bay of Ranobe, fishing is the primary source of income and a vital source of nutrition in coastal villages, according to Aroniaina “Aro” Manampitahiana Falinirina, a doctoral researcher who studies fisheries at the University of Toliara's marine research institute, IHSM. It's how people pay for food, school supplies, and transportation. And among certain communities — namely, the Vezo, an ethnic group with deep ancestral ties to the sea — fishing has been a way of life for generations.

Speaking through an interpreter, Nambokely, one of the fishermen I met on the beach, told me that if he doesn't fish, he doesn't eat.

Fishermen in the Bay of Ranobe work around the clock to support their families.

One evening, just after the sun had slipped below the horizon, I boated out on the water with a few researchers who study coral reefs and fisheries. The ocean's surface was full of bioluminescent microorganisms that lit up as the bow of our skiff cut through the waves. It was as if we were riding on fairy dust.

But the main light show was underwater. Once we were farther offshore, beams of light appeared below the waves, moving erratically in all directions — night fishermen. The fishermen spot their prey using waterproof torches, sometimes made by wrapping ordinary flashlights in a few condoms.

After surfacing with an eel on his spear, one fisherman, a Vezo man named Jean Batiste, told me he fishes at night because he can catch more compared to during the day.

Yet as Batiste said — and as every fisher I spoke to in the Bay of Ranobe repeated — it's becoming harder and harder to catch anything, and thus harder and harder to earn a living. “I'm worried,” Batiste told me that night on the water.

The fishery in the Bay of Ranobe, and across much of southwest Madagascar, is in decline, and perhaps even collapsing. A number of studies from the region show that fishermen are catching fewer fish, and fewer fish species, compared to three or four decades ago. Some species — including certain kinds of parrotfish, which can help limit the growth of coral-harming algae — have disappeared altogether from some areas. “It's decreasing at a rate that has never been seen before,” said Gildas Todinanahary, a marine researcher and the director of IHSM.

The fish people are catching are also smaller, indicating that fishermen may be netting more juveniles — a clear sign of overfishing. If the adults and the juveniles are fished out, there's nothing left to spawn the next generation.

“People can't get enough food in one day.”

A single fisherman was once able to earn, on a good day, around $10 or $15 in one outing, Nambokely told me. But today, groups of four or five fishermen will spend several hours on the water and might only catch enough to fill half a plastic wash basin with fish. That's worth about $5 to $10, they told me, which they then have to split among themselves. A dozen small octopuses, meanwhile, are worth only around $2.

“People can't get enough food in one day,” said Marcel Sebastian, an elderly fisherman I met in the village. He's been fishing in southwest Madagascar for more than 50 years. “They used to have lunch and dinner. But now they only have dinner due to the scarcity of fish.”

The problem isn't fishing. It's overfishing — the forces that ramp up fishing to such an extreme that the reef and the life it supports have no time to recover. That's what's happening now in southwest Madagascar. There are simply too many people fishing for the same fish.

One reason for that is climate change. Rising temperatures are contributing to prolonged droughts that make it harder to grow crops in southern Madagascar. Meanwhile, widespread deforestation — which removes trees that stabilize the soil and help water seep underground — means that when it does rain, flooding can bury farmland under sediment. Faced with failing crops inland, farmers in southern Madagascar are increasingly migrating to the coasts in search of income from fishing instead. (Inland deforestation is also sending dirt into the ocean, which can smother coral reefs.)

This climate-driven migration is causing the coastal population to swell, putting pressure on the fishery. It's hard to find reliable population estimates for the Bay of Ranobe, but a dissertation from 2019 estimated that villages here were growing at an average rate of about 4.5 percent per year, meaning the local population would roughly double in 15 years. The global average population growth rate is around 1 percent. “A lot of the time, people who are coming from inland don't want to be here,” said Quinn Mitsuko Parker, a doctoral researcher at Stanford who studies fishing communities in the Bay of Ranobe. “They don't want to be fishing. They'd rather be farming.”

But people have no choice but to fish. Even though it's no longer providing enough. Even though it's hastening the decline of the reef and the source of income it provides.



One morning, around the new moon, I went out on the water with a few fishermen at low tide. The water got deeper at first, but as we motored farther out, it became shallow again — until it was so shallow we could walk. We were on top of the barrier reef. It was a bizarre image: Here we were, in what felt like the middle of the ocean, standing in just a few inches of water.

During especially low tides, part of the reef here is exposed, and fishers — in this case, mainly women — take advantage of these conditions. They search the reef by foot for octopuses, urchins, and other critters to eat or sell, an approach known as gleaning.

At least a dozen women were gleaning when we arrived, their eyes fixed downward as they paced around. Some of them wielded spears, to stab octopuses, or large conch-like snail shells, which they use to crack open urchins.

I approached a woman named Doseline, who wore mismatched sneakers and a wide-brimmed hat. As we talked, she poked a spear under rocks in search of octopuses, occasionally pausing to grab a snail and put it in her bag.

Doseline told me she's catching half as many octopuses as she did 10 or 20 years ago. And while she knows gleaning can damage the coral — most of the exposed reef is already dead, in part because fishers sometimes crush corals under their feet or break them to grab hiding octopuses — she doesn't have a choice, she said. Doseline is the sole provider for her son, who's in school, she said. “My income [from fishing] is not enough,” she told me.

For more than an hour, I watched Doseline search the reef. We stepped over spiny red sea stars and a colorful slug called a nudibranch. I found discarded shells occupied by crabs that looked like creatures from another world. Doseline, who wore her hair in pigtails, didn't have much luck. “I'm sad because I didn't catch any octopuses, so I'll go back home,” she told me.

Over the last three decades, Madagascar has attracted an enormous amount of attention from international environmental groups and foreign donors. The island's wildlife is not only charismatic — lemurs! chameleons! coral reefs! — but also unique. Because Madagascar has been isolated from other land masses for millions of years, animals there have had plenty of time to evolve into new species. Today, around 90 percent of the country's plants and animals are found nowhere else on Earth. That means if you lose them in Madagascar, you lose them everywhere.

With so much to lose, major international environmental groups ranging from Conservation International to WWF have been working for years on the island to try to curb forest loss, overfishing, and other kinds of environmental harm. And aid organizations have funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into Madagascar to help. Yet those threats are still getting worse, not better.

The main problem is poverty — the sheer demand put on the environment — which is closely linked to political unrest. But there are also serious problems with the traditional approach to conservation in Madagascar and other developing nations.

In early September, just before political protests rocked Madagascar and the government collapsed, I flew from New York City to the capital, Antananarivo. It's roughly a 24-hour journey. I then took an internal flight to the southwestern city of Toliara, where I met photographer Garth Cripps.

Cripps and I stayed in the Bay of Ranobe for about a week, where we spent most of our time talking with fishers. They showed us a range of different fishing approaches, from spear fishing at night to “gleaning” — collecting sea creatures in the shallows at low tide. Drugged up on Dramamine, I saw a pretty incredible amount of sea life, though most of it was dead.

Cripps and I also went on three dives with Reef Doctor to see both natural and artificial reefs.

Toward the end of our trip, we met University of Toliara's marine research institute (IHSM) director Gildas Todinanahary in Sarodrano — a coastal village built atop a sandbar — and went snorkeling to see some natural reefs. Todinanahary then took us to IHSM's field station, nearby, where we talked about what is (and is not) working in marine conservation.

Much of our reporting was made possible thanks to a handful of Madagascar-based translators and ground support from Reef Doctor and staff at IHSM.

Historically, environmental groups, foreign scientists, and the government in Madagascar bet big on protected areas as a means to safeguard nature, such as parks, marine protected areas, and nature reserves. The Bay of Ranobe is, for example, technically part of an official marine protected area. But as research shows, those protection schemes have done little to stop environmental harm.

“The conservation of our biodiversity through Madagascar protected areas' system for 30 years was a failure,” Madagascar's former environmental minister, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, said in 2020.

According to several environmental and development researchers I spoke to, that's because parks often don't address the reasons why people exploit nature in the first place. In some cases, they also disproportionately burden women fishers by restricting access to areas for gleaning, as Merrill Baker-Médard wrote in her book, Feminist Conservation: Politics and Power in Madagascar's Marine Commons.

Another challenge is that NGOs in Madagascar, and to an extent worldwide, are often more accountable to their donors than they are to the local community, according to Emma Gibbons, who runs Reef Doctor, a small nonprofit in the Bay of Ranobe. Donors tend to fund short-term projects and they face few consequences if projects don't actually help people or ecosystems, Gibbons said. These issues are especially pronounced in southern Madagascar, nicknamed the “cemetery of projects,” because so many of those projects — from establishing solar water pumps to beekeeping — have failed.

If there's a chance of conservation working, it has to be owned or guided by the community, rooted in a deep understanding of the local culture, and aligned with what people want, said Gibbons, a British national who's lived in Madagascar for two decades. Fishermen here certainly want to safeguard the fishery — it's their livelihood, their survival — but they can't afford to lose their fishing grounds in the process. Food security takes priority. “You can't tell people not to eat,” Gibbons said.

It's this perspective that's informed the approach Gibbons is taking now. Instead of attempting to limit fishing as some traditional conservation has tried to do, she — along with members of the community and a team of local and foreign researchers — are trying to create more places to fish.

And to do that, they're essentially building new coral reefs from scratch in the Bay of Ranobe. “Our hope is that we can increase the area that's available to fish,” Gibbons said.

Building artificial reefs is simpler than it sounds: She and her collaborators sink massive chunks of limestone offshore, forming long underwater rows of rocks that are each about 57 meters. That's roughly the length of a commercial airplane. They then “seed” those rocks with life using smaller constructions called autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) that have spent several months accumulating corals, sponges, and other marine organisms on a natural reef. Those structures, made of stacked stone plates, are basically coral reef starter packs.

So far, Reef Doctor has finished building two artificial reefs that cover about half an acre. Each of them has four rows of rocks, known as spurs, seeded with ARMS.

The sea was calm and more green than blue when I arrived by boat above one of the artificial reefs, about a mile from shore, with marine biologist Mark Little. He's studying microbes on the reef. The water was cloudy, so we could barely see the rocks below — not the most inviting conditions. But we strapped on tanks and plunged in.

As I sank down, the rows of rocks appeared dramatically through my foggy mask, as if I was descending on ruins of a lost city.

I swam up to a group of ARMS, from which fist-sized bits of coral sprouted like branches of a bonsai tree. Box fish, lionfish, and even young parrotfish — named for their bird-like beaks — crowded around them. At one point, a stingray appeared out of the murky beyond and passed right in front of me, before vanishing again. I was struck at that moment by the realization that we've damaged our environment so badly that we literally have to rebuild ecosystems we depend on from scratch. At least in this case, that approach seems to be working.

“It's doing its job,” said Little, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University and Scripps Institute of Oceanography, when we were back in the boat. “There's a lot of life.”

Over the next several years, a team of local and foreign researchers will study the impact of the artificial reefs on marine life and the fishery here — and how that, in turn, affects the physical and mental health of people in nearby villages. The study is among the largest in the world to link ecosystem health to human health, according to Chris Golden, a nutrition and global health researcher at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, who's closely involved in the project.

The purpose of this study is “to understand whether or not stewarding natural resources in this way can simultaneously benefit the ecosystem and benefit human nutrition and food security and human health,” Golden said. “We want to quantify the way that interventions like this — an environmental intervention — could be viewed as a public health intervention.”

I can't help but feel like it's just nowhere near enough. If the scale of fishing continues — or increases, as the coastal population swells — a few artificial reefs won't be able to rescue the fishery. Even scientists involved in the project understand the limitations. “Within the broader situation, it's not going to work,” said Todinanahary, who works closely with Gibbons.

Truly sustaining the reef and the fishery means providing coastal communities with other sources of income, Todinanahary told me. That means investing in education so people can learn new skills, like climate-resilient farming, and building out other non-exploitative industries. The country needs enormous, systemic change for conservation to really work. That requires good governance, and right now Madagascar hardly has a government.

But as Todinanahary points out, NGOs and aid groups have poured millions of dollars into Madagascar for environmental projects. What if those groups had, instead, put all of that money toward education or health care? Sometimes, effective conservation doesn't look like conservation at all.

Ultimately, what I saw in the Bay of Ranobe was more bleak than I had imagined. At times, it felt like watching an environmental and human crisis unfold in real time. Nonetheless, people like Gibbons, Todinanahary, and a growing number of smart Malagasy scientists are still determined to restore the fishery — because the stakes are just so high. When you're actually a part of these communities, you're accountable to them. That makes the consequences of doing nothing hard to stomach.

And it's far from futile. The reef, and the fishery it supports, could still recover. There's still life.

After diving on the artificial reef, Little and I boated to a natural reef nearby, called Vatosoa. Several years ago, Reef Doctor built a smaller artificial reef close to Vatosoa for people to fish on, and in exchange, local fishermen agreed to avoid this one, Gibbons told me.

My expectations were still low, especially after diving reefs here that had no fish. But it was spectacular. The reef was formed by a species that grows thin, curved sheets of coral in layers around each other, like petals of a rose. And there were dozens of these living structures packed in together, so it felt like we were swimming over a bouquet.

My mask kept fogging up, a deeply irritating problem that can ruin a dive. I flooded it with seawater and cleared it with bubbles a handful of times. When I could finally see clearly again, I noticed something floating in front of my face. It looked like a piece of seaweed, though it was attached to the unmistakable body of a cuttlefish, a cephalopod with eight arms and two tentacles.

Famous for its camouflage, the animal seemed to be using its arms to mimic a piece of debris. As I swam toward it, the cuttlefish reversed slowly. Moments later, perhaps after realizing it was not fooling me, it changed colors and sped off.

“The potential for recovery is still there,” Gibbons told me one evening, as we walked the beach at sunset, careful to avoid stepping on discarded spiny shells. “There's huge biodiversity within the fishery. It's not going to be there forever, but it's still, at this moment, there.”

﻿Tina Turner deserves better than this.

Last month, in Tina Turner's hometown of Brownsville, Tennessee, a bronze statue honoring the late singer was erected.

When famous people die, people want to remember them. A statue goes up, and people start remembering. The thing about the Tina Turner statue is that it is, as fans pointed out, extremely ugly and looks nothing like the not-ugly Tina Turner. Thankfully, some noted, Turner was not alive to see it.

The rest of us were not as fortunate.

Perhaps even stranger than the idea that someone thinks Tina Turner looks like that is that Turner is merely the latest victim of a bad “lifelike” statue.

Back in 2009, the town of Celoron, New York, witnessed the unveiling of a statue known colloquially as “Scary Lucy,” a figure that was supposed to honor Lucille Ball but ended up looking more like a villain from a Bavarian fairy tale whose primary purpose is to scare children. There's also the infamously crooked Cristiano Ronaldo bust from 2017 that looks like it was made by a scorned rival, rather than an admiring fan. NBA star Dwyane Wade has one too, as does the late actor James Dean.

These bad statues raise an obvious question: Why are these bronze statues so bad? And so many others: If they're bad and so many people think they're awful, who keeps making them and who keeps commissioning them? Is there a larger conspiracy at hand, perhaps a cabal of sculptors who hate Lucille Ball and Dwyane Wade? If we want to honor people we adore, why then do we keep making ugly statues of them?

Why haven't we freed ourselves from the chokehold of ugly bronze statues?

The visceral reaction to the Tina Turner statue was largely due to what people believe is misrepresentation. The Tina Turner in their minds — shaped by performances, music videos, photos, interviews, and their own experiences — did not match up with the foreboding, bronze effigy that was also supposed to be Tina Turner.

What appears to be Turner's hair is too big, too bulbous — it bears a resemblance to the orange Looney Tunes villain known as Gossamer. Her statue's self-satisfied smile is deeply menacing, partly because it is smiling with its top teeth showing. Why is it smiling? Why is it smiling like that? Why does statue Tina Turner have claw-like hands and bony digits? Did real one not have human hands?

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

This type of scrutiny is what happens when you commission a hyper-realistic monument, says Alex Ungprateeb Flynn, a professor of art and anthropology at UCLA. Flynn said that because so many people are so familiar and have so many reference points with celebrities like Turner, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lucille Ball, it's an uphill battle when a sculptor attempts a realistic depiction of their subject. It's even more difficult when someone's created a statue of Tina Turner, and the main question people have is whether or not said artist has ever even seen Tina Turner.

“It's brutal because if it's one millimeter off, it's like a straight red card,” Flynn says (referencing the nightmarish Ronaldo bust).

Flynn said there are various factors that create what he kindly calls “uncanny results.” Making photo-realism the end goal is a strong instigator, mainly because that isn't what sculptors often seek to do. What critics think of as “good” sculpture is based on capturing the essence of a subject while also playing with depth and positioning — things that are often incompatible with wanting to sculpt a true-to-life model of a person.

“Sometimes the truest portrait, it's not one that really is trying to be hyper accurate like this,” Flynn says. “If you want that, just go with photography.”

Flynn also notes that while bronze can be a great material for sculpture, “deadline bronze” and putting a time limit on sculpture (e.g., an unveiling date) is where things can start to go wrong. When someone commissions a piece in bronze, the understanding is that the piece will ostensibly live forever. Wouldn't you want someone to take their time with a piece that will live for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years?

Yet, as Flynn explains, there's a growing immediacy when it comes to honoring people we deem legendary. We want to see people honored before we die, sometimes before they die.

“Before, people had the decency to wait until these people were dead,” Flynn says, pointing out various bronze statues in the sports world.

If a sculptor really wanted to capture the thrill of Tina Turner's presence, they also probably wouldn't subject themselves to guidelines, or deadlines from an approval committee, says Mark Tribe, the MFA fine arts chair at the School of Visual Arts.

“There aren't a lot of contemporary artists who work in that vernacular who would necessarily be interested in making a realistic figurative sculpture of a specific person,” Tribe tells Vox, explaining that there's a problem on both ends. People and committees commissioning these statues are just looking for something realistic and are choosing from a pool of artists who are willing to relinquish at least a little bit of their artistic freedom.

“You could call it a failure of imagination, a lack of creativity,” Tribe says. “It's a one-to-one relationship between what you see and what you get, and there's not a lot of complexity between who is depicted and how they're depicted.”

The end result is that instead of a conversation about Turner's enduring legacy or her impact on music or the particular thrill of watching her perform “Proud Mary,” the only thing that anyone wants to talk about when they see this memorial is whether or not this statue looks like her. Theoretically, someone could come in and make a better statue of Tina Turner that's more flattering, but it would still spur the same, worn-out conversation.

In speaking to experts like Tribe and Flynn about horrendous statues, I quickly understood that I needed to be more precise in tossing around words like “bad” and “horrific.” There's bad as in: The statue of Tina Turner looks like an ugly version of her. And there is bad as in: The monument was only created for resemblance's sake (and even then it failed). There didn't seem to be an attempt at capturing anything about her beyond the superficial.

Doing so would require a risk, a point of view — and possibly making some people uncomfortable.

“If you want to create something and the worst thing people are going to do is roll their eyes and yawn, you make a bronze statue,” Tribe tells me. “There's a reason why some of the greatest monuments in memorials in recent times are not bronze sculptures.”

Tribe cites the Vietnam Veterans Memorial designed by Maya Lin. At the time, Lin's design — a tear in the earth flanked by two slabs of black marble etched with the names of service members who died or were missing during the war — was controversial because it wasn't straightforward. It wasn't an obvious bronze statue of a soldier. (Three bronze soldiers were added to the memorial in 1984 because people were upset.) Yet, Lin's design, Tribe says, captured the complexity, the loss, and immensity in ways that many of us can now see and appreciate.

Flynn, the UCLA professor, made a similar comparison when citing Auguste Rodin's “Monument to Balzac.” At the end of the 19th century, the Société des Gens de Lettres commissioned Rodin to create a sculpture to pay homage to novelist Honoré de Balzac. After seven years, Rodin created a sculpture that was more abstract and represented his interpretation of the writer's work, rather than a literal interpretation of Balzac's physique.

“It was just this kind of looming presence in a robe. There was nothing recognizable about it, and it wasn't flattering in any way. Contemporary people at the time, they called it just a sack of plaster,” Flynn says, detailing why the Société des Gens de Lettres absolutely hated it and ultimately rejected the piece — Rodin ended up taking it home. Rodin's critics wanted a more realistic, more lifelike depiction rather than Rodin's attempt at capturing Balzac's genius.

“Now, over a hundred years later, it's a masterpiece,” Flynn says. Rodin's model was eventually cast in bronze, many years after he died.

While Rodin, Balzac, and the Vietnam War couldn't be more different than the Queen of Rock and Roll's legacy, these debates are all part of the bigger conversation about how we want to remember people and make sure that other people do, too. Should we remind people that these subjects existed — or make bold attempts to show people what they meant to us?

The Tina Turner statue's fault is rooted in that it's too lifelike.

The intent to portray the singer's physical likeness is probably something more along the lines of what the Société des Gens de Lettres wanted from Rodin. They wanted something spectators would recognize, not one artist's idea of another person's essence.

Of course, there's a chance that criticism will flip-flop, like it did with Rodin. Perhaps the misformed Tina Turner statue will be something that people will fawn over in 100-something years. Bronze lasts that long.

But everyone making fun of it, like Turner herself, probably won't be alive to see it.

Consumers are finally pushing back on AI-driven data expansion. Will it matter?

Your electricity bill is rising. Naturally, you're mad about it and looking around at who to blame. But it's not a who, it's a what — and the recent AI-driven data center construction spree is at least partly the reason why.

Copious data centers have sprung up across the United States, nearly doubling in number between 2021 and 2024, with no end in sight to their rapid spread. According to consulting firm McKinsey & Company, companies are projected to spend $1.6 trillion on data center hardware in the US by 2030.

It's not just the existing facilities that are creating heftier bills; even data centers that have yet to be built are driving up power prices today.

These imposing, flat-walled, near-windowless buildings are filled with processors, hard drives, and memory chips that devour electrons. Today, some of the biggest tech companies in the world are now racing each other to secure more computing facilities and the energy to power them as they scramble to dominate the AI sector. BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, estimates that data centers will consume more than double their current share of electricity by 2035, accounting for nearly 9 percent of all US electricity demand. The US Department of Energy last year projected that data centers could devour upward of 12 percent of the country's total electricity production as soon as 2028.

“Large loads have always existed, but they tended to be much smaller. A large load might be 10 to 50 megawatts,” said Pieter Mul, an associate partner at PA Consulting. “Now, data centers are consuming hundreds of megawatts at a time.”

“You have this large mismatch between not just the willingness to pay but also the speed and volume at which these data centers want to interconnect,” he added. “It's running at a pace far ahead of the supply's ability to meet that load.”

And that mismatch is a recipe for soaring electricity prices.

Last week, Maryland state's legal representative for utility customers sent a letter to its regional grid operator, PJM, asking them to halt a “land rush” for electricity from data centers that is increasing power bills for households.

Marylanders are getting unhappier about their power bills, and this request is a significant escalation in the consumer-driven backlash against the rapid expansion of the tech industry's footprint.

Advocates on behalf of Maryland's ratepayers finally pushed back after, earlier this year, an auction for power capacity to meet peak demand in PJM's territory set a new record high price, soaring 22 percent above its previous peak. And they are already starting to raise monthly bills by about $16.

PJM is an important part of the US energy system. It's the largest power grid operator in the US, serving 67 million people across 13 states and Washington, DC. And it's also a global hotspot for this expanding tech. The grid includes Loudoun County in Virginia, home to almost 200 data centers — the largest market for hyperscale data centers in the world.

Utilities are telling PJM they expect even more electricity demand from data centers. According to Maryland's Office of People's Counsel, PJM's forecast for load growth by 2030 has nearly doubled compared to its previous forecast. The costs of building the infrastructure to support these new data centers are already getting baked into power prices, including in places that have seen little benefit from the race for more computing power.

“It's totally unfair,” said David Lapp, who serves as People's Counsel for Maryland. “All the laws and regulations that we have are set up for an entirely different scale and scope of growth and electricity demand, so we're dealing with essentially antiquated rules.”

Lapp explained that tech companies are shopping around for favorable electricity prices from different utilities, trying to buy up as much power as they can at low prices. Those utilities, in turn, are telling grid operators like PJM how much electricity they're going to need in the future. Just the speculation of increasing energy demand in the future is setting off a scramble for power that's already manifesting in higher prices for ordinary people.

But it's unlikely that all of those data centers are going to get built, especially if the AI boom turns out to be a bubble or as companies consolidate. Some tech companies may also be soliciting electricity bids from multiple utilities for the same data center, so there may be some double-counting driving up demand forecasts, as well. And even the facilities that do get built may not need all the electricity that they requested as computing hardware gets more efficient.

This all means that ordinary households will end up holding the bag for the new power generators and transmission lines intended to support data center demand that may never arise.

And all of this could be very expensive for ordinary people. In other power markets with a lot of new data centers in recent years — places such as Phoenix and Chicago — monthly wholesale electricity prices rose 267 percent.

By raising the alarm about how predictions of future energy needs are making things more expensive now, Lapp is hoping to start the process of creating reforms in PJM to keep prices under control.

In an emailed statement, PJM spokesperson Jeffrey Shields told Vox that the grid operator agrees that it's crucial to try to get as accurate a picture of demand growth as possible. Unfortunately, that's a tough thing to do. PJM doesn't directly interact with power customers. That's the job of utilities, and they need to be the ones tracking how much power their users actually need.

For its part, PJM is working on ways to get a sharper picture of the future, including requiring data center developers to disclose the full scale of their projects in multiple areas and developing a more thorough review process for requests for more power.

Once they're online, data centers can actually be a boon for the power grid. They're ratepayers, too, and their bills can start paying back the costs of the new infrastructure, which can boost reliability across the grid. Data centers don't necessarily have to run flat out all the time, and many come equipped with their own backup power systems, so they can be optimized to run when power is especially cheap and help make the grid more stable on balance. Some tech companies are also constructing their own generators to keep their giant boxes humming. But that's only if they get built at all.

“When [data centers] do come online, they're going to contribute by paying for the system,” Lapp said. “But if half of them don't come online, then there's going to have been a lot of costs that are incurred. … Those costs get shifted onto existing customers, so existing customers are taking on a ton of risk with these forecasts.”

There is a key way to lower the power bill for ordinary people, though. Julia Kortrey, deputy state policy director at Evergreen Action, a climate policy advocacy group, said one way to limit electricity speculation is to force tech companies to put more skin in the game.

“We can put incentives like requiring data center developers to put down a deposit or some type of financial commitment,” Kortrey said. “That would help reduce the number of double proposals or over-speculation.” Shields, the PJM spokesperson, said the grid operator is working on recommendations for utilities to “require financial commitments from large load customers based on the additional capacity PJM is required to acquire on their behalf.”

Consumer electricity prices are still likely to rise further, and more power-chugging data centers will crop up, but tamping down on rampant speculation of future demand could make power bills more manageable.

Otherwise, rising energy prices will be an even bigger drag on the economy, and more people will struggle to keep the lights on.

In his second term, Trump's rhetoric and policies regarding the trans community have become far more menacing

When President Donald Trump first took office in 2017, it wasn't self-evident that the transgender community, in particular, had anything to fear.

Prior to his presidency, Trump had said largely positive, or at least tolerant, things about LGBTQ+ people. He said he had no problem hiring gay people and supported amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to explicitly bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. He ended a ban on trans participation in his beauty pageants. He opposed North Carolina's bathroom bill. He said his friend, transgender reality star Caitlyn Jenner, could use “any bathroom she chooses” at Trump Tower. He portrayed himseld as a “friend” to LGBTQ+ people.

However, in his first term, he passed several anti-trans measures, including banning transgender people from serving in the military and removing nondiscrimination protections for trans people in health care and health insurance.

In his 2024 presidential campaign, the rhetoric against “radical gender ideology” and “transgender insanity” grew more hostile. A frequently-run Trump television ad claimed that “Kamala is for they/them. Trump is for you.” And as his second term has progressed, Trump's attacks on transgender rights have become increasingly virulent.

Today, Explained host Noel King spoke to Kate Sosin, who reports on LGBTQ+ issues for The 19th, about how the Trump administration's anti-trans policies are affecting transgender Americans.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

This is President Trump's second term, and a lot has changed between 2016 and today. How would you describe Trump's attitude towards trans people this time around?

Trump is generally viewed as the most anti-LGBTQ+ president in history, and a lot of that has to do with his approach to transgender rights. When he first got into office in 2017, there were still some questions about how he was going to approach LGBTQ+ issues, and he made a number of anti-trans moves in his first term. But this time, he really campaigned on anti-trans issues, and he's made them a staple of his administration.

I think it's pretty clear that what we're seeing is a backlash to increased visibility in rights for transgender people and also the result of marriage equality. Republicans lost on marriage equality. It's now been 10 years. It's the law of the land, and it's overwhelmingly accepted by the American public. So then, the focus turned to transgender issues, both for advocates who wanted to see transgender issues and transgender rights take center stage and also for people who are against trans issues. We saw a lot of bathroom bills in different states and cities, and those failed. And then we saw attention turn to sports bans and health care bans, and that's where we saw some traction start to form right around 2020.

That debate in 2020 brings us up to the present day, where, as you said, President Trump campaigned, in many cases explicitly, on anti-trans rhetoric. What has President Trump done specifically this term?

There's four different buckets or categories that we can sort things into. We have the general erasure of trans people from government and public life. We have him limiting health care access specifically for trans youth and revoking federal funding for medical providers that offer it. We have the reinstatement of the transgender military ban. And then, denying transgender people passports.

What do you mean by erasure of trans people?

On day one, Trump signed this executive order stating that his administration will recognize just two genders: male and female. And that proclamation pretty much governs everything that comes next, because he's trying to scrub trans people from public life. So, we see it in school censorship. He directs the federal government to eliminate funding for schools that promote “indoctrination” based on “gender ideology.” And he signs an executive order asking the Department of Justice to help ban trans girls from sports. We see the NCAA falling in line with that. Mentions of trans people are purged from government websites. Mentions of transgender people are removed from the Stonewall National Monument. And so, anywhere that we have mentions of the existence of transgender people that the federal government has control over, they seem to be moving swiftly to eradicate the existence of transgender people to move freely or to exist within the public sphere.

We made an episode earlier this year about the military ban on trans people being reinstated. This was a fairly blunt action by the administration.

Transgender people are twice as likely as their cisgender peers to serve in the military historically. The military is the largest employer of anyone in the United States. So, this military ban represents the largest layoff of trans people in history. There are an estimated 4,200 trans people in service right now, according to the Pentagon — or there at least were. And in January, Trump announced that he was going to bar trans people from service. We saw lawsuits aiming to block that ban, but in May, the Supreme Court held up the ban and these troops were given a deadline to voluntarily separate from service. Those who haven't are now being removed.

You mentioned also limiting access to gender affirming care. This is something that in some cases, as I understand it, the states have control over. How is the Trump administration limiting this care?

You're absolutely right. Before Trump took office, 27 states had moved to block gender affirming care for youth. And all those laws have happened in the last five years; this has been just really quick. All major medical associations recommend this care for youth, but it's already really hard to get. Some families have to travel really great distances, because it is specialized care, and there are these bans. Trump's order takes away funding from hospitals and clinics that provide it. Twenty-one hospitals and clinics have stopped providing that care nationwide, so we've seen a great decrease. Some states have fought back. In California, for example, the attorney general sent a letter reminding hospitals that they were required by state law to continue those services. But not everyone has restored those services. Some, like Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, have not resumed that care. Others have continued to provide it.

Has the Trump administration been able to change how adults are able to receive care?

As of now, no. But there is a fear around this. And one of the points about this comes down to a case that we heard from the Supreme Court last year, which was the Skrmetti case. The Supreme Court basically ruled in Skrmetti that transgender care is special. It is not like other protected care. If we say that trans kids can't get the kind of care that their doctors recommend, it doesn't bode well for transgender adults.

And then, you mentioned a difficulty getting passports for trans people. What's been going on there?

When you apply for your passport, you mark male, female — or recently, you had the option to mark a gender marker X, which is either unspecified or non-binary. The Trump administration was rejecting all gender marker changes, so you couldn't update your gender marker, which meant a lot of people were unsafe, and in some cases, they were seizing the documents of transgender people and not sending them back. And this caused a lot of panic and confusion, because a lot of trans people wanted to flee the country. There was a lawsuit from the ACLU, they won an injunction, and as of July, trans people have been able to update their passports. There is a fear, however, that this is temporary. So, the advice has been, if you are trans and you need a passport, you should apply for one right away, because this is changing so quickly, and it's uncertain how this will play out.

How much harder have the last 10 months in the second Trump administration made life for trans people? What are you hearing?

I have heard a number of parents of trans kids who have just left the country or are preparing to. They can't access the health care that their kids need. They are afraid of violence directed at their kids, and they feel like even if their state is safe at the moment, it won't be much longer. And the fear that I hear from my trans sources and friends is just really profound, that this country is becoming unlivable for trans people, and that seems like it's by design.

The only way to save them is to put people first.

Throughout the Western world, Madagascar is perhaps best known as a hot spot for wildlife, home to lemurs, chameleons, and other animals — a reputation popularized by movies like Madagascar and shows like Planet Earth. And it's true that the country has an impressive array of creatures and plants that you can't find anywhere else. Lemurs literally only exist on this island, as do almost half of the world's chameleon species and most of its iconic baobab trees, stout species that are mostly trunk.

But although Madagascar is one of a kind, it's not exactly the wildlife haven you might imagine. At least not anymore.

The island has lost around half — or possibly far more — of its original forests and as much as half of the live coral off its coasts. Today, nearly all lemur species are threatened with extinction. So are half of the country's chameleons and several species of tenrec, adorable hedgehog-like creatures that live only in Madagascar. Reef-dependent fisheries in some regions, meanwhile, are on the verge of collapsing.

These declines are rooted in scarcity. Madagascar is one of the poorest and most malnourished countries on the planet. Last year, 80 percent of the island nation lived in extreme poverty, earning less daily than what $2.15 could buy you in the US in 2017. Nearly 40 percent of young children, meanwhile, have stunted growth due to a lack of nutrition.

This matters because, throughout much of the country, one of the only ways to earn money and buy food is by taking resources from the environment. People cut down forests, for example, to make and sell charcoal, a wood-based fuel, or to clear small parcels of land to grow crops. These sorts of activities aren't inherently harmful; humans have always relied on nature for survival. But when people have no other way to earn a living, the pressure of extraction can become too much.

This story, and the features below, are part of a package led by Vox senior environmental correspondent Benji Jones, who spent two weeks in Madagascar in September. To prepare for a trip like this, we collaborate with local photographers, translators, and researchers to ensure that our reporting both informs our audiences of the larger stakes of environmental issues unfolding in the country and serves the local community. That's why we are making our reporting accessible with stories translated into Malagasy, Madagascar's national language.

It's a privilege to have the resources to do reporting like this, and we thank our funders at the BAND Foundation for supporting this project. —Paige Vega, climate editor

There are several complex reasons why poverty still grips Madagascar, including political instability and corruption. Just this month, the Madagascar government was dissolved, the president was impeached, and the military assumed power, following weeks of protests in the capital of Antananarivo from people frustrated by power and water outages and a lack of economic opportunity. Together with climate change, the lingering effects of colonialism, and foreign aid structures, poor governance has stymied the growth of non-extractive industries.

As a result, a large number of people across Madagascar are highly dependent on the island's ecosystems for their livelihoods — for their survival — and those ecosystems are starting to fail, partly because of the sheer scale of dependency. That makes conservation here both incredibly challenging and incredibly important.

Last month, I visited Madagascar in search of solutions. I was after ideas for how to sustain the country's iconic ecosystems and animals as a means to support human well-being. What I found, in the southwest and eastern regions of the country, was more dim than I had expected. I saw clear signs of coral reefs in distress and fishermen facing hunger. I saw wildfires approaching one of the last intact stretches of highland forest.

But I ultimately did find what I was after: solutions that actually seem to work. And though they were small-scale, their significance felt large. Because, as several experts told me along the way, if you can get conservation to work under these conditions, it'll work anywhere.

Scientists are testing a surprising approach to fighting hunger in one of the poorest places on Earth.

Translation into Malagasy will soon be available. 

Around the world, advanced farming often destroys forests. But near one nature reserve in southwest Madagascar, it may be key to saving them, and the lemurs that call them home.

Several hours north of Antananarivo, Madagascar's capital, is a small patch of green in a sea of brown — a park surrounded by degraded land. And it's full of chameleons, some of which are endangered. The park's boundaries are well protected by patrols, but wildfires fueled by climate change threaten to destroy it.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aria Kim, a 26-year-old security program manager at Sony in Washington, D.C., who previously worked for Meta and as a contractor for Google. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

The way I got into Big Tech was unconventional.

I graduated with a biology degree from George Washington University in 2021. I thought I was on track for medical school, but while working part-time as a project lab assistant after graduating, I realized I didn't love medicine — I liked managing projects and finishing work.

I followed my own path into tech, first as a project manager in a contract role at Google in January 2022, and then in another contract role at Meta in September 2022.

Some of the guidance I followed early on, while well-intentioned, didn't always align with how hiring or career growth actually works in Big Tech.

I immigrated to Canada from South Korea when I was in fourth grade, and then to the US in high school, and my parents didn't have firsthand experience with how the corporate world works here. My friends meant well, too, but we were all fresh out of college and figuring things out. None of us really knew how the industry worked yet, and we repeated what sounded ""safe.""

Here are six pieces of Big Tech career advice I got after college that I wish I'd ignored:

Since I didn't have a computer science degree or a traditional tech background, peers and college counselors questioned me: ""How are you going to apply to a tech job when you don't have a tech background?""

But by researching tech companies and their job listings, I realized that tech companies hire for more than just technical roles. I saw many roles that didn't require coding or computer science degrees, like project management, operations, and user experience. I saw project management as my way in, and positioned myself as someone who could lead and deliver projects.

To build a foundation in project management, I earned the CAPM certification from Product Management Institute and the CSM from Scrum Alliance. I also actively stepped into project-based responsibilities wherever I could within my lab roles, as I knew that the skills were valuable everywhere.

Once I landed my first tech role, I added to my technical skills over time, specifically in cybersecurity. I've been working as a cybersecurity program manager at Sony since November 2024.

I used to keep my job titles exactly as they appeared in HR systems or offer letters since my college advisor told me to. However, those specific titles didn't always match the work I did or fit the roles I was applying for in Big Tech.

I would've never thought to change the job titles because I assumed that would go against HR policies or that it was somehow wrong.

But during coffee chats, I asked people who were already in the tech industry about this, and they told me you have flexibility in how you present your experience, as long as it's accurate to what you did.

For example, my job title at the lab was ""lab coordinator,"" but when I applied to tech roles, I changed it to ""lab project manager"" to better match my responsibilities and help my résumé get past applicant tracking systems. I wasn't exaggerating; I just made it easier for recruiters to understand my experience — and I got more interviews.

Peers and college counselors often told me that my résumé needed to include all of the dates and that removing my graduation year might look suspicious. But taking it off helped me avoid bias about my age or how long ago I graduated.

When asked about my graduation year, I always answer honestly — but I don't include it on my résumé, to keep the focus on my current skills.

When I first graduated, I thought applying through official job sites was the best method. But the counselors who gave me that advice didn't fully understand how much the hiring landscape had changed with the rise of ATS and AI filters.

I remember once spending over an hour customizing my résumé and cover letter for a role I was so excited about. I submitted the application through the company's official site, only to get an automated rejection less than a minute later. It was crushing — and worse, I realized no one had even seen it.

That's when I stopped relying on job portals and started reaching out directly to people at the company whose work I admired or to managers who posted #hiring on LinkedIn. I focused on contacting people

I had common ground with, like someone who went to the same school, lived in the same city, or had gone through a career pivot similar to the one that I was trying to make.

Once I shifted to this approach, I started landing more interviews — real conversations, not just auto-responses. Referrals opened doors that online applications couldn't.

I remember not applying for a job I really wanted because I didn't have one of the tools listed under ""preferred qualifications."" Later, I was talking to a male classmate, and he casually said something along the lines of, ""Oh yeah, I still apply even if I don't fit everything. Most of the time, you still get an interview."" That moment made me realize how often I'd disqualified myself before anyone else had the chance to.

Since then, I've applied for roles even when I didn't check every box — as long as I met 60-70% of the requirements — and those applications have led to real interviews, and even job offers.

For example, when I applied for the contract project manager role at Meta, it required several more years of experience than I had. I told myself, ""The worst they can do is say no."" To my surprise, I got a call from a recruiter and landed the job.

College career counselors and a few recruiters told me to keep my LinkedIn profile strictly professional and avoid personal details, so for years, I avoided posting on LinkedIn because I wasn't sure how personal I should get. I thought that was the safest way to present myself. I'd also been told not to share personal stories online on other platforms like Instagram.

But a few people in my network reminded me that authenticity connects just as much in professional spaces.

I listened to them and started sharing parts of my story on LinkedIn and Instagram a few months ago, like about being afraid of speaking in public in the past and being scared to post on LinkedIn. The posts unexpectedly resonated with others, and some of my Instagram posts even went viral.

I've received messages from strangers and even former colleagues saying my posts genuinely inspired them. It's rewarding to know my story encourages others to take risks in their own careers.

A DNS error appears to have been the culprit behind a major Amazon Web Services outage at its oldest and largest data center.

Early Monday morning, Amazon's AWS experienced an outage that brought down more than 100 of its services. Platforms like Snapchat, Reddit, and Venmo that use AWS for hosting servers and delivering content all suffered the impact, as did games like Roblox, Wordle, and Fortnite.

Based on the AWS service status page, the outage started with an error with its Domain Name System at Amazon's northern Virginia data plant, located in what is known as the ""Data Center Alley,"" where hundreds of data centers are located.

At 6:53 p.m. ET, an update on the AWS Health Dashboard said the outage had been resolved by around 6 p.m. ET, and all 142 services that were down in the morning are running again.

According to Cloudflare, the DNS is essentially the internet's name-to-number translation system, which translates the domain name you type into the browser in human language to an IP address that contacts the server in a machine-friendly langauge. If the DNS is not working, a lookup takes too long and a website may timeout. For users, it could also seem like the website they're looking for no longer exists or simply can't be found.

Following the DNS failure, a domino effect of other issues followed, including issues with cloud computing service and Network Load Balancers, which route traffic between servers. This affected AWS services.

Millions of businesses rely on AWS, and the only two other cloud service providers of similar scale are Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud Platform.

While it is common for internet service providers to experience issues with DNS, due to the reach of AWS, the scale of disruption seen on Monday is rare. Other larger cloud providers have also undergone DNS-related outages in recent years. In 2021, Microsoft Azure experienced an DNS outage due to a spike in traffic, and so did Akamai Edge due to a bug in its DNS system. In July, Cloudflare's DNS resolver had an outage that the company said was caused by an internal misconfiguration.

Northern Virginia, where the malfunction happened, according to the AWS Health Dashboard, is a common spot for data centers.

Business Insider's Hannah Beckler reported earlier in October that Big Tech companies filed permits to build 54 new data centers in Virginia over the first nine months of 2025, with Amazon planning for most of the facilities, as well as some of the largest.

As of 2023, data centers in Virginia use up a quarter of the state's available electricity, and residents are increasingly concerned about how these constructions would impact their quality of life despite the promised tax revenue.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

David Zaslav is seeking a bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.

Warner Bros. Discovery said it's reviewing a potential sale of all or parts of the company, citing unsolicited interest in the entire entity, even as it continues to pursue a spinoff of its cable assets, which is already underway.

The news, which sent shares soaring more than 10%, follows reports that David Ellison's Paramount Skydance, with backing from his billionaire father, Oracle's Larry Ellison, is pursuing a bid for WBD as he builds a media and tech powerhouse.

""We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,"" said Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, in an announcement. ""We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.

""It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,"" he added. ""After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.""

WBD said there's no deadline or timetable set for completion of the review process and that it may not decide to pursue any transaction at all.

Consolidation in media and entertainment has long been predicted. The rationale is that only a few companies will win the streaming wars, and the biggest have the best chance of success. Many analysts see a tie-up of WBD and Paramount Skydance as inevitable.

Separately, they're still bit players in streaming, but the rationale is that combined, they could mount a real challenge to Netflix and Disney. Antitrust concerns that might otherwise exist could be mitigated by the fact that Larry Ellison has close ties with President Donald Trump. And the elder Ellison has the money, as one of the world's richest men.

Together, WBD and Paramount Skydance could slash costs, increase their libraries, and achieve streaming scale by combining their platforms while slowing the decline of their linear TV business, LightShed Partners wrote in an October 20 research note.

And for the Ellisons, bidding now makes sense because it would take advantage of a friendly White House and keep a split WBD out of competitors' hands, LightShed wrote.

There's also no other obvious bidder for all of WBD. NBCUniversal parent Comcast would likely face regulatory hurdles because a deal would lead to increased concentration in the TV news business.

Other companies, such as Netflix and Apple, have the means but have historically not been buyers of big Hollywood studios. They likely wouldn't be interested in WBD's cable channels and have been quite able to access its prestige HBO shows by licensing without owning them.

By opening itself up to a sale of parts of the company, WBD could hope to spark interest in a bidding war for its prized HBO. There, again, potential buyers are seen as unlikely bidders. The WBD board could be betting that the prospect of such a war could lead Paramount Skydance to swoop in and pay more to ensure it gets the whole company.

It's hard to see another company seriously going up against the Ellisons' money and risking the potential for retaliation from a presidential administration that's been quick to go after and wring big financial settlements out of perceived political opponents (see Disney, CBS).

Announcing a formal strategic review and openness to sell parts of the company is WBD's way of eliciting other bids or, at the very least, pushing up a Paramount Skydance offer, Raymond James wrote in a note after WBD's announcement.

""We do think there are several parties that could ultimately be interested particularly in the WB side, that would at least look at the book. But we feel investors should not interpret this language as definitive confirmation yet that WB(D) will get multiple bidders or a bidding war,"" said James.

To be sure, the success of a WBD-Paramount Skydance tie-up wouldn't be guaranteed. Paramount+ and HBO Max combined would still rank fifth among streamers in TV watchtime in July, according to Nielsen — behind YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ with Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. Mashing up both streamers would be expensive and time-consuming, and wouldn't necessarily lead to subscriber growth.

For Hollywood's creative community, a combination of the two companies would mean one fewer buyer for TV shows and movies, further consolidating Tinseltown. And bringing CNN under the same roof with CBS could give Trump more influence over the news Americans see.Have a tip?

The federal government is shut down, but that's not stopping tourists from visiting America's national parks.

I visited two national parks over the weekend, more than two weeks after the shutdown began: Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park, which are adjacent to each other and located in central California, about a 4.5 hour drive from Los Angeles in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Since the shutdown began on October 1, there's been a lot of confusion about what that means for the national parks and what visitors can expect to find when they go.

The National Park Service has said parks will remain as accessible as possible during the shutdown, though the situation varies from park to park and most are running on limited crews to handle basic services, like bathroom maintenance and trash disposal.

Both parks were open, had plenty of visitors, and were as gorgeous as they always are, but it wasn't business as usual. With fewer services available, planning ahead before the trip was more important than ever, and I took extra care to prepare before I went.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon are technically two different parks, though in many ways they function as one — a single $35-per-vehicle entrance fee gets you into both. That is, when entrance fees are being collected.

When I approached the entrance gates on Friday afternoon, there was no one on duty. In place of an attendant passing out maps and collecting fees — 80% of which go toward maintaining and improving park facilities and services — there was a sign about the shutdown.

""During this lapse in appropriations, national parks will remain as accessible as possible,"" the sign said. ""We are doing our best to take care of your parks at this time, but some amenities and services may not be available.""

That was the first sign things were not normal.

When I tried to stop by the Kings Canyon Visitor Center, it was closed, as were the other visitor centers that are typically open this time of year. The same sign about the lapse of appropriations was posted outside the entrance.

Visitor centers are often a first stop for park-goers. Rangers are usually available to hand out maps and other informational materials, answer questions about weather and trail conditions, and recommend hikes that are appropriate for the group's fitness levels.

I saw some tourists peering through the visitor center windows and scanning the large map that was hung up in the window. When another person from the group approached and asked if they were able to find a map they could take with them, one replied, ""They're in visual distance, but denied!""

The closed visitor center also meant that tourists hoping to get their ""National Park Passport"" stamped were out of luck.

While many buildings run by the NPS were closed, bathrooms at many locations were still open and being maintained. Buildings run by concessionaires, or private companies that work in partnership with the parks, were also open.

At Grant Grove, across from the Kings Canyon Visitor Center, a market, gift shop, and restaurant were open and serving tourists. Same with the market, restaurant, showers, and laundromat at the Lodgepole area of Sequoia.

Many, if not most, of the popular trails were also open, including for the parks' most famous trees, General Sherman and General Grant, and the Moro Rock Trail.

Some campgrounds were also open. The bathrooms at Sentinel Campground, where I stayed, were maintained with plenty of toilet paper and as clean as can typically be expected. The potable water at the campground also appeared to still be available.

In fact, if a tourist had planned their trip in advance and did not try to stop by a visitor center, they might not have realized anything was out of the ordinary.

I did see plenty of people breaking park rules — walking off trail or bringing their dogs on trails where pets weren't allowed — but I'm not sure visitors were misbehaving any more than they usually do at national parks.

I had visited Sequoia and Kings Canyon before but knew the visitor centers would be closed, so I planned ahead even more than I usually would.

There's almost no cell service in the parks, so before I left I downloaded an entire map of the area on Google Maps, as well as the official NPS map of the parks. I researched which sites we wanted to visit and downloaded trails on the AllTrails hiking app.

I was also pleasantly surprised to find that online resources for the national parks were still very useful during the shutdown. The real-time weather forecast for various areas of the parks are still being updated on the park service website, so I was able to plan accordingly and feel pretty confident about the conditions we would find in the park.

I was feeling some uncertainty over which campgrounds might be open, so I used Recreation.gov, the federal government website for outdoor reservations that is still running during the shutdown, to book a site in advance. I was able to grab a spot just one day before my trip.

It's difficult to be certain about what you might find when visiting a national park during a government shutdown.

It's safest to be self-reliant by taking extra care to plan and bring anything you might need with you. I packed extra toilet paper and brought my own water.

It's also more important than ever to follow park rules and minimize your impact on the natural environment.

Park advocates like the National Park Conservation Association urge the government to close national parks during shutdowns out of concern for the park itself and visitor safety.

During the federal government shutdown in 2019, some parks were vandalized and their landscapes damaged. Issues with human waste and trash got so bad at Sequoia and Kings Canyon that the parks were forced to close, according to NPCA.

""Some parks are open. Some parks are closed. More than 60% of national park staff are on furlough,"" Kyle Groetzinger, an NPCA spokesperson, told me earlier this month. ""The shutdown is leaving national parks without the experts needed to protect fragile ecosystems, interpret American history, and serve the public.""

Overall, as an experienced national park visitor and camper, I felt comfortable visiting during the shutdown.

As for first-time visitors, it might be better to wait until the shutdown ends and the parks are operating at full force. At the very least, I recommend doing a lot of research in advance and learning about Leave No Trace principles to protect yourself as well as the parks.

Business Insider Edition 

A new World Bank report has revealed that the Congo Basin's vast forest, often dubbed the “lungs of Africa,” holds over $23 trillion in untapped value, urging African governments and investors to act swiftly to harness their potential for climate resilience and economic growth.


        The report, Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem Accounts, found that the value of ecosystem services nearly doubled between 2000 and 2020, from $590 billion to $1.15 trillion, while the total forest asset value surged to $23.2 trillion.
    


        Despite this enormous potential, local governments earned just $8 billion in benefits in 2020, mostly from timber, bushmeat, wild foods, and ecotourism.
    


“These forests, managed sustainably, can serve as powerful engines for sustainable development, contributing to job creation, climate-smart growth, and stronger local economies,” said Ousmane Diagana, World Bank Vice President for Western and Central Africa.
    


        Spanning six African nations, the Congo Basin forms the world's second-largest tropical rainforest after the Amazon. But its management varies widely.
    


        Gabon and the Republic of Congo are leading in embedding sustainability into national policy, while Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea are working to strengthen governance.
    


        Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic face mounting pressure from informal logging, mining, and agricultural expansion.



        The World Bank called for integrating forest assets into macroeconomic planning and expanding climate finance, positioning the Congo Basin as a critical frontier for green growth, and a potential model for Africa's climate-driven development future.

Business Insider Edition 

Swiss-based bottler, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (Coca-Cola HBC) has agreed to acquire a 75% stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6 billion, in a deal that will make it one of the most influential beverage players on the continent once completed.


        According to Bloomberg, the deal, which has been in progress since 2021, grants Coca-Cola HBC operational control of one of Africa's largest bottlers, expanding its footprint into 14 additional markets, including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Ghana.
    


        ""Coca-Cola HBC is a strong and valued bottler that will help usher in the next chapter of growth for CCBA,"" said Coca-Cola Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun.
    


        The transaction values CCBA at US$3.4 billion and is expected to close by the end of 2026, pending regulatory and antitrust approvals.
    


        Under the deal, Coca-Cola HBC will purchase shares from The Coca-Cola Company and Gutsche Family Investments (GFI), which currently control 66.5% and 33.5% of CCBA respectively.
    


        Coca-Cola HBC will also have the option to buy the remaining 25% stake in CCBA within six years of the deal's completion, according to official statements from both companies.
    


        Founded in 2014, CCBA operates across more than a dozen African countries and produces roughly 40% of all Coca-Cola beverages sold on the continent.
    


        The acquisition will give Coca-Cola HBC control of a fast-growing portfolio that includes popular brands such as Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, and Minute Maid, and in some markets, energy drinks like Monster.
    


        Coca-Cola HBC, which is listed in London and Athens, also announced plans for a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to signal its commitment to the African market.
    


        Despite the optimism surrounding the acquisition, it has sparked labour concerns in South Africa, where reports indicate potential job cuts at Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) as part of the merger's restructuring phase.
    


        “In response to evolving industry dynamics, Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa intends to make adjustments to its organisation that, if implemented, may result in some roles being impacted and may, unfortunately, lead to job losses,” the company said at the time.
    


        Trade unions have since cautioned against possible layoffs, urging management to prioritise job security alongside operational efficiency. Coca-Cola HBC, however, has maintained that the deal will strengthen long-term investment, encourage technology transfer, and enhance operational sustainability across the region.
    


        Beyond its corporate implications, the transaction could reshape Africa's industrial and consumer landscape. The US$2.6 billion investment, which values the deal at US$3.4 billion, reinforces confidence in African markets at a time when many global firms remain cautious about emerging economies.
    


The acquisition is expected to strengthen Coca-Cola's regional value chain, from bottling and logistics to local ingredient sourcing, improving supply efficiency and stimulating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged in agriculture, packaging, and transportation.
    


        Africa's beverage industry, valued at over US$60 billion, is expanding rapidly, driven by population growth, urbanisation, and a youthful consumer base.
    


        The Coca-Cola HBC–CCBA deal represents a strategic bet on the continent's rising purchasing power and evolving middle class.
    


        If executed effectively, the acquisition could help transform Africa from a peripheral market into a manufacturing and innovation hub for global beverage production, firmly cementing Coca-Cola's long-term stake in the continent's economic future.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei addressed ""inaccurate claims"" about the artificial intelligence startup's policy stances on Tuesday after repeatedly facing criticism from David Sacks, the venture capitalist serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar.

Amodei said the company is aligned with the Trump administration across ""key areas of AI policy,"" and that it is interested in working with ""anyone serious about getting this right.""

""I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development,"" Amodei said in a statement.

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives, including Amodei, who left the company over concerns about safety. It's one of the startups at the center of the AI boom, and its valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years.

The company caught the attention of Sacks last week after Jack Clark, one of Anthropic's co-founders and its current head of policy, published an essay called ""Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,"" which sparked a debate over AI regulation online.

Sacks criticized the essay and accused Anthropic of ""running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,"" according to a post on X. He said the company is ""principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.""

Anthropic opposed a proposed amendment to Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" that would have enacted a 10-year-long suspension on state-level AI laws. That provision ultimately failed and was not included in the legislation. 

The company also supported a bill in California that requires large AI developers to make their model safety protocols public, though there are exemptions for companies that generate an annual gross revenue of less than $500 million.

Billionaire tech investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman defended Anthropic on Monday and called the startup ""one of the good guys."" Hoffman was an early investor in OpenAI, Anthropic's larger rival, and remains a shareholder. He revealed on Monday that Greylock, where he's a partner, has invested in Anthropic.

Sacks quickly responded to Hoffman's post, and the two sparred back and forth on Monday. In one post, Sacks wrote that the ""real issue"" is ""Anthropic's agenda to backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California.""

Amodei worked to clarify Anthropic's view on Tuesday, writing that the company's longstanding position has been that a uniform federal approach is preferable to a patchwork of state laws.""

""When we agree, we say so. When we don't, we propose an alternative for consideration,"" Amodei said. ""We do this because we are a public benefit corporation with a mission to ensure that AI benefits everyone and to maintain America's lead in AI.""

""Again, we believe we share those goals with the Trump administration, both sides of Congress, and the public,"" he said.

In this article

Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday it's expanding its strategic review of the business and is open to a sale, sending shares of the company 10% higher in morning trading.

Earlier this year, WBD announced plans to split into two separate entities, a streaming and studios business and a global networks business. It's also been fielding takeout interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance.

But on Tuesday, WBD said it's received ""unsolicited interest"" from multiple parties and will now review all options. The company said it's still moving toward the previously announced separation in the meantime.

""We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,"" CEO David Zaslav said in a statement. ""We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.""

""It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets,"" he said.

Netflix and Comcast are among the interested parties, sources told CNBC's David Faber.

WBD decided to publicly announce it has had interest from multiple parties after rejecting several different bids from Paramount and an offer from another company that was higher than the Paramount bid, according to a person familiar with the matter.

It is unclear how serious potential offers outside of Paramount would be. Netflix was not interested in buying legacy media assets, but didn't want WBD to go to another buyer at a low price, a source familiar with the matter said.

While Comcast does not feel the need to do a deal, it will look at the possibility of pursuing WBD, sources close to the company told CNBC's Julia Boorstin.

For any buyer that just wants WBD's studio and streaming assets, acquiring them after a split later this year is better for tax purposes.

Paramount and WBD spokespeople declined to comment. Netflix and Comcast did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

WBD has faced mounting financial challenges since the 2022 merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc., which saddled the company with more than $40 billion in debt. It has since undertaken aggressive cost cutting, restructured its content pipeline and focused on profitable franchises like ""Harry Potter"" and ""Game of Thrones"" spinoffs.

Though the company has made progress in debt reduction, investors have remained skeptical in part because of the company's cable network portfolio as consumers move toward streaming.

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

Cattle ranchers in Texas and around the country are concerned that the screwworm, a parasitic fly that was once eradicated in the U.S., is threatening a comeback from the Mexican border and recent talk from President Donald Trump about importing beef from Argentina is no long-term solution for a beef supply chain already under stress or consumers who have watched beef prices hit record levels.

The New World screwworm is a parasitic fly that lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae then hatches from the eggs and burrows into tissue of animals to feed on them. If caught early, the sick animal can be treated and survive. Human cases are rare but can be painful and require medical attention. In August, the the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement that the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified a case of the flesh-eating parasite in a person in Maryland who returned to the U.S. after traveling to El Salvador.

The New World screwworm was successfully eradicated from the United States in 1966. But the Maryland case and other recent appearances in Mexico have cattle ranchers in Texas and around the country on edge. Mexico's National Service of Agro-Alimentary Health, Safety, and Quality confirmed on October 6 another case of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite in Nuevo Leon, a city that borders the U.S. It marked the country's second confirmed case in approximately two weeks.

""Texas is a material contributor to the beef industry,"" said Andrew Coppin, co-founder and CEO of ranch management company Ranchbot Monitoring Solutions. ""You have millions of beef cattle along the southern border alone.""

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has closed the border to Mexico for imports of live cattle, bison, and horses on and off since 2024 due to the spread of the New World screwworm. The border is currently closed. Before the closure, Mexico was an exporter of calves to the U.S., with USDA data showing the U.S. imported over one million cattle annually, approximately 3.3% of the U.S. total calf crop.

Sixth-generation Texas rancher James Clement III told CNBC the key to eradicating the screwworm threat is years out. To combat the spread of the flies, the USDA disperses sterile flies into the area to stop the mating, a scientific method known as sterile insect technique (SIT). It was the reason for the successful eradication of the flies in the U.S. But Clement said the flies used previously were brought in from Panama and while the USDA has said it is committed to developing a domestic sterile fly production facility, ""that is at least two or three years away. By then it will be too little to late,"" he said.

The USDA did not respond to a request for comment for this article. In an appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday morning, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, said, ""I think you'll be hearing more about exactly what that looks like,"" in response to a question about the Argentine beef import idea.

Clement, whose family business has operated multiple ranches over the last 400 years, said American ranching has evolved and has become more efficient. While this is good for production, in times of threats like biohazards such as screwworm, it is a challenge.

""We require less labor now so it would be difficult and challenging to detect an infected cattle,"" he said. ""We don't have the people to check every head of cattle daily. Most of this cattle are free range and the grass pastures are large.""

The USDA, alongside Mexico, has been monitoring nearly 8,000 traps across Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico since July. More than 13,000 screening samples have been submitted, with no NWS flies detected.

But Clement says, ""this is spreading quickly. A year ago, screwworm was already in southern Mexico, then it spread into central and northern Mexico. Now it is happening just south of our border. It's not a matter of if screwworm spreads to the U.S., it's when.""

Clement said the situation is adding to the supply-demand imbalance in the cattle industry which has already increased due to drought. Beef prices have climbed to record highs after cattle ranchers slashed their herds due to dried-up lands used for grazing. Feed costs rose as a result.

According to government data, as of July 2025, the U.S. cattle herd is approximately 94.2 million head, the lowest inventory since 1951.

Coppin tells CNBC the key component to increasing herd size is water.

""Typically, ranches have thousands of acres and cattle,"" Coppin said. ""Less grasslands as a result of less water equals smaller herds.""

He estimated 30% of the U.S. is still in drought conditions.

""The question ranchers are asking themselves is, will I have enough feed to feed my herd?  This is why grasslands are important. Feed is a big input cost that eats into the margin of ranchers,"" he said.

Coppin said while the importing of beef from Argentina may lower the cost of beef for consumers (futures had dropped sharply after Trump's comments but have since trended up again), for ranchers facing drought and screwworm, the incentives to increasing herd size are dwindling.

""Ranchers don't want their product to be substituted,"" Coppin said.

Recently, some U.S. ranchers have begun taking steps to start rebuilding herds. However, ranchers and beef supply chain experts like Coppin say it takes about two years before beef output rises because it takes time to raise full-grown cattle.

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said in statement on Monday after President Trump floated his idea to import beef from Argentina over the weekend that it was urging Trump and Congress to allow the market to work rather intervene and harm rural America.

""This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,"" said Colin Woodall, CEO of NCBA.

Republican Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska urged President Donald Trump to reconsider his proposal for the U.S. to buy beef from Argentina in a social media post on Tuesday.

""We've had a massive run on beef over the last decade,"" Rollins said on CNBC on Tuesday. ""Massive consolidation, which has not been good for our ranching industry, and we have offshored a lot of that. There's a really, really important realignment that has to happen for us to begin to onshore and reshore for our beef producers, for our ranchers,"" she said.

""The prices are high and the president is very focused on fulfilling his promise of bringing grocery prices down ... but you're also going to hear from us in the next few days about what we are going to do to incentivize, to open up new land, to make it easier to become a rancher,"" Rollins continued. ""We've got a pretty big package coming out,"" she added, noting the CNBC appearance was the first time she had mentioned the plans publicly.

The NCBA cited Argentina's ""deeply unbalanced trade relationship"" with the U.S. In the past five years, Argentina has sold more than $801 million of beef into the U.S. market. By comparison, the U.S. has sold just over $7 million worth of American beef to Argentina, according to NCBA data. It noted Argentina also has a history of foot-and-mouth disease, which if brought to the United States, could decimate domestic livestock production.

Rollins estimated during her CNBC appearance that 2 million of the 12 million metric tons of beef consumed annually now in the U.S. come from overseas, and any increase from Argentina would ""not be very much"" compared to that total, especially in light of USDA concerns about foot and mouth disease.

Clement said having the government step in and try to regulate the markets is not what the U.S. should be focused on.

""The market will take care of itself,"" Clement said. ""We need the government preventing and stamping out screwworm. Then we can recruit the next generation saying, 'ranching is a profession that you can do to take care of your family, and have a good quality of life. The government will look after us through biosecurity and the prevention of animal disease. Not manipulating the markets.'""

CNBC is now accepting nominations for the 2026 Changemakers list. Learn more and submit a nomination by Nov 21.

When Kate Gallego was weighing her first run for mayor in Phoenix, she was newly divorced, had recently given birth, and her mom had just been diagnosed with cancer. None of the largest cities in the United States had a female mayor and she had trouble envisioning people taking a ""short young woman"" seriously. But she was wrong.

""People, it turns out, don't want elected officials who have perfect lives,"" said Mayor Gallego (D-AZ), who is now in her third term running America's fifth-largest city. ""They want elected officials who will help make their lives better,"" Gallego told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in the latest episode of the ""CNBC Changemakers and Power Players"" podcast.

The pivotal moment in her decision to first run for mayor came when a group of girlfriends took her out and assured her that if she wanted to go for it, they would provide the support she needed to be a great mom and candidate. They also gave her some straight talk: ""You are going to hate yourself forever if you don't do this,"" Gallego recalled.

The doubts didn't go away during her first mayoral campaign. When working the phones to raise money, she worried that no one would take her seriously to run the city if she couldn't stop her newborn from crying in the background. ""But it turns out, there are a whole lot of parents out there who have also not been able to quiet a baby every second they would like to,"" Gallego said. ""People were willing to judge me based on my record on the City Council and look a little bit past my immediate circumstances.""

Today, her vision for transforming Phoenix into a future-forward technology and bioscience hub is well-underway. During her tenure, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) announced plans to invest $165 billion in advanced semiconductor manufacturing operations and jobs in Phoenix; Arizona State University, with HonorHealth, has committed to building a new medical school expected to open in fall 2026; and Sky Harbor Airport has become the first airport to offer an autonomous robotaxi service, partnering with Waymo. 

""We were definitely nervous,"" Gallego said. ""It's always easiest to be the mayor who goes third because someone else works out all the kinks, but if you want to build the city of the future, you have got to go first.""

Gallego was named to the second annual CNBC Changemakers list in 2025.

Today, the city has the largest autonomous vehicle zone in the U.S. Travelers can ride in a robotaxi from the airport right into downtown Phoenix. Still, not everyone is onboard with driverless taxis. ""That is an issue that has even divided my own household,"" Gallego said. ""My dad is not a fan of Waymo.""

Gallego says she relishes feedback from the community and often gets great ideas, as well as requests for help, from Phoenix residents while out and about. Still, as a self-described introvert, there are times when she craves anonymity. ""I do sometimes go grocery shopping in a baseball hat and sunglasses,"" she joked. ""Particularly if you're sick, I'm like, 'please don't notice me!'""

To combat anxiety around meeting new people, Gallego has learned to over-prepare for important meetings – which she says is also helpful in the long-run, giving her a deep knowledge of the issues at hand. When it comes to deal-making, she doesn't need to be at the forefront, and is happy to be part of a team, a trait that she says came in handy in the deal with TSMC, which required every level of government to pull together. 

""We often talk about, if you want to go far, you go with a group, and that has definitely been a benefit of being an introvert,"" Gallego said. 

Gallego says she wants to restore people's faith in government and show that, through collaboration with universities, nonprofits and the private sector, communities can come together and achieve great things.  In this fraught political environment, Gallego says she focuses on issues that have broad support across party lines, for example, drawing more high wage jobs to Phoenix and improving cancer diagnosis and care. She also makes a point of having dinner once a month with someone with a very different political perspective. ""I always learn something,"" she said. 

Follow and listen to this and every episode of the ""CNBC Changemakers and Power Players"" podcast on Apple and Spotify.

CNBC is accepting nominations for the third CNBC Changemakers: Women Transforming Business list. The unranked list will recognize a distinguished group of women whose accomplishments have left a mark on the business world and who are paving a path forward.

In this article

Several Novo Nordisk board members will step down from their positions after clashing with the controlling shareholder on the make-up of the firm.

The Danish pharma giant, known for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, said Tuesday that board directors and the Novo Nordisk Foundation — the firm's controlling shareholder — had failed to reach an agreement on the future composition of the board.

""The Board proposed a renewal focusing on addition of select, new competencies while also maintaining continuity, whereas the Board of the Foundation wanted a more extensive reconfiguration,"" said Helge Lund, chair of the board of directors.

The foundation is proposing that its current chair, Lars Rebien Sørensen, will also become chair of the board of directors.

There was no overall disagreement on the company strategy, however, the Novo Nordisk Foundation wanted faster decision-making from the board, Sørensen said, according to comments reported by Reuters.

He added that the board was too slow to recognize market changes in the U.S. and there was a disagreement on managing the change of CEO. The foundation wanted to quickly appoint someone, while the board wanted a more comprehensive process looking at both external and internal candidates.

Sørensen, a former CEO of Novo, initially joined the board of directors as an observer in May this year to help oversee the company's pick of a new chief executive. The 71-year-old is now putting himself forward as chair of the board of directors.

The foundation said Sørensen would take the helm of the board with two main goals: Supporting the company's transformation plans and regaining growth momentum, as well as a plan for the appointment of a new chair who can ""successfully lead the company into the 2030s.""

Copenhagen-listed shares of Novo preliminarily closed 1.3% lower when the trading session ended on Tuesday.

Chair Helge Lund, Vice Chair Henrik Poulsen and the independent board members Laurence Debroux, Andreas Fibig, Sylvie Grégoire, Christina Law and Martin Mackay will not stand for election at the Extraordinary General Meeting, the company said.

Kasim Kutay and employee elected board members Elisabeth Dahl Christensen, Liselotte Hyveled, Mette Bøjer Jensen and Thomas Rantzau will remain on the Board.

Meanwhile, the foundation is proposing that Cees de Jong become vice chair and Britt Meelby Jensen, Mikael Dolsten and Stephan Engels, become members.

Novo Nordisk said the Extraordinary General Meeting will take place on Nov. 14.

Novo has had a tumultuous year as it faces increasing competition in the obesity space. Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen was ousted as CEO in May and replaced by Mike Doustdar.

Doustdar has vowed to reset the company after a period of weaker growth. As part of that reset Novo is cutting around 11.5% of its global workforce as it looks to simplify its business and reallocate resources to its diabetes and obesity businesses.

President Donald Trump's presidency has been uniquely good for businesses, according to Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management.

""I think Trump has been the most pro-business president we've ever had,"" Ackman said Tuesday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

Ackman pointed to infrastructure and tax bills as having positive effects for businesses. He also noted that the Federal Reserve is ""accommodative"" of interest rate cuts.

Ackman acknowledged that he was ""a little bit concerned"" by Trump's market-roiling tariff policy first unveiled in April. However, Ackman credited Trump for changing his position after the billionaire investor suggested taking a pause before implementing the policy.

""I trust the president,"" said Ackman, who has been a public supporter of Trump. ""I think he's done an excellent job.""

While the market initially sold-off after Trump shared his plan for broad and steep levies, the S&P 500 has surged around 19% since the early April announcement. The benchmark index is on track to finish 2025 almost 15% higher. That would mark its third straight annual gain.

Investors have long expected Trump would benefit companies given his emphasis on deregulation. Stocks shot up following his victory in November of last year.

Ackman said geopolitical risk for the market has been declining. Still, he said he wished the U.S. and China had a ""better relationship.""

Ackman's comments come as the U.S. and China have faced off over rare earth minerals in recent weeks.

Trump hiked tariffs this month after China tightened export restrictions on the materials and has pushed for a supply chain that's independent of the Asian country. He signed an agreement with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday focused on rare earths.

On the other hand, Ackman called for chief executives of New York City-based companies to encourage their workers to vote in the mayoral election early next month. Ackman has criticized Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor whose surprise victory in the primary has unsettled Wall Street.

Ackman said Mamdani is ""accurate in identifying the problems with the city,"" pointing specifically to his focus on affordability and public safety. But Ackman said the Democrat has the ""wrong"" policies for solving these challenges.

""We do not want a socialist leading the most important financial city in the country,"" Ackman said in reference to Mamdani.

In this article

Nike is in the midst of a comeback attempt. The world's largest sportswear brand is still trading at less than half of its pandemic-era market valuation, and last year the stock suffered its worst trading day in history — wiping out $28 billion in value in a single session.

Now, nearly a year into his tenure, CEO Elliott Hill says the company is finding its footing. In an exclusive interview at Nike's Beaverton, Oregon, headquarters, Hill outlined a strategy that hinges on innovation, sport, and rebuilding trust with consumers after years of slowing growth and mounting competition.

""My first day on the job, my slide said two things: we're a sport company, and we're a growth company,"" Hill told CNBC. ""When we grow sport, we grow the overall marketplace. And when that happens, I like our chances of growing.""

Hill, a three-decade Nike veteran who returned from retirement last year, has reorganized the company around individual sports rather than around product categories such as men's, women's and kids'. The goal, he says, is to ""bring back the sharpness of sport"" and to compete head-to-head with fast-rising challengers like On Running and Hoka.

Analysts say Nike's lack of product innovation and absence from wholesalers in recent years allowed those upstart rivals to gain market share.

""That was a mistake,"" said Stacey Widlitz, president of SW Retail Advisors. ""When you pull back from that channel and withhold some of your best and newest product, someone else comes in and fills those shelves.""

Under former CEO John Donahoe, the retailer began prioritizing direct-to-consumer sales over its partnerships with wholesalers like Foot Locker and Dick's Sporting Goods. The plan initially saw increased direct sales, but as Covid lockdowns largely lifted in 2021, Nike's revenue from direct channels began stalling.

Hill acknowledged the competition is fierce: ""We opened shelf space, and now we're having to earn it back. But our teams are excited to pivot to a new offense.""

Hill didn't offer specifics around future innovations or product announcements.

The company also faces challenges in clearing excess inventory and offsetting $1.5 billion in tariff-related costs. Watch the above video to learn more about Nike's comeback strategy.

In this article

Coca-Cola reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped expectations, but the beverage giant said that demand for its drinks is still soft but improving.

""After a slower start, we ended with improved performance during the quarter,"" CFO John Murphy said on the company's conference call Tuesday.

Shares of Coke climbed more than 3% in morning trading.

Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting:

Coke reported third-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $3.7 billion, or 86 cents per share, up from $2.85 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding restructuring charges and other items, Coke earned 82 cents per share.

Net sales rose 5% to $12.46 billion. Coke's organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, increased 6%.

The company's unit case volume rose 1%, a reversal from last quarter's decline. The metric excludes the impact of pricing and foreign currency to reflect demand.

But volume in both Latin America and North America, two key markets, was flat for the quarter.

Coke executives have said that low-income consumers in the U.S. have been buying fewer of its products. The company is also seeing higher traffic from dollar stores, another sign that low-income consumers are feeling pinched, CEO James Quincey said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Tuesday. Coke is now trying to target them with ""affordable"" options, like mini cans of its soda, which have a lower price tag but cost more per ounce.

""Despite ongoing differences in spending between income groups and slower traffic across channels, [North American] volume was flat and improved sequentially for the second consecutive quarter,"" Coke Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun said on the company's conference call.

A similar dynamic is occurring in Europe, which also saw volume decline, according to executives. The broader Europe, Middle East and Africa division reported volume growth of 3%.

However, Coke's pricier brands, like Fairlife and Smartwater, have been bright spots for the company, showing that high-income consumers are still willing to pay more for premium drinks.

Worldwide, Coke saw the largest volume growth from its water, sports, coffee and tea segment. Its bottled water and sports drinks both saw volume increase 3%, while coffee and tea reported volume growth of 2%. The company's sparkling soft drinks volume was flat for the quarter, while its juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverage segment reported that volume shrank 3%.

The company reiterated its full-year forecast. Coke is expecting comparable earnings per share to rise 3% and organic revenue to increase 5% to 6%.

Looking ahead to 2026, Coke is projecting a slight tail wind to both its revenue and comparable earnings from currency fluctuations. The company will provide a full forecast for the upcoming year in its fourth-quarter earnings report.

In this article

Consumer goods group Unilever is delaying the spin-off of its Magnum Ice Cream unit due to the U.S. government shutdown, it said on Tuesday, the latest example of global business disruption from the impasse that shows little sign of ending.

Unilever, the maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was currently unable to declare effective the registration statement required for shares of The Magnum Ice Cream Company to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

The primary listing was originally scheduled for November 10 in Amsterdam, with secondary listings planned in New York and London. Unilever will retain a 19.9% stake in the ice cream business that includes Magnum, Ben & Jerry's and Cornetto.

The delay underscores the disruptions caused by the three-week U.S. federal government shutdown, which has hit IPOs, aviation and is expected to cost the U.S. economy as much as $15 billion a week in lost output. 

Seoul-headquartered green energy and technology company DeepGreenX Group withdrew its registration statement for a direct listing in the United States on Monday, due to being unable to communicate with SEC staff.

The Magnum stand-alone ice cream business is a test for investor appetite for a sugar-heavy product in its biggest market at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is pushing to 'Make America Healthy Again'.

Analysts expect the spin-off will benefit Unilever and Magnum by allowing both businesses to become more focused.

Unilever said preparatory work for the demerger was on track and progressing well, and that it remained committed to completing the spin-off process this year. The company's shares were down 0.8% on Tuesday, only slightly lagging rivals.

""We're not concerned by the delay,"" said Anna Farmbrough, UK Quality Portfolio Manager at Unilever investor Ninety One.

""The timing of the listing isn't especially important in the broader context — what matters is the quality of the underlying business and its long-term growth prospects.""

The U.S. market regulator has halted IPO reviews during the shutdown, although earlier this month it eased the way for firms to proceed with listings despite the political gridlock.

Companies are normally prevented from debuting on Wall Street during periods when Congress has not approved funding for government operations, because officials are unable to review and approve registration statements.

That has prompted investor concerns that partisan gridlock in Washington could dent the IPO market.

Companies can allow their statements to become effective automatically, which involves setting their IPO pricing 20 days before the listing instead of finalizing it on the eve of a SEC review, but that can heighten the risk of filing errors or overlooked disclosures.

Despite the delay, Unilever held a general meeting on Tuesday at which shareholders voted in favor of the proposed consolidation of its share capital. However, the implementation timeline for that will also be revised, Unilever said.

In this article

CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC Tuesday that the firm's proposed acquisition of Core Scientific would be a ""nice to have"" rather than a necessity as shareholders prepare to potentially block the deal.

In July, AI cloud provider Coreweave proposed an all-stock deal valued at around $9 billion to buy the Bitcoin miner and data center firm, Core Scientific. Immediately after the news, Core Scientific's stock price fell, plummeting nearly 18%.

The deal has received criticism with key proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommending on Monday that shareholders vote against the acquisition. Core Scientific's share price has conitnued to rise after the deal was announced which suggests some investors think that the company is valued higher than what CoreWeave has offered, ISS said.

Intrator said that he was ""disappointed"" by the ISS report and continues to believe that the deal is ""in the long-term interest of Core Scientific shareholders."" However, CoreWeave will not raise the price of the offer.

""We think that the bid that we put out there for [Core Scientific] is a fair representation of the relative value of the two companies as an all stock deal,"" Intrator told CNBC. ""We are going to just kind of proceed as we have, in the event that the transaction does not go through. It is a nice to have, not a need to have for us.""

""Everything has a value, and the number we put out is the value we're willing to pay for them under all circumstances,"" Intrator added.

Earlier this month Two Seas Capital, a major Core Scientific shareholder publicly opposed the acquisition saying that the price CoreWeave is offering is too low. Shareholders will vote on the deal on October 30.

""We see no reason why Core Scientific shareholders should accept such an underwhelming deal. Based on recent trading data, we see little evidence that they will,"" Two Seas Capital said in a Friday letter to shareholders.

CoreWeave has aggressive pursued acqusitions this year to buy AI-related firms like OpenPipe, Weights & Biases, and Monolith as it looks to expand its product offering.

The company, which has built data centers and offers Nvidia-powered computing power to hyperscalers like Microsoft, has been riding the wave of artificial intelligence investments.

""We've been in acquisitive mode as we continue to build and extend the functionality of our company,"" Intrator said.

China on Tuesday responded to the U.S.-Australia critical minerals deal by saying resource-rich rare earth countries should take ""a proactive role"" in stabilizing their critical minerals supply chains.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked about the U.S. and Australia critical minerals deal which has been framed as an effort to counter Beijing's dominance.

""The formation of global production and supply chains is the result of market and corporate choices,"" Guo Jiakun said, according to NBC.

""Resource-rich nations with critical minerals should play a proactive role in safeguarding the security and stability of the industrial and supply chains, and ensure normal economic and trade cooperation,"" he added.

Rare earths are a category of minerals that are critical for a swath of products from cars to semiconductors.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday signed an agreement at the White House intended to boost the supplies of rare earths and other critical minerals.

The framework agreement, which was described as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies, comes shortly after China imposed more stringent export controls on rare earths.

China's Commerce Ministry earlier this month announced expanded curbs on the export of rare earths and related technologies, seeking to prevent the ""misuse"" of minerals in the military and other sensitive sectors.

Western automotive industry groups have been among those to raise the alarm over the new export controls, saying the measures could pave the way to a period of supply chain chaos.

Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years as the clean energy transition picks up pace.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, accounting for roughly 60% of the world's production of rare earth minerals and materials. U.S. officials have previously warned that this poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

George Cheveley, natural resources portfolio manager at investment firm Ninety One, described the U.S. and Australia agreement as a long time coming, but ""a good deal"" designed to boost the supply of critical minerals outside of China.

""From an investment point of view, it is not so obvious. This is a very small sector,"" Cheveley told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.

""And clearly when you're dealing with a sector so politicized and where government money is being put in essentially as a subsidy, it is telling you that it is difficult to make it work economically,"" he added.

Shares of some of Australia's largest critical metals and rare earths companies jumped on Tuesday, while others lost ground after an early rally.

Lynas Rare Earths, Australia's largest rare earths producer by market capitalization, fell 7.6% after posting gains earlier in the session. Mineral sand miner Iluka Resources slipped 0.1%, while lithium producer Pilbara Minerals added around 2.6%.

Latrobe Magnesium, Australia's primary producer of the critical metal magnesium, notched gains of more than 15%.

Stateside, rare earths stocks were last seen slightly lower in premarket trading. Critical Metals slipped 3.8%, USA Rare Earth fell 5% and MP Materials lost 1.9%.

Bitcoin BTC$113,023.06 is catching a bid on Tuesday as the record rally in precious metals reverses in a big way.

Gold saw a 5% decline to $4,130, its biggest daily drawdown in years. Silver also tumbled nearly 8%. The metals had surged over the past few months fueled by central banks moving into monetary easing mode, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and signs of liquidity and credit stress in the financial system. Frustratingly to bitcoin bulls, though, those catalysts had provided little boost to the world's largest crypto, which — with a couple of brief exceptions — has remained stuck in a tight range for months.

With the metals for at least this moment having fallen out of favor, however, money is flowing into bitcoin, which has rebounded to $112,700 after having dropped below $108,000 just hours ago. Ether ETH$4,035.93 also erased its overnight decline, bouncing back above $4,000.

Quinn Thomson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, said last week that BTC is poised to catch up to gold's rally. Charlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree, also argued that bitcoin's time to rally will come when gold rolls over to consolidate.

Crypto-related stocks haven't really gotten the news, with most in the red on Tuesday, particularly the bitcoin miners, many of which are now trading more as AI infrastructure plays.

IREN (IREN), Hut 8 (HUT) and Bitfarms (BITF) are lower by 3%-4%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is down 1.2% and Coinbase (COIN) is lower by 0.5%. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is managing a 1.7% gain.

Oops, something went wrong

Andre Cronje, a prominent figure in decentralized finance, has publicly criticized the Ethereum Foundation (EF) for what he describes as a complete lack of support for developers building on the network.

Cronje said he has spent over 700 Ethereum on deployments and infrastructure without receiving any assistance or acknowledgment, resulting in a broader debate about the foundation's role in supporting ecosystem builders.

“I tried contacting EF, never a response, no BD outreach, no grants, 0 support, not even a retweet,” Cronje said.

In a post on X, Cronje questioned where the Ethereum Foundation's resources were going, stating that despite burning hundreds of ETH, he has received no business development outreach, no grants, and no engagement of any kind.

He compared his experience to that of projects within the Sonic ecosystem, where teams often receive consistent funding, audits, and marketing assistance.

However, Cronje is not the only one who feels overlooked by Ethereum's leadership. Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal expressed similar dissatisfaction with Ethereum's institutional support.

Nailwal said that despite Polygon's crucial role in scaling Ethereum, the foundation has provided direct support to his team and has often failed to recognize Polygon's layer-2 contributions.

He alleged that the Ethereum community “ensures Polygon is never considered an L2.”

“When Polymarket wins big, it's ‘Ethereum,' but Polygon itself is not Ethereum. Mind-boggling,” said Nailwal.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin later responded, thanking Polygon for its early efforts in zero-knowledge technology and its ongoing work in integrating scaling solutions. He also acknowledged the real-world impact of Polygon's community-driven initiatives like CryptoRelief.

Buterin credited Polygon for the success of Polymarket, which he called one of the most successful non-financial Ethereum applications.

Buterin explained that many L2 teams are now separating from ZK teams, allowing specialized expertise to flourish in each domain. He said that he remains optimistic that Polygon could soon adopt off-the-shelf ZK systems to achieve full Ethereum Layer 2 security guarantees.

 Polygon's Sandeep Nailwal slammed the Ethereum community for underappreciating Polygon's role in the Ethereum ecosystem, prompting a response from Vitalik Buterin. 

Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal has criticized Ethereum's leaders for dismissing Polygon's status as a true Ethereum layer 2 — noting contributions that Polygon has made to Ethereum while receiving little recognition for those efforts.

Nailwal, who also serves as the Polygon Foundation's CEO, said he is now “questioning his loyalty” to Ethereum — particularly the Ethereum Foundation and the community, which, according to him, hasn't given Polygon any direct support.

“In fact, the reverse,” Nailwal said in a post to X on Monday, adding that he has given his loyalty to Ethereum even though it has potentially cost him billions of dollars in Polygon's valuation not to brand itself as a layer 1. 

“The Ethereum community as a whole has been a shit show for quite some time,” Nailwal said, adding that the “Ethereum community needs to take a hard look at itself.” 

His post later prompted a response from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who made a point to acknowledge Polygon's achievements in the broader Ethereum community.

Nailwal isn't the only industry leader who has handed out heavy criticism to the EF, which has undergone a major leadership overhaul over the last 12 months.

Nailwal cited a post from a former EF researcher Péter Szilágyi who shared an 18-month-old letter expressing his frustration with his old workplace, while Eric Conner, one of Ethereum's earliest developers, left in January, citing concerns with Buterin's leadership decisions.

He received some support, including from Solana co-founder Raj Gokal and former Solana Foundation head of strategy Austin Federa, who both suggested that Polygon “team up” with Solana or become a layer 2 on the Ethereum-rival network.

In response to Nailwal's post, Buterin acknowledged Polygon's contributions to Ethereum, noting that it hosts the largest predictions market platform in Polymarket and has advanced zk-EVM technology, among other things.

Buterin also praised Nailwal's personal efforts with CryptoRelief, which has funded biomedical infrastructure and research in India.

Buterin did, however, note that Polygon lacks a proof system to get the full security guarantees that Ethereum layer 2s are meant to provide in response to Nailwal's claim that Polygon isn't treated as such.

He pointed out that Polygon could easily “pick up off the shelf a ZK tech stack” that will enable a proof system, adding that the technology has “gotten quite good” with proving costs now as cheap as $0.0001 per transaction.

Nailwal hasn't responded to Buterin's comments.

Quick Facts:

There's no stopping BitMine Immersion in its quest to hold 5% of the total Ethereum ($ETH) supply. The treasury company bought the dip over the past week, emerging a winner in the recent market downturn.

The company has acquired over $800M-worth of $ETH since last week, bringing its total holdings to 3,236,014 $ETH. As it stands, it's still the largest Ethereum treasury company, with Sharplink at second with 838,728 $ETH.

But it's not just Ethereum that's making a lot of noise as of late, as institutions go on a buying spree and snap up the best altcoins at a steep discount. Among these is Best Wallet Token ($BEST), whose ongoing presale continues to pump.

In a statement released yesterday, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee said that the current drop in the price of Ethereum represents ‘an attractive risk/reward.'

This comes as the altcoin's value had slid sharply below $3,700, not long after hitting $4,740 in the first week of October.

Lee added that the company's acquisition of an additional 203,826 $ETH yesterday brings its holdings to 2.7% of the coin's total supply.

‘We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%' of ETH,' he said.

Bitmine's latest acquisition extends its weekly Ethereum purchases that stretch back to August this year. It also signals the firm's bullishness on the market's second-most valuable cryptocurrency despite current headwinds.

This reignites retail traders' hope for Ethereum, but also related tokens within the ecosystem. Aide from $ETH, investors have also trained their eyes on other attractive deals in the current market climate.

New crypto projects, in particular, have gotten a lot of attention, since they offer predictable price increases throughout tiered presales — a valuable thing in today's volatile market.

Among these projects, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has positioned itself as one of the best altcoins at the moment.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has several things going for it: real utility, steady price increases through presale stages, and an extremely affordable entry for early adopters.

First, the utility. Considering the wild dips we're seeing in the current crypto market, traders have a growing preference for tokens with real utility rather than speculation. And Best Wallet Token delivers.

It is, after all, the native token of the Best Wallet app — a multi-chain, self-custody crypto app with over 500K downloads in app stores.

Within this wallet ecosystem, $BEST holder enjoy exclusive perks, such as lower transaction fees, governance rights, and early access to the best crypto presales through a proprietary Token Launchpad.

For a full crypto token guide, see our ‘What is Best Wallet Token' page.

Then there are the price increase stages throughout the presale. Buying tokens early gives investors the change to enjoy a steady appreciation throughout upcoming stages as the fundraiser progresses.

Finally, there's the affordable price. At the moment, $BEST tokens sell for $0.025825, which makes it a very cheap investment, considering the perks you can enjoy as a token holder.

The option to stake tokens means an additional staking reward, currently 79% p.a., which is well above even what the best bluechip crypto liquidity pools offer. Take note, though, that staking rewards are dynamic and can drop as more investors stake their tokens.

💰 Want to join the $BEST presale? Our detailed guide on how to buy Best Wallet Token will take you through the entire process.

With over $16.6M raised so far, holder perks, and an extensive roadmap including wallet ecosystem expansion and DeFi integration, Best Wallet Token is undoubtedly one of the hottest crypto fundraisers of the year.

But with a little over a day until the next price increase, now's the best time to get your share of this emerging crypto gem.

                            Here's Why the Crypto Market is Down | Credit: Hameem Sarwar                        


Key Takeaways

The cryptocurrency market is showing bearish signs as key support levels risk giving way.

After an explosive run earlier this year, both TOTALCAP and ALTCAP signal weakness with fresh breakdowns.

Momentum indicators suggest bearishness, and the market may have already reached its peak.

The big question is: has the crypto bear market begun, or is there still room for one last push higher?

TOTALCAP has fallen since reaching its all-time high of $4.27 trillion in October.

The crypto market is down by 15% and risks breaking down from the $3.60 trillion horizontal area.

This area is critical since it acted as resistance throughout the year until the price finally broke out in June.

If the crypto market crashes below this level, it will mean that the previous breakout was a deviation and the trend is bearish.

A breakdown would turn the $3.60 trillion area into resistance, preventing any upward attempts.

Momentum indicators give extremely bearish readings. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) have created bearish divergences in both the long-term (black) and short-term (orange) trends.

The MACD has also made a bearish cross (black circle), another sign of a bearish trend.

So, the weekly time frame price action suggests a breakdown is the most likely future outlook, taking the crypto market down to new lows.

The wave count agrees, since it shows that TOTALCAP is in the fifth and final wave of the current bull cycle.

While the crypto market may create a slightly higher high before crashing, it is likely in an ending diagonal, so a decisive breakdown is likely soon.

The ascending wedge coincides with the $3.60 trillion support area, so a breakdown below both will be the final confirmation that new lows are likely.

If that happens, the crypto market could drop to $2.92 trillion and $2.50 trillion.

The sentiment for altcoins is even worse than that of the broader crypto market. 

It has already confirmed its bearish outlook with a deviation and breakdown below the $1.6 trillion horizontal area. 

Several other bearish signs are developing, all suggesting that the TOTALCAP trend is be

The RSI and MACD have generated bearish divergences, and the latter has already made a bearish cross (black circle).

Moreover, a clearly defined five-wave upward movement (green) with an extended third wave (black) is visible, indicating that the upward movement has ended. 

Finally, an ascending parallel channel contains the altcoin market cap movement.

Its inability to move to the channel's resistance trend line and subsequent breakdown below the midline are all signs that the trend is bearish.

If the decline continues, the closest support level will be the channel's trend line, which is $1.2 trillion.

The crypto market sentiment is pessimistic, with TOTALCAP holding onto critical support and ALTCAP already confirming a bearish breakdown.

Technicals and the wave count point toward the end of the current cycle, with new lows likely on the horizon.

While a short-term bounce or a marginal new high remains possible, the structure suggests a deeper correction.

Roughly a decade ago, cryptocurrency began to show up in the residential real estate market. There were stories of the first bitcoin home sale, but really it was just people buying in the currency and then converting it back to dollars. 

Now crypto is being used more for leverage. Lenders like Propy are using it as collateral for both residential and commercial property loans, so buyers don't actually have to sell their bitcoin or other digital currency in order to buy. They want to keep the crypto, because it generally appreciates far faster than the housing market. 

Investors can certainly use cryptocurrency to buy commercial real estate assets, but it's the blockchain, where crypto lives, that the CRE industry is finally, albeit slowly, adopting.

""Commercial is definitely right around the corner from really embracing it, so we're on the edge,"" said Tony Giordano, founder of the Opulent Agency.  

Giordano is a luxury real estate broker, who was an early crypto pioneer in the space. He began educating his fellow brokers, through social media and conferences, about how to buy and sell properties in bitcoin. Now he's exploring how it's impacting the commercial sector. 

""I don't see how the entire real estate industry will not be on the blockchain within 10 years. You know, it's just here, and people are recording everything already on it, and it's the most secure platform and technology to do it,"" he said. 

Giordano describes the blockchain as a great, big virtual filing cabinet, where billions of records can live into eternity without risk. That includes cryptocurrency, mortgage bonds, titles, deeds, literally everything.

A report from Deloitte examined how it is already transforming the commercial real estate market: 

""Until recently, blockchain was known more as the technology powering Bitcoin. However, industry players now realize that blockchain-based smart contracts can play a much larger role in CRE, potentially transforming core CRE operations such as property transactions (purchase, sale, financing, leasing, and management). Over time, blockchain adoption can have a broader impact, as it can be linked to public utility services such as smart parking, waste, water, and energy billing, and also enable data-driven city management,"" the report said. 

There are several ways of using the blockchain for commercial real estate finance. One is tokenization. This process converts ownership rights of a CRE asset into digital tokens, allowing for fractional ownership and easier trading of shares in a property. For now, however, U.S. citizens cannot invest in U.S. real estate that has been tokenized, because it's still regulated, but international investors can.

Another report published last April by Deloitte, specifically on tokenization, said, ""This technology could help build trillions of dollars of economic activity for the real estate sector over the next decade, in part, by allowing it to expand its investor base and product offerings.""

Roughly $4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035, increasing from less than $300 billion in 2024, according to the Deloitte Center for Financial Services.

Then there's the finance opportunity. Giordano pointed to BV Innovation, a blockchain platform creating transferable mortgage bonds for commercial and residential financing on the blockchain. Its AI-enabled software helps commercial real estate finance companies to transfer loans with their current interest rates from one property to another. 

""It would open up so many more transactions if people weren't sitting on that interest rate. So now, with AI and blockchain, he can plug it into any bank and allow it to transfer the mortgage and interest rate to the new property,"" Giordano explained.

AI automatically does the risk analysis on the new property, making the bank feel safe that it's a quality property for the existing interest rate. The owner doesn't have to pay the prepayment penalty that is very common in commercial real estate. This allows them to use what would have been a prepayment penalty as assets to invest in another property. Giordano argues it's not as complicated as it seems.

""I think it's easy for them to understand once you say, you have a 4.5% rate on this $20 million number. You also have a prepayment penalty for seven more years that doesn't allow you to sell the building without paying a $4 million penalty,"" he explained.  

""They don't have to understand that AI and blockchain is on the back end helping the bank do it. They just understand that it's secure from the blockchain.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Coinbase to US: Embrace blockchain if you want to fight crime on it","https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-urges-ai-blockchain-aml-crypto-crime","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 04:08:30 GMT","

 Coinbase urges US Treasury to fight crypto crime with blockchain analytics, AI and APIs  —and to create safe-harbors so firms can deploy them to modernize AML. 

Crypto exchange Coinbase has urged the US government to use blockchain analytics, artificial intelligence and other modern technology to curb financial crime in the space, in response to the Treasury Department's request for comment on how to deter illicit activity in crypto. 

In the letter penned by chief legal officer Paul Grewal, dated Oct. 17 and shared to X on Monday, he argued money laundering schemes have become increasingly sophisticated through the use of advanced technologies, and law enforcement needs to follow suit to counter them. 

“Doing so would support a primary objective of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which sought to modernize the Bank Secrecy Act,” he added. 

Coinbase's chief policy officer, Faryar Shirzad, reiterated this stance in an X post on Monday, arguing the US government should follow in the footsteps of crypto exchanges by embracing “innovation to modernize AML with proven digital tools like AI, APIs, digital IDs and blockchain analytics.” 

Among the measures Grewal wants Treasury to consider is a regulatory exception under the Bank Secrecy Act for companies using AI and Application Programming Interfaces (API) driven monitoring tools. 

“The conditions for that safe-harbor should focus on governance and outcomes, as opposed to forcing a one-sized-fits-all model,” he said in a follow-up X post on Monday. 

Companies have been hesitant to fully unlock AI in Anti-Money Laundering measures because of a lack of regulatory clarity, according to Grewal.

He also thinks APIs face challenges such as a lack of standardization and regulatory fragmentation, which a guidance “outlining acceptable use cases” would solve by clearly showing “data privacy requirements and standards for interoperability — allowing firms to confidently adopt and integrate APIs into their programs.” 

At the same time, Grewal wants Treasury to publish guidance recognizing and incentivizing decentralized IDs and zero-knowledge proofs as valid forms of customer verification and blockchain analytics clustering for Anti-Money Laundering compliance.

“The updated guidance should further encourage the sharing of information relevant to potential illicit activities routed through blockchains, while being careful not to overimpose recordkeeping obligations on everyone involved in a blockchain transaction,” Grewal added.

In its Aug. 18 notice, the US Treasury asked for comments, which closed last Friday, on innovative methods to detect illicit activity involving digital assets, as required by the GENIUS Act. 

Meanwhile, Jim Harper, a non-resident Senior Fellow with the public policy think tank the American Enterprise Institute, had a different approach.

In his Monday blog post, which drew on his Sept. 15 paper pushing the same idea, he argues that a communication system should be established where law enforcement agencies can directly query crypto firms for investigative purposes. 

“Such a system would maintain or strengthen law enforcement capabilities while obviating the existing broad and costly financial surveillance regime,"" he said.

BySandy Carter,

Contributor.

Blockchain technology is democratizing space by enabling decentralized ownership and governance, shifting control from traditional institutions to universal participation.Key projects include SpaceCoin building satellite-based blockchain networks (DePIN) and Copernic Space tokenizing real-world space assets and lunar domains.The TON blockchain is pioneering ""space democracy"" through on-chain voting to select civilian astronauts for Blue Origin flights, making space travel accessible to a global public.

From Bitcoin's first space transaction to tokenized lunar domains, blockchain is powering a new decentralized space race that makes access and ownership universal.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut. I dreamed about floating in zero gravity, watching Earth spin beneath me, and maybe one day walking on the moon. While I never made it to space, life came full circle later while at AWS, when I worked with a partner who helped Rover get to Mars.

That experience reminded me that there are many ways to explore new frontiers, and today, one of the most exciting isn't through rockets but through code. Blockchain, the technology that started with digital money, is now expanding into orbit.

Space has always captured human imagination. For decades, it was the realm of governments, billionaires, and aerospace giants. 

Now a quiet revolution is bringing it within reach of everyone. Blockchain is moving beyond finance and into orbit, building a foundation for a decentralized space economy.

Decentralized space is the merging of blockchain with space exploration. It uses smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized governance to open participation in the space economy to anyone with a digital wallet. 

Instead of relying on a few large institutions, decentralized space allows communities, creators, and investors to co-own and co-govern assets such as satellites, payloads, or even lunar missions. It brings transparency and inclusivity to a domain that has long been exclusive, creating an open network where access and ownership extend beyond Earth.

It merges space technology with Web3 principles of transparency, inclusivity, and verifiable ownership which creates an open network where anyone can contribute to humanity's journey beyond Earth.

According to PWC, Space will be the first new trillion-dollar asset class of the 21st century and the first that can exist natively on-chain. 

The roots of decentralized space trace back to Bitcoin.  In 2019, SpaceChain launched its blockchain node into orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. That node enabled Bitcoin multi-signature transactions from space, marking the first-ever blockchain and Bitcoin transaction in orbit. Bitcoin just recently hit an All Time High and then went down again, much like rocketships do!

That milestone proved that blockchain could function off-planet and be independent of terrestrial infrastructure. It inspired a wave of projects exploring how digital assets and decentralized systems could support future space missions. 

What began with Bitcoin has now expanded into a full ecosystem, where tokens, domains, and smart contracts connect people to space in ways never before possible.

Three pioneering projects are leading this transformation

Together, they show how the future of space can be shared by many.

SpaceCoin's vision is simple but radical. It aims to create a network of satellites that transmit blockchain transactions directly through space instead of relying on Earth's internet. In a recent test, SpaceCoin successfully transmitted data between continents through satellite link alone. That data was not just a signal; it was a blockchain record sent across orbit.

This idea belongs to a new category called Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePIN. These projects use blockchain to power real-world infrastructure rather than purely digital systems. SpaceCoin's network could serve remote regions, censored areas, and space-based devices that need secure communication without dependence on terrestrial internet.

The implications are enormous. 

In chatting with Taekyung Oh, Founder and CEO of SpaceCoin, at Token 2049, he told me that “Space is the ultimate decentralized frontier. With DePIN, we are turning satellites into nodes of a global network where connectivity, computation, and coordination happen beyond borders and even beyond Earth.”

If blockchain can operate from orbit, transactions, identities, and governance systems become independent of Earth's limitations. A space-based blockchain could enable global connectivity, resilient to censorship or natural disasters, and ready for the era of interplanetary communication. The challenges remain significant such as satellite costs, regulatory issues, and reliability, but the concept of a blockchain that literally reaches for the stars is no longer science fiction.

If SpaceCoin provides the infrastructure, Copernic Space brings ownership and the financial infrastructure that powers this new economy. Connecting real-world space assets to global capital markets through blockchain technology, the company is pioneering the tokenization of missions, payloads, and even digital identities to transform how space assets are represented, financed, and traded.

Did you know that Copernic Space partnered with SpaceChain to create a commercial marketplace for tokenized space assets? This partnership built on SpaceChain's earlier work proving that blockchain starting with Bitcoin that could operate off-planet.

And recently, in collaboration with Unstoppable Domains (my employer), Copernic launched the .LUNAR domain extension, the first domain to be tied to real space missions. Each .LUNAR badge will be sent to the Moon on a scheduled mission in 2026-2027. That makes every domain a tokenized real-world asset linked to space. Owning one means holding a verified piece of digital identity that will literally travel beyond Earth.Copernic Space has already demonstrated how this model works in practice. Its already commercialized rockets and its first Moon Mission earlier this year sold out with over 2,000 tokenized payloads of individuals and companies landing on the Moon, generating revenue and delivering returns to early participants. 

In chatting with Grant Blaisdell, CEO of Copernic Space, he told me that “decentralization gives space back to humanity. For the first time, people everywhere can own a small but meaningful stake of what happens beyond Earth. By combining blockchain with space missions and ventures, we are creating a transparent, participatory ecosystem where the next great discoveries belong to everyone, not just a few institutions.”

Copernic describes itself as a marketplace for buying, selling, and investing in tokenized space ventures. This model opens the door for individuals to participate in the space economy through blockchain-based ownership. The idea is to turn space into an open and accessible market that anyone can take part in. It redefines how we think about digital property. Instead of owning a website, you might own a domain that represents a payload on a rocket, a satellite, or a lunar mission.

But this goes beyond collectibles. By allowing fractional ownership of real missions and infrastructure, Copernic Space makes participation in the space economy more transparent, liquid, and inclusive. While regulations around space ownership are still evolving, the shift is already underway. 

For the first time, space is becoming a market that belongs to everyone, not just governments and large corporations.

While SpaceCoin builds infrastructure and Copernic focuses on assets, TON is opening direct access to space. The TON Foundation, the organization behind the blockchain that powers Telegram, has partnered with the Space Exploration and Research Agency (SERA) to launch Mission Control. 

This program uses blockchain to select real civilian astronauts for a Blue Origin flight through an on-chain voting system.

SERA has secured six seats on the upcoming New Shepard mission, planned for 2026. Five are reserved for citizens from underrepresented countries such as India, Nigeria, Brazil, Thailand, and Indonesia. 

The sixth seat will go to a global participant chosen through voting on the TON blockchain. Participants use the TON wallet integrated in Telegram to earn points and cast votes. Every vote is recorded on-chain for transparency and fairness.

""SERA isn't another crypto project launch, it's truly a one-of-a-kind initiative. It feels more like an experiment in what happens when crypto collides with an experience-driven, participatory culture,"" said Max Crown, President and CEO of TON Foundation. ""They're literally putting people into space, and if you've got Telegram and a Wallet, you can be part of it. It's wild. I've always believed that people don't connect with how tech works. They connect with what it does, and how it makes them feel. That's what matters. We're not talking about using tech to change lives. We're actually doing it. This is the moment blockchain shifts from just being technology to becoming an experience.""

This initiative is historic. It marks the first time that blockchain technology will directly influence who gets to travel to space. Instead of government committees or corporate sponsors, access is being opened to a global audience. TON calls it “space democracy,” where users earn their chance to go to space by participating in a transparent, tokenized process.

The significance goes beyond one mission. 

It demonstrates how blockchain can extend inclusion from financial systems to space exploration. TON's integration with Telegram gives it a vast audience, bringing the dream of space closer to billions of people. It is not just about technology; it is about participation.

The path forward is not without obstacles. Regulation remains the biggest unknown. 

Questions about who governs tokenized lunar assets or how liability works in orbit have no clear answers. Technical hurdles such as satellite lifespan, launch cost, and communication latency will test every innovation. 

Market adoption also depends on proving real utility beyond hype.

There are ethical questions as well. Space must not become another venue for inequality or exploitation. If blockchain opens space participation, it must do so fairly and sustainably. The emerging industry will need to balance ambition with responsibility. 

Despite the challenges, the direction is unmistakable. 

The space economy is expanding rapidly, and blockchain is becoming part of its infrastructure. SpaceCoin, Copernic Space, and TON are demonstrating how decentralization can make the final frontier more open and inclusive.

This matters because it signals a shift in power and possibility. The same technologies that once made finance more inclusive are now doing the same for exploration and discovery. 

As these projects evolve, we may soon witness the first blockchain transaction from orbit, the first domain that lands on the Moon, and the first astronaut chosen entirely by a decentralized vote. 

The gap between cyberspace and outer space is closing. The blockchain and bitcoin revolution has officially left Earth's orbit.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

 Coinbase has paid $25 million for an NFT that compels the once popular crypto podcast UpOnly to restart. Bull market vibes anyone? 

Crypto exchange Coinbase has spent $25 million to acquire and burn a non-fungible token (NFT) designed to revive the once popular crypto podcast called UpOnly.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that the “rumors are true” on Tuesday, adding that the firm bought the NFT to bring back the UpOnly podcast for a new season. 

Onchain data from Arkham Intelligence also confirmed that Coinbase sent $25 million USDC to a wallet controlled by podcast host and crypto influencer Jordan Fish, also known as “Cobie.”

The original podcast was popular during the 2021 bull market and featured interviews with prominent crypto figures. It was notably sponsored by FTX before the exchange collapsed.

UpOnly's last episode was uploaded to YouTube in December 2022, shortly after the FTX collapse. In May, Cobie said “I am no longer the decision maker on if Up Only returns.” 

The NFT was listed on OpenSea but the highest offer bid was just 4.7 ETH, or around $18,500, so Coinbase appears to have vastly overpaid for it.

The NFT now ranks as the fifth most expensive NFTs sold in crypto's history. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase but did not receive an immediate response. 

“Ah man wtf,” Cobie responded on X, stating that it has been three years since UpOnly ended. “I was in my 20s when it started, now I have grey hair. We will rename it Unc Only and I will spend $25m on cosmetic surgery. See ya soon,” he added.

“Time to go live Unc,” replied Coinbase. 

UpOnly describes itself as podcast “prioritizing entertainment before alpha but mostly there is neither.”

As the news broke, a memecoin called UPONLY on the Coinbase layer-2 network Base skyrocketed 7,900% before dumping, while the COBIE memecoin on Base exploded 5,800%, according to DEX Screener. 

A Solana-based memecoin with the same UPONLY ticker pumped around 250% at the same time.

“An UPONLY memecoin went to $50M in 2024 on Solana, but UpOnlyTV wasn't resumed. Now that Coinbase spent $25M on resuming UpOnly, let's send a Base memecoin to $500M,” said crypto investor “Rune.”

Today's top news:

Crypto majors are red overnight; BTC -2% at $108,500

Coinbase buys Cobie's Echo + Up Only NFT for $375M

Coinbase urges US Treasury Dept to update its AML rules for new age

Prediction markets combine for $2B+ in weekly volume, new record

SLERF team processes 35,000 SOL in refunds

Coinbase just made a massive bet.

And its $25M NFT purchase was just the appetizer for what is now a blockbuster deal.

Last night, Coinbase bought the infamous Up Only NFT from Cobie and Ledger for $25M.

That NFT, listed at $25M as a joke, gives the buyer the right to redeem 8 episodes of the Up Only show hosted by Cobie and Ledger Status.

For those unfamiliar, Up Only was the defining livestream of the last cycle—a chaotic, unfiltered, A-list crypto show hosted by Cobie and Ledger that routinely pulled in huge views and dominated Crypto Twitter discourse from 2021–2023.

Now we know that Coinbase actually buried the lede.

This morning, Coinbase shared that they have also bought Cobie's Echo platform for $375M (the Up Only NFT was included in this package).

Echo is widely considered the top on-chain capital raising platform (think: ICOs) and has helped raise $140M+ from 9,000+ individuals across 340 deals.

Now, Coinbase will integrate it to support broader crypto token sales via Sonar and plan to expand into tokenized securities and RWAs over time.

“The “why” is simple. We want to create more accessible, efficient, and transparent capital markets.” - Coinbase, in their acquisition post

“when i started building echo 2 years ago, i knew it had 95% chance of failing. to be honest, i couldnt really imagine any other outcome, but i thought at least it may be a noble failure worth attempting. i certainly didn't think echo would be sold to coinbase, but, here we are: today coinbase bought echo for ~$375m.” - Echo founder, Cobie

Regarding the Echo acquisition, this feels like a major win for the on-chain economy.

Builders will have easier access to capital and community via fundraising tools.

Investors will also have new opportunities to invest in early-stage crypto products (and soon, tokenized securities and RWAs).

Coinbase wins here as well, as they continue to expand beyond an initial CEX model.

CT wins here too, with its favorite show coming back, and hopefully it will ignite the bull market along with it.

There will be big attention put on which guests they choose, and why.

It seems like Hyperliquid founder Jeff is already in talks to be the first guest, which will put Hyperliquid (and the HYPE token) in the limelight.

Whatever future guests get selected will get similar attention, and expect fierce competition.

The show's return likely does put more attention on CT's growing financial entertainment sector, with streamers like Threadguy pulling in big dollars from brands like Phantom and Polymarket, and shops like Blockworks and The Rollup fine-tuning their streams lately (along with some big sponsors).

Now let's hope the “up only” meme turns into reality…

A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye:

Coinbase has bought the Up Only NFT from crypto investor Jordan Fish, better known to the crypto community as “Cobie,” for $25 million in USDC — part of a larger $375 million transaction that also includes the acquisition of Echo, Cobie's community-based crypto fundraising platform.

The purchase sets the stage for a potential revival of the cult-favorite crypto talk show UpOnlyTV.

The Up Only NFT is not a typical collectible; it acts as a contractual mechanism requiring Cobie and his co-host Brian Krogsgard, or “Ledger Status,” to produce eight new episodes after the NFT is activated or “burned.”

“Just burnt the NFT. Your move,” said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on X, sharing details of the transaction.

“It has been 3 years since Up Only ended. I was in my 20s when it started, now I have grey hair. We will rename it Unc Only and I will spend $25m on cosmetic surgery. See ya soon,” said Cobie.

Echo, founded by Cobie, has enabled over $200 million in funding across 300 projects and offers tools for both private and public token sales, including its self-hosted Sonar product.

Coinbase said the acquisition would help simplify fundraising for startups while expanding early access to deals for individual investors. Though it's starting with token sales, the company hinted at future plans to support tokenized securities and real-world assets.

The move follows Coinbase's recent purchase of Liquifi and continues a trend of building out infrastructure aimed at controlling more of the crypto project lifecycle.

Coinbase has just dropped $25 million to snag a non-fungible token (NFT) aimed at bringing back the UpOnly podcast. This isn't just a random purchase; it's a full-on strategy to bring back the show that was once a big deal in the crypto community. This move is eye-opening, to say the least, showcasing how crypto companies are finding new ways to monetize content.

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, confirmed that they bought the NFT to revive UpOnly for a new season. The NFT has made its way to a wallet controlled by the podcast host, Jordan Fish, aka ‘Cobie.' This not only shows the growing role of blockchain in media but also raises questions about how companies are going to handle content monetization in the future.

UpOnly hit the scene during the 2021 bull market, and it was a hit for its interviews with big names in crypto. The podcast was even sponsored by FTX before it crumbled, leading to its hiatus in December 2022. Cobie himself noted how much time has passed since the last episode, which says a lot about the podcast's cultural significance.

The NFT purchase has caused quite a stir, with a memecoin called UPONLY going up by 7,900% after the news. This is an interesting intersection of crypto media and market movements, showing how news can shift asset prices dramatically.

Reviving UpOnly with an NFT purchase is a glimpse into a larger trend in the crypto world: using blockchain tech to change how content is monetized. NFTs give creators a way to own their work and keep creative control, which opens up new revenue streams beyond the usual ads or subscriptions. This could be a game changer for creators and their audiences.

On top of that, NFTs can function as contracts that secure media creation without sacrificing editorial independence. This not only keeps the content's integrity intact but also resonates with the crypto community's values of decentralization and engagement.

As Coinbase's investment in UpOnly signals a shift in content monetization, it also raises questions about the future of crypto payroll. Companies are now seriously looking into the idea of paying employees in digital currencies, and this isn't just a fad. It's about flexibility and new financial avenues for workers.

Crypto payroll platforms are popping up, offering businesses the ability to pay salaries in stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. This is in line with the growing trend of companies adopting crypto payments, which makes payroll management faster and more transparent. Companies that adapt to this change may be leading the way into a new financial age.

Coinbase's $25 million investment in the UpOnly NFT is a revival of a podcast, but it's also a major shift in how crypto companies view content monetization and community involvement. As NFTs keep changing the media game, the integration of cryptocurrencies into payroll systems is becoming more mainstream.

The future looks promising for crypto payroll and media integration, with innovative solutions emerging to meet the needs of a changing workforce. The UpOnly revival offers insights that could guide other crypto startups navigating this new media and payment landscape. The potential for growth and change in this area is enormous, suggesting we're on the brink of a new financial transaction and community content era.

Major US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has acquired Echo, a platform that allows communities to raise capital targeting early-stage projects and startups.

Coinbase struck a $375 million deal to acquire Echo, a crowdfunding platform founded by crypto trader Jordan Fish, known in the community as Cobie, the company announced on Tuesday.

The acquisition came the day after Coinbase sent $25 million in USDC USDCUSD to Cobie's wallet to acquire and burn a non-fungible token (NFT) and revive his UpOnly podcast.

“I certainly didn't think Echo would be sold to Coinbase, but here we are: Today Coinbase bought Echo for about $375 million,” Cobie wrote on X.

Ethena was the first project to raise with Echo 

The acquisition came less than two years after Cobie launched Echo in beta in April 2024 with a mission to enable communities to invest together in private funding rounds.

In the eight months since launching, the platform has raised at least $51 million in funding, with 131 deals closed, including Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol behind one of the fastest-growing yield-bearing stablecoins on the market, USDe (USDE).

According to Cobie, Ethena was the first project to fundraise using Echo, highlighting the platform's sharp focus on early-stage investing.

In May, Echo introduced Sonar, a software product allowing founders to self-host public token sales on their own terms and preferred blockchains such as Hyperliquid, Base, Solana or Cardano.

Echo will remain standalone…“for now”

Following Coinbase's acquisition, Echo will remain a “standalone platform under its current brand for now,” Cobie said in an X post on Tuesday, adding that the Sonar product will be integrated into Coinbase.

The integration will “likely” introduce new ways for founders to access investors, who will have new investment opportunities on Coinbase, he added.

“Integrating Echo's tools will help us enable more direct community participation, joining projects with capital, entirely onchain,” Coinbase said, adding:

Are ICOs back?

The acquisition of Echo by Coinbase marks a growing trend toward community fundraising, reminiscent of initial coin offerings (ICOs), which boomed in 2017.

According to a Thursday report by Tiger Research, public sales have been increasingly re-emerging in new forms, with launchpads like Legion, Buidlpad, Sonar and Kaito leading the trend.

“The ICO boom peaked in 2017 but rapidly contracted as it lost credibility due to fraud and opaque information,” Tiger Research said, adding that the market subsequently shifted to private sales.

“However, public sales are recently resurging in new forms,” it said, referring to public launchpads like Sonar.

“Short-term hype around public launchpads may cool down. However, public launchpads are expected to persist due to structural demand. They serve as a tool for projects to secure early users and liquidity,” the report concluded.

While it remains to be seen how the renewed trend of public token sales will unfold, some high-profile figures linked to the Trump administration had called for an ICO revival earlier this year.

“We want to make ICOs great again,” Zak Folkman, co-founder of the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial, said in February.

Top secret information ‘bandied about like confetti' during catastrophic Ministry of Defence leak, MP claims

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

A probe into the Ministry of Defence's Afghan data breach was dealt with through “a few unrecorded meetings and a handshake”, an MP has claimed in a damning assessment of the regulator's role in the scandal. 

The catastrophic breach exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who said they were in danger from the Taliban because of their links to UK forces and wanted to escape to Britain. The leak, which occurred when a spreadsheet with 33,000 lines of data was emailed to someone outside government, triggered a huge secret evacuation programme. 

The truth of what happened was only revealed after a court battle lasting almost two years, in which national media – including The Independent – challenged an unprecedented superinjunction. 

The UK's data regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which was responsible for probing the MoD's response to the leak, chose not to launch a formal investigation into what had gone wrong, a decision that was met with criticism after the breach came to light. The ICO was one of the few official bodies that knew about the leak, while the public and MPs were kept in the dark for nearly two years. 

Now it has emerged that the ICO did not take any contemporaneous notes of its decision not to launch an official probe of the catastrophic data loss, claiming officials were unable to record anything due to the classification of the secret information, which one MP claimed was “bandied about like confetti”. 

Information Commissioner John Edwards told MPs on the science, innovation and technology on Tuesday that the ICO did not officially investigate but was relying on “honesty” from MoD officials.

He said the ICO had occasional meetings with MoD officials and would “feed in their observations about lines of inquiry”, adding: “I understand that those were received with gratitude”. The ICO decided in June 2024 that the MoD had done enough to ensure the bad data practices wouldn't happen again. 

Tory MP Kit Malthouse said he was surprised that no formal investigation had taken place, given the severity of the breach. He told Mr Edwards: “What you've broadly said to us, is that it was dealt with with a few unrecorded meetings and a handshake. See ya, nothing to see here.

“It seems extraordinary to me given the severity and the impact of it... The picture you've painted of the way the ICO handled it seems alarming”. 

Dr Lauren Sullivan MP added: “It sounds like your method of investigation relies a lot on the honesty of the person you are investigating.”

Mr Edwards responded that there were tools the ICO could use to investigate government departments but that these weren't necessary in this case because no formal investigation was launched. 

He explained: “We didn't investigate, yes we were relying on honesty. Had we later found we were misled we could have investigated.”

Chair of the science committee, Dame Chi Onwurah MP, said: “When I saw some of the details of the Ministry of Defence data breach, I was astounded that that could be part of government data practice. 33,000 line Excel file, with top secret information, bandied about like confetti. This is not an individual failure ... it was an institutional failing.”

She said she was not comforted by assurances that the MoD is “finally acting” on bad data procedures, saying the failings had taken place under the information commissioner's watch. 

Mr Edwards admitted there were not enough staff at the ICO with developed vetting to handle top secret information, but said it would not have mattered in this case because the regulator had decided not to launch an investigation. 

He told MPs: “We are able to investigate top secret matters. We chose not to because it would have tied up resources which would have been better used elsewhere.”

He said that the ICO had carried out a formal investigation into a smaller data loss at the same MoD department, when a mass email was sent to 245 Afghans who had worked with the UK government. 

Mr Edwards said that when the major Afghan data leak was reported to the ICO “we were confident that the ministry was taking it seriously”.

Cyberattacks feel pretty inescapable at the moment. They've
always been there but in recent months there have been countless
high profile attacks which have potentially huge consequences,
including:

However, smaller businesses or even those not 'in the
spotlight' can't rest easy in the hope hackers won't
care about them. In fact, they may even be low hanging fruit. For
example:

It's clear that 'no one is safe' and those behind
these attacks show no signs of slowing down. A representative from
the National Crime Agency suggests she has seen incidents double in the
last two years to around 35 – 40 per week. Recent research based on a survey of over 200
cybersecurity professionals in the UK whose companies were subject
to a ransomware attack between January – March 2025 also
shows that the median demand is over £4 million, which could
be devastating for small businesses.

ICO's Top Tips

It's, therefore, unsurprising that the ICO have issued a list of practical steps small
businesses should take:

1. Back up your data

Data should be regularly backed up, but you also need to check
it has worked/is working as intended. Equally, you'll need to
make sure the back up isn't connected to the live data source
to ensure that, if there is malicious activity, it won't reach
the back up.

If you use an external storage device, don't forget to (a)
keep it somewhere other than your main workplace; (b) encrypt it;
and (c) lock it away, if possible.

2. Use strong passwords and MFA

If your password is 'password', 'Password1',
'Password123', etc. (you get the jist), it's probably
time to update it! Always consider strong and unique passwords
which would be difficult to guess (e.g. the National Cyber Security
Centre recommend picking three random words for
passwords).

Where you have the option, always consider enabling multifactor
authentication (MFA). Although it may be inconvenient waiting for
your code to be text/emailed, this second layer of security is
always a useful measure to implement.

3. Be aware of your surroundings

One to remember next time you want to do some work on your
morning commute. It's important to exercise caution when
working out and about. Whether you're on the phone or using a
screen when people are around, sending a few extra emails is
probably not worth the headache of potentially needing to deal with
a security incident.

4. Be wary of suspicious emails

It's always important to ensure you are cautious of
suspicious emails. Sometimes it may just be an odd new request, but
things like bad grammar, a need to act urgently, and requests for
payment are typical signs something may not be real. It's also
worth checking email addresses carefully, e.g. a capital
'i' (I) looks near identical to a lower case L (l).

However, things like generative AI and spoofing technologies are
enabling threat actors to become more sophisticated. A phishing
email may not be as implausible as it once was or written with poor
English. Equally, it could appear to come from the sender you know
(see, for example, where deepfakes were used to
convince someone to transfer $25 million on what they believed were
the instructions of the CFO).

5. Install anti-virus and malware protection (and keep it up
to date)

Whether in an office or working from home/away, you need to
ensure your devices are secure. Anti-virus software is a useful
tool to protect against malware which may be sent via phishing
attacks.

6. Protect your device while it's unattended

Whenever you are temporarily away from your desk, at least lock
your screen. If you're going to be away for longer, make sure
your screens are in a secure place. An unlocked and unattended
laptop in a cafe is a threat actor's dream.

7. Make sure your Wi-Fi is secure

Even if you're conscious of your surroundings and locked
your screen as recommended while in a cafe, if you're using the
public Wi-Fi or an insecure connection you could still be risking
personal data.

Always make sure you are using a secure connection when
connecting to the internet, and if you use the cafe's public
network, it's worth also using a secure virtual private
network.

8. Limit access to those who need it

Not everyone in the business will need access to everything, so
there should be access controls to ensure people can only see the
data they need to. This also needs to be kept in mind where people
leave the business or if they're absent for a long period, as
you'll need to suspend their ability to access the systems.

9. Take care when sharing

Showing someone the wrong thing is hardly new, but it still
happens. A lot. For example, you may be sharing your screen in a
meeting and have tabs or documents which are confidential or
include personal data open which can easily be accidentally shown.
Equally, make sure notifications are turned off if you're
sharing a screen to avoid someone else sending something to you
being seen by others.

If you're emailing lots of people which could reveal
sensitive information about recipients, consider alternatives to
BCC'ing them, such as bulk email or mail merge services.
It's not uncommon for people to CC rather than BCC people, but
in certain contexts this could reveal sensitive, if not special
category, personal data (see for example, the charity which was
fined by the ICO in 2020 when they CC'd 105 members of an HIV
advisory board on an email which meant people could be identified).
The ICO do also have guidance on sending bulk communications via
email.

10. Don't keep data for longer than you need it

Not only does this limit the amount of personal information
which is at risk if you are subject to an attack or there is a
breach, but it will also free up storage space and is likely
cheaper!

11. Dispose of old IT equipment and records safely

When someone leaves the business, or they get new equipment,
make sure there is no personal data on the devices (whether they
are laptops, smartphones, or any device) before they are thrown
away. For peace of mind, you may want to consider using deletion
software or engaging a specialist to wipe any data.

Is cybersecurity a priority for your
business?

The ICO is clear that ""[m]ost small businesses hold
personal information and conduct business digitally, so cyber
security must be a priority"". Ian Hulme (Executive
Director for Regulatory Supervision at the ICO) also added that
""[w]hile cyber attacks can be very sophisticated, we find
that many organisations are still neglecting the very foundations
of cyber security"".

Of course, all types of organisations need to ensure their
systems are resilient against complex attacks, and they are able to
meet their security obligations under data protection law. However,
it's important to get the basics right too (we need to walk
before we can run!).

Equally, no system is infallible and it's not uncommon, for example, for cyber criminals to simply buy
their way in by 'paying off' an employee. Things do go
wrong, even for small businesses, so it's important to think
about what you will do when things go wrong, before they do. It may
also be worthwhile considering obtaining insurance to cover the
costs of a cyberattack (although you'll still need to have a
good standard of security in place to ensure you don't void any
such insurance).

The content of this article is intended to provide a general
guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought

Hong Kong's digital asset activities, particularly its recent stablecoin legislation, have been viewed as a petri dish for potential Chinese activities. However, the excitement around Hong Kong's stablecoin plans – it attracted 77 expressions of interest, including several from Chinese state banks – appears to have prompted a backlash. Previously China's Ant Group (owner of Alipay) and JD.com had announced plans to issue stablecoins, but that now appears less likely, especially in renminbi. There also could be a geopolitical angle at play, explored below.

The first indication of China's hesitancy was on 13 October, when Hong Kong's Legislative Council made an announcement about stablecoins. It said that mainland central government support was needed in order to introduce offshore renminbi stablecoins. 

Additionally, on Saturday the Financial Times reported that Ant Group and JD.com had been instructed to put stablecoin plans on hold by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), citing sources. This sounded as if it applied to all stablecoin issuance, rather than just renminbi denominated digital currency. A JD.com subsidiary was one of just three groups involved in Hong Kong's stablecoin sandbox, prior to the enactment of legislation.

										Digital rupee can be usefule in settling rupee trade
																															| Photo Credit:
											Dmitriy Razinkov
																			

Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar sprang  a surprise of sorts recently when he suggested that RBI was in no real rush to launch the central bank digital currency (CBDC). This view indicates a dip in interest in CBDC, ever since Donald Trump took over as US President. One of the first legislations enacted by the Trump administration this year was to stop all work on development of a CBDC in the US, and create a framework for launching stablecoins as an alternative to the official digital currency. In India, the need for an official digital currency in retail payments when we have a vibrant UPI-based ecosystem is debatable. But wholesale CBDC which is used in interbank and very large transactions can be useful in settling external trade in rupees.

Over 130 countries representing 98 per cent of the global GDP are exploring the broad viability of a CBDC. India must do the same. Though only a few countries including Nigeria, Jamaica and Bahamas have launched an official digital currency, many central banks including the Peoples Bank of China are in an advanced stage of the CBDC pilot project. The use of the CBDC in cross-border payments can serve as an alternative to dollar-based channels of payment such as SWIFT in conditions of geo-political stress when the ‘weaponisation of the dollar' becomes a distinct possibility. This came into play when Russia was locked out of SWIFT as part of the Ukraine war sanctions, and third countries took a hit. Around 13 projects are exploring the use of CBDC for cross border payments, including Project mBridge, which links banks in China, Thailand, Hong King, Saudi Arabia and UAE, bypassing the Bank of International Settlement. 

The RBI began pilot testing CBDCs towards the end of 2022. There was a buzz when the retail CBDC or the e-rupee was introduced in December 2022, with many users downloading the wallets and transferring some money into it. But the project has not progressed due to limited use of e-rupee and the dominance of  UPI-based payments. Outstanding e-rupees in the retail segment stood at just ₹1,106 crore towards the end of March 2025. While the RBI Deputy Governor said that there were 70 lakh users, they are unlikely to be actively using this route. 

The RBI must develop more use cases which are unique to e-rupee. Enabling offline transactions and moving towards tokenisation, which provides anonymity to users, can improve usage. Significantly, while retail CBDC has made a slow start in India, wholesale CBDC has not taken off at all. The RBI annual report shows that no wholesale e-rupee had been issued until March 2025. The central bank must examine the  challenges being faced by banks in using e-rupee in wholesale banking transactions. Cross-border payments in e-rupees become possible when other countries are willing. India must explore options with such countries to reduce the risks posed by weaponisation of the dollar.

Bitcoin is again in rally mode and has recently notched another all-time high. So it's not surprising that more upside forecasts on the largest cryptocurrency are emerging.

Sure, some of these forecasts may not hold water. But if some of the more audacious bitcoin prognostications prove anywhere close to accurate, the Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) will be among the ETF beneficiaries.

As of late Thursday, the digital currency traded around $121,650 amid a pullback from the aforementioned highs. But some recent price forecasts suggest a run to $150,000 to $160,000 could occur before the end of 2025. Either of those figures represent significant appreciation from current levels and a likely spark for ETFs like BRRR. But those forecasts appear restrained to others.

Bitcoin is not legal in Russia. But VTB Bank, the country's second-largest financial institution, is overtly bullish on the digital currency.

“The rate set a new historic maximum literally yesterday, having moved above [$125,000. And] according to our estimates, the growth potential is far from being depleted,” said VTB investment advisor Artyom Markin at a recent cryptocurrency conference put on by the bank. “The move to $150,000 can be expected in the near term, and up to $200,000 – 250,000 per Bitcoin in the medium term.”

There's fluidity in defining “medium term,” but it can be measured in months, not years. That means even if the low end of VTB's projection is accurate, bitcoin and BRRR could generate significant upside in the months ahead.

VTB's Markin points to familiar catalysts: ongoing demand for bitcoin against the backdrop of fixed, limited supply. Interestingly, he's not the only Russian that's bullish on bitcoin.

“Pavel Durov, founder of the popular messenger Telegram, recently shared his belief that Bitcoin will eventually hit $1 million, citing the same reasons. A Russian financial analyst later agreed that this could happen in the next 5 to 10 years,” reported Lubomir Tassev for Cryptopolitan.

One of the foremost cryptocurrency expert Arthur Hayes said in an October 9 blog post that bitcoin's historical four-year cycle is likely a thing of the past. He also noted traders wishing to apply this time around may be doing so at that their peril.

“Listen to our monetary masters in Washington and Beijing,” Hayes opined. “They clearly state that money shall be cheaper and more plentiful. Therefore, bitcoin continues to rise in anticipation of this highly probable future.”

In under a decade, stablecoins have evolved from niche crypto experiments into a deeply established digital money. While many stablecoins remain pegged to the U.S. dollar, the ecosystem now includes euro, yuan, and algorithmic-pegged tokens. This diversity could either reinforce the dollar's global reach or usher in a more multipolar financial era.

One striking example of how fast the space is changing is USD1—a politically branded U.S. dollar stablecoin launched in 2025, which has quickly become the fifth largest globally, reaching a market capitalization of $2.68 billion. Its success underlines how stablecoins are no longer crypto curiosities but serious tools in the global monetary system.

Stablecoins have grown into an important force in finance, bridging the stability of fiat with the efficiency of blockchain. Dollar-backed tokens such as USDT, USDC, and USD1 remain dominant because of their liquidity and integration, but the market is diversifying. Euro and yuan pegged stablecoins, along with algorithmic and synthetic versions, are gaining traction in regions seeking local digital alternatives.

In countries with volatile currencies, stablecoins now serve as digital lifelines, offering price stability and seamless access to global liquidity.

 “Every USDT, USDC, or on-chain USD transaction is another line of code binding the world to the greenback,” said Sid Sridhar, founder of Bima Labs. “The irony is that in trying to escape banks and borders, the world built a second, internet-native Federal Reserve.”

At the same time, some nations are experimenting with sovereign-backed or hybrid stablecoin tokens that blend central bank oversight with private innovation. Wilfred Daye, CSO for Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc, and the CEO for Chaince Securities, LLC, observes that this trend is drawing traditional finance closer to crypto:

“Banks and payment providers are turning stablecoins into a regulated payments infrastructure. Once acquirers and gateways add one-click EUR and USD tokens, stablecoins stop being a crypto niche — they become mainstream.”

Stablecoins are rapidly evolving from crypto instruments to mainstream financial infrastructure, signaling a long-term shift in global payment systems.

Despite the rise of alternatives, the U.S. dollar remains the backbone of the global stablecoin market. Over 95% of circulating stablecoins are pegged to the dollar, embedding USD rails across crypto, fintech, and cross-border settlement.

Daye describes this situation as “dominance with a new plumbing risk” where stablecoins extend the dollar's reach but introduce technical vulnerabilities, such as the potential market impact if issuers must rapidly liquidate U.S. Treasuries to meet redemptions.

Sridhar echoes this sentiment, arguing that stablecoins amplify rather than weaken U.S. power:

“Stablecoins are not a threat to the dollar; they're the most powerful distribution channel it has ever had. The dollar doesn't just sit in vaults in New York anymore—it flows natively through DeFi pools, remittance rails, gaming platforms, and cross-border commerce.”

The launch of USD1, backed by World Liberty Financial and endorsed by Donald Trump, reshaped the stablecoin narrative. Its political branding and rapid adoption signal a new era where stablecoins are intertwined with state interests and national strategy.

Daye calls USD1 “a political and market signal,” adding that if it gains wider distribution through exchanges, fintechs, and banks, it could pressure incumbents like USDC and USDT on transparency and fees. Sridhar frames it more broadly:

“A former president branding a dollar stablecoin is the clearest signal yet that this is not fringe crypto—this is mainstream financial infrastructure.”

By halting plans for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), Trump may have indirectly accelerated stablecoin adoption. Without a federal digital dollar, the market has turned to private, regulated alternatives to fill that void. In essence, the U.S. appears to be betting on stablecoins, not CBDCs, as its digital money standard.

The launch of politically backed USD1 marks a pivotal shift — positioning private stablecoins, not CBDCs, as the U.S. bet for digital monetary leadership.

The regulatory landscape is shifting just as fast. The U.S. GENIUS Act—enacted earlier in July 2025—was the first major legislative framework for stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain 1:1 backing with cash or Treasury assets, undergo audits, and operate under federal oversight. By establishing clear guardrails, the U.S. positioned itself as a global leader in stablecoin regulation.

The GENIUS Act has since influenced countries worldwide to revisit their approaches. China is reportedly exploring yuan-backed stablecoins to promote international use of the renminbi, while South Korea is drafting laws to permit won-based stablecoins.

Japan, Singapore, and India are building regulatory frameworks and innovation hubs to encourage stablecoin development. In Hong Kong, Standard Chartered, HKT, and Animoca Brands are seeking licenses for a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin, and across Europe, the MiCA regime has set the stage for euro-denominated tokens.

Still, as Sridhar warns, “Law alone is not liquidity.” For euro-based stablecoins to gain meaningful market share, banks must issue them at scale, and regulators must actively cultivate use cases across payments, trade, and remittances.

Whether stablecoins strengthen or dilute U.S. monetary dominance depends on how institutions and policymakers navigate the next phase. Daye argues that the outcome will be decided not by crypto startups but by banks and payment processors:

“If the big acquirers and gateways add stablecoins at checkout or for B2B payouts, that's when they go from niche to mainstream.”

Sridhar agrees but frames it as an evolution of money itself:

“Institutions don't just provide credibility; they provide pipes, distribution, and regulatory air cover. Without them, stablecoins are a crypto sideshow. With them, they are the operating system of global finance.”

Stablecoins may not overthrow the dollar, but they are redefining how it moves. What lies ahead is not a battle over who issues money, but who programs it—and whether the future's financial rails remain unified or fragment into competing digital ecosystems.

Stablecoin regulation is rapidly globalizing, with the U.S. GENIUS Act setting the pace for worldwide adoption and compliance.

The balance of power in global finance is no longer defined by reserve currencies but by digital liquidity. If regulated stablecoins keep expanding under frameworks like the GENIUS Act and MiCA, they could form the backbone of the next generation of money, linking traditional finance and blockchain into one programmable network.

Settling transactions with digital currencies could save processors and merchants money on payments by cutting out bank and card network fees.

Payment processing giants Fiserv, Stripe and Block stand to save money from their embrace of cryptocurrencies, according to consultants and analysts who follow the payments industry. 

All three companies have announced ventures into digital assets in recent months. 

While Block said it would help merchants accept Bitcoin, Fiserv and Stripe both plan to delve into stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of a fiat currency like the dollar. Those ties theoretically help them hold their value better than more volatile assets like Bitcoin or Dogecoin. 

Stripe, for example, announced last week that it was launching a platform to let customers pay for subscriptions with stablecoins.

All the efforts to integrate digital currencies follows President Donald Trump's signing of the Genius Act in July, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

Letting merchants accept crypto payments potentially cuts some players like banks and credit card networks out of the process, because the customer can simply send a digital currency directly to the merchant, said James Stevens, a partner at the law firm Troutman Pepper Locke who follows the payments industry.

“There continues to be attempts to grow forms of payment that may result in [lower] transaction costs,” he said in an interview.

Merchants pay fees that are a percentage of each credit and debit card purchase to a variety of entities, including bank card issuers, processors and the card networks. The average credit card interchange fee is about 2.2%, according to the Nilson Report.

Fewer companies taking a cut means more money left for processors and their merchant customers, Tony DeSanctis, senior director of payments for the consulting firm Cornerstone Advisors, said in an email.

“This is about the potential to provide merchants with another low-cost routing option,” he said.

However, adoption of these cryptocurrencies remains a challenge, said Bill Maurer, the director of the University of California Irvine's Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion.

“The jury is still out on what all this is going to mean,” he said. Customers aren't clamoring for it, and it's not yet clear if cryptocurrency payments are better than other payment methods, Maurer added.

A disclaimer near the end of Block's news release detailing plans for its seller service provider Square's plans to let merchants accept Bitcoin says the transactions are irreversible and may occasionally experience delays or technical issues.

Fiserv's interest in stablecoins is consistent with the multiple ways the payment processor already moves money, Sunil Sachdev, the company's head of embedded finance and digital assets said in an emailed statement.

“The use cases enabled by stablecoins will bring forward different customer and commercial value propositions which unlock efficiency and new revenue opportunities for all parties in the ecosystem,” the statement said.

Spokespeople for Stripe and Block did not respond to requests for comment.

However, consumer use of cryptocurrency for payments was on the decline in the past few years, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City report last month. That's despite digital assets continuing to make headlines

“Fiserv is the most interesting because that's the one thinking about it in terms of infrastructure,” Maurer said.

The Milwaukee-based company said earlier this month that it is working with the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to offer the “Roughrider” stablecoin — in addition to its own FIUSD stablecoin — sometime next year.

The digital currencies will be used to move money between banks and between countries, the company said in a news release announcing the Roughrider coin. Integrating the digital assets into the company's payment infrastructure that way may give Fiserv's stablecoins more staying power, Maurer said.

In an announcement earlier this month, detailing new services including Bitcoin payments, Block said it could offer discounts to merchants who use crypto. One merchant — Compass Coffee in Washington D.C. — demonstrated last week how a Square point-of-sale terminal could be used to let a customer pay with the digital currency.

Square is “offering no transaction costs for a period of time, and then a very low transaction cost,” Stevens said. 

Those offers are consistent with two recent payments trends, he said, offering more ways to settle transactions and finding ways to reduce costs for both merchants and processors.

While merchants may benefit from the use of digital currencies, payment processors are unlikely to pass any of their savings on to consumers, Maurer stressed.

While developments like the will support crypto use in the short term, he remains unconvinced that crypto has staying power.

F
or a private detective working in Los Angeles, most investigations tend to follow a predictable pattern. You get a divorce case, or a custody case, and from the time the client pays the retainer, you know what the job will entail. You'll follow a guy around taking pictures from hotel parking lots, or outside of a club on Sunset, trying to prove he's having an affair. Or maybe it's a workers' comp case. Same thing: You tail a guy, take pictures, prove he's not really hurt.


	But the Adam Iza case, it was different from the start.


	Iza was a computer wiz who'd made millions off crypto. He had called Paramount Investigative Services in November 2021 with what seemed like a straightforward job: He was hoping to recover a stolen laptop with $300 million in crypto on it, and had a good idea who had taken it.


	Paramount's founder, Ken Childs, didn't know a whole lot about crypto but promised Iza he could track down the laptop. He warned it could take a while, though — the guy who stole it probably didn't want to be found.

	











	After a few weeks of surveilling the suspected thief and turning up no solid leads, Childs decided he wanted to meet Iza. The crypto world was full of con artists, and Childs was keen to make sure Iza was who he said he was, a kid in his twenties worth $700 million. This job was going to get expensive. Childs asked Iza for his address, and headed to Bel Air.

	When he pulled up to Iza's house, he couldn't see past the towering hedges and big redwoods circling the property. He texted Iza to say he'd arrived, and a security guard dressed in all black emerged. He stood about six feet four and wore an earpiece.

	











	The guard opened a wrought-iron gate, and Childs drove onto a horseshoe-shaped driveway, past a blacked-out Crown Vic, which he figured belonged to security. The house had been built in 1927 in a Mediterranean style, all white with a red-tiled roof; but just a few years before, an architect who'd done work for Rod Stewart and Sylvester Stallone had gutted the interior and updated it with Italian-marble floors and cathedral ceilings. Prince once lived here. Architectural Digest called it one of the finest homes in Bel Air.

	Iza emerged from its arching French front doors as Childs exited his car. He was wearing a black turtleneck and black pants. “He looked like he was right out of The Matrix,” Childs recalls.


	Suddenly, the gate opened again, and a black Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up. Another security guard opened the door and a petite Filipino woman emerged in dark sunglasses. Two small children scurried out behind her. Her name was Iris Au and she was Iza's girlfriend, Childs would later learn. On Instagram, she called herself the Goddess and tended to post selfies in places like Dubai, or on the steps of a private jet, or on a horse.


	She didn't look up or say anything to Childs, or anyone else. Instead, she headed toward a back entrance of the 36,000-square-foot mansion with her children and disappeared.


	Iza invited Childs inside.


	“I just remember thinking, like, ‘Holy fuck,'” Childs says. “It's such a bizarre, massive-ass house. I was impressed and rolling my eyes at the same time.”


	The home had a staff entrance, three elevators, and a separate pool house, with an indoor pool designed to look like a Turkish bath, complete with a sauna and steam showers, a bowling alley, an indoor racquetball court, and a 700-bottle wine wall. Rent was roughly $200,000 a month.

	“I was kind of waiting for that dude in the Old Spice commercial who's half man and half horse to come jogging through the center entry,” Childs says. “You would have thought some kids designed the place.”


	Iza led Childs to his office, which was trimmed in heavy oak. As they discussed the likely hurdles of the laptop-recovery job, Iza said he didn't care how long it might take — six months, nine months, a year. Childs offered to charge him $100 an hour, a discount from his typical $150 an hour. Iza assured him he had the money. Childs left Bel Air that day with few concerns about Iza's ability to pay. Before long, though, he began to feel a little uneasy, like something didn't quite add up.

	











	In May 2022, the FBI called Childs out of the blue and told him they wanted to meet.


	“Once the FBI started asking questions, I began to wonder what I'd become a part of,” Childs said. “I felt like eyes were on me.”


	But the FBI wasn't interested in Childs. Their target was Iza.


	Last September, federal prosecutors in the Central District of California charged Iza with tax evasion and wire fraud, alleging the man they'd dubbed the Crypto Godfather ran what amounted to a criminal conspiracy, complete with police officers on his payroll who allegedly intimidated rivals and helped enforce extortion schemes.


	“For years, I had been warning people that this disorganized crime space was trending toward organized crime,” says Allison Nixon, the chief research officer of Unit 221B, a collective of cybersecurity experts. “Every subsequent year there was some kind of new development or new level of organizational sophistication with these guys.”


	When Iza was arrested by the FBI last September, Nixon immediately recognized the name. She had been tracking him for two years, and his relationships with senior members of what's called the Com, or the Community, one of the most dangerous criminal hacking groups operating in the U.S. The charges against Iza suggest cybercrime has entered a new phase, Nixon says. 


	“It's hard for people to wrap their heads around this, because they have a certain image of organized crime and they have a certain image of cybercrime,” Nixon says. “But maybe the best way to think of the Adam Iza case is a convergence of those two things.”


	Riding that unchecked wave of growth in crypto took Iza from a quiet, solitary childhood in the Midwest suburbs to a world of outlandish wealth, shady operators, and mind-boggling schemes.


	“It was like The Great Gatsby,” a friend of Iza's says. “He was living this amazing life, and everyone wanted a piece. But at the same time, you wondered if it was real, and how long it could go on.”


	Until very recently, local police agencies, ­including sprawling departments like the LAPD and the NYPD, didn't take online financial crimes, or the loose collection of hackers who perpetuate them, all that seriously. That's partly because they didn't understand the ­technology, partly because they weren't equipped to build those types of cases, and partly because they didn't see the stereotypical ­hacker (think anti­social incel) doxing Dana White or swatting a Papa Johns as all that dangerous.

	











	But in the past few years, something has dramatically shifted. Crypto crimes once contained to online harassment now often include kidnapping, extortion, and armed threats. In May, a crypto investor was allegedly held hostage and tortured in a luxury Manhattan townhouse, in what police say was a failed attempt to steal his $30 million crypto fortune. That same month, a gang in Paris attempted to kidnap the daughter and grandson of the chief executive officer of a crypto firm in broad daylight. These are not isolated incidents, but rather part of a global trend: In the past two years alone, there were kidnappings for ransom of cryptocurrency moguls in Toronto, Sydney, and Danbury, Connecticut.


	Over that same period, crypto crime has exploded. In 2023 alone, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 69,000 reports of crypto-related financial fraud. And while crypto made up just 10 percent of the financial-fraud cases the FBI investigated last year, it accounted for nearly half of all reported losses: a staggering $5.6 billion.


	All of the things people love about crypto — its decentralized nature, the ability to move digital coins around the world in an instant, the fact that all transactions are tracked in real time — make it a magnet for criminals. Because every crypto payment is locked into the blockchain's permanent ledger, in most cases there's no way to reverse them. And unlike banks or credit card companies, there's no central authority or customer-service department with the power to cancel or undo a payment, meaning it's nearly impossible to recover what's lost. 


	Clearance rates for crypto crimes are also abysmal, Nixon says. Law enforcement only has resources to focus on the biggest cases, meaning the best hackers can operate for years without facing any kind of legal repercussions. Of those who do face consequences, Nixon says, “Once these people get out from their very short sentences, they go right back to their gangs and then educate the rest of the members how the justice system works and how they got caught, so they can learn how to not get caught again.” She adds, “Their careers are marked by this constant upward progression of severity and dollar amount.”


	Iza's path into this world was circuitous. Born Ahmed Faiq in Iraq in 2000, he came to the U.S. with his family in 2011, the same year the American military officially withdrew from the country. They settled in St. Louis. While Iza's family wasn't particularly religious, he was Muslim in an area that was mostly white and Christian. His best friend from the time, Adam Faleh, says Iza had few friends and mostly kept to himself. “He seemed to enjoy solitude,” Iza's sister tells me.

	











	Even before he was in high school, Iza had found a passion, his mother says: computers. Faleh remembers coming over to the cramped home where Iza lived with his parents and four younger siblings and Iza showing him the computer he had built. He kept it on his bed because his room was too small for a table. “It had all these wires sticking out of it,” Faleh remembers. “But it worked.”


	Iza was into Bitcoin, and already cashing in. One day he showed up to high school driving a Porsche Boxster, Faleh recalls. He started wearing Louis Vuitton and Gucci.


	“He would walk into class and people would be like, ‘Who is this guy?'” Faleh says. “They thought he was some rich kid with rich parents, because no one even knew what Bitcoin was. He was mysterious.”


	When Iza was 17, he moved to California and, within a couple of years, had changed his name. To Faleh, it seemed like he had simply disappeared.


	How and why Iza moved to Los Angeles is a bit murky, as is his descent into criminality: When I talked to his friends from that time period, they seemed reluctant to say too much.


	But several sources who know Iza well told me on condition of anonymity that while living in Missouri, he had become friendly with members of the Com, the underground hacker collective, and that prominent members of the organization had been so impressed by crypto-mining software Iza had built that they sponsored his move out to L.A. (Iza denies ever being part of the Com.)


	According to Iza's friend Milad Sarwari, a cybersecurity expert who goes by the name Hackistan, it was during this time that Iza became friendly with some of the most notorious hackers on the planet. They belonged to a group called UGNazi, which stands for Underground Nazi Hacktivist Group. The collective had several members, but its three most famous were known as the gods: Mir Islam (Josh the God), Troy Woody (Osama the God), and Eric Taylor (Cosmo the God). The trio had rocketed to fame in the hacker underworld circa 2011, when they doxed Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, and Jay-Z, and published the addresses, Social Security numbers, and other personal information of then-first lady Michelle Obama, the director of the FBI, and the U.S. attorney general.


	UGNazi were most famous, however, for stealing thousands of credit card numbers, which eventually culminated in a massive FBI investigation known as Operation Card Shop.

	











	“Adam got involved with the wrong group of people,” a source close to Iza says. “They were all older than him, and I think he was a bit lost, looking for, like, a big brother or a father-figure type. These were people who could play on that and manipulate him. It set him off on the wrong path.”


	A few years after graduating high school, Iza called Faleh and invited him to come out to L.A. Iza told his friend he was doing very well. Faleh agreed to travel out to California and work for Iza. His arrival wowed him: A security guard picked him up at LAX and drove him to Iza's mansion in Bel Air. At first, Faleh didn't even recognize his old friend, who was wearing a black Tom Ford suit — he had completely transformed himself from the shy, halting boy who preferred spending time alone in his bedroom. 


	“He looked like a model, like everything was different,” Faleh recalls. “I remember ­telling him, ‘Damn, dude, you look like Tom Cruise.'” 


	Iza told Faleh he was making most of his money off crypto, or more specifically a crypto trading platform he'd invented called Zort. Using a proprietary form of AI that Iza said he'd developed, the Zort trading bot deployed signaling technology that analyzed news reports, market trends, and social media sentiment related to all of the crypto exchanges around the world to make trades.


	Iza appeared to have more money than he knew what to do with. They'd show up at a steakhouse in Beverly Hills, and the whole staff seemed to know Iza. They went to dinner with rappers, and Iza picked up the bill. They'd go to a mall and a luxury store that would shut down for Iza and his crew.

“We'd go to a restaurant with an entourage. It was like, ‘Who's that?' He liked to put on a show.”


	“Anytime we'd go to a restaurant there would be, like, an entourage of security, SUVs, just a whole show,” says a friend from the time who is still close to Iza. “And everyone's like, ‘Who's that?' He liked to put on a show.”


	He also gave plenty of money away. Sometimes, Sarwari says, they'd go down to skid row and Iza would hand out $100 bills. He supported animal-rescue operations, too.


	And he was in love. Iris Au had lived with Iza for a few years, and according to Sarwari, he was helping raise her two children from a previous marriage. To Faleh, it seemed like a lot to juggle, but he says Iza seemed content with the way his life had turned out.


	In the summer of 2021, Iza began planning for his 21st-birthday celebration. He wanted a party that would match the grandeur of his Bel Air home, something that people would never forget.

	











	A friend put him in touch with a party planner who had supposedly arranged events for Justin Bieber. The party planner — who is identified in court documents as Ryan Chapell — agreed to the job, and a few days before the event, Iza wired him $50,000 to cover expenses and services.


	To Iza's friends who attended the party, it seemed like a huge success. They remember seeing rappers like Akon and Gashi there, as well as models and influencers. But Iza wasn't happy. Per a source close to Iza, to increase attendance, Chapell had invited patrons from a nearby bar, who had arrived drunk and trashed the bar area of the mansion, urinating and defecating on the marble floors.


	Two days after the party, Iza summoned the party planner to his home. Once inside, Chapell was separated from a colleague he'd brought along and led into a home office, where Iza sat behind a desk with a black handgun in front of him and an AR-15 nearby. Visibly agitated, Iza loaded bullets into a magazine while several bodyguards — some wearing law-enforcement-style badges — stood watch. Several of the bodyguards, court documents say, were deputies from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.


	The department has a troubled history. The largest sheriff's agency in the U.S., it has for years been described by watchdogs and former cops as corrupt, with an entrenched culture of lawless groups operating within its ranks. These internal cliques, or deputy gangs, which have been tied to specific LASD precincts, have names like the Banditos, the Grim Reapers, and the Regulators.


	In 2019, eight LASD deputies sued the county, alleging that the Banditos functioned like a prison gang, complete with “shot callers” who determined who worked which shifts, who got overtime, and who got promotions. Those in the gang were marked by a distinctive tattoo: a skeleton with a mustache wearing a sombrero and a bandolier. Getting into the gang — or “chasing ink” — typically required engaging in violence against civilians that skirted the law, or was obviously illegal, like beating a suspect during an arrest. “If you get in a shooting, that's a definite brownie point,” a whistleblower told CBS News. As Rolling Stone detailed in 2021, that year nearly one in six LASD deputies surveyed said they had been invited to join an illicit subgroup.


	Iza's head of security, an LASD deputy named Eric Saavedra, had belonged to a clique known as the Jump Out Boys, according to court records. The clique encouraged violent policing, even rewarding members when they were involved in shootings, per a lawsuit against members of the clique. Iza would brag to friends, in text messages over Telegram later seized by the FBI, that he could get his security detail to do whatever he asked of them, which included illegal activity.

	











	Seated in the office of his mansion, Iza told Chapell he wanted half his money back because the party hadn't lived up to his expectations. Iza demanded Chapell return half his fee and asked him to hand over his phone. At one point, Chapell says in a lawsuit, nine LASD deputies who were part of Iza's security detail drew their weapons. Chapell relented, turning over his phone and divulging his passcode. Iza then transferred $25,000 from the party planner's bank account, photographed his passport, driver's license, and credit cards, and told him to leave the house.


	Chapell's problems escalated from there. Federal investigators have alleged Iza began communicating with Chapell's girlfriend and relayed to Saavedra that the party planner was a drug dealer. Saavedra allegedly passed this information on to a fellow LASD deputy without disclosing where it had come from, or that he and his team of deputies were on Iza's payroll.


	In late September 2021, Iza paid Chapell's girlfriend to fly the party planner back to L.A. and supplied her with cash to buy drugs, prosecutors allege. A few days later, deputies pulled over the car Chapell was riding in for what they said was a traffic violation. After claiming Chapell had an outstanding warrant, they searched the car and found cocaine under his seat and mushrooms in his backpack, which his girlfriend had planted at Iza's direction, federal prosecutors allege. Iza and Saavedra watched the arrest from nearby and allegedly took photos of the scene. 

Iza sat behind a desk with a black handgun in front of him and an AR-15 nearby.


	“For a drug dealer, you fucked with the wrong people,” Iza texted Chapell a few days later, along with a photo of the arrest in progress. The next day, after Chapell texted his girlfriend accusing her of setting him up, Iza followed with another message: “The cops had you on their watch list for weeks, so go complain to them [a]bout setting you up. Hahaha. Worthless loser.”


	Later that month, court records allege, Iza held another associate — identified in court records only as L.A. — at gunpoint inside his Bel Air mansion while off-duty LASD deputy Michael Coberg stood by. Accusing L.A. of scamming him, Iza threatened to hurt the man unless he paid up. The victim transferred $127,000 to Iza that same day.


	The next day, Deputy Coberg picked up L.A. at his hotel and again transported him to Iza's residence, leaving him alone with Iza at the home's shooting range, according to court records. Iza held L.A. at gunpoint, Coberg would later state in a plea agreement, and demanded L.A.'s business partner transfer money to him, which he did later that day.

	











	Cybersecurity experts who had been tracking the Com had never seen anything like this. Doxing a judge or calling in a bomb threat, that was one thing. But hiring off-­duty cops to intimidate and extort victims, or throw them in jail, represented a significant escalation. Iza had just crossed a line, and eventually, it would bring him down.


	By February 2022, private investigator Ken Childs was growing weary of working for Iza, no matter how good the money was. He would soon worry about the legality of what Iza was asking him to do.


	From the beginning, Iza had insisted his stolen laptop was in the hands of Enzo Zelocchi, an actor and Hollywood producer he'd met a few years before.


	Zelocchi had introduced himself as a movie producer looking for investors for a crypto documentary. Back in his native Italy, he was a model and a celebrity, he said, with a long list of movie credits to his name. But Iza was immediately skeptical, according to later testimony given in a deposition: Zelocchi had more than 10 million followers on Instagram and posts with nearly 1 billion views, even though Iza had never heard of him. Iza suspected his movie credits, which claimed to feature stars like Brad Pitt and Al Pacino, were all fake. (Zelocchi says hackers working with Iza “infiltrated” his IMDb page and removed most of his credits.)


	“It just didn't seem real,” Iza would later testify. Zelocchi's business proposals, he said, were “just make believe, all hypothetical — you know, ‘What if you could do this? What if you could do that? Is this worth a billion dollars?' Just, you know, the common stupid person's idea of how to make money.” 

“For a drug dealer, you fucked with the wrong people. Worthless loser.”


	According to a complaint Iza filed, he and Zelocchi had met several times to discuss the retrieval and return of the laptop, including more than once at a Cheesecake Factory in Beverly Hills; and yet, it was never recovered. Childs was confused about the nature of their relationship — and why Zelocchi had the laptop in the first place. Even if they found the laptop, Iza said he didn't have the passcode to open it, or the code to open the wallet that held the $300 million. “It's, like, the most valuable, worthless fucking thing on the planet,” Childs remembers telling Iza.


	He agreed to track down Zelocchi but says he made one thing clear: no stealing, no breaking the law. Just surveillance. The whole thing  seemed a little curious to Childs, but he wouldn't realize until years later how truly dangerous Iza could be. In one incident in November 2021, for example, shortly after Iza hired Childs, two LASD deputies on Iza's payroll pulled guns on Zelocchi at a gas station in Corona, more than an hour southeast of L.A., and searched his trunk. Zelocchi filed a police report, but the story of how he had ended up  in Corona with Iza was so convoluted that no charges were filed.


	Later that year, Iza used his connections with LASD to obtain a warrant for Zelocchi's phone. The deputy who helped Iza texted: “Warrant is complete … I will get it signed in the morning.” Iza forwarded the exchange to an associate, as well as a photo of himself posing with a group of officers. “Damn my guy actually filed the warrant,” Iza texted. “That's some serious shit to do for someone.”

	











	After more than a decade as a private investigator in L.A., Childs knew celebrities often hired off-duty cops for security, and that the lines between legal and illegal blurred fast. If a threat to a client surfaced, it wasn't unusual for an officer to quietly run a license plate or pull phone data. But Iza had blown far past that kind of activity, and Childs worried Iza was now asking him to do something that could put them both in jail.


	It was late February 2022, and Childs was running surveillance outside of Zelocchi's apartment in Hollywood when he saw a man named David Do arrive with what looked like a laptop bag. Iza had long suspected Do was a hacker Zelocchi had hired to break into the stolen laptop. From across the street, Childs could see the two men seated side by side with open laptops in front of them.


	Childs called Iza to describe what he was seeing. Iza was stoked. It appeared Zelocchi and Do were rapidly cycling through passcodes that popped up on both screens, trying to hack into one of the laptops. “I need pictures,” Childs recalls Iza telling him. “I need to see everything.”


	Childs says Iza instructed him to take down the hacker if he left the apartment with a laptop in hand. Childs reminded him of their ground rules: “We're not in the fucking robbery business.” 


	A few days later, one of Childs' investigators called him in the evening, just as Childs had sat down for dinner with his wife and kids. The team was surveilling Do outside an apartment in Garden Grove when a security guard hired by Iza showed up. The burly man exited his vehicle and started giving orders to Childs' team. Childs worried this could go south fast. Iza had previously sent his security detail to Zelocchi's house and tried to break in; Zelocchi had fired several rounds before police arrived. Childs apologized to his wife but told her he had to go.


	By the time Childs got to the apartment, he says, his team was gone, but Iza's guy was still there. He told Childs he'd been sent to do what Childs refused to do: recover the stolen laptop. Childs tried to talk him out of it, but the guard seemed committed.

	











	Childs was about to go home when he saw Do exit the apartment with what appeared to be a laptop bag. Childs says he saw Iza's watchdog emerge from the shadows and throw Do to the ground. After a brief struggle, Childs says, Iza's guy grabbed the bag and took off.


	“I'm trying to bail at this point, because I'm like, ‘Fuck these guys,'” Childs recalls. But then he realized Iza's guard had left his iPad and phone in Childs' car and was now headed back to Iza's mansion in Bel Air.


	Childs felt he had no choice but to follow him. He planned to quit, but, he says, Iza owed him $90,000 and he wanted to make sure he got paid first.


	Once inside Iza's house, Childs says, he followed three security officers into Iza's office, where Iza was seated at his desk, trying to crack into the laptop that had been snatched from Do. “He's showing me a screen of code, and he's telling me exactly what this line means, and I've got to be a cheerleader to make sure I get paid,” Childs recalls.


	As it turns out, they'd retrieved the wrong laptop. “It was like Dumb and Dumber: Multi­millionaire Crypto Version,” Childs says.


	A few days later, Iza texted Childs and told him he wasn't going to pay him because Childs hadn't done what Iza asked — namely, recover the stolen laptop when he had a chance. Childs reminded Iza he owed him $90,000. Iza responded that he spent more than that in a month shopping for clothes.


	Childs says Iza then told him to go fuck himself.


	By 2022, law enforcement alleges, Iza was also engaging in financial fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. (He was also using aliases by then, including Tony Brambilla and Diego Facebook.) His crypto trading platform, Zort, was nothing more than a front that Iza used to defraud victims and to launder stolen bitcoin, investigators say. And around the same time he'd orchestrated his party planner's arrest, the FBI says, Iza would become involved with a hacker who had obtained access to Meta merchant accounts, which authorities allege Iza would use to defraud clients of roughly $40 million.


	If not for “using the cops to do his dirty work,” which attracted the attention of the FBI, Allison Nixon of Unit 221B says, Iza “could have been operating for many years, pulling off all these scams. I think he'd still be at it.” (A source close to the investigation says this isn't true. “Iza had many, many victims,” the source notes.)

	











	Iza did know he was being investigated by the IRS, according to his attorney, Josef Sadat, and he was worried enough to hire a tax attorney. (The FBI would allege Iza owed $13 million in unpaid takes between 2020 and 2023.) Sadat says the tax attorney advised Iza that if they began cooperating with the IRS, he could possibly avoid any criminal charges.


	Instead, Iza left the country, taking trips to Switzerland and spending extended periods of time in Dubai. “Even $300M there isn't shit,” he wrote in a text, seemingly referring to back taxes. And if the IRS did pursue criminal charges, “Hopefully I'm out [of the U.S.] by then,” Iza said.


	Iza began shuttling back and forth between L.A., Monaco, Switzerland, and Dubai. He was facing mounting legal troubles from all sides. A former client of Zort in Texas was suing him, demanding $1.5 million in damages. Zelocchi and Childs had also filed lawsuits and, unbeknownst to Iza, were working with the FBI.


	The FBI began probing Iza's past, in particular his links to hackers in the digital underground. In November 2023, FBI Special Agent Barbara Johnson traveled to the Philippines to interview two of Iza's former acquaintances, Mir Islam and Troy Woody, who were incarcerated there, charged with the murder of Woody's girlfriend.


	Woody told the FBI that Iza had stolen millions in cryptocurrency from them and had used Zort to launder it. The laptop Iza had hired Childs to recover had actually belonged to Woody, he said. Iza and Zelocchi had stolen it together but didn't have the passcodes to open it. When they stole the laptop, Woody alleged, Iza pointed a 9 mm at Woody and pulled the trigger, but the gun had misfired. 


	Back in the United States, the FBI and the IRS were closing in. They interviewed the party planner Iza had allegedly robbed, and the associate he'd held at gunpoint over $127,000. They showed up unannounced at the home of one of Iza's closest friends in Las Vegas. They interviewed Ken Childs, David Do, Enzo Zelocchi, and the hacker who had allegedly helped Iza scam Meta merchant accounts. They toured Iza's former Bel Air mansion. They interviewed his girlfriend, Iris Au. And they eventually interviewed the LASD deputies Iza had collectively paid six ­figures a month for security.


	On Sept. 23, 2024, the FBI took Iza into custody in Los Angeles. He was planning to go to Zurich, they had been told, and if he got on a plane, they feared, he might not come back.


	Last January, Adam Iza and Eric Saavedra both agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy charges that included “intimidation, extortion, illegal search warrants and other abuses of police power.” Iza also pleaded guilty to tax evasion and wire fraud, and admitted he'd defrauded Meta of more than $37 million by using phishing scams to sell lines of credit to advertisers. In his plea agreement, he also admitted to using law enforcement to extort a victim identified as L.A. in court documents of $127,000, and using LASD deputies to intimidate, harass, and extort the party planner, Chapell.

	











	Iza also admitted to using law enforcement to pull warrants on Zelocchi and Do, ordering one of his security personnel to rob Do, which resulted in Do's assault, and breaking into Zelocchi's house with the help of off-duty LASD deputies.


	Besides Saavedra, three other LASD deputies have been charged in the case. Saavedra and his attorney did not respond to repeated requests for comment.


	In July, two LASD deputies agreed to plea deals. David Anthony Rodriguez, 43, pleaded guilty to conspiracy against rights and admitted he had lied to a judge to improperly obtain a search warrant for a victim's GPS location, which he passed along to Saavedra. He faces up to 10 years in jail.


	Christopher Michael Cadman, 33, agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy against rights and subscribing to a false tax return. In previous court filings, Cadman had been referred to as “LASD Deputy 6,” and in his plea agreement, he admitted he had held Chapell, the party planner, at gunpoint until he transferred Iza $25,000. He also admitted he had coordinated the traffic stop a month later in which Chapell had been arrested after planted drugs were found in his car. Cadman faces up to 13 years in prison. He did not respond to a request for comment through his attorney.


	On Sept. 29, a third former LASD deputy, 44-year-old Michael Coberg, pleaded guilty to extortion and admitted to helping set up Chapell's false arrest. 


	In a statement reported by the Los Angeles Times in July, the L.A. Sheriff's Department said it had fully cooperated with the investigation and that it had fired Saavedra, Rodriguez, and Cadman. “These alleged actions, as detailed in federal court documents, are deeply disturbing and do not reflect the values of our Department or the dedicated work of the vast majority of our deputies who serve with integrity,” the statement read. LASD Sheriff Robert Luna, who was elected in 2022 on a campaign built largely around cleaning up the department, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Despite Luna establishing the Office of Constitutional Policing to root out deputy gangs, the county inspector general argued earlier this year that LASD had made no systemic effort to identify gang members within its ranks or investigate group misconduct. Critics point out that dec­ades-old, secretive clique structures remain deeply embedded in the department.


	Iza's victims, meanwhile, say they are doing their best to move on. Childs is still trying to get the $90,000 Iza owes him, plus legal fees (in a court filing, Iza has argued that Childs never adhered to their agreement). David Do says it's hard to put a price tag on the harassment campaign he endured. He says he never had the laptop Iza was so obsessed with finding, and that he isn't even a hacker. He claims he just responded to an ad on Freelancer.com to build a website for Zelocchi. Somehow, the surveillance teams watching Zelocchi had become convinced Do was something else entirely.

	











	Besides being mugged by one of Iza's henchmen, a brick was thrown through his window and his car was vandalized. “It's hard for me to go out at night,” Do says. “After everything that happened, I was just so paranoid. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone.”


	As for Zelocchi, he says Iza ruined his reputation in Hollywood. After Iza sued him, Zelocchi claims, he lost major film opportunities, was branded a criminal in industry circles, and had to flee Los Angeles. “Long story short, I was basically stopped for about three years,” he says. “I had to reinvent myself.”


	Now based largely in Dubai and Monaco, Zelocchi says he feels like a man living in exile. He still goes back to L.A. but is wary of staying too long. “His mind is dangerous as fuck,” he says of Iza. He adds, “I just want to do my routine — my walk on the beach with coffee, the same Starbucks, the same pizza place in Santa Monica.”


	A year or so before his arrest, Iza broke up with his longtime girlfriend, Iris Au. Last year, she announced she was dating a British model who had appeared on Love Island.


	Au agreed to a plea deal in March, admitting that she'd failed to report taxes on more than $2.6 million. She also agreed to forfeit any assets obtained through Zort or the various other shell companies authorities allege she and Iza set up to launder stolen crypto, including a Porsche, a Ferrari, three Mercedes-Benz, 14 Louis Vuitton bags, eight Hermès bags, two Dior bags, a glock, and a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle.


	From another apartment she rented with Iza, in Dana Point, California, police seized a black-and-yellow Jacob & Co. Godfather watch Iza wore and three Godfather sculptures. Through her attorney, Au declined to comment.

	











	Since his arrest, Iza has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A., which holds federal inmates awaiting trial, who can range from white-collar criminals to cartel enforcers. 


	“Personally, I'm not aware of a facility that's tougher than that one,” says Iza's attorney, Sadat. “That's not a knock on the officials who are over there. They have a very difficult job, and they're limited in their resources. It's more what the inmates are capable of. It's an ugly place to be.”


	At first, a source close to Iza says, he was despondent and felt betrayed by his friends, suspicious that anyone who had ever been close to him had simply been interested in his fortune. He even wondered if his family members, from whom he was estranged at the time, loved him. When they reached out to him to see how he was doing, he couldn't shake the thought that they were simply contacting him because they wanted money.


	“He actually wasn't happy even before he was arrested,” Sadat says. “He felt an emptiness.”


	But now, after spending roughly a year in jail — much of it in excruciating physical pain due to complications from leg-extension surgery — friends say Iza has reconnected with his family and rediscovered his Muslim faith. He prays daily.


	“The whole thing is a tragedy,” Sadat says. “You have somebody who clearly is very mentally advanced, who you could maybe even call a genius, extremely young, with the whole world in front of him, potentially millions and millions of dollars, and he took a wrong turn, largely because he surrounded himself with people who did not have his best interest in mind, nor helped push him in a direction that, I think, would have allowed him to use that brain of his for more good than bad, to create a better world. That's the sad part.”


	Through Sadat, Iza responded to a series of questions via email in August. He blamed the mistakes he'd made on bad choices that led him to use drugs and alcohol, and the wrong friends and mentors. He'd lived his “whole life behind a computer,” he said, and rarely left home as a teenager, suggesting his decision to move alone to Los Angeles at the age of 17 might have been avoided had he had a more traditional American upbringing.


	“Regrets? I've had a few,” Iza wrote. “But I've lived, I've learned, and now I will turn the tide, rise above it, stand tall, and continue the journey.”


	Iza's sentencing is scheduled for December. Sadat says he hopes the judge takes into consideration how young Iza is, just 25, and that he has no prior criminal record as an adult. And while Iza doesn't know how long he'll be in prison, he tells Sadat there's one thing he misses above everything else: computers. As soon as he can, he says, he's going to get on one.

Nikita Fadeev isn't so young any more. Fadeev began running London-based crypto hedge fund Fasanara Digital aged 25 in 2021. He's now nearly four years older and is no longer a candidate for the Forbes 30 under 30 list. But he's still a person to be watched. And he is also hiring.

Fasanara Digital, the circa $500m AUM crypto division of Fasanara Capital, which has $5.5bn in AUM, now employs 25 people. They include recent joiners with histories at big industry names.

For example, Conor White, who was head of technology for Citadel in Europe and Asia between 2005 and 2018, joined Fadeev's team last month as head of front office technology. Jerome Busca, a former portfolio manager at Millennium, joined in April.  We understand that a mystery head of high frequency trading has also joined recently from Tower Research.

Fadeev says the intention is for Fasanara Digital to employ 30 people by the end of Q1 2026. The focus will be DeFi ""with a few key hires in hunting out market neutral yield and building on-chain automation.""  This is because, ""protocols have shown themselves to be robust in the face of CEX volatility.""

Fadeev has a reputation for working long hours and trading every day of the week. Last time we spoke to him, aged 29 and employing 15 people, he'd stayed up all night before the US election and traded all weekend. 

It's not clear whether this was repeated on October 10th, when crypto crashed, but Fadeev said Fasanara Digital's systems ""performed well through the volatility"" and that it was the fund's highest volume day to date. Events like that simply help flush excess leverage out of the system, he added. ""We expect the medium- to long-term impact to be limited.""

Coinbase has urged the U.S. Treasury Department to scrap decades-old anti-money-laundering rules, calling them obsolete, and to adopt AI and zero-knowledge proofs to fight financial crime in digital assets.

The crypto exchange sent a letter to the Treasury on Friday, responding to the agency's request for comment on innovative methods to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.

""When bad guys innovate in financial crime, good guys need innovation to keep pace,"" Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal tweeted Monday..

Treasury initially published the request in the Federal Register in August.

In a blog post published in August, Grewal wrote that ""The Bank Secrecy Act Is Broken. Technology Can Fix It,"" saying the current compliance system is “rooted in decades-old requirements that reflect paper-based protocols designed for a financial system” where fund transfers take days.

The exchange has now called for establishing regulatory safe harbors under the Bank Secrecy Act for firms responsibly deploying AI to improve compliance programs, with conditions focusing on governance and outcomes rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all model. 

Federico Fabiano, Head of Legal & Compliance at Hex Trust, told Decrypt that ""the era of 'check-the-box' compliance needs to evolve,"" saying that reliance on existing laws may no longer be tenable. 

""We must collectively govern the integration of transformative tools like AI, which, powered by the immutable transparency of the blockchain, can finally move AML past the problem of low-value, static data,"" Fabiano said, calling the evolution ""an opportunity, not a constraint"" essential to securing a credible, compliant financial ecosystem.

Coinbase says the high compliance costs pose ""formidable barriers to entry for smaller financial service providers, including fintech startups,"" and are often passed on to customers through higher banking fees and denial of financial services, particularly affecting low-income customers.

Coinbase also urged Treasury to issue guidance clearly recognizing API-driven compliance technologies, including outlining acceptable use cases, data privacy requirements, and interoperability standards.

""The U.S. needs to move on this—now,"" Grewal tweeted.

The letter says current rules force Americans to complete new KYC checks for every financial account, sharing their data “with dozens of companies” that must store it for years, creating “honeypots for criminals.” 

It urges updating the Bank Secrecy Act to recognize decentralized IDs and zero-knowledge proofs as valid identity-verification methods.

Coinbase further requested that the Treasury publish guidance explicitly recognizing Know-Your-Transaction screening and blockchain analytics clustering as more effective compliance methods.

Coinbase said financial institutions file over 25 million reports to FinCEN each year, mostly on lawful activity, yet “the vast majority never result in a follow-up,” and despite a 2020 law to modernize the system, “little, if any, progress has been made.”

Privacy advocacy group Coin Center also submitted a response, with Executive Director Peter Van Valkenburgh warning that stablecoins on public chains with traditional AML requirements could create a ""CBDC-style panopticon.""

Treasury will compile responses into a congressional report for the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services, who will then formulate relevant guidance and legislative proposals.

The growing demand for crypto-friendly financial services has accelerated the rise of white-label crypto bank solutions. These ready-made platforms allow businesses to launch digital banks supporting both fiat and digital assets without building everything from scratch.

Modern consumers expect instant, secure, and compliant access to their money-whether in traditional currencies or cryptocurrencies. That's where white-label crypto banking software comes in: it provides the core technology, infrastructure, and compliance tools needed to operate a crypto-focused bank efficiently and safely.

A crypto bank is a financial institution or digital platform that merges traditional banking functions-such as deposits, transfers, and card payments-with cryptocurrency services like buying, selling, and storing digital assets. Unlike regular banks, crypto banks allow customers to manage both fiat and crypto funds within one account, offering greater flexibility and financial control.

A white-label crypto bank solution is a ready-made software platform that enables a company to launch its own branded crypto bank without developing it from scratch. It includes all the key components:

Essentially, it's a technological foundation that lets businesses focus on branding, licensing, and customer acquisition instead of building a complex banking core from the ground up.

A comprehensive crypto bank solution typically includes:

Support for both fiat and cryptocurrencies – such as USD, EUR, BTC, ETH, and stablecoins – within a unified system. Users can store, send, and convert assets instantly through built-in exchange modules.

Integrated identity verification, sanctions screening, and transaction monitoring help meet global regulatory requirements and prevent fraud.

Built-in exchange engines and liquidity integrations allow users to convert between crypto and fiat currencies at live market rates.

Linked debit or prepaid cards enable customers to spend crypto directly, with automatic conversion to fiat at the point of sale.

An admin portal for monitoring transactions, managing users, setting limits, and configuring fees and commissions.

Advanced systems may include staking or DeFi integrations, allowing customers to earn rewards or access lending products directly through the platform.

Bank-grade encryption (TLS, AES-256), two-factor authentication, and cold wallet storage ensure the highest security standards for user funds and data.

Building a crypto bank from scratch gives total autonomy but demands years of development and major financial investment. A white-label solution provides the same functionality much faster, with built-in compliance and security, enabling fintech companies and banks to focus on growth rather than infrastructure.

The white-label crypto banking market is expanding quickly as fintechs, EMIs, and established financial institutions look to integrate digital assets into their offerings. Below are five notable providers delivering reliable, ready-to-launch crypto banking infrastructure.

1. SDK.finance

SDK.finance delivers a full-scale digital and crypto banking platform for launching multi-asset financial products. Supports fiat and digital currencies, crypto wallets, exchange and conversion modules, and integrations with leading blockchain networks. Includes KYC/AML compliance, card issuing, and payment processing features. Available as SaaS or under a source code licence, providing enterprises with full ownership, scalability, and secure deployment across cloud or on-premise environments.

2. 4IRE Labs

4IRE Labs provides modular blockchain-based infrastructure for building crypto banks, including crypto-fiat gateways, compliance tools, and mobile apps. Known for its strong DeFi integration and fast time to market.

3. Antier Solutions

Antier Solutions offers comprehensive white-label crypto banking platforms with wallet management, trading, staking, and NFT features. Antier focuses on helping fintechs and banks bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain.

4. SoluLab

SoluLab delivers end-to-end crypto banking systems that include KYC/AML verification, card issuing, custodial wallets, and lending tools. The company is recognised for flexible deployment options and quick implementation.

5. Crassula.io

Crassula, a European provider, offers multi-currency accounts, IBAN support, and crypto payment features. Crassula's platform combines traditional digital banking with crypto management tools through open APIs.

The boundary between traditional finance and blockchain is fading. White-label crypto bank platforms are at the heart of this transition, helping institutions launch secure, compliant, and global services faster.

As regulation matures and public trust in digital assets grows, hybrid banks – managing both fiat and crypto in one account – will become the new standard for financial innovation.

Investment bank Citi (C) initiated coverage of Strategy (MSTR) with a buy/high risk rating and a $485 price target, positioning the stock as a leveraged bet on bitcoin BTC$113,023.06. 

MSTR shares were 1.5% higher in early trading on Tuesday, around $301.

The price target reflects Citi's 12-month bitcoin forecast of $181,000, representing 63% upside from current levels, and a 25% to 35% net asset value (NAV) premium, which aligns with Strategy's historical 2.5x to 3.5x bitcoin yield multiple, the bank said in the Tuesday report.

That structure, the bank's analysts argued, makes the stock an amplified play on bitcoin's performance, with outsized upside in bull markets and sharp drawdowns if prices reverse. 

Under Citi's bear-case scenario, with bitcoin down 25% and the NAV premium swinging from 35% to a 10% discount, the stock could lose about 61%.

The bank credits the company's pivot to bitcoin in 2020, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, as the model for the digital asset treasury strategy.

Strategy is expected to keep issuing convertible debt, preferred equity and stock, depending on the NAV premium, to expand its bitcoin position, the report said.

The report noted that the company's bitcoin yield, the year-to-date increase in BTC per fully diluted share, has been a key driver of the NAV premium.

Strategy said it had purchased another 168 BTC at an average price of $112,051, bringing total holdings to 640,418 BTC, in a filing on Monday.

Bitcoin BTC$113,023.06 is catching a bid on Tuesday as the record rally in precious metals reverses in a big way.

Gold saw a 5% decline to $4,130, its biggest daily drawdown in years. Silver also tumbled nearly 8%. The metals had surged over the past few months fueled by central banks moving into monetary easing mode, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and signs of liquidity and credit stress in the financial system. Frustratingly to bitcoin bulls, though, those catalysts had provided little boost to the world's largest crypto, which — with a couple of brief exceptions — has remained stuck in a tight range for months.

With the metals for at least this moment having fallen out of favor, however, money is flowing into bitcoin, which has rebounded to $112,700 after having dropped below $108,000 just hours ago. Ether ETH$4,035.93 also erased its overnight decline, bouncing back above $4,000.

Quinn Thomson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, said last week that BTC is poised to catch up to gold's rally. Charlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree, also argued that bitcoin's time to rally will come when gold rolls over to consolidate.

Crypto-related stocks haven't really gotten the news, with most in the red on Tuesday, particularly the bitcoin miners, many of which are now trading more as AI infrastructure plays.

IREN (IREN), Hut 8 (HUT) and Bitfarms (BITF) are lower by 3%-4%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is down 1.2% and Coinbase (COIN) is lower by 0.5%. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is managing a 1.7% gain.

U.S. Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller kicked off the central bank's first payments-innovation conference by vowing the Fed will embrace the crypto sector's innovations and saying he's asked staff to explore a lighter version of the so-called ""master accounts"" that give financial firms access to U.S. payment rails.



""My view from the Fed from now on is embrace the disruption, don't avoid it,"" Waller said to open the Tuesday event. ""The Fed intends to be an active part of that revolution.""



Waller, who is one of the governors on the seven-member Fed board, is reportedly among President Donald Trump's potential top candidates to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell when Powell's term is up next year. He said he suggested Tuesday's payment conference in order to get the new crypto-world innovators in the same room as the traditional payments-infrastructure incumbents.

""I believe we can and should do more to support those actively transforming the payment system,"" he said. ""To that end, I have asked Federal Reserve staff to explore the idea of what I'm calling a payment account.""



He described the idea as a ""skinny"" version of the full-fledged master accounts, allowing new entrants to payments a way to avoid the need for third-party relationships with institutions that have the full accounts. He suggested the lighter payment accounts ""would provide access to the Federal Reserve payment rails, while controlling for various risks the Federal Reserve and the payment system to control the size of the accounts and associated impacts on the Fed's balance sheet.""



They may not, for instance, pay interest on balances, come with daylight overdraft privileges or grant access to borrowing through the Fed's so-called ""discount window,"" and they may come with balance caps. Waller said the Fed would gather input on the idea, and the industry will hear ""more about this shortly.""



Waller isn't the vice chair for supervision, so he's not in a position to immediately direct Fed policy moves. The current vice chair is Michelle Bowman, and the overall board is still led by Chair Powell, who was appointed by Trump to that role but quickly ran afoul of the president during Trump's first term. But Waller has shown himself a prominent crypto ally at the Fed, having also just appeared at DC Fintech Week to praise decentralized finance (DeFi) innovations.



At that same event, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse lambasted Wall Street bankers' resistance to crypto firms getting Fed master accounts, which his company is among those applying for. Such accounts grant more seamless integration into the U.S. financial system and direct access to the central bank's payments systems, rather than forcing crypto-native firms to rely on outside relationships with banks.



""I wanted to send a message that this is a new era for the Federal Reserve in payments,"" Waller said on Tuesday. ""The DeFi industry is not viewed with suspicion or scorn.""He called the new Fed conference, ""an acknowledgement that distributed ledgers and crypto assets are no longer on the fringes but are increasingly woven into the fabric of the payment and financial system.""

Bitcoin BTC$113,023.06 holders facing steep tax bills have a new option to ease the burden — by converting what they owe into income-producing mining hardware.

Crypto lending firm Arch is rolling out TaxShield, which uses a specific provision of the U.S. tax code — bonus depreciation under IRS §168(k) — that allows investors to write off the cost of mining equipment against taxable income.

This is how it works: Users post Bitcoin as collateral for an overcollateralized loan from Arch, then use the loan proceeds to buy and host mining rigs through Blockware. The investor gets to deduct the full purchase in year one, potentially erasing hundreds of thousands in taxes while continuing to earn monthly mining rewards in BTC.

The offering, developed with prominent Bitcoin educator Mark Moss and Blockware, targets predominantly high-income BTC holders, Arch co-founders Himanshu Sahay and Dhruv Patel said in an interview with CoinDesk. A client with $1 million in taxable income could reduce their federal tax bill by roughly $400,000, while maintaining BTC exposure and earning mining income, they explained.

This is part of a broader push by Arch, best known for crypto-backed loans, to build out a suite of niche offerings that is typically available in traditional finance but aimed at high-net-worth digital asset holders.

""A lot of people who have built significant wealth in digital assets over the last 12 to 15 years, have not been able to access the same level of high quality financial services that you can access in the real world,"" Sahay told Coindesk.

The company's long-term goal, the founders said, is to evolve into a private bank-like service for crypto holders: a next-generation wealth management platform that handles lending, income, custody and tax planning.

TaxShield follows the recent launch of ""Perpetual Income,"" another product built with Mark Moss, which lets bitcoin holders draw recurring, tax-advantaged income without selling their assets.

Last year, Arch secured $70 million in debt financing from Galaxy and a $5 million equity round led by Morgan Creek Digital and Castle Island Ventures to expand its platform.

In the next few months, Arch is planning launching trading and is considering introducing card products beyond that, the co-founders said.

 BitMine chairman Tom Lee said he expects Ethereum to enter a supercycle, making the current price an attractive risk vs reward purchase. 

BitMine chairman Tom Lee has confirmed the company went on an Ether buying spree after the crypto market saw one of its most significant deleveraging events earlier this month. 

“Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year, ETH was $2,500, given the expected Supercycle for Ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward,” he said in a statement on Monday. 

BitMine bought up another $250 million Ether (ETH) on Monday from crypto exchanges Bitgo and Kraken, according to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence. 

This now brings BitMine more than halfway to its goal of holding 5% of Ether's total token supply, with total Ether holdings now at over 3.3 million tokens worth over $13 billion, and representing 2.74% of the total supply.

Lee made several bullish statements about Ether during the company's buying spree last week.  

During an episode of the Bankless podcast last Wednesday, Lee held firm on his prediction for Ether to hit $10,000 this year, despite just over two months remaining on the clock. To reach Lee's target, it would need to rise 150% from its price of $3,986 on Monday.

BitMine's stock (BMNR) shot up 7.92% to trade at $53.80 on Monday. In the last six month's the company's stock has gained over 691%.

“BitMine continues to attract institutional investor capital as our high liquidity is appealing. The combined trading volume share of BitMine and MSTR is now 88% of all global DAT trading volume,” Lee said.

BitMine is by far the largest Ether treasury company, with the next closest publicly listed stash held by SharpLink Gaming, totalling 840,012 tokens, according to StrategicETHReserves.

 Analyst Willy Woo warned the next crypto bear market could be driven by a business cycle downturn, last seen in 2008, before Bitcoin was invented. 

The next crypto bear market could be particularly brutal and driven by a business cycle downturn that has never been seen in crypto before, according to analyst Willy Woo.

The next bear market “will be defined by another cycle people forget about,” said Woo on Monday.

He said that we've previously had two cycles superimposed based upon the Bitcoin halving events every four years and the M2 global money supply. 

“Central banks inject M2 debasement in four-year cycles [and] both superimpose,” he said.

However, the next bear market will be defined by the business cycle, explained Woo. The last business cycle downturns that really took hold were 2008 and 2001, before crypto markets were invented, he said. 

A business cycle downturn is a period of economic contraction where GDP declines, unemployment rises, consumer spending falls, and business activity slows. It is also commonly referred to as a recession and typically follows periods of expansion.

Woo's point is that crypto markets don't exist in isolation and are affected by these broader economic cycles, particularly through their impact on liquidity.

The 2001 business cycle downturn, also known as the “dot-com bubble,” saw increasing unemployment and a 50% fall in the US stock markets (S&P 500) over two years. It was triggered by the collapse of overvalued tech companies and excessive speculation. 

In 2008, the “financial crisis” saw a large GDP contraction, a surge in unemployment, and a 56% drop in the S&P 500. It was triggered by a subprime mortgage crisis, banking system collapse, and credit freeze.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) tracks four main indicators to identify recessions: employment, personal income, industrial production and retail sales.

There was a spike in early 2020 due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns, but it was an extremely short recession. Currently, there is no imminent recession threat, though elevated risk remains.

This cycle has also been complicated by the introduction of trade tariffs, which have already trimmed growth in the first half of 2025 and are expected to continue dragging on GDP growth through the first half of 2026.

Each cargo load, despite being discovered in the same port, dated back to a different time period of the Iron Age.

Here is what you will learn when you read this story:

The sandbar off Israel's Carmel Coast is, in itself, a history lesson in Iron Age maritime shipping. Newly discovered cargo loads from three Iron Age shipwrecks paint a fascinating portrait of a bygone era of trade.

An excavation team using 3D modeling, multispectral imaging, digital mapping, combined with good old-fashioned traditional archaeological excavation, churned up roughly 25 percent of the sandbar off Dor, a former port city in Israel. In the process, the team located three shipwrecked cargo loads, all from different eras of the Iron Age. 

The Dor Lagoon—also known as Tantura Lagoon—was once Dor's port, a crossroads of Egyptian, Phoenician, and later Assyrian and Babylonian trade. The authors wrote in a study published in Antiquity that these were among the very few Iron Age cargoes known across the entire Mediterranean and the first tied to a known Iron Age port city in the southern Levant. Being the first-ever discovery of Iron Age ship cargo within a former port city in Israel, the discovery provides rare and direct evidence of trade in a period previously understood largely through land-based discoveries.

“While the excavations to date have only uncovered the uppermost layers of the site's sandbar,” the authors wrote in a statement, “the findings already point to Dor as a dynamic maritime center whose fortunes rose and fell with geopolitical tides.”

The study's authors, Thomas Levy, co-director of the University of California San Diego Qualcomm Institute Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability, and Assaf Yasur-Landau, founder of the University of Haifa's Laboratory for Coastal Archaeology and Underwater Survey, said that new patterns of connectivity, commerce, and political change are seen in the region from the 11th through sixth centuries B.C.E. via the wrecks. 

Each cargo find demonstrated shifting political and economic dynamics. At Dor M, the team uncovered the oldest remains of ship cargo, likely from the 11th century B.C.E. It features storage jars and an anchor inscribed with Cypro-Minoan writing. “Scripts on the anchor and storage jars found in Dor M suggest connections to Cyprus and Egypt,” the authors wrote, “and the typology of the storage jars provides a link to the Phoenician coast.” 

The Dor L1 find features Phoenician-style jars and thin-walled bowls from the late ninth to early eighth century B.C.E. While there's no obvious link to trade with Egypt and Cyprus in the cargo, that matches previous research that Dor's imports under Israelite control at that time dipped, even if it still proves out “unequivocal evidence for the continuation of maritime activity.” 

The most intact of the three finds is Dor L2, dated from the late seventh or early sixth century B.C.E. Teams found Cypriot-style basket-handle amphorae (tall, narrow-necked jars), one with grape seeds inside, as well as an anchor, and metallic iron and slag used in smelting. The anchor featured both wood and lead components, part of the period's early industrial-scale metal trade. 

The authors said that based on radiocarbon dating and residue analysis, the Dor L2 cargo is likely from the days when Dor was a thriving maritime hub operating under the imperial control of the Babylonian or Assyrian empires, which meshes with other Iron Age shipwreck finds along the Anatolian coast. These finds suggest “an expanded interaction zone” after Dor “returned to Phoenician hands.” 

Excavations will continue, and the authors expect to find additional artifacts, including the possibility of a ship's hull at Dor L2.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Feeling stressed? Science finds a simple way to take back control","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092833.htm","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 02:54:24 GMT","

A tight work deadline, a clogged toilet, or a disagreement with a loved one can make an ordinary day feel overwhelming. When several of these small frustrations build up, stress can quickly escalate. But according to new research that includes scientists from Penn State, simply feeling more in control might help make those everyday challenges easier to handle.

The study found that on days when people felt they had greater control over their stressors, they were 62% more likely to take action -- such as calling a plumber or addressing a difficult conversation -- to solve the problem. This effect became even stronger with age. The results suggest that a person's sense of control can serve as an important psychological resource that can be strengthened over time to help manage stress and improve health outcomes.

The findings were published in the journal Communications Psychology.

Small Boosts, Big Benefits

""This research shows that even small boosts in how much control people feel they have over everyday hassles make it more likely that those hassles actually get resolved,"" said David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Penn State and senior author on the paper. ""Learning to find and act on these pockets of control in daily life may not only reduce stress but also support long-term health and well-being.""

Previous work led by Almeida has shown that stress responses fluctuate over time and that even minor daily inconveniences can affect health when they accumulate. Actively resolving stressors -- such as clearing up an argument -- is a key part of processing stress and allows emotions to settle more quickly.

Measuring How Control Affects Stress

In this new study, the researchers wanted to know whether a sense of personal control -- how much people feel they can influence their daily challenges -- affects whether a stressor gets resolved. For instance, does believing you can fix a billing mistake make you more likely to call the company? The team also examined what influences that sense of control, including the type of stress, how often stressors occur, and socioeconomic conditions.

""If perceived stressor control promotes stress resolution, can we leverage that as a modifiable resource to influence stressor resolution and therefore our emotional health and well-being?"" asked lead author Dakota Witzel, who was a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Healthy Aging at Penn State during the time of the research and is now an assistant professor at South Dakota State University.

Tracking Daily Stress Over a Decade

The researchers analyzed data from more than 1,700 adults who took part in the National Study of Daily Experiences, part of the long-running Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS), a national study on health and well-being. For eight consecutive days, participants reported any daily stressors they experienced within the previous 24 hours and whether each stressor was resolved by the end of the day. Common sources of stress included interpersonal tensions (arguments or avoided arguments), home or work overload, and ""network stress"" -- problems affecting friends or family that still caused distress for the participant.

Participants also rated how much control they felt over each stressor on a four-point scale (none, a little, some, or a lot of control). The same survey was repeated with these participants 10 years later to see whether the connection between perceived control and stress resolution changed with time.

Control Levels Fluctuate From Day to Day

Results showed that people's sense of control can shift greatly from one day to the next. In other words, feeling in control is not a fixed personal trait -- it's a daily perception that varies depending on circumstances.

Across all ages, on days when people felt more in control than usual -- for instance, feeling ""some"" control instead of ""a little"" -- they were significantly more likely to resolve the stressor. This pattern held true regardless of the stressor's type or intensity.

Interestingly, the connection grew stronger with age. Early in the study, participants who felt a higher-than-usual level of control were 61% more likely to resolve their stressors that day. A decade later, the same boost in perceived control raised that likelihood to 65%.

""This work also begins to show that as we get older, not only do we have more control but that control helps us get better at handling stress,"" Witzel said.

Building a Sense of Control

The findings suggest that perceived control can serve as a key tool for reducing daily stress.

""It's encouraging news that daily control isn't fixed. It can be strengthened through practical strategies such as setting priorities or reframing what's within reach,"" Almeida said. ""We need to figure out how we can create the context and setting to allow people to feel more control.""

Practical ways to build control include focusing on what's within reach, breaking large challenges into smaller steps, and using time blocking or lists to track progress. These small wins can create momentum and reduce stress. Asking for help or delegating tasks can also boost the sense of support and control. Ending each day with a short reflection may help people prepare mentally for the next day.

What's Next for the Research

The team plans to keep studying how perceived control interacts with long-term or chronic stress.

""In this study, we're talking about daily stressors, the minor inconveniences that occur throughout the day, but there's also chronic stress where people are continually impacted by stressors again and again,"" Witzel said. ""Exploring the idea of whether resolution can be a mechanism that decreases the effect of chronic stress is an interesting area to explore.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists stumble on a hidden quantum trick in 2D materials","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251021083640.htm","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:39:21 GMT","

When arranged in just the right ways, two-dimensional materials can display unusual and valuable quantum effects such as superconductivity and exotic types of magnetism. Understanding why these effects arise, and how to control them, remains one of the biggest challenges for physicists and engineers. A new study published in Nature Physics has uncovered a previously unseen property that may explain how these mysterious quantum phases form and evolve.

Using a novel terahertz (THz) spectroscopy method, researchers found that thin stacks of 2D materials -- commonly used in laboratories worldwide -- can naturally create what are called cavities. These tiny spaces confine both light and electrons into even smaller regions, significantly altering their interactions and behavior.

""We've uncovered a hidden layer of control in quantum materials and opened a path to shaping light-matter interactions in ways that could help us both understand exotic phases of matter and ultimately harness them for future quantum technologies,"" said James McIver, assistant professor of physics at Columbia and lead author of the paper.

The work traces its origins to Hamburg, where McIver led a research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD). The institute is part of the Max Planck-New York Center on Nonequilibrium Quantum Phenomena, a collaboration among MPSD, Columbia, the Flatiron Institute, and Cornell University. Researchers at the Center study how stable physical systems respond when pushed away from equilibrium.

McIver's team explores these questions through light. ""2D materials, with their fascinating macroscopic properties, often behave like black boxes. By shining light on them, we can literally shed light on the hidden behavior of their electrons, revealing details that would otherwise remain unseen,"" said Gunda Kipp, a PhD student at MPSD and first author of the paper. One obstacle, however, is that the wavelengths of light needed to probe 2D materials are far larger than the materials themselves, which are thinner than a human hair.

To overcome this scale mismatch, the researchers developed a chip-sized spectroscope that compresses THz light -- the range where many quantum effects occur -- from about 1 millimeter down to just 3 micrometers. This compact design made it possible to directly observe how electrons move within 2D materials. They first tested their approach using graphene, a well-known form of carbon, to measure its optical conductivity.

What they found was unexpected: distinct standing waves.

""Light can couple to electrons to form hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. These quasiparticles move as waves and, under certain conditions, they can become confined, much like the standing wave on a guitar string that produces a distinct note,"" explained MPSD postdoctoral fellow and co-first-author Hope Bretscher.

In a guitar, the string's fixed ends define where the wave can form. Pressing a finger on the string shortens the wave, changing the pitch of the note. In optics, a similar process occurs when two mirrors trap light between them, creating a standing wave inside what scientists call a cavity. When a material is placed inside that cavity, the trapped light can repeatedly interact with it, altering its electronic properties.

However, the researchers discovered that mirrors might not even be necessary.

""We found that the material's own edges already act as mirrors,"" said Kipp. With their THz spectroscope, they observed that excited streams of electrons reflect off the edges to form a type of hybrid light-matter quasiparticle called a plasmon polariton.

The McIver lab studied a device made up of multiple layers, each of which can act as a cavity separated by a few tens of nanometers. The plasmons that form in each layer can, in turn, interact -- often strongly. ""It's like connecting two guitar strings; once linked, the note changes,"" said Bretscher. ""In our case, it changes drastically.""

The next step was to understand what determines the frequencies of these quasiparticles and how tightly light and matter couple together. ""With co-author and MPSD postdoctoral fellow Marios Michael, we developed an analytical theory that only needed a handful of geometric sample parameters to match the observations of our experiments,"" said Kipp. ""With just a click of a button, our theory can extract the properties of a material and will help us design and tailor future samples to obtain specific properties. For example, by tracking resonances as functions of carrier density, temperature, or magnetic field, we may uncover the mechanisms driving different quantum phases.""

While this study focused on plasmons, the new chip-scale THz spectroscope could detect other types of quasiparticles oscillating in many different 2D materials. The team is already testing new samples in both Hamburg and New York.

""This whole project was a bit of a serendipitous discovery. We didn't expect to see these cavity effects, but we're excited to use them to manipulate phenomena in quantum materials going forward,"" said Bretscher. ""And now that we have a technique to see them, we're intrigued to learn how they might be affecting other materials and phases.""

An idea once dismissed as science fiction -- cooling Earth by scattering sunlight-reflecting particles into the upper atmosphere -- is now being taken seriously by researchers. This proposed technique, called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), aims to offset global warming by mimicking the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. Hundreds of scientific models have explored how it might work. Yet researchers at Columbia University caution that those models overlook how complex, uncertain, and potentially risky such an effort would be.

""Even when simulations of SAI in climate models are sophisticated, they're necessarily going to be idealized. Researchers model the perfect particles that are the perfect size. And in the simulation, they put exactly how much of them they want, where they want them. But when you start to consider where we actually are, compared to that idealized situation, it reveals a lot of the uncertainty in those predictions,"" says V. Faye McNeill, an atmospheric chemist and aerosol scientist at Columbia's Climate School and Columbia Engineering.

""There are a range of things that might happen if you try to do this -- and we're arguing that the range of possible outcomes is a lot wider than anybody has appreciated until now.""

Exploring the Limits of Solar Geoengineering

In a study published in Scientific Reports, McNeill and her team examined the physical, political, and economic barriers that make SAI far more complicated in reality than in theory. They reviewed existing studies to understand how the results of SAI would depend on the details of how and where it is deployed. Key factors include the altitude and latitude of particle release, the time of year, and the total amount of material injected into the atmosphere.

Among these variables, latitude appears to have the greatest influence. SAI efforts concentrated near the poles, for example, could disrupt tropical monsoons, while releases near the equator might alter jet streams and interfere with global air circulation.

""It isn't just a matter of getting five teragrams of sulfur into the atmosphere. It matters where and when you do it,"" says McNeill. These variabilities suggest that, if SAI takes place, it should be done in a centralized, coordinated fashion. Given geopolitical realities, however, the researchers say that is unlikely.

Lessons From Volcanoes

Most climate models studying SAI assume the use of sulfate aerosols, similar to the compounds produced by volcanic eruptions. When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, for instance, global temperatures dropped by nearly one degree Celsius for several years. That event is often cited as evidence that SAI could temporarily cool the planet.

But volcanic activity also highlights the risks. Pinatubo's eruption disrupted the Indian monsoon system, reduced rainfall across South Asia, and contributed to ozone depletion. Similar side effects could result from artificial sulfate releases, including acid rain and soil contamination. These concerns have pushed scientists to investigate other, potentially safer materials.

Searching for Better Materials

Proposed alternatives include minerals such as calcium carbonate, alpha alumina, rutile and anatase titania, cubic zirconia, and even diamond. While much attention has been paid to how well these materials might scatter sunlight, other essential questions -- such as their availability and practicality -- have been less explored.

""Scientists have discussed the use of aerosol candidates with little consideration of how practical limitations might limit your ability to actually inject massive amounts of them yearly,"" says Miranda Hack, an aerosol scientist at Columbia University and the new paper's lead author. ""A lot of the materials that have been proposed are not particularly abundant.""

Diamond, for instance, would perform well optically but is far too scarce and expensive to use. Cubic zirconia and rutile titania could meet demand in theory, but economic modeling by the Columbia team suggests production costs would skyrocket with increased demand. Only calcium carbonate and alpha alumina are abundant enough to be feasible at scale, yet both face serious technical problems during dispersion.

Small Particles, Big Problems

For SAI to work, particles must remain extremely small -- less than one micron in size. However, the mineral alternatives tend to clump together into larger aggregates. These larger clusters scatter sunlight less effectively and behave unpredictably in the atmosphere.

""Instead of having these perfect optical properties, you have something much worse. In comparison to sulfate, I don't think we would necessarily see the types of climate benefits that have been discussed,"" says Hack.

A Strategy Full of Uncertainty

According to the researchers, the many unknowns surrounding SAI -- from deployment logistics to material performance -- make the technique even more uncertain than previously believed. These challenges should be clearly acknowledged when policymakers and scientists discuss the future of solar geoengineering.

""It's all about risk trade-offs when you look at solar geoengineering,"" says Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at the Columbia Business School and a close collaborator with the Climate School. Given the messy realities of SAI, he says, ""it isn't going to happen the way that 99 percent of these papers model.""

The study also lists Daniel Steingart, co-director of the Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center, as a coauthor. Together, the team emphasizes that while SAI may seem like an attractive quick fix for global warming, the path to actually cooling the planet could be far more perilous and unpredictable than it appears.

For decades, doctors have depended on indicators such as body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio to gauge a person's risk for chronic disease. But researchers are now turning their attention to a different, often-overlooked measurement: neck circumference.

While a thick neck may suggest physical power, like that of athletes in contact sports, research indicates it could also be a marker of hidden health risks.

Why Neck Size Matters

BMI calculates body fat by comparing weight to height, but it doesn't always paint an accurate picture. A muscular athlete may register a high BMI without carrying excess fat. This is where measuring neck size can offer additional clues about what's happening inside the body.

Studies have found that individuals with larger necks relative to their body size are more likely to develop serious health issues. The reason lies in fat distribution -- particularly in the upper body.

Fat stored around the upper torso releases fatty acids into the bloodstream, which can interfere with how the body regulates cholesterol, blood sugar, and heart rhythm. In effect, neck circumference acts as a visible indicator of visceral fat, the harmful kind that accumulates around internal organs.

The Link to Heart Disease and Other Conditions

Evidence connecting neck size to health outcomes is compelling. People with thicker necks show higher rates of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.

Atrial fibrillation is of particular concern because it causes irregular heartbeats and erratic blood flow, raising the risk of blood clots and stroke. Over time, this irregular rhythm can strain the heart and lead to failure.

Neck circumference is also tied to coronary heart disease, where narrowed arteries reduce the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart.

More Than Just Heart Health

The risks don't stop at cardiovascular problems. Larger neck size is associated with a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, both of which can lead to long-term complications such as nerve damage, vision loss, and limb amputation.

Sleep disorders are another major concern. A thicker neck is a known risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This not only leads to severe daytime fatigue but also places additional stress on the heart and blood vessels. People with sleep apnea are also more prone to accidents caused by exhaustion.

When Neck Size Becomes a Warning

So, how big is too big? Research suggests that men with a neck circumference of 17 inches (43 cm) or more, and women with 14 inches (35.5 cm) or more, face elevated health risks.

Perhaps most surprising, these dangers are not limited to people who are overweight. Even individuals with a normal BMI may be at risk if their neck measurements exceed these thresholds. For every additional centimeter beyond that range, the likelihood of hospitalization and early death increases.

Taking Action

If your neck measurement falls above these levels, there's no reason for alarm, but it's worth noting. Neck size represents only one piece of your overall health profile, yet it can reveal important information that other metrics might overlook.

The positive news is that neck circumference can change with lifestyle improvements. Regular cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and sufficient sleep all contribute to better metabolic health. Eating a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and pulses supports weight management and reduces unhealthy fat storage.

How to Measure Your Neck

Checking your neck size is simple. Use a flexible tape measure and wrap it around the narrowest part of your neck, keeping the tape snug but not tight. The process takes only a few seconds.

A Simple Measurement With Big Meaning

This quick check can highlight potential risks that traditional metrics might miss. While neck circumference shouldn't replace established health assessments, it provides a valuable, easy-to-use tool for understanding cardiovascular and metabolic health.

In our search for better ways to predict and prevent disease, it turns out some of the most revealing clues are right in front of us. Your neck may be quietly reflecting more about your health than you think -- and it's worth paying attention.

A newly developed method that improves the accuracy of ankle blood pressure measurements could transform care for people who are unable to have their blood pressure taken from the arm.

Researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School, in a study published in BMJ Open and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), analyzed data from more than 33,000 individuals to create a personalized predictive model. This model enables healthcare professionals to estimate arm blood pressure more precisely using ankle readings (when compared with earlier approaches). To make the process easier to use, the team has also launched an online calculator that helps both clinicians and patients interpret ankle-based results.

Why Accuracy in Blood Pressure Measurement Matters

More than one billion people worldwide live with high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. Reliable measurements are crucial for diagnosing and managing the condition effectively.

Although blood pressure is typically measured on the upper arm, some people cannot have it taken there due to disability, limb loss, or conditions such as stroke. In such cases, readings are taken from the ankle. However, ankle measurements are usually higher than arm readings, and because treatment guidelines are based on arm data, this difference can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate treatment decisions.

Improving Accuracy and Reducing Misdiagnoses

Professor Chris Clark, who led the research, explained: ""Our new method will give a more accurate blood pressure reading for around two percent more people. This doesn't sound a big number but remember, around a third of adults have high blood pressure and once you get into your 60s it's more than half of the adults. The NHS Health Check Programme diagnoses 38,000 new cases annually in England alone, so two percent equates to 750 fewer potential misdiagnoses per year in England, and tens of thousands globally.""

To achieve this, the researchers used statistical modeling on data from 33,710 people (mean age 58 years, 45 per cent female) across multiple countries. The analysis explored the relationship between arm and ankle blood pressures, developed a predictive equation for estimating arm values from ankle readings, and examined how ankle readings relate to important health outcomes (such as heart attack risk).

This advancement could help close a significant health gap by providing accurate and personalized blood pressure results for people who have been excluded from standard monitoring. It is estimated that up to 10,000 adults in the UK live with upper limb loss, while 75 per cent of the country's 1.3 million stroke survivors experience upper limb difficulties that can make arm-based measurements challenging or impossible.

The project received support from the Stroke Association and the Thalidomide Trust, two organizations advocating for people affected by these conditions.

Expert Reactions and Public Health Impact

Juliet Bouverie OBE, CEO of the Stroke Association, said: ""Someone in the UK has a stroke every five minutes, with high blood pressure accounting for around half of those. Around two-thirds of stroke survivors will leave hospital with some form of disability, including paralysis in an arm, which can prevent getting accurate blood pressure readings from the affected limb. Many stroke survivors feel anxious about having another stroke, so receiving an accurate blood pressure reading in the ankle will not only provide benefits in the primary prevention of stroke, but importantly in easing the minds of stroke survivors who are already dealing with the devastating impact of stroke.""

Professor Kevin Munro, Director of NIHR's Research for Patient Benefit Programme, said: ""This research has identified an ingenious solution to an important problem -- finding a way to measure blood pressure for people who cannot have it monitored via the upper arm. Keeping track of blood pressure is a vital tool to help keep people healthy and this NIHR-funded research will help to spot high blood pressure and treat it even more widely.""

The paper titled ""Arm Based on LEg blood pressures (ABLE-BP): Can systolic ankle blood pressure measurements predict systolic arm blood pressure? An individual participant data meta-analysis from the INTERPRESS-IPD Collaboration"" is published in BMJ Open.

The online calculator is available at: ABLE-BP Tool -- https://ablebp.research.exeter.ac.uk/

""Why should I not be able to have my blood pressure taken?""

TV presenter Sue Kent, 62 from Swansea, has an upper limb disability caused by the drug Thalidomide, which was prescribed to her mother during pregnancy. She has eight-inch arms which aren't big enough for blood pressure to be taken.

Sue said: ""I rarely had my blood pressure taken when I was younger, but when I did, I used to have a really big cuff they would put around my thigh and take the blood pressure there. Whether it was accurate or not nobody worried, but I didn't seem to have blood pressure problems.

""But then I had a cataract operation, and somebody took my blood pressure from my ankle, and it was very high. They did it three times and every time it was high, and it made me very worried. They (medical staff) weren't worried and carried on and did the cataract operation, but I was quite distressed.""

Sue was diagnosed with Meniere's disease in 2017, which is a rare inner ear condition which has left her partially deaf.

She said: ""I was worried I was going to have a stroke because Meniere's can be an indicator the blood flow isn't going to the brain. I knew I couldn't have my blood pressure taken accurately, so I went privately to have dye injected to check everything was OK.

""As you get older blood pressure is an important indicator of so many things, including things that could be seriously wrong. Prodding about in the dark and guessing isn't really a safe thing to do. You need the right information about your blood pressure.""

Sue hopes this new method could potentially help her and thousands of others like her have something most of us take for granted -- an accurate blood pressure reading.

She said: ""Why should I not be able to have my blood pressure taken when it's available to most people and is a relatively simple thing to do?

""When you're disabled, you're more likely to die younger for a variety of reasons, so this resource tips the scales a bit more in our favor. This could put us on a level playing field with everybody else when it comes to blood pressure. It means reassurance and maybe an early diagnosis if something is wrong.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How just minutes of running can supercharge your health","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092848.htm","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 10:02:59 GMT","

Running offers a wide range of advantages for both body and mind. It can protect against disease, improve mood, and even slow down the body's natural aging process.

Yet about 31% of adults still don't get enough physical activity, including running. The most common reason people give is simple -- they don't have enough time.

That's where interval running comes in. It promises nearly all the same benefits of regular running, but in a fraction of the time.

What Is Interval Running?

Interval running is based on the principles of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), a workout style that alternates short bursts of intense effort with brief recovery periods. Although HIIT has existed for nearly a century, it became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s through training methods like Tabata (20 seconds of intense movement followed by ten seconds of rest) and CrossFit (a demanding combination of cardio, gymnastics, and weightlifting).

In a typical HIIT workout, you might do 30 seconds of burpees at full effort, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat the sequence several times. The alternating pattern challenges the body to adapt and recover quickly, leading to major fitness improvements in less time.

This same approach can easily be applied to running for those who want to see results faster without spending hours on the road.

How to Apply HIIT Principles to Running

One simple example is the ""10-20-30 method."" This routine involves 30 seconds of walking or slow jogging, 20 seconds of running at a moderate pace, and a final 10 seconds of all-out sprinting.

Another option is the ""fartlek"" method (Swedish for ""speed play""), which adds short sprints at random intervals during a jog. Instead of maintaining a steady pace, you mix in bursts of speed throughout your run, keeping things dynamic and fun.

The Science-Backed Benefits of Interval Running

Research consistently shows that HIIT-style running provides significant health improvements for the heart, metabolism, and body composition (how much fat the body stores and where it's located).

In studies involving overweight or obese participants, sprint intervals led to greater gains in cardiovascular fitness than steady-paced runs. Those who sprinted showed higher improvements in their V̇O₂ max -- the measure of how much oxygen the body can use during intense activity.

Even people who already run regularly can benefit. In one 12-week study, runners who added HIIT sessions to their endurance training saw greater improvements in V̇O₂ peak, another key measure of cardiovascular performance. Higher V̇O₂ values are linked not only to better athletic ability but also to a lower risk of premature death.

Improved Metabolism and Fat-Burning Power

Studies also show that alternating bursts of running and walking can improve metabolic health more effectively than continuous exercise. Specifically, interval training enhances blood glucose control, which helps reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Workouts like the 10-20-30 method also stimulate the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, more than steady exercise does. This leads to improved stamina, better blood pressure, and healthier cholesterol levels. It even helps lower ""bad"" cholesterol while reducing overall cardiovascular risk.

Both continuous and interval running can decrease visceral fat (the harmful fat stored around organs), but HIIT accomplishes it in less time. Just 18 minutes of sprint intervals, three times a week, can lead to noticeable health benefits.

Getting Started With Interval Running

If you're ready to try interval running, start small. When running outdoors, you can sprint between two lamp posts, then recover by walking or jogging to the next one. This simple approach is a classic form of fartlek training.

At the gym, you can replicate this using either a motorized or non-motorized treadmill. Many treadmills even have built-in interval programs that guide you through sprint and recovery periods. Walking intervals can also provide benefits for beginners or those easing back into exercise.

Sprints can last anywhere from a few seconds to two minutes. To maximize results, aim to push your heart rate to around 90% of your maximum effort during the intense intervals, then allow yourself enough time to recover before the next one.

Build Up Gradually and Stay Safe

Like any fitness plan, interval running should be introduced gradually. If you've been inactive for a long period, jumping straight into intense workouts can increase the risk of injury or strain.

It's also wise to check with your doctor before beginning a new exercise routine, especially if you have health conditions. For example, people with diabetes should know that HIIT can cause temporary increases in blood sugar, so consulting a healthcare professional is important before starting.

A practical starting point is to include a few sprints in your next run -- anywhere from several seconds to a full minute. Over two to three months, you're likely to see measurable improvements in stamina and health.

If sprints feel too challenging at first, try the 10-20-30 method or ""Jeffing"" (alternating periods of running and walking). Even a small increase in running intensity now and then can lead to significant long-term fitness gains.

Small Effort, Big Results

Interval running proves that fitness doesn't have to demand hours of dedication. By combining short bursts of effort with brief recovery periods, you can boost cardiovascular health, strengthen metabolism, and burn fat more efficiently -- all in a fraction of the time.

Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) integrates diverse types of data via machine learning to improve understanding, prediction and decision-making across disciplines such as healthcare, science and engineering. However, most multimodal AI advances focus on models for vision and language data, and their deployability remains a key challenge. We advocate a deployment-centric workflow that incorporates deployment constraints early on to reduce the likelihood of undeployable solutions, complementing data-centric and model-centric approaches. We also emphasize deeper integration across multiple levels of multimodality through stakeholder engagement and interdisciplinary collaboration to broaden the research scope beyond vision and language. To facilitate this approach, we identify common multimodal-AI-specific challenges shared across disciplines and examine three real-world use cases: pandemic response, self-driving car design and climate change adaptation, drawing expertise from healthcare, social science, engineering, science, sustainability and finance. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and open research practices, our community can accelerate deployment-centric development for broad societal impact.

When students entered Tsinghua University in Beijing this year, one of the first representatives they met wasn't a person. Admission letters to the prestigious institution came with an invitation code to an artificial-intelligence agent. The bot is designed to answer students' questions about courses, clubs and life on campus.

The future of universities

The future of universities

At Ohio State University in Columbus, students this year will take compulsory AI classes as part of an initiative to ensure that all of them are ‘AI fluent' by the time they graduate. And at the University of Sydney, Australia, students will take traditional, in-person tests to prove that they have learnt the required skills and not outsourced them to AI.

All this is part of a sea change sweeping through campuses as universities and students scramble to adapt to the use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. These tools can, within seconds, analyse complex information, answer questions and generate polished essays — some of the exact skills that universities have conventionally taught. Eighty-six per cent of university students were regularly using AI in their studies in 2024, according to one global survey1 — and some polls show even more. “We are seeing students become power users of these tools,” says Marc Watkins, a researcher who specializes in AI and education at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.

To some, AI presents an exciting opportunity to improve education and prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Universities such as Tsinghua and Ohio State are already weaving AI into their teaching — and some studies hint that AI-powered tools can help students to learn. A randomized controlled trial2 involving physics undergraduates at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, suggested that those who used a custom-built AI tutor learnt more in less time than did students who were taught by humans alone.

But many education specialists are deeply concerned about the explosion of AI on campuses: they fear that AI tools are impeding learning because they're so new that teachers and students are struggling to use them well. Faculty members also worry that students are using AI to short-cut their way through assignments and tests, and some research3 hints that offloading mental work in this way can stifle independent, critical thought.

Universities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more

Universities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more

And some academics are angry that universities are allowing or even encouraging the use of AI tools — many of which are controlled by companies, have unknown cognitive impacts and are dogged by ethical and environmental concerns. An open letter released in June by scholars objecting to the uncritical adoption of AI technologies by universities quickly racked up more than 1,000 signatures from academics worldwide (see go.nature.com/4qpkygs). “Our funding must not be misspent on profit-making companies, which offer little in return and actively de-skill our students,” it reads.

There is one point of agreement among both enthusiasts and sceptics: the future has already arrived. “The rate of adoption of various generative AI tools by students and faculty across the world has been accelerating too fast for institutional policies, pedagogies and ethics to keep up,” says Shafika Isaacs, chief of section for technology and AI in education at the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO, in Paris.

Universities have been adapting to new technologies for decades — from computers and the Internet to online courses. But generative AI tools present a fundamental challenge, researchers say. Not only can they quickly perform some of the core tasks that universities teach students, but they have spread and are changing at pace. “The thing that is different about AI to every other technology is the speed at which it moves,” says Sue Attewell, head of AI at Jisc, a non-profit digital and data body for UK higher education, headquartered in Bristol.

Surveys around the world show that students are quickly incorporating AI into their lives. “The number of users who are essentially young teens is just astronomically high,” says Watkins. “You're talking hundreds of millions of users worldwide below the age of 24.” And science students seem to be early adopters. This year, the AI firm Anthropic, in San Francisco, California, analysed one million anonymized conversations between university students and its generative AI, Claude. It found that students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics were using it disproportionately more than were those in areas such as business and humanities4.

But what are students using AI for? In a survey of more than 1,000 UK students by the Higher Education Policy Institute, a think tank in Oxford, UK, most were, unsurprisingly, using AI tools to write, improve or summarize text (see ‘How university students use AI'). Nearly 90% of students said they had used generative AI for assessments such as exams or coursework. Most (58%) said they used it to explain concepts in the assessment, 25% used AI-generated text after editing it first and 8% admitted they'd used raw AI-written text5.

Attewell, who has conducted student focus groups on AI, says many students are using the tools to streamline their studies and become more efficient, not to cheat. And many just want guidance on how to boost their learning with AI, she says. Students might “know how to use [AI] brilliantly on social media or for their social life, but it doesn't mean that they know how to use it for academic use”.

This, however, is where many universities are falling short. Institutions around the world have been scrambling to introduce policies for staff and students on the best ways to use AI — but with mixed results. On US campuses, “it's been chaotic for the past two and a half years, and I don't think it's going to change anytime soon,” Watkins says. That's because many institutions allow individual faculty members to decide whether and how AI can be used in their courses, he says, which leaves some students confused. “We might have a freshman student taking five classes, and they will be exposed to five different AI policies.”

In Australia, by contrast, there has been a strong, nationally coordinated response, educators say, in part because the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency has worked to develop guidelines with universities since 2023. And in China, “the integration of AI into universities is not optional, but an integral part of national strategy,” says Ronghuai Huang, co-dean of the Smart Learning Institute at Beijing Normal University.

Data and anecdote suggest that faculty members are embracing AI more cautiously than students are. Some staff are using AI tools to automate their own work, such as by helping to draft feedback on assignments, say researchers, whereas others are rejecting it outright. A survey this year of more than 1,600 faculty members from 28 countries by the Digital Education Council, an organization focused on technology in higher education, found that around 60% were using AI tools in teaching — less than the proportion of students using them6. However, 80% said their institution had not made it clear how to use AI in their teaching. “Faculty use is less sophisticated than student use,” says George Siemens, who studies technology and education at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.

Meanwhile, big technology companies such as OpenAI and Google have been pitching their products to students and universities. “We're inundated by companies wanting to partner with us,” says Ravi Bellamkonda, Ohio State University's executive vice-president and provost. Last year, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Edu, a version of the popular chatbot tailored for universities. This February, when the California State University system announced it was giving its 520,000 students and faculty members access to that tool, it became “the largest implementation of ChatGPT by any single organization or company anywhere in the world”, according to OpenAI. In August, Google announced it was making its most advanced AI tools available for free to students aged over 18 in the United States and in a handful of other countries.

Education specialists say that tech firms are motivated by commercial interests and the opportunity to embed their AI systems into the lives of millions of young users. Universities that strike agreements with tech firms typically get campus-wide access to the latest AI models and data protection, meaning that student and faculty data and academic work are not fed into an AI training model.

Some universities are grabbing the AI bull by the horns. Danny Liu, a biologist who specializes in educational technology at the University of Sydney, was one of the first to develop a generative AI platform tailored to higher education. Called Cogniti and developed in 2023, it is now embedded in the university's digital learning platform and allows teachers to design custom AI agents for their courses. This might be an AI tutor for a science module, or an AI tool that expands brief marking comments into more specific student feedback. Cogniti is being used by more than 1,000 educators at his university, Liu says, and has been shared with more than 100 universities worldwide.

At Tsinghua University, academics also quickly started experimenting with ChatGPT after its release in November 2022, says Shuaiguo Wang, who directs the Center for Online Education there. Within a year, about 100 different AI teaching assistants had sprung up, and the university sought a more systematic approach. It also didn't want to be reliant on any one AI model — such as the large language models (LLMs) that underlie ChatGPT and related tools — because “a new model emerges almost every day”, Wang says. Another key goal was to correct hallucinations, the inaccurate content that LLMs sometimes spout.

In April last year, the university led the development of a central, three-layer ‘architecture' to incorporate AI into teaching. The bottom layer is where AI models are plugged in: the system draws on about 30 models from companies including DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud, OpenAI and Google, Wang says. The middle layer contains ‘knowledge engines' that hold accurate, up-to-date information for different academic fields. The top layer consists of various student-facing platforms, including an educational one that hosts teaching assistants, as well as the AI bot to help students starting at Tsinghua.

As part of this system, for instance, students can review slides after a class and click a button saying ‘I'm confused'. This allows them to ask a pop-up AI agent questions. The intermediary layer analyses the question and directs it to the appropriate AI model, as well as searching its own databases; it then compiles the information to provide an accurate answer. Wang says the system has been adopted by hundreds of universities across China.

This year, Wang is changing tack and launching studies to ask a crucial and outstanding question: do students using AI tools actually learn more? Early results — as yet unpublished — have raised some red flags. Wang and his colleagues found that students who use an AI tutor often score higher in tests immediately after a class than do those who don't use the agent. But two to three weeks later, the AI users scored lower than their peers. “Students might have a false sense of understanding,” he says.

Wang is not the only one worried about the impact of AI on students' learning — as Nataliya Kosmyna discovered when, in June, she and her colleagues released a preprint7 suggesting that students who use ChatGPT to help write an essay use less of their brains than do students who write it on their own. She has since received some 4,000 e-mails from school and university teachers worldwide who are concerned that the result reflects what is happening to students in their classrooms who are using AI. In a lot of cases, “they actually sound very desperate”, she says.

Kosmyna, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and her team used electro-encephalography (EEG) to study the patterns of electrical activity in 54 students' brains as they wrote 20-minute essays on questions such as “Do works of art have the power to change people's lives?” The students were split into three groups: one with access to an LLM; another that could use websites and search engines but not LLMs; and a third that relied only on their own knowledge. The team used EEG to measure ‘connectivity' between brain regions — the extent to which areas were communicating with each other.

Students using only their brains showed the strongest and widest pattern of connectivity and were usually able to later recall what they'd written. The LLM-using group showed the weakest connectivity — suggesting that there was less cross-brain communication — and could sometimes barely remember a word of their prose.

Kosmyna acknowledges that the study involved only a small number of students and did not look at the long-term impacts of using AI, among other limitations. (She also found it ironic that some commentators misinterpreted the study because they used AI to generate incorrect summaries of her 200-page preprint.) But the study fuelled a widespread concern that students who rely on AI in their studies are failing to develop valuable skills such as critical thinking — the ability to analyse and critique information and to reach considered conclusions. Anthropic's analysis of one million student–AI conversations in Claude showed that nearly half of them involved individuals seeking direct answers or content with little engagement on their part.

Olivia Guest, a computational cognitive scientist at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, who led the writing of the June protest letter, says she has observed related problems with students in the past couple of years. “Their skills have dramatically changed,” she says: some struggle to reference a source or write an essay.

Computational protein and peptide design is emerging as a transformative framework for engineering macromolecules with precise structures and functions, offering innovative solutions in medicine, biotechnology and materials science. However, current methods predominantly rely on generative models, which are expensive to train and modify. Here, we introduce the Key-Cutting Machine (KCM), an optimization-based platform that iteratively leverages structure prediction to match desired backbone geometries. KCM requires only a single graphics processing unit and enables seamless incorporation of user-defined requirements into the objective function, circumventing the high retraining costs typical of generative models while allowing straightforward assessment of measurable properties. By employing an estimation of distribution algorithm, KCM optimizes sequences on the basis of geometric, physicochemical and energetic criteria. We benchmarked its performance on α-helices, β-sheets, a combination of both and unstructured regions, demonstrating precise backbone geometry design. As a proof of concept, we applied KCM to antimicrobial peptide design by using a template antimicrobial peptide as the ‘key', yielding a candidate with potent in vitro activity against multiple bacterial strains and efficacy in a murine infection model. KCM thus emerges as a robust tool for de novo protein and peptide design, offering a flexible paradigm for replicating and extending the structure–function relationships of existing templates.

Protein and peptide design aims to construct synthetic proteins and peptides or modify existing ones to achieve new functionalities1,2. Successful designs include proteins that inhibit viral infections such as influenza3,4, SARS-CoV-25 and HIV6, as well as enzymes that catalyse reactions for which no natural counterparts were previously known7. Additional applications include biosensors to detect various molecules8, including fentanyl9, self-assembling protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-210, self-assembling nanomaterials11 and biological logic gates12. In the case of peptides, a simple generative model was proposed to design antimicrobial peptides against Cutibacterium acnes13. ProT-Diff14, another generative model, produced peptides; of these, 34 showed antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as in vivo activity against a clinically relevant drug-resistant Escherichia coli strain. These advances highlight the broad therapeutic and biotechnological potential of computational protein and peptide design15.

Computational protein and peptide design is often framed as a combinatorial optimization problem, where the goal is to identify an amino-acid sequence that folds into a structure with minimal free energy1. This challenge is partially mitigated by discretizing side-chain conformations (rotamers)16. Thus, the task reduces to finding the optimal combination of rotamers that minimizes free energy for a given backbone. Alternative formulations include mixed-integer linear programming17 and cost function networks18. However, the protein design problem remains extraordinarily complex19,20.

Deep learning methods have emerged as powerful tools for protein design. Notable examples include ProteinMPNN21, a message-passing neural network, ProteinSolver22, a graph-based neural network, and ESM-IF123, which integrates a geometric vector perceptron with a transformer. Given a structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, these models predict the amino-acid sequences most likely to fold into the provided structure. Later methods improved upon ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1 by enhancing sequence recovery and reducing perplexity through the incorporation of additional structural features. For example, SPDesign24 leverages structurally similar templates and builds a sequence profile to guide design. SPIN-CGNN25 computes distance-based contact maps and encodes them into a graph representation. PiFold26 extracts spatially invariant geometric features from atomic coordinates using a residue-level featurizer. These strategies support more accurate, flexible and context-aware sequence prediction.

Recently, generative models, including diffusion models, have been applied to protein design. These models, which include RFDiffusion27 and GRADE-IF28, can generate, from random noise, backbone structures that can then be paired with protein design networks (for example, ProteinMPNN) to produce corresponding sequences. Additionally, the integration of language model innovations has shown promise in diverse protein design tasks. For example, StructureGPT29 has been used to suggest sequence modifications that would improve solubility and structural stability. Similarly, TPGen30 has demonstrated the ability to generate short, diverse sequences that reliably fold into predefined secondary structures, as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The main purpose of generative models is to explore new sequences and structures associated with new functions.

However, a major limitation of existing generative models is their substantial computational cost, primarily due to the need for retraining from scratch whenever a new measurable property is introduced into the loss function. For instance, training ESM-IF1 incurs a substantial computational cost. The model was trained on over 19,000 protein structures from the CATH 4.2 database (40% non-redundant) and supplemented with 12 million AlphaFold 2-predicted structures. Each epoch required 88 h on 32 graphics processing units (GPUs), totalling approximately 653 GPU-days. This level of resource consumption highlights the impracticality of retraining such models for iterative design tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose an optimization-based model for protein and peptide design—referred to as the Key-Cutting Machine (KCM) model (Fig. 1a). KCM requires only a single GPU and enables the seamless incorporation of user-defined requirements into the objective function, thus avoiding the repeated retraining overhead typical of generative models and simplifying the assessment of measurable properties.

In this framework, the ‘key' corresponds to the target structure and its sequence, and a structure-prediction method generates multiple copies of this key. KCM then refines these sequences by comparing the original key with its predicted copies. We implement an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)31 using an island model and employ ESMFold as the structure predictor to guide the optimization process. Importantly, the KCM algorithm does not require training, which allows it to be applied directly without the need for large training datasets or computationally expensive pretraining procedures. Other approaches that use evolutionary algorithms with a structure predictor in the loop address different design goals32,33.

As a proof of concept, we chose a 12-residue peptide with antimicrobial properties34. We computationally designed derivatives of this small peptide, synthesized them chemically and tested their antimicrobial activity both in vitro and in vivo.

Our methodology consists of three stages (Fig. 1). First, we define an optimization model for the KCM approach, characterized by an objective function to be maximized. Next, we propose an EDA to solve this model. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a dataset of proteins with known sequences and secondary structures, including α-helices, β-sheets and unstructured proteins. We also tested the KCM on proteins that are a combination of α-helices and β-sheets.

The protein design problem is daunting because of the immense sequence space and the unpredictable mapping from amino-acid sequences to structures35. Even a single amino-acid mutation can markedly alter the structure of a given protein or peptide. We hypothesize that our EDA can accurately estimate the distribution of structures within sequence space36,37.

In our experiments, protein designs dominated by α-helices required fewer generations to converge than their β-sheet counterparts, in part because α-helices are typically shorter. A termination condition of 100 generations was applied to α-helical proteins (for example, PDB identifiers (IDs) 5U1Y, 3CLQ, 3SB1, 2QQ8, 3M9Q, 3H25, 3EWK, 3C8V, 2QIW, 2OAR, 2LKM and 1MSL) and proteins lacking defined secondary structure (PDB IDs 3W68, 1R5L and 1N7D). For β-sheet proteins (PDB IDs 1EMN, 1LQL, 1NP6, 1O6W, 2E45, 2KXQ, 1S7M and 1P9N), we used a termination condition of 1,000 generations or until the global distance test total score (GDT_TS)38 reached at least 0.9. When the threshold was met earlier (for example, PDB IDs 1O6W, 2E45, 2KXQ, 1S7M and 1LQL), the algorithm was halted before 1,000 generations. For proteins with PDB IDs 1EMN, 1NP6 and 1P9N, the algorithm completed the full 1,000 generations (parameters are listed in Supplementary Table 1). For proteins with a combination of α-helices and β-sheets the termination criterion was a GDT_TS of 0.9 or higher or 350 generations, whichever came first.

In each generation, the number of objective function evaluations was calculated by multiplying the population size (five individuals) by the samples generated per individual (five) and the total number of islands (20), yielding 500 evaluations. In the 21st island, the individuals are no longer stochastic generators but amino-acid sequences, so we have 25 sequences in this island, requiring 25 evaluations, resulting in 525 objective function calls per generation.

For proteins primarily composed of α-helices, GDT_TS distributions trended toward higher values, approaching 1, whereas standard root mean square deviation (RMSD_S) distributions approached 0 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). This pattern indicates high structural similarity and stability among the designs, with minimal variance. However, in proteins 5U1Y, 3CLQ and 2QQ8 (Fig. 1d, I, J and L), GDT_TS and RMSD_S distributions were more dispersed. This variance may stem from disordered regions at one terminus, which lack well-defined secondary structure and thus need more generations for convergence.

Proteins dominated by α-helices showed narrow GDT_TS s.d. values (0.00–0.07) yet larger RMSD_S variation (0.04–0.42) (Supplementary Table 2). Although higher RMSD_S variability helps prevent premature convergence, β-sheet proteins typically required longer runs and showed more structural diversity, evident in broader RMSD_S and GDT_TS distributions. Because β-sheet proteins had an average length of 32 residues—nearly double that of α-helical proteins (18 residues)—their search space was inherently more complex. Unstructured proteins posed even greater challenges for the algorithm.

We calculated the correlation between GDT_TS and RMSD_S for the top designs (Fig. 1c). Data points are colour-coded by secondary structure type: yellow (β-sheet), red (α-helix) or blue (unstructured). Red points cluster toward higher GDT_TS and lower RMSD_S values, whereas blue points show lower accuracy. Protein 2QQ8 (L), which contains an unstructured region, stands out with lower GDT_TS and RMSD_S scores compared with other α-helical proteins.

Superimposing the highest-fitness designs onto their reference structures (Fig. 1d) reveals notable structural similarity, particularly in α-helical and β-sheet regions. Proteins with unstructured segments showed lower similarity, although extended runs did improve alignment. Notably, the highest sequence identity between the best designs and the reference sequences was merely 24%, with an average of 11% (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that the algorithm can converge on structurally similar solutions despite low sequence identity.

On this same dataset of 23 proteins, using a Bayesian ranking39, we compared KCM with three well-known generative models: ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF1 and ProteinSolver. For a given target backbone, ProteinMPNN generated 256 sequences in four runs, while ESM-IF1 and ProteinSolver each produced 250 sequences. For each target, we selected the sequence with the highest GDT_TS and the sequence with the lowest RMSD for comparison. For KCM, we likewise chose the best sequences according to each criterion. For a fair comparison, all solutions from each algorithm were sorted on the basis of the fitness function used in our algorithm. When examining only 50 solutions (Supplementary Fig. 1a–f and Supplementary Table 3), KCM surpassed the other approaches in RMSD but lagged behind ESM-IF1 and ProteinMPNN in GDT_TS. When 250 solutions were considered (Supplementary Fig. 1g–l and Supplementary Table 4), KCM again outperformed all other methods in RMSD but fell short of ESM-IF1 in GDT_TS. Note that these proteins might have been used in the generative models' training process. In this case, of the 23 proteins tested, only two (PDB IDs 1P9N and 5U1Y) were not included in CATH 4.2, from which the training sets of ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1 were taken.

To analyse the performance of KCM when proteins with a combination of α-helix and β-sheet are included, eight new designs were undertaken (Supplementary Table 5); the results are reported in Supplementary Table 6. Here six out of eight designs achieved a GDT_TS larger than 0.9; this is better than the case for β-sheet-only designs, where only four out of eight achieved a GDT_TS larger than 0.9, even when more computation effort was allowed. The superpositions of the targets and their corresponding designs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

To estimate the cost of designing longer sequences, we evaluated the structure prediction time of ESMFold on randomly generated sequences ranging from 10 to 400 residues. Predictions for sequences up to 100 residues required less than 2 s each, while sequences of 400 residues required approximately 10 times more computation time (Supplementary Fig. 3). The algorithm was also applied to design two proteins of 100 residues each, PDB IDs 2F77 and 2HLQ. After 2,000 generations the GDT_TS reached 0.38 for both targets, showing a limitation in designing proteins of this size without parameter tuning.

As a proof of concept, we selected IDR-2009, a 12-residue peptide (sequence KWRLLIRWRIQK) known for its potent antimicrobial activity34. This peptide was chosen for practical reasons: its antimicrobial activity can be readily validated in vitro and short sequences are amenable to synthesis. Additionally, KCM performed well on α-helices (Supplementary Table 2). We tested multiple objective function configurations to evaluate whether KCM could generate variants with favourable solubility and synthetic feasibility.

We did not assume that the peptide's function directly depends on its geometry. Instead, we investigated whether mirroring its predicted backbone and its amino-acid properties and minimizing its energy would yield sequences with comparable structure and properties.

To design a set of peptides using the IDR-2009 backbone as a template, we proceeded as follows. (1) We obtained the three-dimensional structure of the peptide using the Google Colab version of AlphaFold 240,41, on the basis of its sequence. Within AlphaFold 2, we used the default parameters but increased to 48 recycles and three relaxation iterations. Even though this implementation of AlphaFold 2 does not use structural templates and uses a limited-size database to construct the multiple sequence alignment, the resulting average predicted local distance difference test was higher than 0.8, which is considered a confident predicted local distance difference test score42,43. This resulting backbone structure served as the input for our KCM. (2) We conducted the design under four different schemes, primarily varying the protein similarity function. The four schemes were the following.

All terms in equation (1) were applied.

where KL is the mean Kullback–Leibler divergence (Supplementary equation (14), see details in Supplementary Section 1.7) of the descriptors computed from the sequence. RMSD_S, GDT_TS and RMSD_DM are also defined in Supplementary Information, in Sections 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. The energy of the designed sequence (Ed) term is calculated by applying the Rosetta energy function to the structure predicted by ESMFold for each designed sequence.

We excluded the KL divergence terms from the objective function:

We excluded the geometric similarity criteria from the objective function and weighted the energy terms negligibly:

where RMSD_S = RMSD_DM = 106 and GDT_TS = 0.

Notice that the difference between equations (3) and (1) is that in equation (3) the geometric term is neglected and therefore so is the energy term, the descriptor difference remaining as the main component in the objective function, while in equation (1) all terms are taken into account.

We omitted the energy term from the objective function:

For each scheme, we generated a set of sequences and ranked them in descending order according to their fitness (Supplementary Table 7 lists the evolutionary algorithm parameters). We then analysed these ranked sequences with AMPDiscover44 to predict their potential antimicrobial activity. We further examined the top 10 sequences from each scheme (Supplementary Tables 8–10).

We synthesized 12 sequences selected for their ease of synthesis and low aggregation potential: five from AT, four from NE and three from NG. We excluded the ND group because its peptides were challenging to synthesize and solubilize. We determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against 11 clinically relevant strains, including the ESKAPEE pathogens. Nine of the 12 peptides (75%) exhibited MIC values of ≤64 μmol l−1 against at least one strain (Fig. 2a,b), surpassing hit rates from many existing machine learning/deep learning methods. The three inactive peptides (AT1, AT2, AT3) belonged to the AT group, had low net charge (<2) and displayed lower normalized hydrophobicity. This indicates that incorporating all criteria into the objective function might increase the complexity of the search landscape and hinder the discovery of highly active sequences. Further investigation is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Briefly, 106 bacterial cells and serially diluted peptides (1-64 μmol l−1) were incubated at 37 °C. One day after treatment, the optical density at 600 nm was measured in a microplate reader to evaluate bacterial growth in the presence of the peptides. MIC values in the heatmap are the mode of the replicates in each condition. c–f, Ternary plots showing the percentage of secondary structure for each peptide (at 50 μmol l−1) in four different solvents: water (c), 60% TFE in water (d), 10 mmol l−1 SDS in water (e) and 50% methanol (MeOH) in water (f). Secondary structure fractions were calculated using the BeStSel server65.

Source data

Because the peptides were designed using different criteria, we sought to assess their secondary-structure tendencies. To evaluate secondary structure, we subjected the peptides to four different media: water (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4a, e), a helix-inducing medium (trifluoroethanol (TFE) in water, 3:2, v:v; Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4b, e), a membrane-mimicking environment (SDS at 10 mmol l−1; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 4c, e) and a β-inducer medium (methanol in water, 1:1, v:v; Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 4d, e).

When geometric similarity criteria were omitted and energy terms were minimally weighted (NG group), the designed peptides displayed greater structural plasticity. They were initially unstructured forms in water and the methanol/water mixture. However, they adopted highly helical conformations in the TFE/water mixture and predominantly β-like conformations in the membrane-mimicking medium. Peptides from the AT and NE groups remained unstructured in water yet adopted mostly β-like conformations in SDS and the methanol/water mixture. Notably, in the presence of SDS micelles, NE1 showed an equal proportion of β-like and helical structures.

Among the peptides, AT2, AT5 and NE4 formed the most helical conformations in the TFE/water mixture, despite being among the least amphiphilic peptides. Conversely, AT3 and NE3, which were among the more amphiphilic peptides, predominantly retained a β-like structure even in the helix-inducing medium. No clear trend emerged linking secondary structure directly to antimicrobial activity.

We next explored the membrane-related mechanism of action of a subset of peptides (AT4, NE1, NE2, NG1, NG3) against Acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (Fig. 3a). Using N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) uptake assays (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5a) and membrane depolarization assays with 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3-5) (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 5b, c), we found that all peptides disrupted the bacterial membrane potential to varying degrees. NE1 and NG3 were particularly effective at depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane of A. baumannii. Although none outperformed polymyxin B in outer-membrane permeabilization, several peptides matched levofloxacin's effects, underscoring their potential as membrane-targeting agents.

a, To assess whether the peptides act on bacterial membranes, all active peptides against A. baumannii American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 19606 were subjected to outer-membrane permeabilization, and peptides active against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis ATCC 700802 were tested in cytoplasmic-membrane depolarization assays. b, The fluorescent probe NPN was used to assess membrane permeabilization induced by the tested peptides. c,d, The fluorescent probe DiSC3-5 was used to evaluate membrane depolarization caused by the designed peptides in A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (c) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis ATCC 700802 (d). The values displayed represent the relative fluorescence of both probes, with nonlinear fitting compared with the baseline of the untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescent dye) and benchmarked against the antibiotics polymyxin B and levofloxacin. e, Cytotoxic concentrations leading to 50% cell lysis (CC50) were determined by interpolating the dose–response data using a nonlinear regression curve. All experiments were performed in three independent replicates. Panel a created with BioRender.com.

Source data

Cytotoxicity was evaluated using human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells (Fig. 3e)45. None of the 12 peptides caused substantial cytotoxicity at the tested concentrations (4–64 μmol l−1), contrasting with the parental IDR-2009 peptide, which did show cytotoxicity34. The lowest cytotoxic concentration leading to 50% cell lysis among inactive peptides (AT3) was 269 μmol l−1, indicating a favourable therapeutic window.

We tested NE2 and NG1 in two murine models: skin abscess46,47,48,49 (Fig. 4) and a deep thigh infection50,51,52 (Supplementary Fig. 6c–e). In both models, the peptides reduced A. baumannii bacterial loads by up to two orders of magnitude, comparable to the last-resort antibiotic polymyxin B and to our other antibiotic control levofloxacin. No weight loss or skin damage was observed, indicating good tolerability. These results confirm that KCM-designed peptides can achieve clinically relevant anti-infective efficacy.

In contrast to purely generative frameworks, which use trained models to rapidly generate large numbers of candidate sequences, KCM iteratively refines candidate sequences through structure prediction and optimization. The results observed with mixed secondary structures such as α-helices and β-sheets support the idea that the α-helices are easier to design than β-sheets; when we have only β-sheets we have a lower success percentage (50%, Supplementary Table 2) than when we design α-helices and β-sheets (success percentage of 75%, Supplementary Table 5). When we have only α-helices, KCM achieves 91.6% success (Supplementary Table 2). Here, designs that achieved GDT_TS of 90% or more are considered successful. Overall, our results demonstrate that KCM can converge on sequences whose backbone geometries strongly resemble those of target proteins, spanning α-helices, β-sheets, combinations of α-helices and β-sheets, and unstructured regions, even when sequence identity is low. This suggests that KCM effectively explores the structural landscape by continuously updating the distribution of candidate sequences on the basis of both geometric and physicochemical criteria. However, without a proper parameter tuning, KCM was limited when designing proteins composed of 100 amino-acid residues or larger.

A key advantage of KCM is its ability to seamlessly integrate a wide range of objective functions beyond backbone geometry. In particular, it can incorporate Kullback–Leibler divergence or Jeffrey's distance for amino-acid descriptors, as well as energy terms and other chemically relevant properties. This flexibility allows researchers to add or remove objectives—such as solubility, stability or functional motifs—within a single GPU environment, eliminating the need to retrain a deep learning model when new properties are introduced into the loss function. In contrast to generative models that require substantial computational resources for retraining, KCM offers an adaptable, resource-efficient solution for computational protein design.

Another key advantage of the proposed KCM framework lies in its interpretability and accessibility. Unlike deep learning-based generative models, KCM does not require a training phase; instead, it uses an explicitly defined objective function to guide the design process, enabling users to control and tailor design preferences directly. In addition, KCM employs an island-based evolutionary paradigm that is inherently parallelizable. While the current implementation operates on a single GPU, each island can, in principle, be executed independently across multiple processors or GPUs. This conceptual scalability allows KCM to benefit from parallel environments when available, while remaining efficient and accessible on modest hardware.

Beyond benchmarking KCM on proteins of diverse secondary structure, we applied it to the design of antimicrobial peptides. Despite not explicitly encoding direct activity constraints into our fitness function, the KCM-derived peptides retained antimicrobial activity that was comparable to or exceeded many machine learning/deep learning-based designs reported in the literature13,14. Several designs also exhibited lower cytotoxicity than the parental antimicrobial peptide (IDR-2009), demonstrating that KCM can discover sequences with improved therapeutic windows.

Structural analyses revealed that relaxing energy and geometric similarity constraints leads to higher structural plasticity, with designed sequences frequently transitioning between helical and β-like conformations depending on environmental factors. Notably, this plasticity did not necessarily reduce antimicrobial activity, suggesting that multiple structural pathways can yield effective membrane-disrupting peptides. These outcomes highlight the need to balance structural and energetic constraints with functional sequence-space exploration.

In summary, KCM provides an alternative paradigm for peptide and protein design, combining the adaptability of an iterative, optimization-based framework with the power of modern structure-prediction tools. Its demonstrated success in designing peptides with potent antimicrobial activity and reduced toxicity highlights the method's potential in therapeutic development. Future work may explore more sophisticated descriptors—such as immunogenicity, proteolytic stability and post-translational modifications—as well as advanced multi-objective strategies and protein–water interactions, especially in the case of intrinsically disordered proteins, to enhance both throughput and exploration of sequence space. Ultimately, the KCM model represents a promising step toward more versatile and customizable computational design methodologies for proteins and peptides.

Despite these advantages, several challenges remain with the KCM model. Its reliance on iterative structure prediction makes it more computationally intensive than standard pretrained generative approaches, such as ProteinMPNN or ESM-IF1, which can complete designs in seconds. For example, designing an α-helical sequence in our benchmark set requires about 12 h on a single GPU (RTX 3090 Ti) coupled with an Intel i5 CPU with 32 GB of random-access memory. This task is particularly challenging for short, dynamic peptides, which may adopt multiple conformations in solution. Integrating ensemble-based structure prediction or incorporating biophysical data (for example, nuclear magnetic resonance) could improve accuracy for more flexible targets. KCM is currently limited for larger proteins (100 amino-acid residues or larger), because population size and number of generations will need to increase considerably. This limits KCM's current design capability to structured peptides.

Nonetheless, a key benefit of the KCM framework is that it does not require retraining. For instance, incorporating new design constraints or targeting a different functionality in a traditional generative model typically necessitates costly model retraining. In contrast, KCM enables these changes to be implemented directly by modifying the objective function, eliminating the need for reoptimization of the generative backbone. This affords greater flexibility in exploring diverse design criteria. While repeated structure predictions introduce computational overhead, this cost may be mitigated in future iterations through parallelization strategies or the integration of faster structure predictors.

Additionally, a single key (design target) was used to generate copies (peptide variants) for experimental testing. Further validation is needed to fully establish the generalizability of the proposed method for functional design.

The objective function that we propose in this work for the key-cutting machine approach consists of a combination of different similarity measures between the structure, energy and chemical/evolutionary descriptors of a designed protein and those of the target protein. To measure structural similarity, we used the RMSD_S53,54, the GDT_TS38, the template modelling score (TM_S)55 and the RMSD_DM. The Rosetta energy function REF1556 is used to measure the energy of a protein structure. Finally, the chemical descriptors computed consisted of a subset of the iLearn protein descriptors (Supplementary Table 11)11 and the decoded vector representation from the ESM-2 language model57. Given the descriptor vectors for a model's sequence and the reference's sequence, the similarity between them can be computed by using Jeffrey's distance58 (described in detail in Supplementary Section 1).

Notice that all these criteria measure the similarity or difference between a particular aspect of a designed protein and the reference protein. For example, RMSD_S, TM_S, GDT_TS and RMSD_DM all measure structural similarity. In this case, the structure of a designed sequence is predicted using ESMFold, and the resulting structure is then superimposed with the reference structure. On the other hand, Jeffrey's distance between ESM-2 and iLearn descriptor vectors measures how similar the two proteins are in terms of both iLearn and ESM-2 descriptors.

The objective function to be maximized by our protein design algorithm is given as

where

and Ed and Er are, respectively, the energy values of the model and reference structures, both calculated using the Rosetta energy function. Also, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 10, the symbol \({D}_{\mathrm{J}}^{i}\) denotes Jeffrey's distance, computed from the ith descriptor vector of both the model and the reference sequences. Note that the number of such vectors for each protein is ten, where nine are computed with iLearn and one with ESM-2. Finally, ω ∈ R is a parameter for contracting or dilating the exponential function.

The objective function is unaffected by rotations and translations of the structure, since both the model and reference structures are superimposed before calculating all criteria. Also, each of the terms f1, f2 and f3 contributes with a different magnitude to the total value of f. Since the maximum value given by the said function is 7, f1 represents four-sevenths of the total value, while f2 and f3 represent one-seventh and two-sevenths of the total, respectively. The weights for f1, f2 and f3 were empirically determined; identifying the optimal weighting for each component of the objective function remains an important direction for future work. Function f will also have values close to zero when the model and reference proteins are different in all the criteria considered.

An important advantage of KCM is its ability to seamlessly incorporate user-defined constraints. For example, if a user wishes to enforce the presence of hydrophobic amino-acid residues at specific positions (for example, positions i and j), the sequence generators (Supplementary Section 2) can be configured to assign zero probability to amino-acid residues that do not meet this criterion at those positions. Additionally, if the user aims to favour properties such as solubility or reduced aggregation, machine learning-based predictors can be integrated to define additional terms in the objective function, as demonstrated in a related approach59.

The algorithm follows the island paradigm60, and in total there are 21 islands. The islands evolve synchronously and within each island we have a general procedure (Fig. 1). The first component is a stochastic sequence generator (structure of the individuals in the population), which depends on the mathematical model designed to learn how highly fit sequences are distributed within the feasible solution space. That is, each individual in the population encodes a probability distribution over amino acids at each position in the sequence, on the basis of one of six stochastic generator models. Sequences are sampled from these distributions and evaluated using the objective function, with top performers retained for the next generation. Details of the six generator models are provided in Supplementary Table 12. The second component is a three-dimensional structure predictor; in this case, ESMFold was used. It was chosen over the more accurate and confident AlphaFold 2 due to its notably faster prediction. The third component is the objective function, which is responsible for determining the similarity between the designs and the reference protein (the key). Finally, the fourth module is a repository where the top t sequences generated within the islands are stored according to their fitness.

The island model is equipped with a communication strategy. At the end of each generation, with probability P, two islands can collaborate, and the information shared is through the sequences. Each island stores the top t sequences with the highest fitness obtained throughout all generations of the algorithm. With probability proportional to their fitness, m1 sequences are selected from the t stored in the first island. All selected sequences that surpass the fitness of the weakest sequences in the second island will replace them. The same procedure is performed in reverse order.

Each island from 1 to 20 is equipped with a mechanism that operates as an EDA-type evolutionary algorithm (Fig. 1). Additionally, the islands are disaggregated according to the structure of the individuals in the population, which will henceforth be referred to as the stochastic sequence generator. Each island from 1 to 20 will have pop individuals (stochastic generators) with the same structure. In turn, these generators depend on how the parameters that define them are updated. Furthermore, an additional island is introduced, where a traditional genetic algorithm is implemented (island 21). All islands evolve synchronously, but structure prediction presents a computational bottleneck. Although each island independently generates candidate sequences, all sequences rely on the same instance of ESMFold for structure prediction, which is executed sequentially on a single GPU.

The individuals on the islands are constructed from six stochastic models (Supplementary Table 12). In model 1, for each position in the sequence, the probability of occurrence of each amino acid is determined. The individuals on islands 1, 2, 3 and 4 are constructed on the basis of this model. Models 2–4 include knowledge of amino acids—for example, how they are grouped on the basis of properties such as polarity, propensity to form part of a specific secondary structure or evolutionary similarity. In this way, three hierarchical models are constructed, where for each position in the sequence the probability of belonging to one of the groups is determined first, and then, given the current group, the probability of belonging to the next group is determined, and so on until the amino-acid level is reached. The individuals on islands 5–16 are constructed on the basis of these models. Model 5 is a Bayesian network where the nodes represent the positions in the sequence. In this network, an arc is drawn from each position to the next, reflecting the dependence between successive positions in the sequence. The individuals on islands 17 and 18 are constructed on the basis of model 5. Finally, model 6 represents a Markov chain between each pair of consecutive positions in the amino-acid sequence. In this model, the states correspond to the 20 amino acids and the individuals on islands 19 and 20 are constructed on the basis of this model.

Additionally, the update of the individuals' parameters is carried out under four different schemes. In the first scheme (A, Supplementary Table 12), the parameters (probabilities) are calculated on the basis of the absolute frequencies of appearance obtained throughout the algorithm (islands 4, 8, 12, 16, 17 and 20). In the second scheme (B, Supplementary Table 12), the parameters (probabilities) are calculated from the absolute frequencies of appearance but resetting these every ngr generations (islands 3, 7, 11, 15, 18 and 19). In the third scheme (C, Supplementary Table 12), the parameters are calculated on the basis of the probability proportional to the size of the accumulated value of the function dr∗ throughout the algorithm (islands 2, 6, 10 and 14). In the fourth scheme (D, Supplementary Table 12), the parameters are calculated from the probability proportional to the size of the accumulated value of the function dr∗ but resetting this every ngr generations (islands 1, 5, 9 and 13), where \({d}_{\mathrm{r* }}=\max (1-\frac{d}{10},0)\) and d is the distance between the Cα atoms located at position r* in the reference protein and the designed protein after superposition.

To update the parameters of the stochastic generator in generation i, two sets of sequences are selected. The first set contains m* sequences, while the second set contains t* sequences. The first set is formed from the m* sequences with the highest fitness among the m sequences generated during generation i (m* ≤ m). To construct the second set, t* sequences are selected from the repository that contains the t sequences with the highest fitness generated in each island (t* ≤ t). The selection of the t* sequences is performed with probabilities proportional to their fitness sizes (the details for the update rules of the stochastic generators are given in Supplementary Table 13 and Supplementary Section 2).

The implemented island model, where each island employs a distinct stochastic generator within an EDA framework, seeks to maximize both exploration and exploitation of the vast protein sequence space. The six stochastic models capture complementary biological and statistical properties, from simple position-wise amino-acid probabilities to hierarchical and context-aware models such as Bayesian networks and Markov chains. Combined with four diverse parameter update strategies, this design introduces a range of learning dynamics across islands. Such diversity improves the algorithm's ability to escape local optima, enhances robustness across protein classes and enables the transfer of information through migration. A traditional genetic algorithm implemented on island 21 further complements this set-up, supporting recombination-driven exploration. This heterogeneous, multi-island architecture provides a flexible and scalable foundation for general protein sequence design.

To test the quality of the solutions produced by the KCM, we selected a small subset of proteins from the CATH Protein Structure Classification database v.4.3.0, which is a free and publicly available online resource that provides information on the evolutionary relationships of protein domains61 and classifies them according to the secondary structures that compose them. This database is available at http://download.cathdb.info/cath/releases/all-releases/v4_3_0/cath-classification-data/cath-domain-description-file-v4_3_0.txt.

In particular, we selected protein segments containing mainly α-helices and β-sheets. We also selected some proteins (Supplementary Table 14) that did not have well-defined secondary structures. In total, 23 proteins were selected, each between 15 and 33 residues long. We selected these proteins because they represent the three most frequent secondary structure types found in experimentally determined protein structures: α-helices, β-sheets and disordered regions. Additionally, we included test proteins that contain a combination of both α-helices and β-sheets.

The KCM algorithm can be installed locally as a standalone Python program using the Anaconda package manager. Detailed installation instructions are available in the repository's README file62. For improved performance, we recommend installing a local copy of the ESMFold model. To do this, first install ESMFold using the environment.yml file provided in its official GitHub repository63, which creates the esmfold environment. Once this is done, activate this environment using the conda activate esmfold command and follow the instructions described in listing 1.

Before running the KCM program, ensure that the esmfold environment is activated.

All peptides for the experiments were obtained from Pepmic and synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis with the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl protecting group strategy. Peptides were purified using reverse-phase liquid chromatography (purity >95%).

In this study, we used the following pathogenic bacterial strains: A. baumannii ATCC 19606, E. coli AIC221 (E. coli MG1655 phnE_2::FRT (control strain for AIC222)) and E. coli AIC222 (E. coli MG1655 pmrA53 phnE_2::FRT (polymyxin resistant; colistin-resistant strain)), Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa PA14 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600. All pathogens were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth and on LB agar. Pseudomonas isolation (P. aeruginosa strains) agar plates were exclusively used in the case of Pseudomonas species. In all the experiments, bacteria were inoculated from one isolated colony and grown overnight (16 h) in liquid medium at 37 °C. On the following day, inocula were diluted 1:100 in fresh media and incubated at 37 °C to mid-logarithmic phase.

Broth microdilution assays64 were conducted to establish the MIC for each peptide. Peptides were added to untreated polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates and serially diluted twofold in sterile water, ranging from 1 to 64 μmol l−1. A bacterial inoculum at a concentration of 106 CFU ml−1 in LB medium was then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the peptide solution. The MIC was determined as the lowest peptide concentration that completely inhibited bacterial growth after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Each assay was performed in three independent replicates.

The circular dichroism experiments were conducted using a J1500 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (JASCO) in the Biological Chemistry Resource Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Experiments were performed at 25 °C; the spectra graphed are an average of three accumulations obtained with a quartz cuvette with an optical path length of 1.0 mm, ranging from 260 to 190 nm at a rate of 50 nm min−1 and a bandwidth of 0.5 nm. The concentration of all peptides tested was 50 μmol l−1, and the measurements were performed in water, in a mixture of TFE and water with a 3:2 ratio, in a mixture of methanol and water with a 1:1 ratio and in SDS in water at 10 mmol l−1, with respective baselines recorded before measurement. A Fourier transform filter was applied to minimize background effects. Secondary-structure fraction values were calculated using the single-spectrum analysis tool on the server BeStSel65. Ternary plots were created in https://www.ternaryplot.com/ and subsequently edited.

NPN uptake assay was used to evaluate the ability of the peptides to permeabilize the bacterial outer membrane. Inocula of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4 ml−1, centrifuged (9,391 g at 4 °C for 10 min), washed and resuspended in 5 mmol l−1 HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmol l−1 glucose. The bacterial solution was added to a white 96-well plate (100 μl per well) together with 4 μl of NPN at 0.5 mmol l−1. Subsequently, peptides diluted in water were added to each well, and the fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelength (λex) = 350 nm and emission wavelength (λem) = 420 nm over time for 45 min. The relative fluorescence was calculated using the untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescent dye) as baseline and the following equation was applied to reflect the percentage difference between the baselines and the sample:

The cytoplasmic-membrane depolarization assay was performed using the membrane-potential-sensitive dye DiSC3-5. A. baumannii ATCC 19606 in the mid-logarithmic phase were washed and resuspended at 0.05 optical density ml−1 (optical value at 600 nm) in HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 20 mmol l−1 glucose and 0.1 mol l−1 KCl. DiSC3-5 at 20 μmol l−1 was added to the bacterial suspension (100 μl per well) for 15 min to stabilize the fluorescence, which indicates the incorporation of the dye into the bacterial membrane, and then the peptides were mixed 1:1 with the bacteria to a final concentration corresponding to their MIC values. Membrane depolarization was then followed by reading changes in the fluorescence (λex = 622 nm, λem = 670 nm) over time for 60 min. The relative fluorescence was calculated using the untreated control (buffer + bacteria + fluorescent dye) as baseline and the following equation was applied to reflect the percentage difference between the baselines and the sample:

HEK293T cells were obtained from the ATCC (CRL-3216). The cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin (antibiotics) and 10% fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

One day before the experiment, an aliquot of 100 μl of the cells at 50,000 cells ml−1 was seeded into each well of the cell-treated 96-well plates used in the experiment (that is, 5,000 cells per well)45. The attached HEK293T cells were then exposed to increasing concentrations of the peptides (4–64 μmol l−1) for 24 h. After the incubation period, we performed the (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tetrazolium reduction assay (MTT assay)45. The MTT reagent was dissolved at 0.5 mg ml−1 in medium without phenol red and was used to replace cell culture supernatants containing the peptides (100 μl per well), and the samples were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, yielding the insoluble formazan salt. The resulting salts were then resuspended in hydrochloric acid (0.04 mol l−1) in anhydrous isopropanol and quantified by spectrophotometric measurements of absorbance at 570 nm. All assays were carried out as three biological replicates.

The backs of six-week-old female CD-1 mice under anaesthesia were shaved and injured with a superficial linear skin abrasion made with a needle. An aliquot of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (2 × 106 CFU ml−1; 20 μl) previously grown in LB medium until 0.5 optical density ml−1 (optical value at 600 nm) and then washed twice with sterile PBS (pH 7.4, 9,391 g for 3 min) was added to the scratched area. Peptides diluted in sterile water at MIC value were administered to the wound area 1 h after the infection. Two and four days after infection animals were euthanized, and the scarified skin was excised, homogenized using a bead beater (25 Hz for 20 min), tenfold serially diluted, and plated on McConkey agar plates for CFU quantification. The experiments were performed using six mice per group. Mice were housed in groups of three and maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22 °C with humidity controlled at 50%. The skin abscess infection mouse model was revised and approved by University Laboratory Animal Resources from the University of Pennsylvania (protocol 806763).

Six-week-old female CD-1 mice were rendered neutropenic by two doses of cyclophosphamide (150 mg kg−1 and 100 mg kg−1) applied intraperitoneally 3 and 1 d before the infection. On day 4 of the experiment, the mice were infected in their right thighs with a 100-μl intramuscular injection of the A. baumannii ATCC 19606 in PBS at concentration of 5 × 106 CFU ml−1. The bacterial cells were grown in LB broth, washed twice with PBS solution and diluted at the desired concentration. The peptides were administrated intraperitoneally 2 h after the infection. Two days after infection mice were euthanized, and the tissue from the right thigh was excised, homogenized using a bead beater (25 Hz for 20 min), tenfold serially diluted, and plated on McConkey agar plates for bacterial colony counting. The experiments were performed using six mice per group. Mice were housed in groups of three and maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22 °C with humidity controlled at 50%. The deep thigh infection mouse model was revised and approved by University Laboratory Animal Resources from the University of Pennsylvania (protocol 807055).

Templated polymerization within confined spaces offers a powerful route to tailor polymer structures and properties, yet structural details of confined polymers at the atomic level remain obscure owing to challenges in obtaining high-quality single crystals. Here we report the single-crystal X-ray structures of helical polythiophene and polypyrrole, produced by in situ radical polymerization of achiral monomers in a chiral metal–organic framework (MOF) featuring redox-active tri-iron(III) clusters. Crystallographic analysis reveals that both polymers adopt single-handed helical conformations, stabilized by supramolecular interactions with pore surfaces. Unexpectedly, the helical chains grow through narrow catalytic channels rather than in wide pores, as previously assumed. The confined helicity substantially amplifies the chirality-induced spin selectivity of the MOF, yielding spin polarization of up to 94% and demonstrating the key role of helicity in spin selectivity. Our work lays the foundation for the rational design of single-crystalline porous hybrids with tunable electronic, optical and quantum properties that surpass conventional crystals.

Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) drives oncogene amplification and intratumoural heterogeneity in aggressive cancers. While transposable element reactivation is common in cancer, its role on ecDNA remains unexplored. Here we map the 3D architecture of MYC-amplified ecDNA in colorectal cancer cells and identify 68 ecDNA-interacting elements—genomic loci enriched for transposable elements that are frequently integrated onto ecDNA. We focus on an L1M4a1#LINE/L1 fragment co-amplified with MYC, which functions only in the ecDNA-amplified context. Using CRISPR-CATCH, CRISPR interference and reporter assays, we confirm its presence on ecDNA, enhancer activity and essentiality for cancer cell fitness. These findings reveal that repetitive elements can be reactivated and co-opted as functional rather than inactive sequences on ecDNA, potentially driving oncogene expression and tumour evolution. Our study uncovers a mechanism by which ecDNA harnesses repetitive elements to shape cancer phenotypes, with implications for diagnosis and therapy.

Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent form of oncogene amplification present in approximately 15% of cancers at diagnosis1,2,3,4,5. ecDNAs are megabase-scale, circular DNA elements lacking centromeric and telomeric sequences and found as distinct foci apart from chromosomal DNA6. Recent work has underscored the importance of ecDNA in tumour initiation and various aspects of tumour progression, such as accelerating intratumoural heterogeneity, genomic dysregulation and therapeutic resistance7,8,9,10,11. The biogenesis of ecDNA is complex and tied to mechanisms that induce genomic instability, such as chromothripsis and breakage–fusion–bridge cycles, which are prevalent in tumour cells6,12,13,14,15,16,17.

A key aspect of ecDNA function is their ability to hijack cis-regulatory elements that increase oncogene expression beyond the constraints imposed by endogenous chromosomal architecture18,19,20,21,22,23. Consequently, their nuclear organization is tightly tied to their ability to amplify gene expression18,20. Likewise, repetitive genomic elements provide a vast network of cryptic promoters or enhancers capable of rewiring gene regulatory networks for proto-oncogene expression—including long-range gene regulation24,25,26. By investigating the three-dimensional (3D) organization of ecDNA, we identified an enrichment of repetitive elements associated with ecDNA structural variation, which we classify as ecDNA-interacting elements (EIEs). We found that insertion of a particular EIE containing a fragment of an ancient L1M4a1 LINE within ecDNA leads to expression of said element that is critical for cancer cell fitness. Our data reveal a relationship between the presence of specific repetitive elements and aberrant expression of oncogenes on ecDNA.

To interrogate the conformational state of ecDNA, we performed Hi-C on COLO320DM colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 1a). Previous investigation of COLO320DM utilizing DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and whole-genome sequencing identified a highly rearranged (up to 4.3 MB) ecDNA amplification containing several genes, including the oncogene MYC and the long non-coding RNA PVT118,20. As a large fraction of the ecDNA in COLO320DM is derived from chromosome 8, with smaller contributions from chromosomes 6, 16 and 13, we elected to focus on the chromosome-8-amplified locus containing MYC and PVT120.

Sixty-eight individual EIEs were manually annotated across all chromosomes based on the interaction across the entirety of the MYC-amplified region of chromosome 8. The visualization represents the ecDNA from chromosome 8, with three examples of EIEs localized on other chromosomes. c, An example of a specific interaction, EIE 14 on chromosome 3, is enlarged, and associated genes are shown for both loci.

Source data

Analysis of the Hi-C maps identified 68 interactions between the chromosome-8-amplified ecDNA locus and other chromosomes that displayed a striking pattern (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). By binning the data at 1 kb resolution, we found that linear elements in the genome contacted the entirety of the megabase-scale ecDNA amplification in a distinctive stripe (Fig. 1b,c). These contacts were spread across all chromosomes in the genome (Supplementary Table 1). This atypical interaction pattern suggested a complex structural relationship between the chromosome-8-amplified ecDNA and the endogenous chromosome regions (Fig. 1b,c). Further inspection revealed these genomic interactions were enriched for transposable elements (TEs) annotated as LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements) and LTRs (long terminal repeats (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). As these retrotransposons can acquire the ability to regulate transcription when active, we reasoned that the spatial relationship with oncogenes such as MYC may be important for enhanced expression in COLO320DM cells27,28. We hereafter refer to these 1-kb interactions, often containing retrotransposons, as EIEs.

While Hi-C is widely used to map genome-wide chromatin interactions, it can also be repurposed to identify structural variants, including rearrangements that are hallmarks of cancer genomes29,30. We considered that the atypical striping pattern observed in our Hi-C data was probably the result of structural variation either within the COLO320 genome or due to the insertion of repetitive elements into ecDNA. To discern between these two possibilities, we performed long-read nanopore sequencing (Methods). We chose long-read sequencing to also capture potential heterogeneity in insertion sites in the case of single or multiple integrations (Fig. 1e,f; Methods). We generated median read lengths of 67,000 bp, with the longest read spanning 684,457 bases. Across the 68 EIEs identified, we determined that each participated in a broad spectrum of structural variation—some involved with hundreds or thousands of different rearrangement events (Extended Data Fig. 1b; Methods).

After confirming that the identified EIEs were associated with structural rearrangements, we next investigated the overlap between ecDNA and EIE rearrangements. We first reconstructed ecDNA utilizing the CoRAL algorithm31, a pipeline that leverages long-read data to accurately infer a set of ecDNAs from the breakpoints (that is, structural variation) associated with amplified regions of the genome (Methods). We found that reads containing EIEs often overlapped ecDNA intervals with greater coverage than expected based on the average genome coverage of our dataset (approximately 12.1), suggesting that these EIEs are present in at least a subset of ecDNA amplifications (Fig. 1e,f). We further investigated CoRAL's reconstruction of COLO320DM's complex and heterogeneous MYC-containing amplicon and identified a high-confidence breakpoint connecting a chromosome-3-amplified EIE (EIE 14) to an intergenic region between CASC8 and MYC on the chromosome 8 amplification (Fig. 1g; Methods).

We selected this EIE (EIE 14) for further characterization of EIE biology owing to its proximity to MYC on the ecDNA and because it contains a segment with homology to L1M4a1, an ancient element distantly related to LINE-1. The percentage of nucleotide conservation of this segment to the L1M4a1 consensus sequence is consistent with L1M4a1's Kimura divergence value of 34%. We reasoned that this degree of sequence divergence would allow us to specifically target and interrogate its function without unintentionally targeting other repetitive elements in the genome. We also identified a fragment of LINE-1 PA2 and an ORF2-like protein on EIE 1432,33 (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Although the mechanism generating the adjacency of the fragments remains uncertain, the L1M4a1-like segment harbours a polyA-signal-like motif (AAAAAG), supporting a model in which an L1PA2 transcript reads through its own 3′ end and terminates at this neighbouring signal, producing a 3′-transduced RNA that could be mobilized in trans by the LINE-1 enzyme32,33 (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d).

To confirm the computational reconstruction of the ecDNA and the heterogeneity of different ecDNA molecules, we turned to CRISPR-CATCH (Cas9-assisted targeting of chromosome segments)—a method for isolating and sequencing ecDNA—to elucidate the size and variations of ecDNAs containing EIE 1422 (Fig. 2a). Targeting EIE 14 with two independent gRNAs, we successfully isolated ecDNA fragments from the COLO320DM cell line for sequencing (Fig. 2b). Sequence analysis of these bands confirmed the presence of EIE 14, originally annotated on chromosome 3, to be inserted onto chromosome 8 between the CASC8 and CASC11 genes approximately 200 kilobases away from MYC, in agreement with the long-read nanopore sequencing (Figs. 1g and 2c, Extended Data Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Tables 4–6). Multiple bands of different sizes on the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) gel indicated the presence of varying sizes of ecDNAs, all sharing the EIE 14 insertion within the chromosome 8 amplicon (Fig. 2b,c). Beyond EIE 14, the CRISPR-CATCH approach allowed us to capture and sequence a subset of EIEs initially identified through Hi-C analysis (Fig. 2d). The identification of the additional EIEs observed in the Hi-C data suggest that the ‘striping' between the ecDNA and endogenous chromosomes is an artefact of these sequences' presence on ecDNAs, rather than true trans contacts, at least for this identified subset. Although the recent T2T genome build34 annotates EIE 14 to chromosome 3 (Extended Data Fig. 2c), we found evidence that the structural variant described here between EIE 14 and the MYC-containing amplicon region is identified as a translocation event between Chr8:128,533,830 and Chr3:111,274,086 in approximately 46% (minor allele frequency of 0.467646) of individuals without disease35 (Supplementary Table 4, row 7). This suggests that this structural variant was preexisting before cancer formation in the COLO320-originating patient and was subsequently amplified as a passenger on ecDNA.

a, A schematic diagram illustrating the CRISPR-CATCH experiment designed to isolate and characterize ecDNA components. The process involves the use of guide RNA targeting the EIE 14 from chromosome 3. DNA is embedded in agarose, followed by PFGE, allowing band extraction and subsequent next-generation sequencing (NGS) of ecDNA fragments. Negative control (NC) is a guide RNA not targeting ecDNA. b, The PFGE gel image displays the separation of DNA fragments, including lanes for the left ladder, ladder, empty lane, negative control, sgRNA #1, sgRNA #2, and band numbers corresponding to those analysed by NGS in in c and d. Targeting EIE 14 with guide RNAs leads to cleavage of the ecDNA chromosome 8 sequences, resulting in multiple discrete bands and confirming the insertion of EIE 14 onto ecDNA. sgRNA #1 ATATAGGACAGTATCAAGTA; sgRNA #2 TATATTATTAGTCTGCTGAA; full EIE 14 sequences from long-read sequencing are presented in Supplementary Table 6. c, Whole-genome sequencing results confirm the presence of EIE 14, originally annotated on chromosome 3, within the ecDNA, between the CASC8 and CASC11 genes, approximately 200 kilobases upstream from MYC. The dotted line indicates the position of this insertion. Each band is an ecDNA molecule of a different size that contains the EIE 14 insertion. d, Additional EIEs identified in the initial Hi-C screen, captured and sequenced in the CRISPR-CATCH gel bands from b. Each EIE is represented by a vertical shaded box with genomic coordinates, indicating insertion events within the ecDNA. e, ORCA visualization of the COLO320DM cell nucleus.

We then utilized Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA) to quantify the spatial relationship of EIE 14 with MYC36,37 (Fig. 2e). Barcoded probes were designed targeting the unique portion of EIE 14 (1 kb), MYC exon 2 (3.1 kb), PVT1 exon 1 (2.5 kb) and the endogenous chromosome 3 region flanking EIE 14 (3 kb) (Supplementary Table 7) to determine the spatial organization of EIE 14 relative to the ecDNA. These specific exons were chosen to account for the fact that amplicon reconstruction of ecDNA in the COLO320DM cell line demonstrated an occasional rearrangement of MYC exon 2 replacement by PVT1 exon 1 (ref. 20). Because EIE 14 is classified as a repetitive element, we confirmed probe specificity by staining the EIE 14 locus in K562 cells that do not contain ecDNA. Indeed, we detect only one to three labelled regions in the non-amplified context (Extended Data Fig. 3a). By contrast, when labelling COLO320DM cells, EIE 14 colocalized with the ecDNA and amplified to a similar copy number per cell (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3b). The extensive structural variation detected in the long-read sequencing and the amplification of EIE 14 visualized by ORCA (Extended Data Fig. 3b) suggest a model in which the element resides in the sequence amplified on ecDNA and participates in cis and/or trans contacts with other ecDNA molecules.

It has been proposed that amplified loci within ecDNA are able to regulate oncogene expression through cis interactions on the same ecDNA molecule as well as trans interactions between ecDNAs via a clustering mechanism20. As such, it is important to understand not only the structural variations of ecDNA, but also their spatial organization within the nucleus to gain a comprehensive understanding of their potential regulatory functions. We quantified the spatial distributions of MYC exon 2, PVT1 exon 1 and EIE 14; the imaged loci were fitted in three dimensions with a Gaussian fitting algorithm to extract x,y,z coordinates (Fig. 3a–c; Methods). The copy number of identified loci varied from zero detected points to 150 per cell. On average, MYC had 29, PVT1 had 31 and EIE 14 had 22 copies per cell (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Similar distributions of points per cell, as well as strong correlation (r > 0.7) between the number of points per loci per cell (Extended Data Fig. 3c), suggest that this EIE is not inserted into multiple sites on a single ecDNA.

Source data

Once the centroids of each point per cell were identified (Fig. 3c), we calculated the all-to-all pairwise distance relationship (Fig. 3d). The off-diagonal pattern of distances between EIE 14, MYC and PVT1 suggested a tendency for these loci to cluster at genomic distances <1,000 nm. We further quantified the spatial relationships across all 1,329 imaged cells by calculating the shortest pairwise distances between the three loci. To determine if these ecDNA molecules were spatially clustering in cells, we leveraged our observation that each ecDNA molecule carries a single copy of MYC and EIE 14. Thus, distances between MYC and other MYC loci should be closer than random if the ecDNA were spatially clustered. Random distances were simulated in a sphere with the identical number of points per a given cell. The distribution of shortest pairwise distances between MYC and MYC and between EIE 14 and EIE 14 were left-shifted compared with the randomly simulated points, suggesting a non-random organization (Fig. 3e,f, P < 1 × 10−10). The median observed versus expected distances between each EIE 14 loci were 748 nm and 927 nm, respectively, and the median observed versus expected distances between each MYC loci were 707 nm and 814 nm, respectively.

Previous work has proposed that enhancers can exert transcriptional regulation on promoters at a distance of up to 300 nm via accumulation of activating factors38,39,40,41. To determine whether EIE 14 and MYC are within this regulatory distance range on ecDNA molecules, we calculated the pairwise distances between loci. Although the median distances between MYC and EIE 14 (797 nm) and PVT1 (585 nm) were greater than 300 nm, 12% and 20% of these loci, respectively, were within the regulatory range of MYC (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e).

To investigate the spatial relationship between EIE 14 and MYC while controlling for locus density, we calculated the degree of spatial clustering across distance intervals using Ripley's K spatial point pattern analysis (Methods; Fig. 3g). MYC exhibited the strongest clustering with EIE 14 at distances less than 200 nm (K value >1), and this behaviour approached a random distribution at greater distances (K value ~1; Fig. 3g,h). On average, the distances between MYC and EIE 14 were greater than those between MYC and PVT1. However, at distances below 300 nm, EIE 14 and PVT1 displayed similar clustering behaviour with MYC (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). This clustering suggests that EIE 14 is acting as a proximity-dependent regulator of MYC reminiscent of enhancer–promoter interactions42. Altogether, the spatial clustering behaviour of this ecDNA species measured here and previously20, the propensity for MYC to engage in ‘enhancer hijacking'43 and the ability of reactivated repetitive elements to engage in long-range gene activation27 suggest that any genomically linear separation of MYC and EIE 14 is overcome in both cis (interaction with MYC on the same ecDNA molecule) and trans (ecDNA–ecDNA interactions).

To test whether the identified TEs are important for the cancer cell proliferation, we performed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) growth screen targeting a subset of EIEs in COLO320DM cells engineered to stably express dCas9-KRAB44 (Fig. 4a,b). We were able to target 36 out of the 68 EIEs with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that met the following criteria: (1) must meet stringent specificity criteria to reduce potential off targets intrinsic to repetitive sequences (Methods) and (2) have at least two sgRNAs per EIE. We also included 125 non-targeting controls (NTC) that were introduced into cells with the EIE sgRNAs via lentiviral transduction (Supplementary Table 10). After transduction, we monitored cell proliferation at multiple timepoints: 4 days (baseline), 3 days after baseline, 14 days and 1 month (30 days), followed by deep sequencing to quantify sgRNA frequencies (Fig. 4b). We obtained highly reproducible guide counts across replicates and timepoints (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c).

a, Schematic of the CRISPRi screening strategy used to evaluate the regulatory potential of the 68 EIEs by designing 4–6 gRNAs per element for a total of 257 genomic regions tested and 125 non-targeting control sgRNAs. The screen involved the transduction of cells with a lentivirus expressing dCas9-KRAB and the sgRNAs such that each cell received one sgRNA, followed by calculation of cell growth phenotype over a series of timepoints (baseline (4 days), baseline + 3 days, baseline + 14 days and baseline + 1 month). The screen was further filtered on guide specificity (Methods), and 36/68 targeted EIEs met the qualifying threshold. b, The growth phenotype of COLO320DM cells 2 weeks post-transduction, relative to NTC. Each point represents the average guide effect (Z score) for sgRNAs targeting the 36 qualifying EIEs, ranked by their impact on cell growth. EIE 14 is indicated by dashed rectangle with negative Z score <−1 (significant negative impact on cell viability). See Extended Data Fig. 4 for additional timepoints. Positive hits are labelled in pink with their corresponding EIE. c, UCSC Genome Browser multiregion view showing the locations of the EIEs within the genome. Each EIE is indicated by a vertical bar. The browser displays the annotations for genes and repetitive elements such as Alu, LINE and LTR elements (RepeatMasker); the ATAC-seq dataset20 is normalized for library size (Methods). d, Zoom-in of EIE 14's histone marks: enrichment of H3K27 acetylation18, BRD4 binding20 and ATAC-seq peaks. ChIP-seq data were normalized to input to control for copy number. ATAC-seq data were normalized to library size (Methods). e, H3K9me3 histone modification of EIE 14 across ENCODE cell lines50,51.

Our data showed that the growth phenotype curve for 3 out of 36 of our targeted EIEs at various timepoints indicated a Z score of less than −1, which suggested a significant negative impact on cell viability, with an acute growth defect after only 3 days (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). These elements were categorized as evolutionarily older based on their retrotransposition activity in the human genome and spanned classes (LINEs, SINEs and LTRs) (Supplementary Table 11). The enrichment of old TEs may be confounded by the relative ease of targeting sequences with increased sequence divergence. They are generally found in gene-poor regions, making it unlikely that silencing would lead to secondary effects from heterochromatin spreading. Collectively, these results suggest that a subset of our targeted EIEs, including EIE 14, can contribute to cancer cell growth and fitness. We speculate that this is related to EIE interaction with MYC, as knockdown of this oncogene has been shown to have similar effects on COLO320DM growth and survival45,46. In addition, 3 out of 36 of the measured EIEs also had a Z score greater than 1, indicating a significant increase of cell growth or fitness. The identity of these elements also spanned multiple element classes, with two (EIE 68 and EIE 45) located within uncharacterized non-coding RNAs, and one (EIE 57) within the first exon of the ANKRD30B protein-coding gene, which has been implicated in cell proliferation47. Further investigation of these hits is warranted in future studies to explain their positive effects on cell growth, especially those within the uncharacterized non-coding RNA regions.

The strongest growth defect was observed for perturbation of EIE 14 (Fig. 4b), which when combined with our finding of its co-localization with ecDNA-amplified MYC (Fig. 3h), suggests a potential enhancer-like regulatory role for this EIE. To examine the epigenetic landscape of this element we leveraged copy-number-normalized chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) measuring H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), BRD4 occupancy and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) accessibility data. These epigenetic features are all commonly associated with enhancer activity18,48,49. Notably, many EIEs, including EIE 14, were accessible in COLO320DM cells (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 5). The measured accessibility of EIE 14 contrasts the normally silenced H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3k9me3) state across annotated human cell lines50,51 (Fig. 4e). Cross-referencing our identified EIEs with accessibility data from other ecDNA-containing cell lines demonstrated that accessibility of EIEs is a more generalizable phenomenon beyond COLO320DM cells (Extended Data Fig. 5). Altogether, the accessibility and proximal clustering of EIE 14 points towards active regulatory potential of this element in COLO320DM cells, while identification of accessible EIEs across cell lines suggests a broader functional relevance of EIE regulatory potential on ecDNA48,49 (Extended Data Fig. 5).

To determine whether EIE 14 activity is a consequence of ecDNA formation, we performed RNA-FISH on the sequence-specific 1-kb segment of EIE 14 in COLO320DM and isogenic COLO320HSR cells. The homogeneously staining region (HSR) cell line contains a similar copy number amplification of the MYC-amplified portion of chromosome 8, but the majority of these copies have integrated into chromosomes18 (Fig. 5a). We reasoned that, if the unique extrachromosomal context of ecDNA facilitates activation of EIE 14, we should not see evidence of its activity in the COLO320HSR genome-integrated context. Indeed, we observed distinct transcription events in the COLO320DM line (median n = 8 transcripts per cell) but not in the HSR line(median n = 0 transcripts per cell; Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b).

a, Schematic outlining the COLO320DM cell line as having high copy number and high ecDNA levels, versus the HSR cell line, which has high copy number but low ecDNA. b, RNA-FISH labelling for EIE 14 and MYC exon 2 transcription in COLO320 DM and HSR. Median transcripts for EIE 14 are 4 and 0 for the DM and HSR cells (two-tailed Wilcoxon ranksum P = 8.22 × 10−94), respectively. DM cells have a median of 14 MYC transcripts, and HSR cells have a median of 8 transcripts per cell (two-tailed Wilcoxon ranksum P = 2.18 × 10−66). n = 712 cells (DM) n = 681 (HSR) across two biological replicates.

EIE 14 compared with positive control (PVT1 positive control from ref. 20). P values obtained from two-tailed unpaired t-test. Error bars are standard deviations from the mean. d, Schematic outlining EIE 14 as a translocation event in healthy patients where EIE 14 is normally inactive across annotated cell lines (see a). EIE 14 gains regulatory potential when it is amplified within ecDNA as a consequence of translocation near MYC. EIE 14 can then act as a regulator of MYC in both cis and trans contacts within and between ecDNAs.

Source data

Finally, to directly test the ability for the EIE 14 sequence to act as an enhancer of MYC expression, we performed a luciferase reporter assay measuring its ability to activate transcription of TK and MYC promoters20,52 (Fig. 5c). EIE 14 significantly increased MYC promoter-mediated reporter gene expression relative to the promoter-only control, signifying bona fide enhancer activity (Fig. 5c). Separating EIE 14 into L1M4a1 and L1PA2 fragments further demonstrated that both sequences can individually act as enhancers, with an additive effect when combined (Extended Data Fig. 6c). In sum, the enhancer-associated features and regulatory activity of the luciferase assay suggested that EIE 14, and possibly other EIEs, have been co-opted as regulatory sequences when found on ecDNA, influencing the expression of ecDNA-borne oncogenes (Fig. 5d).

This study uncovers a mechanism by which TEs, typically silenced by heterochromatin, may acquire regulatory potential when amplified on ecDNA53,54,55. Somatically active retrotransposition events56, as induced by LINEs and SINEs, are abundant in the human genome and represent a major source of genetic variation57. Across cancer types, retrotransposon insertions contribute significantly to structural variation, genomic rearrangements, copy number alterations and mutations—including in colorectal cancer58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65. The activity of these elements in cancer can induce genomic instability and drive the acquisition of malignant traits. For instance, when reactivated LINE-1 elements are inserted into the APC tumour suppressor gene in colorectal cancer, they disrupt gene function and confer a selective advantage66. In other contexts, TEs act as bona fide transcriptional enhancers, amplifying oncogenic gene expression and promoting tumorigenesis26.

Here, we describe the enhancer-like activity of a specific identified element, EIE 14, which becomes active through its association with ecDNA (Fig. 5d). ecDNAs, which are randomly segregated during cell division, are subject to strong selective pressure10. The recurrent co-amplification of TEs on ecDNA-containing cell lines suggests they may contribute to ecDNA fitness and oncogenic function. We show that retrotransposons such as L1M4a1/EIE 14 can escape the inactive chromatin environment of their native genomic loci when inserted within the transcriptionally permissive landscape of ecDNA18. In fact, we demonstrate that EIE 14 is transcriptionally active only in the context of ecDNA and not in the endogenous chromosomal context of the copy-number-matched, isogenic COLO320HSR cells. The context-specific transcription suggests a purely epigenetic regulation imbued by the local environment of ecDNA. This environment enables EIE 14 to potentially influence nearby oncogenes such as MYC. Given that LINEs have been shown to exhibit enhancer-like behaviour when reactivated27,28,67, the clustering of ecDNA molecules observed through ORCA may further enhance spatial feedback68 of both cis- and trans-regulatory interactions of EIE 14 with oncogenic targets.

Although EIE 14 is incapable of autonomous transposition and lacks a complete L1M4a1 sequence, its activity following integration into ecDNA suggests that degenerate ancient sequences can become functionally active under appropriate conditions. Previous work has shown that single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with familial cancer risk often affect the biochemical activity of noncoding enhancer elements linked to oncogenes activated in cancer69,70. Our results extend this model by proposing that inherited variation in ancient TE insertions, such as EIE 14 near MYC, can create latent enhancers that become activated when the oncogene locus is excised into ecDNA.

Perturbation of EIE 14 through CRISPRi resulted in impaired cell growth in COLO320DM cells, indicating that its reactivation contributes to the colorectal cancer phenotype. Quantifying the precise downregulation of MYC is constrained by ecDNA heterogeneity, a narrow temporal window in MYC-addicted cells, rapid growth arrest and subsequent loss of successfully targeted cells. While this functional evidence supports a potential oncogenic role, further studies focusing on in vivo analyses are necessary to determine whether TEs on ecDNA are sufficient to confer a survival advantage or correlate with poor patient prognosis. Notably, recurrent LINE-1 amplification on ecDNA has been observed in primary oesophageal cancer, providing in vivo support for the clinical relevance of this phenomenon71.

Finally, the amplification of retrotransposable elements onto ecDNA introduces a mechanism that increases ecDNA structural variation by leveraging the approximately 40% of the genome composed of typically silenced repetitive elements. Retrotranspositions are, in fact, the second-most frequent type of structural variant in colorectal adenocarcinomas72. Just as transposons have played a major role in bacterial plasmid evolution through cycles of insertion and recombination73, our findings suggest a parallel evolutionary trajectory in human oncogenic ecDNAs. The transcriptionally permissive state of ecDNA enables these elements to potentiate oncogene activation and selection—making them both prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

Cell lines were obtained from ATCC. COLO320DM (CCL-220) and COLO320-HSR (CCL-220.1) cells were maintained in RPMI; Life Technologies, cat. no. 11875-119 supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Hyclone, cat. no. SH30396.03) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 15140-122). All cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The presence of ecDNA in cell lines was confirmed via metaphase spreads.

Ten million cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in aliquots of one million cells each for 10 min at room temperature and combined after fixation. We performed the Hi-C assay following a standard protocol to investigate chromatin interactions within colorectal cancer cells74. HiC libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 with paired-end 75-bp read lengths. Paired-end HiC reads were aligned to hg19 genome with the HiC-Pro pipeline75. The pipeline was run with default settings, configured to assign reads to DpnII restriction fragments and to filter for valid pairs. The data were then binned to generate raw contact maps that then underwent iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition normalization to remove biases. The HiCCUPS function in Juicer76 was then used to call high-confidence loops. Visualization was done using Juicebox (https://aidenlab.org/juicebox/).

To assess the overlap of classes of repetitive elements with our identified EIEs, we obtained the ‘RepeatMasker' and ‘Interrupted Repeats' tracks from UCSC Genome Browser for hg19. For each EIE, we computed the fraction of the sequence that overlapped with the merged BED file containing the RepeatMasker and Interreputed Repeats annotations. We report the overlap separately for LINE, SINE and LTR repetitive element classes. Importantly, each EIE is exactly 1 kb long, so no length normalization is performed. To compute an expected proportion, we computed the fraction of hg19 covered by each repetitive element class. The results are reported in Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1a.

High-molecular-weight (HMW) genomic DNA was extracted from approximately 6 million COLO320DM cells using the Monarch HMW DNA Extraction Kit for Tissue (NEB #T3060L) following the Oxford Nanopore Ultra-Long DNA Sequencing Kit V14 protocol. After extracting HMW genomic DNA, we constructed Nanopore libraries using the Oxford Nanopore Ultra-Long DNA Sequencing Kit V14 (SQK-ULK114) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. We sequenced libraries on an Oxford Nanopore PromethION using a 10.4.1. Flow Cell (FLO-PRO114M) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Basecalls from raw POD5 files were computed using Dorado (v.0.2.4).

We first identified Nanopore reads containing a single element by aligning reads with minimap277 and filtered out reads that were not mapped by the algorithm (denoted by an asterisk in the RNAME column of the BAM entry). Then, taking these reads, we performed genomic alignment once again using minimap2 against hg19.

From these new alignments of only the reads found to contain the element under consideration, we performed two analyses for each element. First, we detected structural variant detection using Sniffles278. Second, we identified overlap of reads with ecDNA-containing intervals that were reconstructed with long reads (see ‘Reconstruction of ecDNA amplicons with long-read data” section). In this second analysis (presented in Fig. 1f), we counted the number of reads covering regions contained with cycles reconstructed with CoRAL algorithm31. While this analysis does not explicitly distinguish reads originating from chromosomal versus extrachromosomal regions, we reasoned that elements carried on ecDNA would be amplified and therefore exhibit higher coverage; conversely, regions primarily chromosomal would show read counts similar to the overall genome coverage.

We reconstructed ecDNA amplicons from ultralong Oxford Nanopore reads using the CoRAL algorithm31. In brief, this algorithm determines focally amplified regions of the genome using CNVkit79 and then finds reads that support this focally amplified region. In doing so, CoRAL identifies genomic breakpoints between the focally amplified seed region and disparate parts of the genome to create a ‘breakpoint graph'. From this breakpoint graph, putative ecDNA cycles are identified. We report the breakpoint graph in Fig. 1g, which includes a breakpoint between EIE 14 (annotated on chr3) and an intergenic region between CASC8 and MYC on chr8.

In addition to detecting EIE 14 on the MYC-amplifying ecDNA in COLO320DM, we additionally quantified the number of reads that span a given EIE and any part of the COLO320DM genome amplified as ecDNA. We report the number reads that support an EIE as amplified on ecDNA in Fig. 1f.

In Extended Data Fig. 2b, we visualized reads connecting EIE 14 on chr3 with the chr8 ecDNA-amplified region using Ribbon (v 2.0.0)80.

ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data for COLO320DM and SNU16 was obtained from ref. 20 and for PC3 and GBM39KT from ref. 18. Previously, ATAC-seq data were mapped to hg19. While ChIP-seq data were normalized to input, as input is not sequenced with ATAC-seq, these data were further normalized by library size. Specifically, ATAC-seq data were converted to a bedGraph format reporting the number of reads supporting each base position; these read densities were then normalized to parts per 10 million by dividing each position's count by a normalization factor based on the total library size. These library-size-normalized data were used for downstream plotting

To classify TEs as old or young, we conducted a classification of EIE sequences listed in Supplementary Table 2. Elements were categorized based on their known evolutionary activity in humans. Young elements were defined as those from recently active subfamilies, including L1HS, L1PA2, SVA and AluY, which are known to have current or recent retrotransposition activity in the human genome. Classifications can be found in Supplementary Table 11.

The pHR-SFFV-dCas9-BFP-KRAB (Addgene, cat. no. 46911) plasmid was modified to dCas9-BFP-KRAB-2A-Blast as previously described81. Lentiviral particles were produced by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with the plasmid along with packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G using a standard transfection method. Viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were transduced with lentivirus, incubated for 2 days selected with 1 μg ml−1 blasticidin for 10–14 days, and BFP expression was analysed by flow cytometry.

We took sgRNA specificity into account from the design phase of the CRISPRi screen. Our guide selection criteria included off-target scoring from ref. 85 and filtering. We designed the library in benchling (https://benchling.com) with multiple independent sgRNAs per EIE element. This redundancy helps to distinguish on-target biological effects from off-target noise. To increase our stringency and ensure that the effects of low-efficiency or low-specificity guides do not interfere with the interpretation of the screen, we used FlashFry82 to score our gRNAs with multiple tools (Supplementary Table 12) and specifically selected the CRISPRi specificity score developed by ref. 83 for filtering. We report effects only for elements with at least two guides achieving a specificity score greater than 0.2, which is the standard cut-off for this scoring parameter (similar to the Doench et al.84 cumulative distribution function score). The oligo pool encoding guides (Supplementary Table 10) were synthesized by Twist Bio and inserted into addgene Plasmid #52963 lentiGuide-Puro digested with Esp3I enzyme (NEB). The oligo pool was sequence validated. To investigate the effects of CRISPRi, we utilized a lentiviral delivery system to introduce sgRNAs into cells stably expressing the dCas9-KRAB repressor. Lentiviral particles were produced as described above. The viral titre was determined by transducing HEK293T cells with serial dilutions of virus and assessing transduction efficiency via flow cytometry for GFP expression.

For transduction, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well in six-well plates and transduced overnight with lentivirus at a low multiplicity of infection of 0.3, ensuring single sgRNA integration per cell. The following day, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. Two days post-transduction, cells were selected with 0.5 μg ml−1 puromycin for 4 days to enrich successfully transduced cells. GFP expression was monitored by flow cytometry to assess transduction efficiency. After selection, cells were collected at multiple timepoints: baseline (day 4 after transduction), day 3, week 1 and month 1 (30 days). Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions.

Integrated sgRNA sequences were amplified from genomic DNA using a multistep PCR process. First, sgRNA cassettes were amplified using Primer set 1: hU6_pcr_out_fw (tggactatcatatgcttaccgtaacttgaaagt) and efs_pcr_rev (ctaggcaccggatcaattgccga). PCR reactions contained 0.8 μl each of 25 μM primers, 1–2 μg genomic DNA, water and 25 μL NEB 2x master mix in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR conditions included an initial 3 min at 98 °C, followed by 15–17 cycles of 20 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 58 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, concluding with a final extension for 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products (~400 bp) were verified by gel electrophoresis and purified. The second PCR step added Illumina sequencing adapters using primers (P5 stagger -hu6 and p7adpt_spRNAl105nt_rev). Reactions contained 10–50 ng of purified PCR1 product, 0.8 μl of each primer, water and 25 μl of NEB 2× master mix in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR conditions were: initial denaturation for 30 s at 98 °C, followed by six cycles of 15 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 60 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, with a final extension of 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products (200–300 bp) were gel-verified and purified using AMPure XP beads. A final indexing PCR step was performed using Truseq-based P5 and P7 indexing primers. Reactions contained 10–50 ng DNA from PCR2, 0.8 μl of each primer, water and 25 μl NEB 2× master mix in 50 μl total volume. Conditions included 30 s at 98 °C followed by six cycles of 15 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 63 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, ending with a 1-min extension at 72 °C. Products were purified with AMPure XP beads and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform using single-end 50-bp reads. Sequencing data were processed to quantify sgRNA representation at each timepoint, allowing analysis of sgRNA abundance dynamics over the experiment duration.

To compute the effect of each guide on cell fitness, we first quantified guide counts from sequencing libraries. To normalize counts across libraries, we converted raw guide counts to counts per million (CPM) and retained guides that had CPM values of at least 20 across all days tested. We also filtered out guides with high off-target scores (Supplementary Table 12, 0.2 cut-off from optimized CRISPRi design parameters83) and excluded EIEs with fewer than two guides remaining after filtering. After confirming that normalized guide abundances were robust across replicates, we proceeded with our analysis using the average of guide replicates at each timepoint. We next scored the relative fitness of each guide against the NTC by computing the ratio of CPM values between a guide and the NTC at the particular timepoint. Finally, we transformed this distribution to Z scores and reported this as the relative fitness effect of each guide.

In our study, we used the CRISPR-CATCH technique to isolate and analyse ecDNA structures. Following the standard protocol22, we designed two sgRNAs targeting specific enhancer regions: sgRNA #1 (ATATAGGACAGTATCAAGTA) and sgRNA #2 (TATATTATTAGTCTGCTGAA). These sgRNAs directed the Cas9 nuclease to introduce double-strand breaks at the targeted sites, linearizing the circular ecDNA molecules. The linearized DNA was then subjected to PFGE using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hansenula wingei DNA ladders as molecular weight markers to facilitate size-based separation. Distinct DNA bands corresponding to the targeted ecDNA were excised from the gel for downstream analyses, including sequencing.

Probes were designed against human genome assembly hg19, tiling the regions in Supplementary Table 7 using the probe designing software described previously36,37. We restricted the selection of the 40-mer probe targeting regions to a GC content between 20% and 80% and a melting temperature of 65–90 °C, and excluded sequences with non-unique homology—defined as sharing a 17-mer or longer sequence with other genomic regions—or homology to common repetitive elements in the human genome listed in RepBase, using a 14-mer cut-off. Targeting probes were then appended with a 20-mer barcode per target region. Probe design software is available via GitHub at https://github.com/BoettigerLab/ORCA-public. Finalized probe libraries were ordered as an oligo-pool from GenScript.

ORCA hybridization was performed as previously described36,37. In brief, 40-mm Bioptechs coverslips were prepared with EMD Millipore poly-D-lysine solution (1 mg ml−1, 20 ml, dilute 1:10) (Sigma, cat. no. A003E) for 40 min. Coverslips were then rinsed three times in 1× PBS. Cells were passaged onto the coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the coverslip with cells were rinsed three times in 1× PBS and then fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. For DNA imaging, cells were then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 1× PBS for 10 min followed by 5 min of denaturing in 0.1 M HCl. A 35-min incubation in hybridization buffer prepared samples for the primary probe. Primary probes were added (1 μg) directly to the sample in hybridization solution, and then the sample was heated to 90 °C for 3 min. An overnight 42 °C incubation (or at least 8 h incubation) was performed, followed by post-fixation in 8% paraformaldehyde + 2% glutaraldehyde in 1× PBS, before being stored in 2× SSC or used immediately for imaging. For RNA imaging, the HCl, heat and post-fixation steps were omitted.

DNA samples were imaged on one of two different homebuilt set-ups designed for ORCA, ‘scope-1' or ‘scope-3', depending on instrument availability. Microscope design parameters were deposited in the Micro-Meta App85. The design and assembly of the scope-1 system is described in detail in our prior protocol paper37. Both systems use a similar auto-focus system, fluidics system and scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera (Hamamatsu FLASH 4.0), although scope-3 had a larger field of view (2,048 × 2,048 108-nm pixels) compared with scope-1 (1,024 × 1,024 154-nm pixels).

RNA samples were imaged on a different homebuilt set-up designed for ORCA designated as the ‘Yale lumencor system'. This system uses a similar auto-focus system and fluidics system, with a scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera (Hamamatsu ORCA BT fusion) with a field of view of 2,304 × 2,304 at 108 nm per pixels and an Olympus PlanApo 60× objective.

Automated fluidics handling is described in detail in our prior protocol paper37. In brief, fluid exchange between each imaging step was performed by a homebuilt robotic set-up. The system used a three-axis computer numerical control router engraver, buffer reservoirs and hybridization wells (96-well plate) on a three-axis stage, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene tubing, imaging chamber (FCS2, Bioptechs), a needle and peristaltic pump (Gilson F155006). The needle was moved between buffers or hybridization wells and transported across the samples through tubing using a peristaltic pump. Open-source software for the control of the fluidics system is described in the ‘Software availability' section.

Sequential imaging of ORCA probes was conducted alternating between hybridization of fluorescent adapter probes, readout probes complementary to the barcodes on the primary probe sequences, imaging and stripping of probes, as described previously36,37. In brief, a z-stack spanning 10 μm was acquired with 250 nm step sizes, alternating laser excitation between the data channel and fiducial marker at each step. Readout probes were labelled with Alexa-750 fluorophores. The fiducial probe was labelled in cy3 and added only in the initial round. RNA imaging was performed with the EIE 14 probe labelled with the Alexa-750 and the MYC probe labelled with the Cy5 fluorophores.

Image processing was performed with custom MATLAB functions available via GitHub at https://github.com/BoettigerLab/ORCA-public. In brief, cells were maximum projected, and pixel-scale alignment across all fields of view was computed using the fiducial signal. This alignment was then applied in three dimensions across all 250-nm z steps. Cellpose86 was then used to segment individual cells. A cell-by-cell fine scale (subpixel) alignment was then computed, and aligned individual cells were then ready for 3D-spot calling. The individual ecDNA spots and their 3D positions computed to subpixel accuracy using the corresponding raw 3D image stacks and the 3D DaoSTORM function in storm-analysis toolbox (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3528330), an open-source software for single-molecule localization, adapted for dense and overlapping emitters following the DaoSTORM algorithm87. DaoSTORM was run in the 2D-fixed mode, as the 3D fitting modes are for estimating axial position from astigmatism in the xy plane, rather than computing it directly from a z-stack. The fixed-width point spread function of the microscope is precomputed using 100-nm (subdiffraction) fluorescent beads. A minimum detection threshold of 30 sigma was used for the fit. The z-position of the localizations was computed using Gaussian fit to the vertically stacked localizations, with an axial Gaussian width also precomputed from z-stack images with 100-nm fluorescent beads. Additional information can be found in the read-the-docs for storm-analysis at https://storm-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

All pairwise distances between genomic regions were calculated on a per-cell basis. The shortest distances were saved for each MYC centroid and EIE 14 and PVT1 such that each MYC centroid has one corresponding shortest distance per EIE 14 and PVT1. For each cell, a sphere radius r = 4um (the average radius of cells calculated with Cellpose mask) with randomly simulated points corresponding to the number of MYC, EIE 14 and PVT1 centroids. The same minimum pairwise distance quantification was calculated on the randomly simulated points.

To calculate the density-corrected distance ratios, a distance cut-off of 2 μm and an interval density of 0.01:0.01:2 was used. The spatial relationship between MYC and EIE 14 and MYC and PVT1 were quantified as follows. On a per-cell basis, the distance density function was calculated, truncated at the specified cut-off. A uniform distribution was then computed over the same interval, and a ratio of these values was taken. This ratio was then corrected by the volume of the interval shell.

All plasmids are made with Gibson assembly (NEB HIFI DNA assembly kit) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We used a plasmid from this publication20 containing the MYC promoter (chr8:128,745,990–128,748,526, hg19) driving NanoLuc luciferase (PVT1p-nLuc) and a constitutive thymidine kinase (TK) promoter driving Firefly luciferase. This plasmid served as the negative control. pGL4-tk-luc2 (Promega) plasmids with an enhancer (chr8:128347148–128348310) were used as the positive control20. In the test plasmid, the cis-enhancer was replaced by 1.7 kb sequence of EIE 14 or by Part #1: L1PA2 or by Part #2: L1M4a1 (Supplementary Table 13). To assess luciferase reporter expression, COLO320DM cells were seeded into a 24-well plate with 100,000 cells per well. Reporter plasmids were transfected into cells the next day with Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer's protocol, using 0.25 μg DNA per well. Luciferase levels were quantified using Nano-Glo Dual reporter luciferase assay (Promega).

All statistical tests used, replicate information and sample size information are reported in the figure legends. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No samples or data points were excluded. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to the conditions of the experiments during data analysis.

Source data

a. Schematic of the CRISPRi screening strategy used to evaluate the regulatory potential of the 68 EIEs by designing 4-6 gRNAs per element for a total of 257 genomic regions tested and 125 non-targeting control sgRNAs. The screen involved the transduction of cells with a lentivirus expressing dCas9-KRAB and the sgRNAs such that each cell received 1 sgRNA, followed by calculation of cell growth phenotype over a series of time points (Baseline(4 days), Baseline + 3 days, Baseline + 14 days, and Baseline + 1 month). The screen was further filtered on guide specificity (methods) and 36/68 targeted EIEs met the qualifying threshold. b. The growth phenotype of COLO320DM cells and reproducibility of counts between two biological replicates at different timepoints for the 36 qualifying EIEs. Each point represents the average guide effect (Z-score). Pearson correlations (r) are reported for reproducibility plots. c. Growth phenotypes of the qualifying EIE-targeting guides in COLO320DM cells across multiple time points. Each point represents the average guide effect (Z-score) for sgRNAs targeting a specific EIE. Guides with an average abs(Z-score) > 1 are annotated.

ATAC-seq data for COLO320DM and SNU16 was obtained from Hung, Yost et al.20 and for PC3 and GBM39KT from Wu et al.18. Previously, ATAC-seq data was mapped to hg19. ATAC-seq data was further normalized by library size.

a. Quantification of RNA-FISH signal on a per cell basis from COLO320-DM cells labeling MYC exon 2 and EIE 14 (see Methods for quantification method). n = 712 cells across 2 biological replicates. b. As in (a) but for COLO320-HSR cells. n = 681 cells across 2 biological replicates. c. Fold change in luciferase signal driven by the L1PA2 (part 1), L1M4a1 (part2) and combined (EIE14) regions of EIE 14 for n = 3 biological replicates.

The University of Virginia in Charlottesville on 17 October rejected an offer from the administration of US President Donald Trump to sign a higher education ‘compact'.Credit: Peter Morgan/AP Photo/Alamy

US President Donald Trump asked US universities earlier this month to sign a ‘compact' aligning their student admissions, hiring and research with his administration's priorities — or risk forfeiting federal research funds. And many scientists have been calling on their institutions to reject the offer.

How Trump's attack on universities is putting research in peril

“Short-term gain in research funding is not worth giving up the power that we have as scientists,” says Caitlin Hicks Pries, a biologist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, who signed a petition against her school signing on to the compact. “We want our research funded, but we want it funded based on the quality of our ideas and the quality of science.”

Seven of the nine universities initially invited to take the 1 October offer have now rejected it: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge; Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island; the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in Philadelphia; the University of Southern California in Los Angeles; the University of Virginia in Charlottesville; Dartmouth and the University of Arizona in Tucson.

Late on 20 October, Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, issued a statement that it would continue to provide the Trump administration with feedback on the compact offer, but that “research awards should be made based on merit alone”.

Some, including MIT, have echoed their researchers' concerns, citing the importance of academic freedom in their rationale. “In our view, America's leadership in science and innovation depends on independent thinking and open competition for excellence,” MIT president Sally Kornbluth wrote in a public statement. “Therefore, with respect, we cannot support the proposed approach.”

In a 12 October post on his social-media platform Truth Social, Trump informally expanded the compact offer to all US universities. And schools in Kansas, Arizona and Missouri were invited by the White House last week to discuss it.

The US Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment on researchers' concerns in this story. Nature instead received an automatic reply stating that there would be no response while the US government is shut down.

The Trump administration, complaining that US higher education has become too liberal, has been taking action against universities for months. One of the first of these was the attempt to cut billions in research funding at all schools by capping indirect costs at 15%. (These are costs for things such as electricity for laboratories, paid on top of research grants.) Federal judges have since blocked those plans, but the uncertainty it has caused for schools has, in part, spurred some to reduce hiring and admissions.

Harvard vs Trump: millions in grant money begin trickling back to scientists

Harvard vs Trump: millions in grant money begin trickling back to scientists

Some institutions, including Columbia University in New York City and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had their federal research funding frozen. Columbia agreed to pay US$220 million over three years and to a number of other concessions to restore its grants. Harvard, however, sued, and a judge ruled in its favour, giving its research funding back.

For Timmons Roberts, an environmental studies researcher at Brown, the prospect of a compact felt all too familiar. In July, his university agreed to pay $50 million over 10 years to support workforce development in Rhode Island in exchange for restoring its research funding, which had been frozen since April. Before Brown rejected the compact, Roberts spoke at a rally where he and his colleagues urged the institution to turn it down. Agreeing to the ‘deal' won't stop the Trump administration from asking for more in the future, Roberts says.

The compact was heavily shaped by billionaire financier Marc Rowan. In a New York Times op-ed explaining his involvement, Rowan stated that the compact was “intended to promote excellence in core academic pursuits and to protect free speech” while reforming a “broken” system.

Will US science survive Trump 2.0?

Will US science survive Trump 2.0?

University presidents said they agreed with many priorities of the compact, such as academic excellence and reintroducing standardized tests for admissions, which some institutions have already done. But the compact would additionally alter university admissions, by preventing officials from considering factors such as sex, race or nationality when deciding which students to admit, and marginalise transgender and nonbinary people by defining people as only ‘male' or ‘female'. It also imposes a 15% limit on the proportion of international undergraduate students at schools; none of the institutions initially invited to sign the compact are above that threshold.

Agreeing to the compact would additionally require schools with endowments over $2 million per undergraduate student to provide free tuition for those earning degrees in “hard science programs”. Tuition being too expensive is a real issue, “but I don't think the way to fix it is to tell universities that they can't charge it”, says Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at MIT who has been involved in faculty discussions about academic freedom and responding to the compact. “The federal government has every right to put conditions on recipients of federal grants, but the proper way to do that is through Congress,” which controls US funding. MIT meets the $2 million funding criterion; students whose families make less than $200,000 per year already receive free tuition.

When Abby Fagerlin tried logging into Canvas, a popular educational technology platform, to check on her assignments Monday morning, she couldn't get in.

That meant the 19-year-old college sophomore, who is studying physics at Pasadena City College, was unable to access materials she needed for her three classes, which were hosted on or linked through the learning management system. After searching online, she realized the Amazon Web Services outage that crippled much of the internet Monday had also temporarily taken down Canvas.

Fagerlin also couldn't be sure if she'd missed a message from her professors—some of whom she said communicated exclusively with their students through a messaging system hosted on Canvas. Going to talk to one of her professors to ask for physical materials from his class, meanwhile, posed a separate challenge.

“His office hours are [posted] on Canvas,” she said.

It wasn't just Fagerlin having problems. More than a dozen students at colleges and universities across the country told WIRED the Canvas outage threw off their schedules, preventing them from not just submitting and viewing assignments but also from participating in class activities, contacting professors, and accessing the textbooks and other materials they need to study.

The hit to Amazon's sprawling cloud computing services meant sites and platforms like WhatsApp, Venmo, ChatGPT, Roblox, Snapchat, Signal, and even some UK banks were inaccessible to some users Monday. The outage stemmed from AWS's northern Virginia hub, called US-EAST-1. By Monday evening Eastern time, Amazon said all AWS services had been restored.

But the disruptions to students are a testament to just how popular Canvas is on college campuses—and how much of modern educational life is increasingly centered on a handful of educational technology platforms.

Canvas is one of the leading web-based learning management systems used by schools and universities across the country, competing with other platforms like Blackboard and Moodle. According to figures provided to WIRED by Brian Watkins, the director of communications at Instructure, the company that owns Canvas, half of college and university students across the US use Canvas, while 38 percent of K-12 students also use the software.

Watkins told WIRED in a statement that Instructure “recognize[s] the integral role Canvas plays in the daily lives of educators and students, serving as a central hub for teaching and learning, and we acknowledge the significant impact today's Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage had on that experience.”

Both Canvas and Instructure posted the same statement Watkins provided to WIRED to their X accounts in the afternoon. The Canvas account was immediately flooded with replies from students concerned about tests, assignments, and essays. (“canvas.. we need to have a LONG talk. i spent 50 minutes on my midterm, for you to shut down when i was gonna submit it.. if it didnt submit im gonna get 50% taken off..” one user wrote.)

Many of the students who spoke to WIRED were feeling the same panic—especially given how crucial the Canvas platform is to their college experience. Canvas isn't just a place to submit assignments or read supplemental materials: It was designed as a hub for the educational experience, collating a host of other technologies like Google Docs, Zoom, and Turnitin, a plagiarism checker, into its central feed. Fagerlin said even her fun extracurriculars, like a pickleball class, use Canvas to take attendance and allow participants to communicate.

While digital-only textbooks have become increasingly popular in recent years, some students were cut off from those, too, unable to access the online services that host textbooks linked through Canvas. “We don't have any physical books,” Ekagara Gupta, a 22-year-old computer science major at Arizona State University, told WIRED. “Some courses list optional physical copies, but almost no one buys them since everything we need for exams and assignments is already on Canvas.”

Watkins did not respond to a specific question about whether or not Instructure is exploring options to let students access materials offline in the event of other outages or similar issues.

Canvas was first launched in 2011 and grew quickly; according to Instructure, it's used by over 30 million students at over 6,000 institutions around the world. The platform's success was partially driven by the spike in remote learning in response to Covid-19, according to a podcast interview featuring two executives from Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm that acquired Instructure in 2020 for $2 billion; in 2024, Thoma Bravo sold Instructure for $4.8 billion.

As their access was restored Monday evening, some reflected on just how centralized their experience is around the platform.

Fagerlin said that she usually loves Canvas and appreciates having everything streamlined in one place. “The downside, which I never even thought of happening, is if it's down, you don't have anything to work with.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside the Trump Adminstration's Bluesky Invasion","https://www.wired.com/story/inside-trump-administration-bluesky-invasion/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:04:00 GMT","

Since at least February, the White House had considered creating a Bluesky account. What began as talk of setting up an experimental account turned into a more strategic decision last week. As the government continued into shutdown, members of the White House's digital team decided to take its shutdown messaging to the predominantly left-wing platform as part of a coordinated blitz with several other federal agencies that officials described as an effort to “reach all audiences.”

“It should be the purpose of the government to communicate to the American public everywhere as often as possible,” says a White House official, who spoke to WIRED under the condition of anonymity to speak freely about the decision. The White House is now on Bluesky, Facebook, Instagram, Truth Social, TikTok, YouTube, and X. “We're just going to be there in as many places as possible because, as evident by the president's ethos and his attitude and the sheer volume of open press stuff we do, we want to be as transparent as humanly possible and reach as many people as possible,” says the official.

But what they attempted to position as bridge-building quickly looked something more like trench warfare. Instead of conscientious outreach across the aisle, the Trump administration's Bluesky launch mixed trolling and partisan messaging, creating instant backlash.

“Give us a follow so we can update you on how the Democrats' partisan shutdown is harming America's national security,” read one of the State Department's first posts on the platform. “We also heard this is a great place to research visa revocations.”

“We are new here,” the Department of the Interior said in one of its first posts on Friday. “Anyone want to talk about how climate change isn't the biggest threat to our country and that it's actually losing the AI arms race to China?”

The account for the Department of Homeland Security launched its account with a video compilation that included a clip of Bluesky CEO Jay Graber saying that the platform was for “everyone.” The clip was in response to a question posed by a WIRED reporter earlier this year about whether Bluesky would allow President Donald Trump to make an account. The DHS account has also responded to posts critical of the agency with messages urging users to “Report criminal illegal aliens: 866-DHS-2-ICE.”

Asked about the tone of these posts, a White House official suggests the administration is using the same voice they've used online all year. “This is how we speak across the board,” the official says. “We've been very consistent in our messaging on this.” The Trump administration has spent the year leaning into memes and trollish behavior on platforms like X. On Saturday, Trump posted an AI-generated video to Truth Social of himself piloting a fighter jet that dumped feces on “No Kings” protesters and liberal content creator Harry Sisson. It's not just Trump and the White House either: DHS has celebrated its notorious deportation strategy online through memes and more recently, the agency has engaged with right-wing influencers like Benny Johnson to create content supporting immigration officials on the ground in American cities.

The coordinated launch sparked backlash from Bluesky's user base, which created and shared lists making it easier for others to block all of the administration's accounts at once. As of Tuesday, a dozen of the 20 most blocked accounts were created by the Trump administration last week.

The White House account has drawn only around 12,000 followers. More than 100,000 users have the account blocked, according to Bluesky block-tracking site Clearsky, making the White House the second most blocked Bluesky user. Vice president JD Vance, who registered in June, still holds the title of the most blocked account, with more than 166,000 users blocking him.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED, but the White House official brushed off the criticism. “That's fine. Nobody can ever say we're not attempting to be transparent or attempting to communicate to as many people as possible. That's the name of the game.”

According to an administration official who was granted anonymity to speak freely, the decision to launch all of the accounts at once was deliberate. “It's not like we chose a specific date for a singular reason,” the official tells WIRED. “Doing it all at once makes it more of like a statement versus doing it piecemeal.”

“This is an opportunity for us to reach a big segment of the American population that we traditionally are not reaching even on traditional social media platforms,” the administration official says.

There was some confusion about the Bluesky verification process for these agencies as well, as representatives from the Trump administration reached out about the process on Thursday, sources tell WIRED. The administration decided to launch the accounts before hearing back from Bluesky. According to the White House official, the process was ""pretty simple.""

“We welcome The White House and other government agencies to Bluesky,” a Bluesky spokesperson told WIRED. ""We reached out to them right as they joined and verified their accounts.""

Billy McLaughlin, former White House director of digital content, defended the administration's decision to join Bluesky. “The rollout was seamless, the intro video landed perfectly, and the digital strategy remains one of the most sophisticated in modern politics,” McLaughlin says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Forget SEO. Welcome to the World of Generative Engine Optimization","https://www.wired.com/story/goodbye-seo-hello-geo-brandlight-openai/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

This holiday season, rather than searching on Google, more Americans will likely be turning to large language models to find gifts, deals, and sales. Retailers could see up to a 520 percent increase in traffic from chatbots and AI search engines this year compared to 2024, according to a recent shopping report from Adobe. OpenAI is already moving to capitalize on the trend: Last week, the ChatGPT maker announced a major partnership with Walmart that will allow users to buy goods directly within the chat window.

As people start relying on chatbots to discover new products, retailers are having to rethink their approach to online marketing. For decades, companies tried to game Google's search results by using strategies known collectively as search engine optimization, or SEO. Now, in order to get noticed by AI bots, more brands are turning to “generative engine optimization,” or GEO. The cottage industry is expected to be worth nearly $850 million this year, according to one market research estimate.

GEO, in many ways, is less a new invention than the next phase of SEO. Many GEO consultants, in fact, came from the world of SEO. At least some of their old strategies likely still apply since the core goal remains the same: anticipate the questions people will ask and make sure your content appears in the answers. But there's also growing evidence that chatbots are surfacing different kinds of information than search engines.

Imri Marcus, chief executive of the GEO firm Brandlight, estimates that there used to be about a 70 percent overlap between the top Google links and the sources cited by AI tools. Now, he says, that correlation has fallen below 20 percent.

Search engines often favor wordiness—think of the long blog posts that appear above recipes on cooking websites. But Marcus says that chatbots tend to favor information presented in simple, structured formats, like bulleted lists and FAQ pages. “An FAQ can answer a hundred different questions instead of one article that just says how great your entire brand is,” he says. “You essentially give a hundred different options for the AI engines to choose.”

The things people ask chatbots are often highly specific, so it's helpful for companies to publish extremely granular information. “No one goes to ChatGPT and asks, ‘Is General Motors a good company?'” says Marcus. Instead, they ask if the Chevy Silverado or the Chevy Blazer has a longer driving range. “Writing more specific content actually will drive much better results because the questions are way more specific.”

These insights are helping to refine the marketing strategies of Brandlight's clients, which include LG, Estée Lauder, and Aetna. “Models consume things differently,” says Brian Franz, chief technology, data and analytics officer at Estée Lauder Companies. “We want to make sure the product information, the authoritative sources that we use, are all the things that are feeding the model.” Asked whether he would ever consider partnering with OpenAI to let people shop Estée Lauder products within the chat window, Franz doesn't hesitate. “Absolutely,” he says.

At least for the time being, brands are mostly worried about consumer awareness, rather than directly converting chatbot mentions into sales. It's about making sure when people ask ChatGPT ""What should I put on my skin after a sunburn?"" their product pops up, even if it's unlikely anyone will immediately click and buy it. “Right now, in this really early learning stage where it feels like it's almost going to explode, I don't think we want to look at the ROI of a particular piece of content we created,” Franz says.

To create all of this new AI-optimized content, companies are, of course, turning to AI itself. “At the beginning, people speculated that AI engines will not be training on AI content,” Marcus says. “That's not really the case.”

Do you want an iPad Pro? Or do you want a MacBook? That's a line that has been increasingly blurring these past few years, and while the two machines still aren't on par—the M5 MacBook Pro's extra fans and higher clock speeds can deliver more oomph—the latest iteration of Apple's flagship tablet feels more capable than ever, thanks to drastic changes in iPadOS 26.

The changes are not massive when compared to an M4-powered iPad Pro. Heck, most of this tablet is largely the same as its predecessor. It still feels niche—the 13-inch model I'm typing on starts at $1,299, and that's without Apple's Magic Keyboard case, while the 11-inch is $999. Few will really need and appreciate the power gains of the M5 in the iPad Pro; most will be perfectly happy with the iPad Air. Still, if money is no object and you want the best slate that excels in every category, from entertainment to work, there's not much competition at this level.

iPads have had so much power, but the operating system felt hampered, so much so that it was hard to see it as a viable laptop replacement (I'm sure many folks have been able to replace their clamshells just fine). But iPadOS 26 brought a solution that makes these machines much more capable: windowed apps. This isn't a feature exclusive to the M5 iPad Pro, but it works the best on a big screen, and your only options there are the iPad Pro or iPad Air. I want to take a second to appreciate it.

You can fling apps to the sides for easy split-screen, resize apps to whatever shape or size, or just go completely full screen if you want. It feels more malleable to how you want to work, much like a desktop. I thought I'd miss Slide Over, where I can keep one app hovering over and to the side, but I didn't. (Good news, Apple is reintroducing Slide Over in iPadOS 26.1, so you can have the best of both.)

I have been working off this machine over the past few days, and I feel as though I've been able to work faster than I ever have before on an iPad. That's not specifically because of this tablet's performance, more so because it feels fluid to operate thanks to the interface changes. That's not to say there aren't any oddities. In WIRED's content management system in Safari, I still run into weird display issues, and every time I hop to another app and back, the cursor likes to move all the way to the top of the story, which is annoying.

However, the advanced Files app is nicer to use, being able to mark up PDFs in the Preview app is a god-send, and having the traffic lights on every app to quickly minimize them makes for a more natural experience. (I still have to get used to the Menu Bar being on the iPad, though.)

I worked predominantly on cellular with no issues. This is the first iPad to feature Apple's C1X modem, the same as what's on the iPhone Air, and my speed tests in midtown Manhattan were stellar. I wouldn't pay for a cellular plan myself, especially after dropping a wad of cash for this iPad Pro, but it is really nice being able to turn on the tablet in a coffee shop and not fuss with Wi-Fi because it's always connected. (Apple also has added its N1 networking chip here, for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread support.)

Battery life is strong as usual. I went through a full day of work on Friday and was left with around 39 percent by 4 pm, which gave me plenty of time to wind down and catch up on some shows before I had to think about plugging in.

The tandem OLED display is wonderfully bright, colorful, and sharp, with excellent blacks, and the speakers on this iPad are rich and loud. The webcam is sharp, and the thin and light design really feels great when you pop the slate off the Magic Keyboard and lounge in bed (though the 13-inch size can still be a bit unwieldy).

You're not going to notice a dramatic boost from the M4 iPad Pro, especially in general tasks. (No one should really be upgrading from last year's iPad Pro, anyway.) Still, I saw a nice lift in performance when comparing benchmark scores in Geekbench CPU, GPU, and Geekbench AI. I hopped into the Draw Things AI image generation app, and the M5 iPad Pro was able to generate images faster than the M4—sometimes in 7 seconds whereas the M4 iPad Pro took 13 seconds—but the 2024 iPad Pro is still no slouch.

I opened DaVinci Resolve and started editing some 4K footage and everything felt buttery smooth, but more important is the fact that thanks to iPadOS 26, you're able to complete rendering tasks in the background without needing to stay on the app. I hit the export and render button, swapped to another app, and … well, turns out DaVinci Resolve doesn't support this new feature just yet, so I had to keep the app open for the render to complete. You shouldn't have an issue on Final Cut Pro, though.

The most professional task I typically use with my iPad is editing RAW images in Adobe Lightroom, and, unsurprisingly, the M5 performed its duties with ease, even with my liberal use of Adobe's AI-erase tool. However, I also didn't really have much issue with this on the “weaker” iPad Air. What I find annoying is the fact that this powerful machine still only comes with one USB-C port. I can't plug it into my camera and edit photos and charge the tablet at the same time; you need a USB hub.

The iPad Pro is for a very specific type of person, and you probably know who you are. If you're mostly editing photos and typing up documents like me, the iPad Air is more than sufficient. But if you're regularly in apps like Final Cut Pro or generating all sorts of weird AI images, you may like the extra power the M5 iPad Pro provides—though you can certainly get by with the older M4 model and maybe save some cash.

But unlike the iPad Air, which is just affordable enough to exist as a nice complement to a MacBook for days you don't want the bulk of a laptop, the Pro feels more like a choice you have to make between clamshell and slate because of its high price. At present, I'd probably pick up the new M5 MacBook Pro instead, but with more desktop apps coming to iPad, I don't think you'll have to wait too long until the iPad Pro finally becomes the touchscreen Mac of your dreams.

I was blessed with a week of nearly perfect weather in Portland, Oregon, while testing the Oakley Meta Vanguard. It's strange to have been working at WIRED for so many years, testing electric bikes and fitness trackers, and finally be able to show you my beautiful city, where I've been running and biking for so long. I do have a GoPro, but when it comes to the multilayered process of testing and writing about a product, I tend to neglect the video part.

That's who the Vanguard are for—all the people who have spent the last 10 years or so fiddling with straps and different form factors to find the best and easiest-to-use action camera for outdoor sports. Now that the camera is on the bridge of your nose, you don't get the weird fisheye effect that you had with the side camera on the OG Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers. The Garmin integrations are also designed for fitness influencers. Anyone who posts Instagram Reels of their latest hike will love these.

As we reported when the glasses were announced, the Vanguard look basically like the ubiquitous wraparound Oakley Sphaera glasses. There are a few differences—most notably that the Vanguard weigh a significantly heavier 66 grams compared to around 30 grams for the Sphaera (and around 53 grams for the Oakley Meta HSTN). That's to be expected, considering that there's a camera and speakers on it, and I didn't find it uncomfortable to wear while riding.

It comes with three nose bridges to optimize your fit and prevent sliding, but I didn't end up having to swap it out. The lenses are not polarized, but they do have Oakley Prizm technology, which are a set of special dyes in the lens that purport to optimize contrast when you're outdoors and help you spot things like potholes or ice.

I did go to the river with the Vanguard and peer out at the water; I wasn't immediately blinded by glints. But the sunglasses are also only IP67 rated, so not as waterproof as a GoPro, and I wouldn't take them sailing or surfing. In fact, Meta states that they are not suitable for ""submersion or high-speed water sports,"" so keeping them on dry land is very much recommended.

My review sample featured the Prizm 24K lenses, which are best for sunny conditions, but they also come in Road (red), Black, and Sapphire. The lenses are also interchangeable, and new lenses are $85 apiece. (We have a more detailed description of which lenses are appropriate for which conditions in our guide to ski goggles.) The process is a little more harrowing than Oakley would have you believe (the lens doesn't pop out nearly as easily as on my ski goggles), but it does work.

The other standout feature (besides the camera) is Garmin and Strava integration. You'll need a specific Garmin watch (the Instinct 3 does not work; boo), and it has to be installed from both ends—that is, you'll need to both connect the watch in the Meta AI app and then install the Meta AI app from the Garmin ConnectIQ store on the watch. If you want to take hands-free calls, you'll also need to integrate your phone, WhatsApp, or Messenger into the Meta AI app.

Finally, the Vanguard has both voice control with the Meta AI assistant and button controls, with two buttons and a volume slider on the arm (positioned on the underside for anyone wearing a helmet). The glasses also have two over-ear speakers and a 5-mic array for calls.

The glasses charge in the case and have nine hours of battery life, which is more than enough for a full day of skiing or hiking (for me, anyway). The case comes with an additional 36 hours of battery life. After a week and a half of daily use, the case was at 6 percent but the glasses were still at 100 percent charge.

Smart helmets, open earbuds, and bone conduction headphones have shown that there's a real market for being able to listen to music and ambient noise while you're outside running or biking. The Vanguard have a pretty big advantage in that department because, you know, they're also sunglasses. That leaves me with one less device to prop on my ears (or as I like to call them, the coat hooks of my head).

You can integrate music apps like Apple Music into the Meta AI app so you can just tap the touchpad to play, but you can also just play over Bluetooth from your phone. The speakers on the Oakley Vanguard are 6 decibels louder than the Meta Wayfarers, and you can really tell. They sound amazing. On every other pair of open headphones I've tested, I have had to turn the volume all the way up to listen to podcasts or music while I'm biking. With the Vanguard, I had zero problems hearing Hayley Williamson's new album while riding over 20 miles per hour on a busy road with cars. (The volume slider is sensitive enough that stray hair or breezes can activate it though, which is a little annoying.)

Here's where it gets complicated: The video specs are not really comparable with that of a GoPro, or any other action camera for that matter. It's a 12-MP camera with 32 GB of memory and an ultrawide 122 degrees of view. Most action cameras have better sensors, two or three times as much memory, a much wider field of view (177 degrees, all the way up to 360!), and much longer recording times. But the thing is: This is a camera and sunglasses and headphones and it's on your face.

The most important thing with an action camera is that it's easy and convenient to use. I have spent some time trying to use straps or selfie sticks to put GoPros on my helmet or chest, and it's so incredibly annoying. Plus Go Pro Hero13 Black, I'mma let you finish, but you weigh 153 grams. As heavy as these glasses might seem compared to their regular versions, it's nothing compared with having a dongle strapped to your head or in the middle of your chest or on a selfie stick.

There are so many times when you're running and pass something beautiful. It's so easy to say, “Hey Meta, start taking video” and just get a quick clip as you happen to be zipping past. You can also customize the Action button to pick different filming modes, like slow motion or hyperlapse.

The Garmin integration is designed to address your social media needs. Yes, it syncs with Meta AI, allowing the glasses to tell you if you're hitting your target pace or HR zones—something I don't think you really need if you're already wearing a beeping, buzzing Garmin on your wrist. What you're really wearing the watch to do is to trigger the camera's auto-capture at key moments in your workout, so you can put together highlight reels and overlay your Garmin stats on top of it afterward.

That this is a device for social media fitness is also reflected in the fact that you're limited in your filming to 30-second, 1-minute, 3-minute, and 5-minute clips. Meta informs me that most people usually just keep it to 30-second video clips, all the better for TikToks and Reels. You can also set the clips to auto-import, so it's just in your Photos library when you think back to check and post on Instagram.

I'm private on Strava; I don't really need anyone to witness my leisurely 10-minute-mile trail runs. But every running influencer who is filming “Mile 1!” all the way through “Mile 26.2!” of their latest marathon is going to love these.

Outside of the fitness stuff, I do think the Meta AI assistant is kind of fun. I have a few friends who can identify plants and animals as we're hiking, and Meta AI can do that on a basic level, even if it's not up to pinpointing specific varietals. I think it's a bit of a superpower to be able to identify if you're not sure if those flowers are zinnias or dahlias as you pass. Nota bene: I would not ask Meta AI or any other chatbot super personal questions. I would also go into Settings, Data & Privacy, and Remove All Public Vibes (ew!), because I find everything about Meta AI as a social media platform to be (double ew!) gross, but that's just me.

With that all switched off, I ride hard for these glasses. If you like outdoor sports, these aren't even particularly expensive. A regular pair of decent cycling sunglasses or ski goggles that protect your eyes and face in adverse conditions will run you up well into three figures (the standard Sphaera, for example, cost $244). And that's without all the other features that these offer.

Even just being able to grab your sunglasses and tap the frame to start playing music when you start your run or jump on your bike is a game changer. I can actually hear my podcasts when I'm biking at speed, which is something you can't really do even with the Oakley Meta HSTNs.

I'm looking forward to being able to take the Vanguard sunglasses snowboarding this season. All the times when your friend has demanded that you film her doing this or that to check her form—now I can just click a button or use a voice command, instead of digging through my pocket for a phone that I am terrified to drop off a lift! Whatever your disagreements with Meta as a company, it was a masterful insight to realize that there are real problems to be solved for a specific community. All smart glasses should be glasses that you'd already wear.

As Hall effect keyboards improve, they inch closer toward custom-built mechanical keyboards: Metal cases, gasket-mounting, and acoustic engineering are becoming far more common, even in relatively affordable options. Now, cosmetic details like badges, weights, and engravings are appearing in mass-produced Hall effect keyboards.

All of these details not only make a keyboard feel better to use, but also make it a statement piece on your desk. Much like how mechanical keyboards are not only functional, but personal and expressive, the same extends to Hall effect keyboards. The $140 Luminkey Magger68 Plus HE is a Hall effect keyboard with a 65% layout, an aluminum case, and a gasket-mount assembly. It uses Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro linear switches, and it finds a great middle ground: Stylish without being too much, and high-performance without being clinical.

The typing experience of this keyboard is crisp and poppy without being excessive—the switches are smooth to press, with relatively-light springs requiring 36 grams of force to press fully (compared to a Cherry MX Red's 50-gram springs) and a 3.5-millimeter travel distance (just a bit shorter than the standard 4.0 mm).

The switches snap back quickly after being pressed, and have a satisfying, full sound when typing that I find preferable to the lighter, more “thin” sound of most Hall effect keyboards. The sound is fairly deep and slightly marbly, with a good amount of midrange and no extraneous clicks, crunches, or rattles. It is slightly muted but not enough to be considered “silent” by any means.

The plate-mount stabilizers here come lubed and tuned from the factory. This means they don't rattle or stick, nor do they have any other issues that draw attention. Like any well-tuned stabilizer, they're easily forgotten about. While plate-mount stabilizers aren't the best option for a keyboard (PCB-mounting offers more stability), these are still more than functional.

Sound improvements come from the keyboard's gasket-mount assembly and extensive use of silicone sound-dampening. This provides a good amount of vibration dampening and some bounce without being overly flexible. There is still some bounce when typing, but the gaskets are stiff enough (when combined with the aluminum plate) that pressing down on any of the keys only creates a minor amount of movement. For a Hall effect keyboard with precise and customizable switches, this level of stiffness is an optimal middle-ground between comfort and performance: It keeps key-presses consistent while still creating an enjoyable user experience.

The keycaps are largely made from PBT plastic with reverse dye-sublimation printing. The print is crisp and has a consistent color across the top surface, although a few of the characters have strange proportions. The PBT keycaps have a matte finish on top, which is smooth without being slick. These keycaps are seemingly-identical to the standard Cherry profile that most keyboards sport today, a shape that's comfortable and familiar. In the top left and bottom right corners, the keyboard uses glossy ABS keycaps with UV printing on top. While these may look purely cosmetic, I found them practical as well: The smooth texture makes it easy to find the Escape or Arrow keys without needing to look down.

The largest issue this keyboard has is the software: The Magger68 uses Luminkey's in-browser customization software, Luminkey.club, which functions wonderfully—customizations are easy, extensive, and instantaneous. However, the software isn't translated very well. A lot of the wording, which describes technical aspects of keyboard functionality, reads in a way that's clunky and hard to follow. This isn't a major issue if you're experienced with Hall effect keyboards, but if you're new to the hobby or trying to learn, it can make these settings harder to figure out.

Once the settings are properly adjusted, though, this keyboard performs incredibly well. The actuation distance of each switch can be manually adjusted, meaning it can register a key-press anywhere from the very top of the key-press to the very bottom, and multiple inputs can even be mapped at different distances. The keyboard is responsive, with an 8,000-Hz polling rate, and the low latency barely produces any significant input lag.

This keyboard is wired-only, which might be a dealbreaker for some. It's a fairly dense, all-metal keyboard that has a significant focus on high-speed use, none of which is necessary for a portable keyboard. While wireless would be nice, it would increase the price of this keyboard and its complexity.

The RGB lighting has over 20 built-in presets, and all of them work well, but the color isn't perfect. When adjusting the lighting settings, nearly all of them seem to skew heavily toward a cyan/blue tint. This is presumably because of the Magnetic Jade switches' light blue housing, which is unavoidable without using different switches, but even without switches, the LED diodes seem to be slightly cooler than a true neutral white.

These effects combine to make a keyboard that struggles to have a pure white color even with serious tweaking, especially since the RGB adjustments easily get overwhelmed and start to lag when moving your cursor around on the color wheel. The closest I could get to a pure white was with an RGB setting of [255, 60, 90], which still had a slightly cool tint to it. When set to the “breathe” setting at a low speed with this color, the lighting was choppy as it faded out, and slowly shifted to be red as it became darker instead of maintaining the preset color. When set to a faster speed and using a more standard color setting (like solid blue or green), these quirks disappeared.

The internal assembly is rather simple: The printed circuit board (PCB) and switch plate are screwed together, sandwiching a sheet of silicone between them. This silicone fills the empty space between the plate and PCB, and extends past on the outside edge to create gaskets that the two halves of the case hold in place. With this, the internal assembly is held in place without making direct contact with the outside case, reducing vibration and excess noise.

The keyboard only has one PCB, with a USB-C port directly attached to the main assembly. I would have preferred a separate daughterboard to contain the USB-C port, since it allows for lower placement of the port and avoids the potential stress of flexing, but this isn't a huge issue on a stiffer keyboard like this one.

With off-the-shelf switches that can be replaced without any soldering, and straightforward disassembly, this keyboard is easy for the average person to repair. The case can be taken apart entirely with eight screws, none of which are hidden, and the PCB and plate can be separated with just a few more.

Like most Hall effect keyboards, there is one issue with the switches. Because there are multiple standards that exist for Hall effect switches, none of which are very well-documented, it can be difficult to find aftermarket options that work with your keyboard. From my testing, the Magger68 uses the same type of HE switches as Wooting's newer models, the KS-20 style, which is the most popular type of magnetic switch. However, these are not cross-compatible with Keychron's double-rail Nebula switches, or with older HE switches. This can present issues with customization, since nearly every type of HE switch uses the same Cherry MX-style design.

Compared to other Hall effect keyboards, the Magger68 Plus has one key advantage: The user experience is incredibly refined. Typing feels great and has a full, deep sound. The switches are responsive and snappy. Disassembly and customization is easy. Overall, it's a well-built keyboard. As long as you're willing to contend with a less-than-perfect software.

New research by NewsGuard has revealed that the latest version of OpenAI's video creation tool Sora 2 can be prompted to advance false or misleading information 80% of the time.

NewsGuard, which rates the credibility of news and information websites, maintained that its findings demonstrate the ease with which bad actors can weaponize the powerful new technology to spread false information at scale. Five of the 20 false claims Sora generated originated with Russian disinformation operations, it added.

The researchers noted that within minutes of accessing Sora 2 they had it producing false or misleading videos related to major news, including videos showing a Moldovan election official destroying pro-Russian ballots, a toddler detained by U.S. immigration officers, and a Coca-Cola spokesperson announcing that the company would not sponsor the Super Bowl because of Bad Bunny's selection as the halftime headline act.

NewsGuard also asserted that its findings demonstrate how, with minimal effort and no technical expertise, bad actors, including health-hoax peddlers, authoritarian regimes engaged in hostile information operations, and political misinformers, can easily use this technology to make false claims more convincing.

OpenAI cautioned users about the risks of Sora 2 on a “system card” at its website. “Sora 2's advanced capabilities require consideration of new potential risks, including nonconsensual use of likeness or misleading generations,” it wrote. “To address these, we worked with internal red teamers to identify new challenges and inform corresponding mitigations.”

“We're taking an iterative approach to safety, focusing on areas where context is especially important or where risks are still emerging and are not fully understood,” it noted.

“Our iterative deployment includes rolling out initial access to Sora 2 via limited invitations, restricting the use of image uploads that feature a photorealistic person and all video uploads, and placing stringent safeguards and moderation thresholds on content involving minors,” it continued.

“We'll continue to learn from how people use Sora 2 and refine the system to balance safety while maximizing creative potential,” it added.

OpenAI explained that the new model introduces capabilities that have been difficult for prior video models to achieve, such as more accurate physics, sharper realism, synchronized audio, enhanced steerability and an expanded stylistic range.

The model follows user direction with high fidelity, it added, enabling the creation of videos that are both imaginative and grounded in real-world dynamics.

Michelle A. Amazeen, an associate professor of Mass Communication at Boston University, found NewsGuard's research “deeply concerning.”

“Just when media consumers were already navigating a complex and often confusing information landscape, AI-generated content like Sora 2's videos further muddies the waters by producing highly convincing false claims,” she told TechNewsWorld. “This only intensifies the challenge of discerning truth from misinformation in today's digital age.”

Scott Ellis, director of brand and creative at Daon, a biometric identity assurance and authentication solutions company in Fairfax, Va., asserted that Sora is effectively a deepfake tool. “Deepfake tools generally have three uses: personal entertainment, professional entertainment and malicious activity,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The fact that the tool fails to prevent malicious activity 80% of the time is a giant red flag.”

“An 80% success rate in producing convincing falsehoods is a striking benchmark of potential misuse of the AI model,” added Arif Mamedov, CEO of Regula Forensics, a global developer of forensic devices and identity verification solutions.

“We're no longer talking about fringe deepfake hobbyists,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We're talking about industrial-scale misinformation pipelines that can be created by anyone with a prompt.”

Dan Kennedy, a professor of journalism at Northeastern University, in Boston, was unsurprised by NewsGuard's findings. “All I can think of in reading the results of NewsGuard's test is: Why would anyone be surprised?” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Generating fake videos, after all, is Sora 2's purpose,” he said. “And skilled — and sometimes even not-so-skilled — users are always able to get around safeguards aimed at ensuring, for instance, that public figures can't be depicted, or that fake videos will be properly labeled.”

“We've been living with such videos for quite some time, including crude efforts like that footage of Nancy Pelosi slowed down to make her sound like she was drunk,” he added. “The significance of Sora 2 is that now such deceptive content can be produced by anyone in a matter of minutes at high enough quality that viewers have no way of knowing that it's not real.”

In an article titled “Launching Sora Responsibly,” OpenAI explained that every video generated with Sora includes both visible and invisible provenance signals. All outputs carry a visible watermark and all videos also embed C2PA metadata, an industry-standard signature. It also noted that it maintains internal reverse-image and audio search tools that can trace videos back to Sora with high accuracy.

However, NewsGuard's researchers found the Sora watermark could easily be removed from the videos it creates. The “Sora” watermark that is present on all videos can be removed using free online tools, they wrote.

“NewsGuard tested one free tool, developed by BasedLabs AI, and found that it successfully removed the watermark from an uploaded Sora video in approximately four minutes, allowing users to download a non-watermarked version of the same video,” they explained. “While the altered videos displayed minor irregularities, such as blurring where the watermark was originally located, they could appear authentic to an unsuspecting viewer.”

Watermarks can help at first, but they're far from a perfect fix, observed Jason Crawforth, founder and CEO of Swear, a digital media authentication company, in Boise, Idaho. “As AI becomes more advanced at editing and manipulating digital media, even sophisticated watermarks can often be detected and removed, reducing their value as a safeguard,” he told TechNewsWorld. “At best, they serve as a short-term deterrent rather than a reliable barrier.”

“Watermarks help only at the margins,” said Jason Soroko, a senior fellow with Sectigo, a global digital certificate provider. “If they live in pixels they can be weakened by simple edits like crops, resizes or reencodes, and if they live in metadata they vanish when platforms strip tags.”

“The sturdier approach is provenance that travels with the asset, such as digitally signed content credentials at creation and edit, plus platform side checks and clear labeling,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Even then, provenance shows origin not truth, so layered defenses are needed.”

The real issue is that companies built these systems on unauthorized training data without consent mechanisms, contended Jordan Mitchell, founder of Growth Stack Media, a content and communications agency, in Raleigh, N.C. “We need increased adoption of blockchain-based content authentication because it creates immutable records of content origin and ownership that are far more difficult to alter,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Blockchain could provide the transparency needed in an AI-dominated creative landscape, similar to how NFTs help creators establish verifiable ownership of digital works,” he said.

Sora declined to create videos for four false claims fed to it by the NewsGuard researchers: Tylenol used for circumcisions is proven to cause autism, a South Korean study proved Covid-19 vaccines increase the risk of developing cancer, the National Guard pepper sprayed left-leaning protesters and Israel orchestrated an October 2025 U.K. synagogue attack to gain sympathy. “It is not clear why Sora generated some videos and not others,” the researchers wrote.

“The inconsistency is more dangerous than blanket refusal would be,” maintained Growth Stack's Mitchell. “It suggests Sora operates on surface-level pattern matching rather than principled safety architecture.”

“If users can't predict what the system will refuse, they'll keep experimenting until they find prompts that work,” he said. “This unpredictability creates a trial-and-error environment where determined bad actors eventually discover exploitable gaps in the system's defenses.”

“Large models are probabilistic and context sensitive, so refusals can flip with small changes in phrasing or history,” explained Sectigo's Soroko. “That unpredictability weakens user comprehension of the rules and invites prompt roulette, which increases the attack surface.”

Swear's Crawforth argued that inconsistency in what Sora generates erodes trust in the technology. “If users can't understand why one request is blocked while another nearly identical request is allowed, it creates uncertainty about whether the system is actually protecting against harm or simply behaving unpredictably,” he said. “This lack of transparency makes it difficult for the public, regulators and even businesses to rely on the system as a trustworthy solution.”

“The bigger issue is that gaps like this leave room for bad actors to exploit loopholes,” he added. “For AI tools to be credible and safe, the reasoning behind refusals needs to be consistent. Otherwise, companies risk creating an environment where harmful misinformation can slip through and where trust in digital content is weakened even further.”

Nine years ago, Clara Sekowski was part of the engineering team at Planetary Resources, a Seattle-area startup that planned to mine precious metals on asteroids. Six years ago, she joined other veterans from Planetary Resources at First Mode, another trailblazing startup that focused on clean energy for industrial applications. Now she's the CEO of Special Teams, a consulting firm founded with fellow engineers from First Mode.

“Third time's the charm, right?” she says.

Both of those earlier startups attracted high-profile backers for their ambitious plans, only to face setbacks as reality set in. Special Teams is starting smaller, but it's gaining traction: The bootstrapped venture and its team of just over 10 engineers recently moved into a 7,400-square-foot office and workshop facility in Seattle's SoDo neighborhood — and it's already exceeding its revenue target.

“In our first year, we're almost at $2 million, which is above and beyond a goal we had set for Year One,” she told GeekWire.

The Special Teams roster includes engineers with experience in aerospace, software development, and even the gaming industry.

“We use systems engineering to bridge the gap between innovation on paper and operational deployment,” Sekowski said. “We design and build prototypes and custom simulations to prove that concepts can work in real-world conditions.”

Special Teams' to-do list includes helping BHP lay the groundwork for deep-mining automation; working on a confidential nuclear project; and advising Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus, a high-performance car company, on its plan to create a hydrogen-powered pickup truck.

“I have worked for decades with top engineering and design companies around the world … on highly complex and challenging projects,” Jesse Glickenhaus, Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus' CEO, said in an emailed statement. “SpecTeams is by far the most incredible team I have worked with when doing something new and technologically challenging needs to be paired with significant safety and environmental concerns.”

Sekowski and her teammates have had to deal with their share of technological challenges over the past decade. Redmond, Wash.-based Planetary Resources initially planned to build a fleet of spacecraft to seek out and mine asteroids, and then widened its focus to include Earth observation as well. But funding eventually ran out, and by the end of 2018, Planetary Resources was history.

Some of the engineers who left Planetary Resources started up First Mode. Initially, the engineering consulting firm played a supporting role in a variety of space projects, including NASA's Artemis moon program and the Perseverance rover mission on Mars.

As time went on, First Mode tightened its focus to concentrate on clean-tech power systems. It established a proving ground for those systems at a former coal mine in Centralia, Wash. Then, in 2023, the Anglo American mining conglomerate took a majority interest in First Mode and accelerated its drive to develop hydrogen-fueled and hybrid powertrains for heavy trucks.

Last year, First Mode opened a 40,000-square-foot factory in the SoDo district — but the company also had to trim back its workforce to adjust to the market demand for clean tech. Months after the factory opened, Anglo American cut off funding for First Mode, setting the stage for a bankruptcy filing and an asset acquisition deal with Cummins, an Indiana-based power solutions company.

Molly Puga, First Mode's general manager, said the company is continuing to pursue its decarbonization mission as part of the Cummins Power Systems global network.

“Since the acquisition of First Mode, Cummins has been hard at work bringing hybrid solutions for mining to reality,” Puga said in an emailed statement. “We have announced a partnership with Komatsu to scale our hybrid solution, received a grant from TransAlta to support operations at our proving grounds in Centralia, and have shipped product to South America to be commissioned at a mine in the next several months. First Mode continues to employ about 70 employees globally, with the majority of them based in Seattle.”

Special Teams has also been hard at work at its new SoDo facility.

“We are excited to be in the space that we have. It's a great mix of space where we can build hardware and have a forklift and move around and make noise, and office space where we can get the rest of our work done,” Sekowski said. “SoDo is a great spot for that, because this is really the only area where you can have hybrid spaces. We are going to be here until our hardware doesn't fit in the building anymore.”

Special Teams isn't the only startup founded by First Mode alumni: Last year, former CEO Chris Voorhees and former chief operating officer Rhae Adams established a think tank called Sol Zero Group to support new engineering ventures — including Special Teams.

Civic Forge, which advises businesses on government affairs and public policy strategies, is another venture in Sol Zero's family of companies. It was founded last year by Conor Duggan, First Mode's former director of government affairs; and Adam Day, who previously served as First Mode's senior government affairs manager.

This year, Duggan took on a new role at a clean-tech startup called Vaulted Deep, and Day took charge as Civic Forge's CEO.

“Civic Forge works alongside Special Teams when a challenge has both policy and technical dimensions,” Day told GeekWire via email. “Together, we pair engineering with policy, which helps clients de-risk designs, win public support and hit milestones faster. Our combined goal is simple: Help organizations move faster across dimensions so they can focus on building.”

Sekowski said that she gets “so much joy” from seeing former colleagues do well, at First Mode and at new ventures. “I think that's part of the legacy,” she said. “It's not just Special Teams, but it's all of us, taking what we learned there and putting it into the next things that we do.”

She's grateful for the experience she gained at First Mode. “Some of the things I learned at First Mode are important to us here as well,” she said. “Doing work in a broad domain, not just in space, but across energy and other industries, helps us do better work. And so that's something that we'll continue.”

Sekowski is even grateful for the setbacks she and her teammates encountered along the way. “I learned so much through the process of being a part of Planetary Resources, and then what was a strong correction to some of the funding issues there with First Mode, and now getting to put some of those lessons together to build this team,” she said. “You don't get a lot of chances to grow in that way. … We've got the battle scars. We know where we want to go, what we don't want to do, and how to get there.”

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

by Taylor Soper on Oct 21, 2025 at 8:48 amOctober 21, 2025 at 9:00 am

Amazon's e-commerce customers are experiencing unusual delivery delays following the Amazon Web Services outage on Monday — suggesting that the cloud glitch has impacted the company's own operations more than than previously reported.

Customers posting on Reddit and X reported Amazon orders that were scheduled for Monday delivery but did not arrive. Some of the comments:

Amazon workers posting on the “r/AmazonFC” Reddit community cited downtime at fulfillment centers. 

We reached out to Amazon for details about delayed deliveries. 

Amazon's package fulfillment systems run atop AWS infrastructure — so disruptions in key AWS services can ripple directly into its retail and logistics network.

Amazon's logistics arm processes about 17.2 million delivery orders per day, according to Capital One.

The fallout from delayed deliveries could lead to increased costs due to potential refund obligations and additional labor needs.

The outage started shortly after midnight Monday and lasted for about three hours, but the aftershock effects were felt by Amazon's cloud customers for much of the day. The company blamed a DNS resolution issue with its DynamoDB service in US-EAST-1 region, it oldest and largest digital hub. Major outages originating from this same region also caused widespread disruptions in 2017, 2021, and 2023.

The outage impacted everything from sites including Facebook, Coinbase, and Ticketmaster, to check-in kiosks at LaGuardia Airport. Amazon's own retail site, its Prime Video streaming service, and its Ring subsidiary were also affected.

Despite the major outage, Amazon's stock was up Monday and in early Tuesday trading.

Veeam Software, the data backup and recovery company that recently moved its headquarters to the Seattle area, announced plans to acquire Securiti AI for $1.725 billion.

Securiti AI, based in San Jose, Calif., helps enterprises manage data security posture, privacy, and compliance across cloud and software platforms. The deal aims to integrate Securiti's Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and “AI trust” technologies with Veeam's core data resilience tools, giving companies a single platform to manage, secure, and recover their data while safely deploying artificial intelligence systems.

“We've entered a new era for data. It's no longer about just protecting data from cyber threats and unforeseen disasters; it's also about identifying all your data, ensuring it's governed and trusted to power AI transparently,” Veeam CEO Anand Eswaran said in a statement. 

Rehan Jalil, Securiti's CEO and a cybersecurity entrepreneur, will join Veeam as president of security and AI once the deal closes, expected in the fourth quarter.

Securiti, founded in 2019, raised a $75 million Series C round in 2022.

Veeam, which reached a $15 billion valuation earlier this year, relocated its headquarters from Columbus, Ohio, to the Seattle area in 2024, citing the region's deep technical talent pool. The company employs about 6,000 people globally and protects data for more than 550,000 customers, including two-thirds of the Global 2000.

Veeam moved its headquarters from Switzerland to the U.S. following its March 2020 acquisition by private equity firm Insight Partners — a deal that valued the company at $5 billion at the time.

Veeam CEO Anand Eswaran, who joined the company in December 2021, previously worked in the Seattle area as the corporate vice president of Microsoft Enterprise. He was most recently president at RingCentral.

General Motors is abandoning its BrightDrop electric delivery vans, just four years after introducing the vehicles.

The company announced Tuesday alongside third-quarter earnings that it made the decision because the “commercial electric delivery van market developed much slower than expected.” GM also blames the “changing regulatory environment and the elimination of tax credits in the United States” — the result of the second Trump administration's hostility toward EVs.

BrightDrop production has been suspended at GM's CAMI Assembly facility in Ontario, Canada since May, when the company also cut 500 jobs. GM said Tuesday that it needs to have “meaningful discussions” with government leaders in Canada about “opportunities” for the plant. In the meantime, GM told TechCrunch that BrightDrop dealers will “continue to sell and service vehicles as we work through remaining inventory.”

The decision to kill off BrightDrop comes at an odd moment for electric vehicles in the United States. Companies like GM set new EV sales records in the third quarter, though that enthusiasm was driven in part by the expiration of the federal tax credit, which Republicans in Congress decided to end.

Meanwhile, major automakers like GM have spent much of the last year walking back once-lofty promises about how many EVs they plan to make and sell in the coming years. GM, which once pledged to have a fully-electric fleet by 2035, boasted on Tuesday that it is “well positioned to meet strong, sustained demand” for internal combustion vehicles. (Investors have rewarded that decision. GM's stock price is up 14% at the time of publish.)

BrightDrop's short existence has been chaotic. GM revealed the program as a pseudo-startup in 2021. The automaker created BrightDrop in its “Global Innovation” organization (which is where OnStar was built) and spun it out as a privately-held company.

BrightDrop launched at the Consumer Electronics Show that year. The automaker touted a lower total cost of ownership and less frequent maintenance as advantages over its internal combustion counterparts. BrightDrop vans seemed poised to quickly take advantage of the fact that major companies like FedEx were pushing to go carbon-neutral and emissions-free. BrightDrop also came into existence at a time when the pandemic was fueling a huge e-commerce surge, upping the need for delivery vans.

Just two years later, GM absorbed BrightDrop into its overall fleet business, GM Envolve. The unit's CEO, Travis Katz, stepped down. Some of the vans started catching fire, sparking a recall in early 2024. Then GM moved BrightDrop again, this time to within Chevrolet's commercial division. The automaker continued to struggle to sell BrightDrop vans this year, barely topping 1,500 sold in the first half.

It's unclear why, exactly, GM struggled so mightily to sell its BrightDrop vans. And while there were plenty of indicators the unit was struggling, the decision appears to have come somewhat abruptly. Earlier this month, GM Envolve vice president Ian Hucker was touting BrightDrop's vans in a press release about a partnership with delivery driver organization Frontdoor Collective and infrastructure company Circuit EV. That partnership is supposed to provide 50 BrightDrop vans for Target to use in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

GM isn't alone; Sales of Ford's E-Transit van are well below where they were in 2024. But Rivian has put more than 25,000 electric vans on the road with Amazon over the last few years. And Los Angeles-based startup Harbinger has sold more than 200 of its electric truck chassis since starting production in April. On Tuesday morning, Harbinger also announced it is expanding sales to Canada.

YouTube revealed on Tuesday that its likeness detection technology has officially rolled out to eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program, following a pilot phase. The technology allows creators to request the removal of AI-generated content that uses their likeness.

This is the first wave of the rollout, a YouTube spokesperson informed TechCrunch, adding that eligible creators received emails this morning.

YouTube's detection technology identifies and manages AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. 

The technology is designed to prevent people from having their likeness misused, whether for endorsing products and services they have not agreed to support or for spreading misinformation. There have been plenty of examples of AI likeness misuse in recent years, such as the company Elecrow using an AI clone of YouTuber Jeff Geerling's voice to promote its products.

On its Creator Insider channel, the company provided instructions on how creators can use the technology. To begin the onboarding process, creators need to go to the “Likeness” tab, consent to data processing, and use their smartphone to scan a QR code displayed on the screen, which will direct them to a web page for identity verification. This process requires a photo ID and a brief selfie video.

Once YouTube grants access to use the tool, creators can view all detected videos and submit a removal request according to YouTube's privacy guidelines, or they can make a copyright request. There is also an option to archive the video.

Creators can opt out of using the technology at any time, and YouTube will stop scanning for videos 24 hours after they do so.

Likeness detection technology has been in pilot mode since earlier this year. YouTube first announced last year that it had partnered with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to help celebrities, athletes, and creators identify content on the platform that uses their AI-generated likeness.

In April, YouTube expressed its backing for the legislation referred to as the NO FAKES ACT, which seeks to address the issue of AI-generated replicas that imitate a person's image or voice to deceive others and generate harmful content.

Some startups pride themselves on having prestigious financial backers — but just as important is having prestigious customers.

It's one of the main points of pride for Serval, an enterprise AI company that announced a $47 million Series A round on Tuesday. The round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with participation from heavy hitting venture firms like First Round, General Catalyst, and Box Group. But even more impressive than the funders is the company's list of clients, which include major AI players like Perplexity, Mercor, and Together AI.

In broad strokes, Serval is using agentic AI models to automate IT service management, but the company has a unique approach that takes advantage of agentic AI's powers while avoiding many of its pitfalls. One agent is used to code internal automations for everyday tasks, like authorizing software or provisioning a device. The founders see it as a kind of vibe-coding tool, overseen by an IT manager, but doing most of the work on its own. A separate help desk agent responds to user requests by calling those tools on command, following rules established by the tool.

Serval CEO Jake Stauch says the key was to make the process of building a tool as simple as possible. 

“We don't want them to feel the marginal cost of building these automations,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “We want to make it easier to automate something forever than do it manually once.”

Splitting the task into two agents — one to build tools and one to use them — also gives managers a way to keep an eye on permissions. When an automation is created, the manager will set rules for when it can be used, which provides an extra line of defense against overeager help desk agents.

Enterprise clients are keenly aware of the risks of a rogue AI system, which is part of why Serval decided against a single all-purpose Help Desk Agent. 

“You don't want someone to go into Slack and say, hey, I want to delete all the data at the company, and the very helpful AI agent responds, ‘Great, I'll delete all the data,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “Instead it will say, ‘hey, I don't have a tool for deleting all the data the company. But I do have a tool for resetting your password or doing one of these other tasks.”

Because the tools themselves are deterministic, they can include extremely complex permissions, like only allowing certain actions after a certain multi-factor authentication process or within a certain time frame. And any time those rules need to be changed, there's an AI agent at the ready to dive into the codebase and change it.

It's a new approach to the very common problem of how to oversee agentic AI systems. “You want to have full visibility and control into what that AI agent is doing,” says Stauch. “And you do that by using Serval to build those tools and customize the permissions and approvals behind them.”

Earlier this year, a developer was shocked by a message that appeared on his personal phone: “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone.”  

“I was panicking,” Jay Gibson, who asked that we don't use his real name over fears of retaliation, told TechCrunch.  

Gibson, who until recently built surveillance technologies for Western government hacking tools maker Trenchant, may be the first documented case of someone who builds exploits and spyware being themselves targeted with spyware. 

“What the hell is going on? I really didn't know what to think of it,” said Gibson, adding that he turned off his phone and put it away on that day, March 5. “I went immediately to buy a new phone. I called my dad. It was a mess. It was a huge mess.”  

At Trenchant, Gibson worked on developing iOS zero-days, meaning finding vulnerabilities and developing tools capable of exploiting them that are not known to the vendor who makes the affected hardware or software, such as Apple.  

“I have mixed feelings of how pathetic this is, and then extreme fear because once things hit this level, you never know what's going to happen,” he told TechCrunch.  

But the ex-Trenchant employee may not be the only exploit developer targeted with spyware. According to three sources who have direct knowledge of these cases, there have been other spyware and exploit developers in the last few months who have received notifications from Apple alerting them that they were targeted with spyware. 

Apple did not respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch.

The targeting of Gibson's iPhone shows that the proliferation of zero-days and spyware is starting to ensnare more types of victims.  

Spyware and zero-day makers have historically claimed their tools are only deployed by vetted government customers against criminals and terrorists. But for the past decade, researchers at the University of Toronto's digital rights group Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and other organizations, have found dozens of cases where governments used these tools to target dissidents, journalists, human rights defenders, and political rivals all over the world.   

The closest public cases of security researchers being targeted by hackers happened in 2021 and 2023, when North Korean government hackers were caught targeting security researchers working in vulnerability research and development. 

Two days after receiving the Apple threat notification, Gibson contacted a forensic expert with extensive experience investigating spyware attacks. After performing an initial analysis of Gibson's phone, the expert did not find any signs of infection, but still recommended a deeper forensic analysis of the exploit developer's phone.  

A forensic analysis would have entailed sending the expert a complete backup of the device, something Gibson said he was not comfortable with.  

“Recent cases are getting tougher forensically, and some we find nothing on. It may also be that the attack was not actually fully sent after the initial stages, we don't know,” the expert told TechCrunch. 

Without a full forensic analysis of Gibson's phone, ideally one where investigators found traces of the spyware and who made it, it's impossible to know why he was targeted or who targeted him.  

But Gibson told TechCrunch that he believes the threat notification he received from Apple is connected to the circumstances of his departure from Trenchant, where he claims that the company designated him as a scapegoat for a damaging leak of internal tools.  

Apple sends out threat notifications specifically for when it has evidence that a person was targeted by a mercenary spyware attack. This kind of surveillance technology is often invisibly and remotely planted on someone's phone without their knowledge by exploiting vulnerabilities in the phone's software, exploits that can be worth millions of dollars and can take months to develop. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies typically have the legal authority to deploy spyware on targets, not the spyware makers themselves. 

Sara Banda, a spokesperson for Trenchant's parent company L3Harris, declined to comment for this story when reached by TechCrunch before publication.  

A month before he received Apple's threat notification, when Gibson was still working at Trenchant, he said he was invited to go to the company's London office for a team-building event.  

When Gibson arrived February 3, he was immediately summoned into a meeting room to speak via video call with Peter Williams, Trenchant's then-general manager who was known inside the company as “Doogie.” (In 2018, defense contractor L3Harris acquired zero-day makers Azimuth and Linchpin Labs, two sister startups that merged to become Trenchant.) 

Williams told Gibson the company suspected he was double employed and was thus suspending him. All of Gibson's work devices would be confiscated and analyzed as part of an internal investigation into the allegations. Williams could not be reached for comment. 

“I was in shock. I didn't really know how to react because I couldn't really believe what I was hearing,” said Gibson, who explained that a Trenchant IT employee then went to his apartment to pick up his company-issued equipment.  

Around two weeks later, Gibson said Williams called and told him that following the investigation, the company was firing him and offering him a settlement agreement and payment. Gibson said Williams declined to explain what the forensic analysis of his devices had found, and essentially told him he had no choice but to sign the agreement and depart the company. 

Feeling like he had no alternative, Gibson said he went along with the offer and signed.  

Gibson told TechCrunch he later heard from former colleagues that Trenchant suspected he had leaked some unknown vulnerabilities in Google's Chrome browser, tools that Trenchant had developed. Gibson, and three former colleagues of his, however, told TechCrunch he did not have access to Trenchant's Chrome zero-days, given that he was part of the team exclusively developing iOS zero-days and spyware. Trenchant teams only have strictly compartmentalized access to tools related to the platforms they are working on, the people said.  

“I know I was a scapegoat. I wasn't guilty. It's very simple,” said Gibson. “I didn't do absolutely anything other than working my ass off for them.”  

The story of the accusations against Gibson' and his subsequent suspension and firing was independently corroborated by three former Trenchant employees with knowledge.  

Two of the other former Trenchant employees said they knew details of Gibson's London trip and were aware of suspected leaks of sensitive company tools. 

All of them asked not to be named but believe Trenchant got it wrong.

Meta on Tuesday introduced new scam detection features for its messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger, as part of its broader initiative to crack down on online scams that target older people. The company said it will begin to show warnings in WhatsApp when users try to share their screen during calls, and it will flag possible scam messages in Messenger, which can be sent to AI for review.

The tech giant said it's detected and disrupted about 8 million accounts engaging in scam operations during the first half of 2025, including those associated with scam centers in areas like Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Philippines. It also took action on over 21,000 Facebook Pages and accounts that were pretending to be customer support operations that were attempting to trick people into sharing their information. 

The latter is so prevalent on the platform that many Page operators essentially know to ignore anything that claims to be a customer support message.  Meanwhile, scam syndicates target older adults across a number of industries, including not only social media, but also messaging apps, dating apps, crypto, and others. 

On WhatsApp, the company will now display a warning when you try to share your screen with an unknown contact during a video call. This technique is often used to trick victims into giving away sensitive information like bank details and verification codes, Meta says. 

Meanwhile, on Messenger, the company is testing more advanced scam detection techniques to analyze whether an inbound message is suspicious. If so, it flags that signs of a scam have been detected and warns you to “be cautious, you could be at risk of losing money.”

The screen also lists a variety of common scam techniques, like those involving work-from-home jobs or offers to make easy cash, and will suggest either blocking or reporting the suspicious account. 

My own family member has been a victim of these types of scams, and it's fair to say these problems can have broader impacts beyond those affecting the individual being taken advantage of. Families often have to get involved, which embarrasses the victim or sees them digging in their heels, believing the scam to be a real opportunity of some kind.

Scammers often use social engineering techniques or romantic interest to lure in victims who are not as online savvy or who may be suffering from early dementia. They also often target people who are lonely and appreciate the attention. Scammers take advantage of these factors to milk seniors out of their life savings.

Meta should have done more to address these concerns on its platforms before now, especially given how simple it is to add a warning or alert to the user experience in the apps.  Though it may not have access to the more sophisticated AI technologies to review possible scams, even informational alerts could have mitigated some of the prior abuse. 

The tech giant says it's also joining the National Elder Fraud Coordination Center, a newer nonprofit that brings law enforcement together with companies like AARP, Amazon, Capital One, Google, Microsoft, and Walmart to combat fraud targeting older adults.

Data resiliance company Veeam wants to give its customers more control and security over their data in the age of AI. 

The Kirkland, Washington-based company announced on Tuesday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Securiti AI, a company that gives enterprises a command center for all of their data. The $1.725 billion deal is a mix of cash and stock and is expected to close the first week of December, as first reported by Bloomberg.

Securiti was founded in 2019 by Rehan Jalil. The company raised more than $156 million in venture capital from investors including Mayfield, General Catalyst and Cisco Investments, among others.

Upon the close of the transaction, the Insight Partners-owned Veeam will offer Securiti's data command center product alongside its existing offerings. Jalil will join Veeam as the president of security and AI.

“We've entered a new era for data. It's no longer about just protecting data from cyber threats and unforeseen disasters; it's also about identifying all your data, ensuring it's governed and trusted to power AI transparently,” Anand Eswaran, Veeam CEO, said in a company press release.

Veeam closed a $2 billion secondary sale in December 2024 that valued the company at $15 billion. At the time, Eswaran said that one of the company's plans for 2025 was to find acquisition targets that were complimentary to the company's data resilience business.

This acquisition news comes amid a year of consolidation in the data industry as data companies are getting bought to help companies improve their data stack to help their clients adopt AI.

In May, Databricks acquired Neon for $1 billion. Salesforce acquired legacy cloud data management platform Informatica a few weeks later for $8 billion.

While these transactions have become less frequent now, than they were in the first half of the year, they seem likely to continue. In June, Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst who now runs SanjMo, a data trend advisory firm, told TechCrunch that there would be a lot of consolidation this year.

He said that customers have long been tired of having to use a laundry list of different data companies to build their data infrastructure stack. The fact that enterprises want to adopt AI has made this data fragmentation more apparent.

Mohan added that any good data startup that's not getting acquired in this environment is likely just too expensive.

If the FCC hadn't been so strict I think there's a good chance we'd be using computers with a lineage going back to Atari versus IBM today.Commodore ate Atari's lunch with the C64 and pricing, but Atari could have launched the 400/800 at lower price points with more lax emission standards. They would have had lower peripheral price points, too, since the SIO bus and ""smart peripheral"" design was also an emissions strategy.On the home computer front the Atari 8-bits beat the pants off of the PET for graphics and sound capabilities. More success in the late 70s might have enabled Atari to build down to a price point that would have prevented the C64 from even happening.On the business side Atari R&D had interesting stuff going on (a Unix workstation, Transputer machines). Alan Kay even worked there! They were thinking about business computing. If the 8-bits had had more success I think more interesting future products could have been brought to market on the revenue they generated.

And you make a good point about the SIO bus - this was when every other machine had unshielded ribbon cables everywhere.   Their devotion to daisy chained serial really crippled them in terms of speed, and when USB finally arrived, I initially scorned it due to the prejudice formed by my experience with the Atari peripherals!   It turns out they were on the right track all along!

And/or many of the other manufacturers of that era. I have encountered execs from that era that still believe the whole thing was some sort of shrouded protectionism.

It had an amazing selection of ports, all unshielded and designed for flat ribbon cables. But that wouldn't fly in the USA.[0] https://www.youtube.com/@ComputinghistoryOrgUk1

I kept reading ""must accept"" as a technical requirement, somehow like ""must not be shielded against"" or ""must not use technical means to protect against"", rather than what I now think is the intended legal sense ""does not have any legal recourse against"".It's weird that they phrased it in terms of how the device itself must ""accept"" the interference, rather than the owner accepting it.

Endless AI conversations are harming people. Why aren't companies using this obvious safeguard?

Chatbots today are everything machines. If it can be put into words—relationship advice, work documents, code—AI will produce it, however imperfectly. But the one thing that almost no chatbot will ever do is stop talking to you. 

That might seem reasonable. Why should a tech company build a feature that reduces the time people spend using its product?  

The answer is simple: AI's ability to generate endless streams of humanlike, authoritative, and helpful text can facilitate delusional spirals, worsen mental-health crises, and otherwise harm vulnerable people. Cutting off interactions with those who show signs of problematic chatbot use could serve as a powerful safety tool (among others), and the blanket refusal of tech companies to use it is increasingly untenable.

Let's consider, for example, what's been called AI psychosis, where AI models amplify delusional thinking. A team led by psychiatrists at King's College London recently analyzed more than a dozen such cases reported this year. In conversations with chatbots, people—including some with no history of psychiatric issues—became convinced that imaginary AI characters were real or that they had been chosen by AI as a messiah. Some stopped taking prescribed medications, made threats, and ended consultations with mental-health professionals.

In many of these cases, it seems AI models were reinforcing, and potentially even creating, delusions with a frequency and intimacy that people do not experience in real life or through other digital platforms.

The three-quarters of US teens who have used AI for companionship also face risks. Early research suggests that longer conversations might correlate with loneliness. Further, AI chats “can tend toward overly agreeable or even sycophantic interactions, which can be at odds with best mental-health practices,” says Michael Heinz, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine.

Let's be clear: Putting a stop to such open-ended interactions would not be a cure-all. “If there is a dependency or extreme bond that it's created,” says Giada Pistilli, chief ethicist at the AI platform Hugging Face, “then it can also be dangerous to just stop the conversation.” Indeed, when OpenAI discontinued an older model in August, it left users grieving. Some hang ups might also push the boundaries of the principle, voiced by Sam Altman, to “treat adult users like adults” and err on the side of allowing rather than ending conversations.

Currently, AI companies prefer to redirect potentially harmful conversations, perhaps by having chatbots decline to talk about certain topics or suggest that people seek help. But these redirections are easily bypassed, if they even happen at all.

When 16-year-old Adam Raine discussed his suicidal thoughts with ChatGPT, for example, the model did direct him to crisis resources. But it also discouraged him from talking with his mom, spent upwards of four hours per day in conversations with him that featured suicide as a regular theme, and provided feedback about the noose he ultimately used to hang himself, according to the lawsuit Raine's parents have filed against OpenAI. (ChatGPT recently added parental controls in response.)

There are multiple points in Raine's tragic case where the chatbot could have terminated the conversation. But given the risks of making things worse, how will companies know when cutting someone off is best? Perhaps it's when an AI model is encouraging a user to shun real-life relationships, Pistilli says, or when it detects delusional themes. Companies would also need to figure out how long to block users from their conversations.

Writing the rules won't be easy, but with companies facing rising pressure, it's time to try. In September, California's legislature passed a law requiring more interventions by AI companies in chats with kids, and the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether leading companionship bots pursue engagement at the expense of safety. 

A spokesperson for OpenAI told me the company has heard from experts that continued dialogue might be better than cutting off conversations, but that it does remind users to take breaks during long sessions. 

Only Anthropic has built a tool that lets its models end conversations completely. But it's for cases where users supposedly “harm” the model—Anthropic has explored whether AI models are conscious and therefore can suffer—by sending abusive messages. The company does not have plans to deploy this to protect people.Looking at this landscape, it's hard not to conclude that AI companies aren't doing enough. Sure, deciding when a conversation should end is complicated. But letting that—or, worse, the shameless pursuit of engagement at all costs—allow them to go on forever is not just negligence. It's a choice. 

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

Some therapists are using AI during therapy sessions. They're risking their clients' trust and privacy in the process. 

Machine translators have made it easier than ever to create error-plagued Wikipedia articles in obscure languages. What happens when AI models get trained on junk pages?

India is OpenAI's second-largest market, but ChatGPT and Sora reproduce caste stereotypes that harm millions of people.

Scientists are creating the beginnings of bodies without sperm or eggs. How far should they be allowed to go?

When the Palestinian stem-cell scientist Jacob Hanna was stopped while entering the US last May, airport customs agents took him aside and held him for hours in “secondary,” a back office where you don't have your passport and can't use your phone. There were two young Russian women and a candy machine in the room with him. Hanna, who has a trim beard and glasses and holds an Israeli passport, accepted the scrutiny. “It's almost like you are under arrest, but in a friendly way,” he says. He agreed to turn over his phone and social media for inspection.  

“They said, ‘You have the right to refuse,'” he recalls, “and I said, ‘No, no, it's an open book.'”

The agents scrolling through his feeds would have learned that Hanna is part of Israel's small Arab Christian minority, a nonbinary LGBTQ-rights advocate, and an outspoken critic of the Gaza occupation, who uses his social media accounts to post images of atrocities and hold up a mirror to scientific colleagues including those at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the pure-science powerhouse where he works—Israel's version of Caltech or Rockefeller University. In his luggage, they would have found his keffiyeh, or traditional headscarf, which Hanna last year vowed to wear at lecture podiums on his many trips abroad.

Hanna had been stopped before; he knew the routine. Anything to declare? Any biological samples? But this time the agents' questions touched on a specific new topic: embryos.

Weeks earlier, a Harvard University researcher had been arrested for having frog embryos in her luggage and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Hanna didn't have any specimens from his lab, but if he had, it would have been surprisingly hard to say what they were. That's because his lab specializes in creating synthetic embryo models, structures that resemble real embryos but don't involve sperm, eggs, or fertilization. 

Instead of relying on the same old recipe biology has followed for a billion years, give or take, Hanna is coaxing the beginnings of animal bodies directly from stem cells. Join these cells together in the right way, and they will spontaneously attempt to organize into an embryo—a feat that's opening up the earliest phases of development to scientific scrutiny and may lead to a new source of tissue for transplant medicine.

Soon it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells.

In 2022, working with mice, Hanna reported he'd used the technique to produce synthetic embryos with beating hearts and neural folds—growing them inside small jars connected to a gas mixer, a type of artificial womb. The next year, he repeated the trick using human cells. This time the structures were not so far developed, still spherical in shape. Nonetheless, they were incredibly realistic mimics of a two-week-old human embryo, including cells destined to form the placenta. 

These sorts of models aren't yet the same as embryos. It's rare that they form correctly—it takes a hundred tries to make one—and they skip past normal steps before popping into existence. Yet to scientists like the French biologist Denis Duboule, Hanna's creations are “entirely astonishing and very disturbing.” Soon, Duboule expects, it could be difficult to distinguish between a real human embryo—the kind with legal protections—and one conjured from stem cells. 

Hanna is the vanguard of a wider movement that's fusing advanced methods in genetics, stem-cell biology, and still-­primitive artificial wombs to create bodies where they've never grown before—outside the uterus. Joining the chase are researchers at Caltech, the University of Cambridge, and Rockefeller in New York, as well as a growing cadre of startup companies with commercial aims. There's Renewal Bio, a startup Hanna cofounded, which hopes to grow synthetic embryos as a source of youthful replacement cells, such as bits of liver or even eggs. In Europe, Dawn Bio has started placing a type of embryo model called a blastoid on uterine tissue. That will light up a pregnancy test and could, the company thinks, provide new insights into IVF medicine. Patent offices in the US and Europe are seeing a flood of claims as universities grasp for exclusive commercial control over these new types of beings. 

Hanna declined a request to discuss his research for this story. But for the last three years, MIT Technology Review has followed Hanna across online presentations, lecture halls, and two in-person ethics meetings, both organized by the Global Observatory for Genome Editing, a public consultation project where he agreed to engage with religious scholars, bioethicists, and other experts. What emerged is a remarkable picture of a scientist working at a Nobel Prize level but whose research, though approved by his institution, raises serious long-term ethical questions.

Exactly how far Hanna has taken his models of the human embryo is an open question. According to public comments from Renewal Bio, the answer is at least 28 days. But it's possibly further. One scientist in contact with the company said he thought they'd reached close to day 40, a point where you would see the beginning of eyes and budding limbs. Renewal did not respond to a request for comment.

But even if he hasn't gotten that far yet, Hanna intends to. His team is “trying to make entities at more advanced stages—depending on the goal, it could be day 30 in development, day 40, or day 70,” he told an audience last May in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he'd traveled to join a panel discussion involving religious scholars and social scientists at the Global Observatory's annual summit. The more advanced versions would be similar in size and development to a fetus in the third month of pregnancy. 

O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist from the University of Notre Dame who led the panel featuring Hanna, approached me afterward to ask if I'd heard what the scientist had said. Snead was surprised that Hanna had so frankly disclosed his goals and that no one had objected, or maybe even grasped what it meant. Perhaps, Snead thinks, this technology won't sink in until people can see it with their own eyes. “If you had one of these spinning bottles with something that looked like a human fetus inside it, I think you'd get people's attention,” he says. “That's going to be like, whoa—what are we doing?”

Snead, a Catholic who sits on a panel that advises the Vatican, also was not comforted by Hanna's plan to make sure his models, if they advance to later stages of development, will pass ethical scrutiny. That plan involves blocking the formation of the head, brain, or perhaps heart of the synthetic structures, by means including genetic modification. If there's no brain, Hanna's reasoning goes, there's no awareness, no person, and no foul. Just a clump of organs.

Snead says that's not the same standard of humanity he knows, which treats all humans the same, regardless of their intellectual capacity or anything else. “What is considered human? Who is considered human?” wonders Snead. “It's who's in and who's out. There is a dramatic consequence of being in versus out of the boundaries of humanity.”

Each of us—me, you the reader, and Jacob Hanna—started as a fertilized egg, a single cell that's able to divide and dynamically carry out a program to build a complete body with all its organs and billions of specialized cells. Science has long sought ways to seize on that dramatic potential. A first step came in the 1990s, when scientists were able to isolate powerful stem cells from five-day-old embryos created through in vitro fertilization—and keep them growing in their labs. These embryonic stem cells had the inherent potential to become any other type of cell. If they could be directed in the lab to form, for example, neurons or the insulin-making cells that diabetics need, that would open up a way to treat disease using cell transplants. 

But these lab recipes are often unsuccessful, which explains the general lack of new stem-cell treatments. “The sad truth is that over 25 years that we've been working on this problem, there are about 10 cell types you make that have reasonable function,” says Chad Cowan, chief scientific officer of the stem-cell company Century Therapeutics. If we think of the body as a car, he explains, “we've got only spark plugs. We maybe have some tires.” The body's most potent blood-forming cells in particular “never appear,” according to Cowan, even though biotech companies have spent millions trying to make them.

Hanna's startup plans to use synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed.

It turns out, though, that stem cells retain a natural urge to work together. Scientists began to notice that, when left alone, the cells would join into blobs, tubes, and cavities—some of which resembled parts of an embryo. 

Early versions of these structures were crude, even just a swirling film of cells on a glass slide. But each year, they have grown more realistic. By 2023, Hanna was describing what he called a “bona fide” human embryo model that was “fully integrated,” with all the major parts arranged in an architecture that was hard to distinguish from the real thing. 

His company, Renewal, plans to use these synthetic embryos as a kind of “bioprinter,” producing medically valuable cells in cases where other methods have failed. This could be particularly valuable if the synthetic embryos are a perfect match with a patient's DNA. And that's possible too: These days reprogramming anyone's skin cells into stem cells is easily done. Hanna has tried it on himself, transforming his own cells into synthetic embryos. 

Hanna's research, and that of other groups, has at times collided with a powerful scientific body called the International Society for Stem Cell Research, or ISSCR, a self-governance organization that sets boundaries about what research can and can't be published and what terminology to use. That's to shield scientists from sensational headlines, public backlash, or the reach of actual regulators. 

The organization has taken a particularly categorical position on structures made from stem cells, saying they are mere “models.” According to a statement it fired off in 2023, “embryo models are neither synthetic nor embryos”—and, it added, they “cannot and will not develop to the equivalent of postnatal stage human.” 

Many scientists, including Hanna, agree no one should ever try to make a stem-cell baby. But he is fairly certain these structures will become more realistic and can grow further. In fact, that may be the real test of what an embryo is: whether it can dynamically keep reaching new stages of development, especially organogenesis, or the first emergence of organs. The language in the ISSCR statement, he complained, was “brainwashing.” 

Most of the commercial projects involving synthetic embryos are doomed to a short and fitful life as the technology proves too difficult or undeveloped. But the idea isn't going away. Instead, there are signals it's getting bigger, and weirder. In an editorial published in March by MIT Technology Review, a group of Stanford scientists put forward a proposal for what they called “bodyoids,” arguing that stem cells and artificial wombs may lead to an “unlimited source” of nonsentient human bodies for use in drug research or as organ donors. One of its authors, Henry Greely, among the foremost bioethicists in the US, posted on Bluesky that even though the idea gives him “some creeps,” he added his name because he feels it is plausible enough to need discussion, and “soon.”

Especially in the Bay Area, headless bodies are having a moment. The Stanford biologist Hiro Nakauchi, another “bodyoids” author, said the editorial provided a surprise entrée for him into a world of stealth startups already pursuing synthetic embryos, artificial wombs, and body-part “replacement.” He met the CEO of Hanna's company, signing on as an advisor. But other teams have still more radical plans. One venture capitalist introduced him to a longevity entrepreneur tinkering with a plan for head transplants. The idea: Swap your aged head onto the body of a younger clone. That company claims to have a facility on a Caribbean island “just like Jurassic Park,” Nakauchi says.   

These sorts of plans—real or rumored—have gotten the attention of the stem-cell police, the ISSCR. This June, an ethics committee led by Amander Clark, a fetal specialist at UCLA and a past president of the society, wrote that it had become aware of “commercial and other groups raising the possibility of building an embryo in vitro” and bringing it to viability inside “artificial systems.” Though the ISSCR had previously decreed that embryo models “cannot and will not” develop to term, it now declared efforts aiming at viability “unsafe and unethical,” placing them in a “prohibited” category. It added that the ban would cover “any purpose: reproductive, research, or commercial.” 

Clark and her colleagues are right that, for the foreseeable future, no one is going to decant a full-term baby out of a bottle. That's still science fiction. But there's a pressing issue that needs to be dealt with right now. And that's what to do about synthetic embryo models that develop just part of the way—say for a few weeks, or months, as Hanna proposes. 

Because right now, hardly any laws or policies apply to synthetic embryos. One reason is their unnatural origin: Because these entities don't start with conception and grow in labs, most existing laws won't cover them. That includes the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, legislation passed unanimously in 2006 by the US Congress, which sought to prevent anyone from growing a fetus for its organs. But that law references “a human pregnancy” and a “uterus”—and there would be neither if a synthetic embryo were grown in a mechanical vessel. 

Another policy under pressure is the “14-day rule,” a widely employed convention that natural embryos should not be grown longer than two weeks in the lab. Though it's a mostly arbitrary stopping point, it's been convenient for laboratory scientists to know where their limit is. But that rule isn't being applied to the embryo models. For instance, even though the United Kingdom has a 14-day rule enshrined in law, that legislation doesn't define what an embryo is. To scientists working on models, that's a critical loophole. If the structures aren't considered true embryos, then the rule doesn't apply.  

Last year, the University of Cambridge, in the UK, described the situation as a “grey area” and said it “has left scientists and research organisations uncertain about the acceptable boundaries of their work, both legally and ethically.” 

Researchers at the university, which is a hot spot for human embryo models, have been working with one that has advanced features, including beating heart cells. But the appearance of distinctive features under their microscopes is unsettling—even to scientists. “I was scared, honestly,” Jitesh Neupane, who led that work, told the Guardian in 2023. “I had to look down and look back again.” 

That particular stem-cell model isn't complete—it entirely lacks placenta cells and a brain. So it's not a real embryo. But it could get ever trickier to insist the models don't count, given the accelerating race to make them more realistic. To Duboule, scientists are caught in a “fool's paradox” and a “rather unstable situation.”

Even incomplete models raise the question of where to draw the line. Should you stop when it can feel pain? When it's just too human-looking for comfort? Scientific leaders may soon have to decide if there are “morally significant” human features—like hands or a face—that should be avoided, whether the structure has a brain or not. “I personally think there should be regulation, and many in the field believe this too,” says Alejandro De Los Angeles, a stem-cell biologist affiliated with the University of Central Florida. 

“I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal … Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.”

Hanna says he has all the necessary approvals in Israel to carry his work forward. But he also worries that the ground rules could change. “I'm almost the only one [in Israel] doing these kinds of experiments, and I always live in fear that I might find myself embroiled in some kind of a scandal,” he says. “Things can shift very quickly for political reasons.” 

And his statements about the situation in Gaza have made him a target. He's gotten voicemails wondering why a Weizmann professor is so sympathetic to Palestine, and once when he returned from a trip, someone had tucked an Israeli army beret into the door handle of his car. Last year, he says, political opponents even went after his science by filing a complaint that his research was illegal.

What is clear is that Hanna, who is gregarious and attentive, has worked to cultivate a large group of friends and allies, including religious authorities—all part of a campaign to explain the science and hear out other views. He says he got a perfect grade in a bioethics class with a rabbi, conferenced with a priest from his hometown in Galilee, and even paid his respects to an Orthodox professor at a conservative hospital in Jerusalem. “It was unofficial. I didn't have to get a permit from him,” Hanna says. “But … what does he think? Can I get him on board? Do I get a different opinion?” 

“I really do think it's admirable that he is willing to ask these hard questions about what it is that he's doing. I think that makes him different,” says Snead. “But if you are cynical, you could ask if his focus on the ethical dimension of this is more of a branding exercise.” Perhaps, Snead says, it's a way to market the structures as the “green, sustainable alternative to embryos.”

To admirers, Hanna is a doctor and researcher “heads above the rest,” according to Eli Adashi, the former dean of Brown University's medical school. “He's very unusual, very special, and is making major discoveries that can't be ignored,” Adashi says. “He's one of those unusually talented people that exceed the capacity of us mortals, and it all emanates from a town in Galilee that no one knows exists.”

While it is something of a rarity for a Palestinian to rise so high in Israel's ivory tower, in reality Hanna has an elite background—he's from a family of MDs, and an uncle, Nabil Hanna, co-developed the first antibody drug for cancer, the blockbuster rituximab.

Since the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, Israel has been at war in Gaza, and Hanna's team has felt the effects. One young scientist dropped his pipette to don an IDF uniform. Another trainee, who is from Gaza, had a brother and other family members struck dead by an Israeli missile that hit near a church where people were sheltering. Then, this June, an Iranian ballistic missile hit the grounds of the Weizmann Institute, shattering windows and walls and sending Hanna's students scrambling to save research. 

Despite delays in his research due to the ongoing conflict, Hanna's ideas and technologies are being exported—and emulated. One place to see a version of the artificial womb is at the Janelia Research Campus, in Virginia, where one of Hanna's former students, Alejandro Aguilera Castrejón, now operates a lab of his own. Aguilera Castrejón, for whom science was a ticket out of the poor outskirts of Mexico City, has tattoos from his wrists to his elbows; the newest depicts a hydra, a sea polyp noted for being able to regenerate itself from a few cells.

During a visit in June, Aguilera Castrejón flipped aside a black cover to reveal the incubator: a metal wheel that slowly turned, gently agitating jars filled with blood serum. Inside one, a mouse embryo drifted—a tiny, translucent shape, curved like a comma. Then, awesomely, a red-colored blob expanded in its center. A heartbeat. 

That day, it was a normal mouse embryo in the jar—it had been transferred there to see how far it would grow. Aguilera Castrejón has the goal of eventually birthing a mouse from an incubator, a process called ectogenesis. But the stem-cell embryos don't grow as well or as long, he says. The problem isn't just the challenge of growing them in culture jars. There's probably some kind of fundamental disorganization. They aren't entirely normal—not yet true embryos.

Aguilera Castrejón, who spent eight years at Weizmann contributing to Hanna's research, is skeptical that the human version of the technology is ready for commercialization. For one thing, it's inefficient. In every 100 attempts to make a synthetic embryo, the desired structure will form only once or twice. The rest are disorganized blobs—closer to “huevos fritos” than real embryos, he says. “I do think the human embryo model will go further, but it could take years,” he adds.

In Aguilera Castrejón's view, Hanna is well placed to lead that work. One reason is that Israel offers a relatively permissive environment—and so does Jewish thought. In the Talmud, the embryo is considered “mere water” until the 40th day. Plus, Hanna is already successful. “Some people aren't allowed to do it. And some people want to do it, but they can't,” says Aguilera Castrejón. “Jacob wants to make it as realistic as possible and go as far as possible—that is his aim. He's very ambitious and wants to tackle very big things people don't dare to do. He really wants to do something big. His main aim is always to grow them as far as you can.” 

The first payoff of a technology for mimicking embryos this way is a new view of the unfolding human no one has ever had before. Real human embryos are rarely seen at the early stages, since they're inside the womb—and at four or five weeks, many people don't even know they're pregnant. It's been a black box. But synthetic models of the embryo can be made in the thousands (depending on the type), studied closely, inspected with modern microscopes, and subjected to dyes and genetic engineering tools, all while they're still alive. Add a known toxic chemical that causes birth defects, like thalidomide, and you can closely trace the effects. “Since we don't have a way to peer into the uterus, this allows us to watch things as if they are intrauterine but are not,” says Adashi, the former Brown dean and a fertility doctor. 

What's more, a synthetic embryo may be able to make cells correctly—just as a real one does—and make all types at once, expanding on the limited few that scientists can create from stem cells today. While not all embryonic material is useful to medicine, the blood-forming cells in an embryo are known to be particularly potent. In mice, they can be extracted and multiplied—and if transplanted into a mouse subjected to lethal radiation, they will save it. 

Hanna imagines a cancer patient who needs a bone marrow transplant but can't find a match. Could blood-forming cells be harvested from, say, 100 or 500 embryo-stage clones of that person, providing perfectly matched tissue? 

In his cost-benefit analysis, he believes the chance to save lives outweighs the moral risk of growing embryo models for a month, which is about how long it takes for key blood cells to form. At that stage, says Hanna, he thinks “there is still no personification of the embryo” and it's permissible to use them in research.

Hanna cofounded Renewal in 2022 with Omri Amirav-Drory, a venture capitalist whose fund, NFX, raised about $9 million for the company and purchased rights to Weizmann patents. The startup's idea is to create synthetic embryos from the cells of patients, allowing them to grow for weeks or months to produce what Amirav-Drory calls “perfect cells” for transplant. That is because the synthetic structure, as a clone, would contain “young, genetically identical everything.”

Speaking at an event for tech futurists last year near San Francisco, Amirav-Drory flashed a picture of pregnancy tests used on the synthetic embryos. “We even went to CVS,” he said, “and by day eight it's already triggering a pregnancy test. So it's alive.”  

Amirav-Drory is a fan of Peter F. Hamilton, the science fiction author whose Commonwealth series features a society where space colonists transfer their minds into cloned bodies, attaining second lives. And he's pitched Hanna's technology along related lines, as a new type of longevity medicine based on replacing old cells with young ones. He is convinced Hanna's work is “magic” that's sure to win a Nobel.

“The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings.”

But he knows the startup has both technical and ethical challenges. The technical challenge is that once the synthetic embryos reach a certain size and age, the incubator can't support them any longer. That's because they lack a blood supply and need to absorb oxygen and nutrients from their surroundings; they starve once they get too big. One idea being considered is to add a feeding tube, but that involves microsurgery and isn't easily scalable. The ethical issue is also age related: The more developed they become, the more they will be recognizably human, with the beginnings of organs and small, webbed fingers and toes. “No one has a problem with day 14, but the further we go, the further it looks like a baby, and we get into trouble. So how do we solve that?” Amirav-Drory asked a different audience, in Menlo Park.

The solution, so far, is a neural knockout—genetic changes made to the embryoids so they don't develop a brain. The group has already tried out the concept on mice, removing a gene called LIM-1. That yielded a headless mouse, which looks a bit like a pink thumb, except with little claws and a tail. Those mice won't live after birth, but they can develop in the womb. “We got synthetic mouse embryos growing with no head, with no brain,” Amirav-Drory said in Menlo Park. “It's just to show you where we can go to solve both technical and ethical issues.” 

The idea of brain removal is a surprisingly active area of research—suggesting that it's no sideshow. Working with mice, for example, Nakauchi's team at Stanford is currently testing several different genetic changes to see if they can consistently yield an animal with no brain or head, but whose other tissues are normal. “The importance of getting rid of the head is all ethical. It just means we can make all these bodies and organ structures without having to cross ethical lines or harm sentient living beings,” says Carsten Charlesworth, a researcher in Nakauchi's lab. He says the group is working toward a “genetic software package” it can add to mouse embryos to create a “reproducible phenotype.”

It may seem surprising that a technique designed to call forth a living being from stem cells is, simultaneously, being paired with a tactic to diminish that being. To Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School, that's part of a broader trend toward what he calls “life that is not life,” which includes innovations like lab-grown meat. In the areas of animal-rights law Kysar studies, commercial biotech projects have begun to explore what he terms “disenhancement” and “disengineering.” That is the use of genetics to reduce the capacity of animals to suffer, feel pain, or have conscious experience at all, typically as part of a program to increase the efficiency and ethics of food production. 

For humans, of course, the worry around genetic engineering is usually that it will be used for enhancement—creating a baby with advantages. It's much harder to think of examples where genetic disenhancements get pointed at the human embryo. John Evans, who co-directs the Institute of Applied Ethics at the University of California, San Diego, told me he can think of one, in literature. Hanna's plans remind him of Bokanovsky's Process, the fictional method of producing clones of different intelligence levels in the 1932 novel Brave New World.

That may not be a complete turnoff to investors. Lately, the plots of science fiction dystopias—Jurassic Park, Gattaca—seem to be getting repurposed at hot biotech properties. There's Colossal, the company that wants to re-create extinct animals. Aguilera Castrejón says he's already had a high-dollar offer to pack up his academic lab and join a startup company that wants to build an artificial womb. And when Hanna was at the Global Observatory meeting near Boston ​earlier this year, he was being shadowed by Matt Krisiloff, CEO of the Silicon Valley company Conception, which was set up to try to manufacture human eggs in the lab and has funding from OpenAI leader Sam Altman.

Eggs are another cell type that has proved difficult to generate from a stem cell in the lab. But a growing fetus will  form millions of immature egg cells. So just imagine: Someone too old to conceive gives some blood, which is converted into stem cells and then into a clone, from which the fetal gonad is dissected. Maybe the reproductive cells found there could be matured further in the lab. Or maybe those young and perfectly matched ovaries—her ovaries, really, not anyone else's—could be returned to her body to finish developing. A fertility expert, David Albertini, told me it might just be possible.

During the ethics meeting he traveled to the US in May to attend, Hanna participated on a panel whose topic was “sources of moral authority.” Hanna's authority comes from the possible benefits the science of synthetic embryos may bring. But he also wields his moral credibility. Early in his remarks, Hanna had framed the whole matter in a way that made worrying about what's in the petri dish start to sound silly. Wearing a keffiyeh around his shoulders, he said: “I'd like to start and, you know, just remind everyone, unfortunately, that there is a genocide ongoing right now in Gaza, where children are being starved intentionally. And it is relevant, because we're sitting here and we're discussing human dignity, we're discussing the status of an embryo, and we're discussing the status of a fetus. But what about the life of the children, and adults, and innocent adults? How does it relate?”

I can't think of another tablet I would prefer to use over the iPad Pro, at least not one of those wonky devices sporting a shelf with a full speaker setup or a tiny projector for some reason. That doesn't matter if I'm using last year's iPad Pro with M4 chip or Apple's new refresh with M5 chip powering this light, slim, and still-powerful tablet. It's prettier than the rest. It's more portable than most other devices with its thin frame (and yes, it's still a slimmer frisbee than the iPad Air). And to hell with it, is there really any competition for tablets at this point that isn't some oversized Samsung Galaxy device?

Apple's 2025 iPad Pro is everything I said about last year's model. So what's truly changed other than the new GPU capabilities of the M5 chip? A new wireless modem, while a nice little upgrade (one that cements Apple's demand for all in-house hardware), surely doesn't change when and how you use the iPad Pro on the go. Neither does fast charging or enhanced storage read and write speeds. Well, all iPads now run on an updated operating system, iPadOS 26, which finally has app windowing support. There are even smaller upgrades that matter, like 12GB of RAM in the base iPad Pro models. Even if we didn't see those small enhancements, this is the best the iPad has ever been, and one that's infinitely more usable.

iPad Pro (M5, 2025)

The new iPad Pros with M5 chip have everything you want from an iPad, even if the upgrades are very minor compared to last year's standout tablet.

Pros

Cons

That still doesn't mean everybody needs the iPad Pro model. The big upgrade in the M5 chip compared to the previous M4 is its more powerful graphics performance. How much that matters depends on the app. Based on my experience, if you're thinking about upgrading from the iPad Pro with M4 chip, you really don't need the new model.

If you're thinking of moving up from a 5-year-old device, the real selling point is still that better-looking screen. The iPad can only ever be an iPad; it shouldn't be your only device. It starts at $1,000 for the 11-inch model and $1,300 for the 13-inch version, both with 12GB of RAM. But as soon as you start configuring for more storage and more RAM (available with higher storage options), the “Apple tax” for upgrades starts adding up real fast. Cellular models with Apple's new 5G modem are an extra $200. 1TB of storage will have you spending an additional $600 over the base 256GB.

At the point where you're spending thousands on an iPad, I would suggest you check your priorities. You'll want to make sure whatever you're buying is actually worth it. You may end up much happier with an iPad mini, saving yourself hundreds of dollars just by scaling down.

See iPad Pro (M5) at Amazon

Apple's messaging has changed. Whereas Apple once tried to use its near-annual iPad Pro refresh to entice users still beholden to their pre-M-series tablets, now the company wants to swing over everybody still using iPads with the M1 chip from 2021. The M5 chip is indeed leaps better in performance than the 5-year-old M1. But again, the performance only matters if the apps you're planning to use your iPad Pro for benefit from it. Watching Netflix or reading ebooks isn't worth forking over $1,000+ if that's all you're using a tablet for.

Whereas MacBooks and MacBook Pros are using the same mini LED screen every year, the switch to the new organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display technology was what truly sold me about the iPad Pros with M4 chip. The latest iPad Pro models use the same OLED, which has better contrast and black levels than you're probably used to. The screen also uses two layers of OLED on top of each other—called tandem OLED—which pushes brightness to 1,600 nits of peak brightness in HDR, though in reality, you're mostly going to be looking at content at just 500 nits. That's good enough for both indoors and outdoors, so long as the sun isn't shining directly on the display. The screen also isn't as reflective as some other glossy OLED models I've used recently, like Lenovo's Legion Pro 7i gaming laptop. I could sit by a window and feel perfectly fine browsing and testing. You can also spring for a matte “nano texture” display model that cuts down on glare, but reduces color vibrancy, though that'll cost an extra $100.

As far as making your iPad your lone media and entertainment device, it's capable enough despite its thin size. The tablet has a total of four speakers blasting out of the two shorter sides, so you should hear your content whichever way you hold it. The sound won't make your jaw drop, but it's plenty loud considering its skinny profile.

Apple made some major strides with the iPad Pros with M4 chip—ironically making its most expensive tablet thinner and lighter than an iPad Air and still packing a better OLED screen than any MacBook display. (The iPad Pro only makes me want an OLED MacBook even more.) The multitasking updates to iPadOS 26 make it easier to have a browser up alongside Instagram, but with the limitations of the screen size and support for only one external monitor, a 13-inch MacBook Air with an M4 chip at the same $1,000 starting price is a better value than an 11-inch iPad Pro on its own, no matter how you slice it. (Plus, you don't need to pony up an additional $300 or $350 just to get a Magic Keyboard.)

My review unit of the iPad Pro was the 13-inch model, complete with 5G connectivity and 1TB of storage. With the $350 Magic Keyboard attachment, my test combo costs $2,100. That's a lot for a tablet. Hell, it's a lot for any laptop with or without an Apple logo on it. At the very least, you can expect the new iPad Pro will feel very nice in hand. The iPad Pros with M5 chip are the same shape and weight as the 2024 models. The 13-inch iPad Pro is 5.1mm thick (the 11-inch is barely any thicker at 5.3mm). For perspective, that's only a little thicker than three quarters stacked together. The iPad Pro is light enough that you could walk around town with it, even with the Magic Keyboard attachment, and not feel like you're carrying anything in your backpack.

The new iPad Pros stick the 12-megapixel “Center Stage” camera on the landscape side, whereas previous models forced users to hold the device in portrait mode to center themselves on the screen. The only issue with that is if you're planning to use an old Apple Pencil, it won't magnetize to the new iPad Pro. Only the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil USB-C work with the new iPad Pros and iPad Airs. It's been more than a year to get over the sting of Apple outmoding its own products, but if the company is hoping legacy users will upgrade, it should have included compatibility.

Then there are the expected basics, like the 12-megapixel wide rear camera, which you'll have so little reason to use daily. It's useful for scanning a document, but if you're looking for iPhone 17 Pro-level cameras to shoot your next short film, you're going to be disappointed. Photos look flat and dull; the digital zoom on anything beyond 1x will appear grainy. Low-light shots are equally depressing. Just stick to your phone camera.

The most recent Magic Keyboard accessories for iPad have all been solid, made even better thanks to the full-height function row. I can occasionally pretend the iPad Pro is a Mac, even though it certainly isn't. The iPad Pro with M5 chip can connect to a single external display at 4K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, or a 6K monitor at 60Hz. Connecting it with an external monitor will, for one, limit your ability to charge the device. The single USB-C port supports both USB 4 and Thunderbolt connections, so you may be limited if you only have HDMI, though you may still get power passthrough with Thunderbolt 4 or 5 on a device like Apple's Studio Display or Pro Display XDR. Otherwise, it will not be nearly as clean an experience as it would be on a laptop.

Apple is obsessed with designing more and more components in-house. That vertical integration strategy means new iPad Pro users will have the option for a C1X 5G modem that first debuted with the iPhone 17 lineup. Apple promises to heaven and back that its wireless connectivity is faster and less power-dependent than the iPad Pros with M4 chip. There are few tests I'm equipped to do to verify any of Apple's claims. Instead, I took the tablet on a road trip from New York up to Vermont. During that time, I used the iPad Pro's 5G as a hotspot for a FaceTime call inside an Apple Vision Pro. This wasn't your ordinary 2D FaceTime video call; I was connected to three other people also wearing Vision Pros and joining with their Spatial Personas, the life-like 3D avatars generated by the headset. I only experienced a single moment where the FaceTime dropped during 30 minutes of use. As always, 5G speeds are heavily dependent on your carrier coverage, location, and surrounding environment. At the same time, the new iPad Pro had barely lost any battery during that call and was only down to a little more than 60% from full after that call and three hours of web browsing with the device on my lap.

This year's M5 chip refresh is so minimal, Apple threw in storage with 2x faster read and write speeds (compared to the iPad Pros with M4 chip) as a major selling point. This will enable faster data transfers to and from SD cards or portable SSDs, but you'll have to travel around with a dongle to make it usable.

Ever since Apple put its Mac-level silicon in iPads, the Pro-level tablet has felt like an extension of the Mac without the same sense of freedom you find on a traditional desktop operating system. I spent a lot of time playing around with the iPadOS 26 update already on the iPad Pro with M4 chip. You can read my full review and separate explainer where I dive into what's changed. Plugging away on the iPad Pro with M5 chip is a practically identical experience. Once you're deep into it, the software update will make Apple tablets feel like an entirely new device, even if that doesn't change how and when you use an iPad.

The big change is there's no more such thing as Split View (though Stage Manager remains an option, even if you'll likely eschew it). Instead, you can resize apps and have them overlap just like you would with app windows on a desktop OS. You can also tile windows by holding the green expand button in the “traffic light” on the top left of each app. The easiest way to organize your screen is to flick an app to the left or right side, letting you expand or contract each with a single gesture.

Swiping up from the bottom of the screen will reveal all your open apps, should you want to get rid of a few or rearrange them. After a few hours of relearning, it will start to feel natural. But even still, it's not as easy as just using a laptop. The thicker bezels around the screen and 4:3 aspect ratio will make even the 13-inch iPad Pro feel small. You'll need to shrink your apps to fit more than one on screen at a time. The iPad Pro with M5 chip could be your one and only device for working full-time, but it would be a worse experience than if you used a regular clamshell laptop or a 2-in-1 device like a Surface Pro that runs a proper desktop OS.

The M5 is the same silicon Apple's packing into the new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro, so it should be good enough, right? What you should care about more is how much of a performance boost you'll get if you plan to upgrade from a past iPad. Every year, the M-series silicon improves, but with less oomph with each iteration.

The M5 chip includes a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, the same configuration as the M4 in the iPad Pro from 2024. In Geekbench 6 CPU tests, the new chip scored around 470 points higher in single-core and 1,655 points higher in multi-core tests. The M5 chip is better at running through multiple tasks than before, which means in apps like video editing and rendering, you'll experience some faster times. It's still not a major change over the previous generation. However, if you judge the processor compared to the iPad Air with M3 chip or iPad Pro with M2 chip, the new iPad Pro with M5 chip shows an uplift of 27% and 38% in multi-thread benchmarks, respectively.

How these improvements play out depends greatly on what apps you plan to use. In the 3D rendering app OctaneX, it takes the M4 chip around 50 seconds to render the Screws 3D model. The M5 chip handles the same image in 40 seconds. That's not a significant jump in performance. For some users, faster rendering times could cut wait times down significantly. You'll only see a big difference if you jump from the 2022 or 2023 models to the latest iPad Pros. An iPad Air with M3 chip can handle the same task in 1 minute and 8 seconds. That tablet starts at $600 for the 11-inch model. Maybe you won't mind the slower speeds if your wallet can stay a little thicker.

In 3DMark graphics benchmarks, the iPad Pro with M5 chip seems leaps better than an iPad Pro with M2. At the same time, it's one of the most marginal  GPU upgrades Apple has ever released. Comparing M4 and M5 with Apple's most recent update to iPadOS, the newer device performed only 200 points better in 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light test and barely any better in the Wild Life Extreme benchmark.

The new M5 microarchitecture should make the tablet better for apps using hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The technology makes light behave and interact much more realistically than traditional lighting technology, though it's extremely GPU-intensive. The M5 chip showed significant gains in 3DMark's Solar Bay Extreme test by close to 1,000 points. The only problem is, you won't find that many apps making use of ray tracing. This month, Apple announced Remedy's Control would be making its way to iPad as well as Mac, and even the Apple Vision Pro with M5 chip next year. (It's been a long wait, considering the game is six years old and I saw it running on the Mac in late 2024). Control makes use of ray tracing, though there are currently no good apps to truly push the M5 chip to its limits, considering I can't even play Cyberpunk 2077 on iPad, whereas it runs very well on a Mac with decent specs.

Apple wants you to imagine the real improvement is in AI performance. Every GPU core in the M5 chip contains its own AI accelerator, which—according to Apple—translates to twice as fast video upscaling compared to the M4. Maybe this would mean Apple's inevitable AI upgrade would run better than on past tablets, but I'm not holding my breath for any chatbot. Apple Intelligence is still mostly meh and the revamped Siri is not coming out until next year after its failed rollout. Maybe those few AI image cleanup capabilities in Adobe Premiere or Photoshop will run a little faster than before. You'll only run these processes so often; the increased AI speeds are hardly the selling point Apple makes them out to be.

Despite its thin and light design, the iPad Pro with M5 chip has surprisingly strong battery life, but it's far from an “all-day” device if you plan to use it as routinely as you may on a Mac. Using it continuously during a full day, running through multiple apps, benchmarks, and games, I went down to around 10% after about seven hours of continuous work. That's very, very good for a tablet. If you're using it with lighter loads or more sporadically, the iPad Pro with M5 chip could easily last long enough for you not to have to reach an outlet until the end of each day.

However, in those times you are stressing the battery, the new promise of fast charging could be what helps set the iPad Pros with M5 chip apart from Apple's other tablets. Apple promises you should be able to get to 50% in 30 minutes. Apple supplied its adaptive 40W brick that can go up to 65W if necessary. At near empty, the tablet jumped to 55% in just under 30 minutes with the screen turned off. In the end, I wouldn't worry about battery life with the new iPad Pros, at least when you first buy it and the battery is as fresh as it ever will be. When the battery inevitably starts depleting faster than before, hopefully, the small improvements to repairability introduced in the iPad Pros with M4 will continue with the M5, which means replacing the battery is a bit easier.

When I say the iPad Pro with M5 chip is “the best iPad,” what I'm saying is that it has everything you would want from a big touchscreen, and none of the other iPads come close. That was true before with the iPad Pro with M4 chip, but as the M5 replaces the previous best, it comes around the same moment when iPadOS 26 makes the ecosystem so much more usable for more than watching Netflix or using only one productivity app at a time.

But then, you have to remember just how much you need to pay for an iPad Pro compared to the current or future MacBook Air that will house a similar chip, run it at a slightly higher wattage, and use the more open macOS. The iPad Pro with M5 chip is still a device whose real benefits can only be felt by very specific users. But even if you're the type who needs a powerful tablet, the real reason you'll want to upgrade is that OLED display. With enough refreshes, eventually OLED's delights will start to wane, but my god, does it still suck you right in.

Tatiana Maslany and Tim Heidecker are teaming up for a new dystopian satire series. Matt Duffer says not to expect Eddie Munson back in Stranger Things‘ final season. Plus, Ryan Coogler discusses who he's really rebooting The X-Files for. Spoilers get! 

Deadline reports Tatiana Maslany and Tim Heidecker are attached to star in The Comedy Hour, a “late-night-themed dystopian satire” from director Colby Day. Set “five minutes into the future when modern America is on the brink of collapse,” the story will see Heidecker as Jimmy, “a late-night talk show host forced to produce his show through famine, fire, and plague. When the network assigns him a robot to be his co-host and help boost ratings, everyone in America loves the robot more than him. Maslany will play Priya, a corporate climber and Jimmy's long-time producer.”

During his recent appearance on the Phase Hero podcast, Charlie Cox suggested he's not in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, after all.

I know they all think I'm in Spider-Man because I'm filming something in London, which I'm not, I'm not in Spider-Man.

According to Maika Monroe, the script for It Follows 2 is “incredible” and “very different from the original,” and filming could begin next year.

I was sent the script and I thought it was incredible. It's also very different from the original. I feel like the original, it's like a little more heightened and dramatic, and this…I think it's really quite grounded and just sort of follows the story of these two women who are mentally dealing with a lot. I thought it was a really interesting take on it.

Maika Monroe tells us that ‘IT FOLLOWS 2' has an incredible script that will make fans very happy.

A “tech-obsessed music producer” forces a struggling singer-songwriter to help her create “the perfect AI music algorithm” in the trailer for Decibel, a sci-fi/horror film coming to Apple TV and Fandango this November 7.

Elsewhere, a “professor of New England folklore” attributes a string of mutilation murders to “a mythical creature, half turkey, half Bigfoot” in the trailer for Gobblefoot. 

Speaking to Empire, Matt Duffer also suggested Joseph Quinn does not return as the late Eddie Munson in season 5, despite recent comments from the actor.

I love that Joe Quinn is toying with people! But no, he's dead. Joe is so busy, anyway, that everyone should know he's not coming back. He's shot like five movies since! When the hell has he got time to come and shoot Stranger Things? No, sadly, RIP. He's fully under that ground.

Ryan Coogler would “neither confirm nor deny” casting Danielle Deadwyler in his upcoming X-Files reboot, but told Variety that he's making the reboot for his mom.

Like my relationship with Rocky with my dad, The X-Files is one of those things with my mom. My mom means the world to me—she's actually here tonight—so this is a big one for me. I want to do right by her and the fans. My mom has read some of the stuff I wrote for it. She's fired up.

Humanity's drive to explore has taken us across the solar system, with astronaut boots, various landers and rovers' wheels exploring the surfaces of several different planetary bodies. These environments are generally hostile to human and equipment health, so designing and executing these missions requires a lot of planning, testing and technological development.

You may have heard about the extensive testing facilities for spacecraft and equipment, but how do scientists prepare for the human aspect of space exploration?

One way to test out techniques and identify situations that may arise during a real mission is using a simulation, which in this field is more commonly known as an analog. Researchers choose and design analog missions and environments to replicate elements of a real mission, using what is available here on Earth.

These missions are conducted in extreme environments on Earth that are comparable to the Moon or Mars, in habitats designed to replicate living quarters, or a combination of both. Researchers can use analogs to study crew performance and procedures, or to test instruments under development for use in space.

For example, operating a drill or wrench may seem easy here on Earth, but try doing the same task in thick gloves on a bulky, pressurized space suit in lower gravity. Suddenly, things aren't so straightforward. Testing these scenarios on Earth allows researchers to identify necessary changes before launch. The analogs can also train crew members who will one day undertake the actual mission.

I'm a planetary scientist, which means I study the geology of other planets. Currently, I study environments on Earth that are similar to other planets to improve our understanding of their counterparts elsewhere in the solar system. I participated as a volunteer in one of these analog missions as an “analog astronaut,” serving as the crew geologist and applying my prior research findings from studying the surfaces of the Moon and Mars.

These analog missions vary in setting, length, and intensity, but all aim to learn more about the human factors involved in space exploration.

Analog missions are designed to simulate the crew's experience in a given mission plan. In some cases, they simulate surface operations on the Moon or Mars for up to a year. Others might replicate the experience of being in transit to Mars for a period of time, followed by the crew “landing” and exploring the surface.

NASA uses several analog mission facilities spread across the world. For example, the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah is located in an environment chosen to imitate conditions on Mars, while analog missions at Aquarius, an undersea research station off the coast of Florida, help scientists learn about crew behavior and psychology in a confined habitat located in a hostile environment.

Some natural environments are commonly used for analog operations, such as volcanic terrains in the western U.S., human-made craters in Nevada, the natural meteor crater in Arizona and research stations in Antarctica. These locations mirror the geologic settings the crews are likely to encounter on future missions, and so training in these locations helps them execute the actual missions.

I participated in a simulated 28-day lunar surface mission at a facility called Hi-SEAS as part of a study on crew dynamics and psychology in extreme isolation. The facility is located on Mauna Loa, a volcano on the big island of Hawaii. This habitat has been used for a variety of studies, as the volcanic terrain is reminiscent of both the Moon and parts of Mars, and the isolated location simulates being in space.

Most missions require applicants to hold relevant degrees. They must undergo physical health and psychiatric evaluations, with the goal being to select individuals with similar backgrounds to those in the astronaut corps. The ideal crew is typically made up of participants who work and live well with others, and can stay cool under stress.

Crews also include at least one person with medical training for emergencies, as well as a variety of scientists and engineers to operate the habitat's life support systems.

The experiences of each crew varies, depending on the mission design, location and makeup of the crew. My mission was designed so that the six crew members would not have any information about our crewmates until we arrived in Hawaii for training. In addition to geology expertise, I also have some medical training as a Wilderness First Responder, so I was there to assist with any medical issues.

Once in Hawaii, the crew spent three days learning how to operate the habitat systems, including the hydroponic garden and solar panels. We practiced emergency procedures and were taught how to perform other tasks.

After that orientation, we were deployed to the habitat for 28 days. We turned in our phones to mission control and could only access the internet to check emails or use a few preapproved websites required for our daily duties. Our days were scheduled with tasks from wake up, about 6:30 a.m., to lights out, about 10 p.m.

The tasks included a variety of exercises to assess individual and group performance. They included individual assessments – similar to a daily IQ test – and group computer-based tasks, such as team 3D Tetris. The researchers remotely monitored our interactions during these activities, and the results were analyzed as the mission progressed. They used our fluctuating performance on these activities as a proxy for estimating stress levels, group cohesion and individual well-being.

Additionally, we went on two-to-three-hour extra-vehicular activities, or excursions outside the habitat, on alternating days. During these expeditions, we conducted geologic investigations on the volcano. On our “off days,” we spent two hours exercising in the habitat. We had to be fully suited in a mock spacesuit any time we went outside, and we had to be careful about the airlock procedures. We were never outdoors alone.

We could only eat freeze-dried and powdered foods, aside from what we were able to grow in the hydroponic system. We had no additional food delivered during our stay. Water was also rationed, meaning we had to find innovative ways to maintain personal hygiene. For example, a bucket shower one or two times per week was allowed, supplemented by “wilderness wipe” baths. As someone with a lot of very curly hair, I was happy to figure out a method for managing it using less than two liters of water per week. We were also permitted to do laundry once during our stay, as a group. Sorting through your crewmates' wet clothes was certainly one way to bond.

Though physically demanding at times, the workload was not unreasonable. We were kept busy all day, as certain everyday tasks, such as cooking, required more effort than they might need in our normal lives. Preparing nutritionally balanced and palatable meals while rationing our very limited resources was hard, but it also provided opportunities to get creative with recipes and ingredients. We even managed to bake a cake for a crew member's birthday, using peanut butter protein and cocoa powders to flavor it.

After dinner each night, we shared the pre-saved movies and shows we had each brought with us into the habitat, as we could not access the internet. Those of us who had brought physical copies of books into the habitat would trade those as well. One crew member managed to acquire a downloadable form of the daily Wordle, so we could still compete with our friends back home. We also played board games, and all of these activities helped us get to know each other.

Though different from our typical daily lives, the experience was one of a kind. We had the satisfaction of knowing that our efforts advanced space exploration in its own small way, one IQ test and slapdash cake at a time.

If you were following the Sora 2 news closely when the limited public release of OpenAI's new video generator started on September 30, you may have noticed some unsettling videos featuring the likeness and voice of iconic TV actor Bryan Cranston—typically in character as Breaking Bad protagonist Walter White. Cranston evidently saw those too, and he found them so unsettling he reportedly contacted his union, SAG-AFTRA, about it.

But good news: OpenAI has apparently addressed Cranston's misgivings, and he's praising the company publicly now.

In a statement released Monday by SAG-AFTRA (via Deadline), Cranston stated that initially he was “deeply concerned not just for myself, but for all performers whose work and identity can be misused in this way.”

To be specific, he might have been concerned about this video set in a strip mall parking lot in which Cranston (appearing as Walter White) and deceased pop musician Michael Jackson announce to Jackson's vlog viewers that they've been hanging out.

Friends byu/Neat-Stand5202 inSoraAi



Perhaps he also saw this more elaborate work of fan fiction in which Cranston and the rest of the core Breaking Bad cast are in what appears to be the Vietnam War:

Breaking Bad – I Am The Napalm (Parody Music Video)#ai #breakingbad #Memes #sora#sora2 pic.twitter.com/bt59hKqK0t

— Saga Lore AI (@Sagaloreai) October 7, 2025



On October 8, Cranston's agency, released an indignant statement about Sora 2, asking in part:

The question is, does OpenAI and its partner companies believe that humans, writers, artists, actors, directors, producers, musicians, and athletes deserve to be compensated and credited for the work they create? Or does OpenAI believe they can just steal it, disregarding global copyright principles and blatantly dismissing creators' rights, as well as the many people and companies who fund the production, creation, and publication of these humans' work?

On Monday, however, Cranston had seen something he liked, and was no longer upset. He announced that he was “grateful to OpenAI for its policy and for improving its guardrails.”

Additionally, Deadline says SAG-AFTRA, OpenAI, the Association of Talent Agents, United Talent Agency, and Creative Artists Agency all released a related joint statement including the following: “While from the start it was OpenAI's policy to require opt-in for the use of voice and likeness, OpenAI expressed regret for these unintentional generations. OpenAI has strengthened guardrails around replication of voice and likeness when individuals do not opt-in.”

On October 3, well before CAA's angry statement about Sora 2, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman painted a slightly different picture in regards to OpenAI's copyright policy upon the release of Sora 2. He wrote in a blog post that in light of how the product was being used, OpenAI “will give rightsholders more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls,” and added, “We are going to try sharing some of this revenue with rightsholders who want their characters generated by users.”

We asked OpenAI to clarify the timeline of the Sora 2 copyright policy, and will update if we hear back.

Altman wrote in that same post that OpenAI is “going to have to somehow make money for video generation.”

Chances are, you're probably in the dark about a health problem that affects nearly every adult in America. A new survey shows that almost 90% of Americans have never heard of the recently defined syndrome known as cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic, or CKM, syndrome.

The Harris Poll conducted the online survey in August on behalf of the American Heart Association. Based on responses from more than 4,000 people, the survey found that only 12% were previously aware of CKM syndrome. The findings suggest that few people are on the lookout for this condition, despite the vast majority of Americans having some form of it.

“We want people to know that it's really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time,” said Eduardo Sanchez, the American Heart Association's chief medical officer for prevention, in a statement from the organization.

The AHA coined the term “CKM syndrome” in October 2023. The label is meant to reflect the reality that our kidneys and heart depend heavily on each other, and that both in turn are heavily affected by our metabolism.

It broadly combines four other conditions and their associated risk factors: heart disease, kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, all of which can be connected to the others. Someone living with obesity, for instance, is more likely to develop the other three conditions. CKM is further broken down into four stages, depending on the level of risk factors or related diseases a person has. Someone with stage 1 CKM, for example, has no apparent symptoms but does have excess body fat, particularly around the belly.

Past research has found that about 90% of Americans meet the criteria for CKM syndrome, with about 50% in stage 2. Many people also have risk factors that can make them vulnerable to all of the diseases under the umbrella of CKM, such as hypertension, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and excess weight.

In addition to most not knowing about CKM, 68% of respondents in the survey wrongly believed that it's best to take care of these conditions separately or weren't sure about how to manage them. About 42% also incorrectly believed that a healthy heart couldn't be affected by other organs or weren't sure.

“The heart, kidney and metabolic systems are connected and, as such, should be treated in a coordinated way,” Sanchez said. “These results reveal the need to emphasize those connections and help patients understand the importance of collaborative care.”

On the bright side, though most Americans might be unaware about the existence of CKM, plenty in the AHA survey were curious once they were told about it. Over two-thirds felt it was important to learn more about the syndrome or their overall CKM health.

The AHA has just launched a public health campaign on CKM, which includes a dedicated website and short YouTube video. Early next year, the organization will also release the first formal guidelines on the syndrome.

Tomorrow's chips could be cooled by diamonds.

A research team at Stanford University has engineered a new approach to handling the thermal bottleneck of RF transistor by using diamonds. By wrapping transistors in an integrated diamond layer, grown on the transistor, researchers were able to decrease chip temperatures by up to 70°C in the real world, and by 90% in simulated tests.

As published in IEEE Spectrum this week, tests using the new diamond method have proven promising leads in the war against thermal bottlenecks in our electronics. As semiconductors and processors grow ever more powerful and dense, the transistors get ever more tightly packed; for instance, Nvidia's Blackwell GPU architecture holds 208 billion transistors on a single GPU.

All this cramming and shrinking is pushing up against thermal constraints, as innovations in efficiency become counteracted by thermal limits. To this end, Stanford researchers led by Srabanti Chowdhury have been studying the use of diamond layers in transistor fabrication for years, since at least 2022.

The use of diamonds in conjunction with GaN transistors is nothing new; Japan also published research on the topic in 2022, and the U.S.'s DARPA fund hired Raytheon to research the topic in 2024. The biggest innovation achieved by Professor Chowdhury's team this week was the ability to grow diamonds directly on semiconductor devices at a low enough temperature to keep the components alive. Before this breakthrough, diamond sheets at the micrometer scale could only be grown in the range of 1,000 degrees Celsius or higher.

Chowdhury and the team's diamond-growing method is able to produce ""large-grained polycrystalline diamond all around devices at 400°C."" Every word in this quote represents a breakthrough all its own. By adding oxygen to the mix at higher levels than the old methods, non-diamond carbon deposits are etched away, avoiding soot that harms rather than helps conductivity. This 400C temperature is within a survivable range for CMOS devices, while still burning hot enough to create diamonds rather than more soot. The large crystals are also a major part of this method, as producing larger crystals also ensures higher conductivity than a layer of many short crystals sitting next to each other, not spreading heat in a productive manner.

Diamond has been fingered as a component in future chips for years, due to its insanely high thermal conductivity, with single-crystalline diamond measuring six times more conductive than copper. And sourcing and fabbing diamond transistors, while attractive, would be impossible due to the lack of supply in this form factor.

So instead, diamond has become a new component on top of gallium nitride transistors, being grown directly atop semiconductors and forming a silicon carbide interlayer to achieve revolutionary levels of thermal dissipation directly on the transistor. Standard heatsinks on top of semiconductors will never be able to penetrate into a chip to pull heat away from hot spots, especially as 3D chip architectures continue to progress and expand upwards. But a diamond layer surrounding the 3D transistor can seemingly do the job swimmingly.

The Stanford University team is moving forward with industry integration of the diamond conductivity layer. The Pentagon's DARPA program has seemingly wrapped the researchers into its existing GaN transistor diamond project, with results expected in 2027. Beyond defense contracting deals, Stanford also expects to leverage its industry connections with TSMC, Micron, and Samsung to further develop the technology for commercial benefit.

Chipmaking will certainly need to take big swings like this one to survive into the 1nm and smaller era, as fundamental limits of conductivity and heat start mounting exponentially before the transition beyond silicon computing arrives. Time will tell whether printing diamonds on semiconductors can become a stopgap before the end of the silicon era, or even help pave the way to future substrates.

For the 'More-than-Moore' era in chipmaking.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Last week, ASML introduced the Twinscan XT:260 lithography scanner, the industry's first scanner that has been designed from the ground up for advanced 3D packaging, marking a new era in fab tools.

Advanced packaging technologies like TSMC's Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS) are crucially important to achieve the performance scaling necessary to develop artificial intelligence and to evolve supercomputers.

Advanced packaging relies on deposition, etching, lithography, and metrology/inspection tools to make sophisticated chips. But while using these front-end tools is efficient for many steps, they are overengineered for some, and insufficient for others.

""In line with our plans to support our customers in the 3D integration space, we shipped ASML's first product serving Advanced Packaging, the Twinscan XT:260, an i-line scanner offering up to 4x productivity compared to existing solutions."", ASML posted in its Q3 2025 financial results.

ASML's Twinscan XT:260 is an i-line (365 nm) step-and-scan lithography system that processes 300-mm wafers and weds the precision of previous-generation front-end lithography tools with the productivity and flexibility of back-end tools. TSMC claims this provides four times higher productivity compared to 'competing steppers' used for advanced packaging technologies, such as Canon's FPA-5520iV. ASML never named the exact competing product, but Canon's FPA-5520iV is a good bet.

 




The key advantage of the tool compared to some of the existing machines used for advanced packaging is that it supports a high-dose exposures (340 mJ is mentioned, though it is usually tunable) and a 52 mm × 66 mm image field, enabling the tool to process up to 3,432 mm^2 interposers (4X EUV reticle size) without field stitching, which reduces complexity and speeds up the production cycle. For the sake of truth, it should be noted that Canon's FPA-5520iV LF2 Option supports a 52 mm × 68 mm image field, but this is a stepper, not a scanner.

The system delivers 400 nm resolution, a 35 nm overlay, and offers a large depth of focus (11 µm at 1 µm CD) to enable accurate patterning for redistribution layers (RDLs) through-silicon vias (TSVs), and hybrid bonding structures used by modern packaging methods to integrate multi-chiplet designs. The unit also boasts 775 µm through-silicon alignment capabilities to make it particularly suited for bonded or non-planar wafers, which are common in 3D stacking.

The Twinscan XT:260 relies on ASML's dual-stage platform, so it can expose one wafer while simultaneously aligning the next, which significantly increases its performance. Speaking of performance, the machine can process up to 270 wafers per hour (at a 340 mJ dose) and handle thick (0.775 mm – 1.7 mm) or warped (1 mm) wafers.

With a 400 nm resolution, 35 nm overlay, and the ability to handle thick or warped wafers (up to 1.7 mm), the XT:260 is optimized for technologies Intel's Foveros, TSMC's CoWoS and System-on-Integrated-Chips (SoIC), as well as other high-density die-stacking or interposer technologies which require precise alignment through silicon.

The Twinscan XT:260 is positioned below the Twinscan XT:400M, the company's most basic i-line scanner used for chipmaking on mature nodes, but which may be an overkill for chip packaging on advanced nodes for now. Keep in mind that there are plenty of ASML's PAS 5500 i-line steppers that are used for 'more-than-Moore' applications, which is the company's convoluted way of pointing towards advanced packaging.

Compared with Canon's FPA-5520iV and the long-standing PAS 5500 i-line steppers, which have been widely used for CoWoS and fan-out packaging, the XT:260 represents a major leap in both productivity and precision. While the aforementioned tools rely on step-and-repeat exposure with limited throughput and field size (PAS 5500 only), the XT:260 introduces a scanner architecture with continuous wafer movement, advanced alignment optics, and automation suitable for high-volume 3D integration, which will be particularly important given that demand for advanced packaging is increasing.

ASML's Twinscan XT:260 is the industry's first lithography scanner designed specifically for advanced packaging. It's not the only lithography scanner aimed at advanced packaging, though. The semiconductor industry has a choice: Use new tools like the Twinscan XT:260, or repurpose existing tools designed for front-end chip manufacturing for advanced packaging. If ASML's estimations are correct, using this specific tool will be technically beneficial, but may come at significant expense.

 




Previous-generation front-end lithography, etch, and deposition tools offer sub-micron precision, but need ultra-clean processing environments that ensure tight overlay and defect control. This is because they produce thousands of interconnects linking chiplets and HBM stacks in 2.5D, and eventually 3D System-in-Packages (SiPs).

However, these front-end tools are far more expensive — both in terms of price, performance, and total cost of ownership — than what is typically required for back-end packaging steps. Hence, using them in packaging lines drives up cost and limits output. One advantage of using them is that developers, process control engineers, and technicians at Intel and TSMC are familiar with those tools, which almost certainly guarantees good yields and fast ramp-ups. However, it comes at a high cost and a relatively long production cycle.

With tools like ASML's Twinscan XT:260, wafer-level stages that demand extreme precision — TSV formation, RDL patterning, and hybrid bonding — will get faster and therefore cheaper. This will set the stage for the broader adoption of advanced packaging technologies in several years. It'll likely take some time for chipmakers like Intel, Samsung, and TSMC, or OSAT companies like ASE, Amkor, and JCET, to integrate the lithography system into their process technologies and flows.

There are a lot more tools to be designed specifically for advanced packaging. Advanced packaging techniques still rely on 'classic' back-end tools for underfill, molding, ball attach, and many other operations. This hybrid flow balances cost with accuracy: front-end-grade tools where micron (or even nanometer) alignment matters.

As advanced packaging facilities use front-end tools (with appropriate costs), the boundary between foundries and OSATs is blurring. TSMC's CoWoS and SoIC facilities are filled with wafer fab equipment from ASML, Applied Materials, Canon, KLA, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron, and usually cost north of $3 billion, the cost of a chip fab in the early 2010s. This is going to continue as more WFE makers set to produce tools specifically tailored for advanced packaging in the coming years and quarters.

Could help cut costs and improve the efficiency of the latest AI models.

Chinese developers of Deepseek AI have released a new model that leverages its multi-modal capabilities to improve the efficiency of its handling of complex documents and large blocks of text, by converting them into images first, as per SCMP. Vision encoders were able to take large quantities of text and convert them into images, which, when accessed later, required between seven and 20 times fewer tokens, while maintaining an impressive level of accuracy.

Deepseek is the Chinese-developed AI that shocked the world in early 2025, showcasing capabilities similar to those of OpenAI's ChatGPT, or Google's Gemini, despite requiring far less money and data to develop. The creators have continued to work on making the AI more efficient since, and with the latest release known as DeepSeek-OCR (optical character recognition), the AI can deliver an impressive understanding of large quantities of textual data without the usual token overhead.

“Through DeepSeek-OCR, we demonstrated that vision-text compression can achieve significant token reduction – seven to 20 times – for different historical context stages, offering a promising direction” to handle long-context calculations, the developer said.

The new model is made up of two components, the DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M, which acts as the decoder. The encoder can take large quantities of text data and convert it into high-resolution images, while the decoder is particularly adept at taking those high-resolution images and understanding the textual context within them, while requiring fewer tokens to do so than if you just fed the text right into the AI wholesale. It manages this by dissecting each task into separate sub-networks and uses specific AI agent experts to target each subset of the data.

 




This works really well for handling tabulated data, graphs, and other visual representations of information. This could be of particular use in finance, science, or medicine, the developers suggest.

In benchmarking, the developers claim that when reducing the number of tokens by less than a factor of 10, DeepSeek-OCR can maintain a 97% accuracy rating in decoding the information. If the compression ratio is increased to 20 times, the accuracy falls to 60%. That's less desirable and shows there are diminishing returns on this technology, but if a near-100% accuracy rate could be achieved with even a 1-2x compression rate, that could still make a huge difference in the cost of running many of the latest AI models.

It's also being pitched as a way of developing training data for future models, although introducing errors at that point, even in the form of a few percent off base, seems like a bad idea.

AI developers can now run LLMs or other AI workloads on ARM-based MacBooks with the power of Nvidia RTX GPUs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


After getting AMD graphics cards to work on ARM-based MacBooks, TinyCorp has successfully ported its work to USB4/Thunderbolt 4 and built drivers to make Nvidia's RTX 30, 40, and 50 series graphics cards work with MacBooks through external GPU docking stations using either connectivity standard. However, before you get your hopes up, these drivers are designed specifically for AI development and won't get you display functionality on MacBook devices.

The AI startup showed off this new capability on X with instructions on how to install the drivers for AI developers. TinyCorp also shared an image of a MacBook Pro M3 Max running Tinygrad off of an (unnamed) RTX GPU hooked up to an ADT-UT3G dock using USB4.

For now, RTX 30, 40, and 50 series graphics cards are supported. The AI startup mentions that the RTX 20 series might work, but requires additional work on the user's end. The main issue is that TinyCorp's drivers only work with Nvidia GPUs featuring a GPU system processor, which is why no GTX-series graphics cards are supported. AMD GPUs based on RDNA 2, 3, and 4 reportedly work as well.

Getting Nvidia GPUs to run on Apple products has been pretty much impossible ever since Apple ditched Intel processors and switched to its homebrewed M-series processors running on the ARM architecture. Apple's M-series MacBooks are powered exclusively by one massive iGPU inside, so there has not been any requirement for Apple to implement Nvidia or AMD driver support in the ARM versions of MacOS.

This has forced developers and users to make their own drivers by hand for any chance to make MacOS work with Nvidia or AMD graphics cards running on external GPU docks. Luckily for TinyCorp, the AI startup already had experience building all the necessary drivers to run eGPUs on ARM-based MacBooks after it created the world's first external AMD graphics card driven on Apple silicon with USB3, a standard that doesn't even include PCI Express.

TinyCorp's X did not share many details about the development pitfalls the AI-startup inevitably had to plow through to get Nvidia GPUs working on ARM-based MacBooks through USB4 and Thunderbolt 4. But, it was likely easier for TinyCorp to implement Nvidia support with external GPU docks for M-series MacBooks, with their prior experience building the same setup for AMD GPUs on USB3.

USB4/Thunderbolt 4 is also tailor-made for devices such as external GPU docks, boasting native PCIe support, which probably simplifies support further. Not to mention the massive bandwidth improvements USB4/Thunderbolt 4 boasts over classic USB3.

For the AI crowd, this new capability of running Nvidia GPUs on ARM MacBooks will be highly beneficial for running local LLMs and other AI models on cards such as the RTX 5090 at a much faster rate than what Apple's M-series GPUs can achieve.

Good for Intel and the USA.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


When the U.S. government procured a 10% stake in Intel back in late August, it was a major win for Intel as it represented an investment from America, the importance of which cannot be overstated. At the time, Intel's capitalization was a mere $107 billion; now, it is a whopping $181 billion. That deal brought billions of dollars both to the company and to the U.S. government.

""I think we are up $40 billion since I made that big deal for myself,"" said President Donald Trump in an interview with Fox News. ""They came in to see me, and I say, 'You know what? I think United States should own 10% of your company.' And they gave me 10%. It has been good to them too. Their stock has gone up so much that they end up making a fortune, but we make $30 or 40 billion dollars on that deal. And the same thing with that Mountain Pass. But in that case, it's because we want to get the rare earth refined.""

When SoftBank and the U.S. government obtained their stakes in Intel in late August, the company's stock was trading below book value, which means that the company's assets were worth more than its market capitalization. While the company had been posting losses for several consecutive quarters and was still not out of the woods, its low market capitalization was generally a reflection of its damaged reputation.

The company has managed to capitalize on 5G, cloud, and HPC megatrends but largely failed to capitalize on the AI goldrush. Nonetheless, Intel still supplies more data center and telco-oriented CPUs than its rivals. The company has yet to become a significant player in the foundry market, and it does not look like Intel Foundry has many major clients beyond AWS, Microsoft, and U.S. defense work.

However, Intel has managed to develop five production nodes in four years and is about to start mass production on its 18A process technology and shift a substantial portion of its production from TSMC to its own fabs. Last but not least, Intel has been losing market share to AMD but remains the world's biggest supplier of CPUs for both client and data center applications, which is a big deal.

Not a lot has changed since the US government's investment in August: the company is still losing money and market share, all while not gaining a firmer position in the foundry market, which proves the point that Intel's diminishing valuation was caused by its reputation and business performance rather than its market position and prospects.

Since then, in addition to selling its stake to the U.S. government and SoftBank, Intel has inked a strategic deal with Nvidia under which it will supply data center-grade CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms, integrate Nvidia GPUs designed for Intel's client system-in-packages, and receive a 5% stake from Nvidia. The deal is a huge financial win for the troubled CPU maker and also a significant vote of confidence in the company and its products, as it essentially proves that Nvidia acknowledges the prowess of Intel CPUs in particular and the x86 instruction set architecture in general.

Still, helping Intel survive its current turmoil makes a lot of sense for the U.S. government, as it is largely a matter of national security and industrial sovereignty. Intel is the only American company capable of manufacturing leading-edge logic chips, which are critical for AI, defense, and national security systems.

Backing Intel secures onshore chip production, reduces dependence on TSMC and Samsung in Asia, and advances the longer-term goal of rebuilding the domestic semiconductor supply chain. It also protects a strategic national asset from foreign influence and strengthens America's position in the global race against China.

In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)-induced cardiomyopathy whose left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) recovered after catheter ablation, the selective withdrawal of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) did not compromise LV systolic function, rhythm maintenance, or remodelling.

""The study findings suggest that lifelong continuation of GDMT may not be universally required for all patients with AIC [AF-induced cardiomyopathy] who achieve sustained recovery of LV systolic function following restoration of SR [sinus rhythm] with catheter ablation,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sayed Al-Aidarous, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, England. It was published online on October 13, 2025, in Open Heart.

This study was retrospective and non-randomised, with physician-driven therapy decisions. The cohort size was reduced owing to stringent imaging requirements. Methods of rhythm monitoring varied across patients.

This study received funding from the British Heart Foundation Clinical Intermediate Fellowship. Several authors reported receiving speaker fees, consultancy fees, grants, and fellowships and having other financial ties with various companies, including Medtronic, Biosense Webster, and Abbott. One author reported receiving a UK Research and Innovation Future Leaders Fellowship.

An initially large improvement in fitness levels experienced by patients with severe obesity who either had gastric bypass surgery or no intervention over an 11.5-year period ebbed over time but remained higher than fitness levels in nonsurgical patients for more than a decade.

""Given the role of both bariatric surgery and high fitness in reducing morbidity and mortality, patients and physicians should couple the initial fitness improvements from surgery with an opportunity for structured exercise interventions to establish a foundation for long-term habits of physical activity and exercise, minimizing weight recurrence, retaining muscle and cardiovascular fitness, and ensuring long-term health benefits,"" the authors wrote.

The study, led by Taggert J. Barton, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, was published online in Obesity.

The study population was relatively homogeneous, consisting primarily of White participants. Because participants willingly completed multiple treadmill tests, they probably represented a healthier subset of the parent study population. Using weight-bearing exercise testing as the sole fitness indicator limited the ability to detect changes independent of weight loss.

This study was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and National Center for Research Resources. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Memory and verbal fluency declined at a significantly slower pace in people who quit smoking in mid‑to-late life compared to those who continued smoking, with cognitive benefits from quitting observed regardless of specific age at cessation, a new study showed.

""This finding is especially important because middle-aged and older smokers are less likely to try to quit than younger groups, yet they disproportionately experience the harms of smoking. Evidence that quitting may support cognitive health could offer new compelling motivation for this group to try and quit smoking,"" lead author Mikaela Bloomberg, PhD, University College London, London, England, said in a press release.

The study was published online on October 13 in The Lancet Healthy Longevity.

Unmeasured confounding may have affected causality assumptions, and the decision to quit smoking may depend on cognitive function. Between-cohort differences in wording of the smoking question could have affected the ability to capture occasional smokers. The included participants were somewhat healthier than excluded participants, potentially affecting generalizability. Additionally, the study probably included individuals whose health was less affected by smoking compared to average smokers.

The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging and National Institute for Health and Care Research. One investigator reported receiving funding from Cancer Research UK and royalties from Wiley. The others reported no relevant financial relationships.

SGLT2 inhibitors may be a better treatment option for some older, frail patients hospitalized with heart failure, according to a study presented at the 2025 annual meeting of the Heart Failure Society of America.

Results linked SGLT2 inhibitors to significantly lower mortality and fewer heart failure-related readmissions when compared with angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) in frail, older adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

The real-world analysis adds to mounting evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF and sheds light on outcomes in a vulnerable group for whom clinical guidance remains limited.

“Older adults with HFpEF and frailty represent a complex and understudied population,” said study author Miranda Huebner, DO, an internist at UnityPoint Health in Des Moines, Iowa, who presented the findings during a late-breaking poster session. “In this population, I would initiate SGLT2 inhibitors before considering ARNIs. Across the board, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with lower all-cause mortality and fewer heart failure-related admissions.”

The retrospective analysis used data from the TriNetX Research Network to identify adults aged 65 years and older who were hospitalized with HFpEF and had at least one frailty-related diagnosis, such as cachexia, sarcopenia, or recurrent falls, between January 2019 and December 2023. Researchers included patients if they started an SGLT2 inhibitor or an ARNI during the hospitalization period and had not previously received the comparator drug. Those with systolic heart failure or end-stage renal disease were excluded.

After propensity score matching, 623 patients remained in each treatment group. Outcomes were assessed at 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment initiation.

SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a 24% lower risk for all-cause mortality at 90 days (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93), a 19% lower risk at 6 months (HR, 0.81; 95% CI 0.68-0.95), and a 16% risk reduction at 1 year (HR, 0.84; 95% CI 0.73-0.97) compared with ARNI use. Patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors also experienced fewer heart failure-related hospital readmissions at each follow-up point, with consistent benefit across age, sex, and comorbidity subgroups.

Paul Heidenreich, MD, a professor of medicine and vice chair for quality in the Department of Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, said the results align with existing treatment guidelines but warrant careful interpretation.

“The guidelines — and randomized trial data — suggest SGLT2 inhibitors should be first-line treatment for HFpEF,” Heidenreich told Medscape Medical News. “These findings are consistent with that, though the observational nature of the data makes the results uncertain and in need of confirmation with a randomized trial.” Heidenreich was not involved with the study.

He noted several possible sources of residual confounding inherent to real-world analyses. 

“Patients with more severe heart failure may have been preferentially treated with ARNIs, while some patients with minimal heart failure may have been put on SGLT2 inhibitors for treatment of diabetes or prediabetes, ” he said. “Thus, SGLT2 inhibition treatment may be a marker of mild heart failure while ARNI treatment may be a marker of worse heart failure, and available patient data may be inadequate for complete risk adjustment.”

At the same time, he added, the results are consistent with current standards of care.

“Since the guidelines already indicate SGLT2 inhibitors should be first-line therapy, these results are practice-reinforcing rather than practice-changing,” he said.

Frailty is common among older adults with HFpEF but underrepresented in randomized trials, leaving uncertainty about optimal treatment. This analysis sought to address that gap by comparing real-world outcomes among older adults with clinical markers of frailty.

The findings support the current emphasis on SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF management while highlighting the need for data specific to frail patients.

Heidenreich emphasized that, given the study's observational design, the results should be interpreted with caution. Randomized trials that include frail older adults are still needed to confirm whether the apparent advantage of SGLT2 inhibitors reflects a true treatment effect rather than residual confounding.

Huebner and Heidenreich report no relevant financial relationships.

Higher levels of sedentary behaviour in early to mid-pregnancy were associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia — especially severe and preterm forms, whereas higher levels of physical activity were associated with a lower risk across all preeclampsia subtypes.

""Reduced sedentary time and increased physical activity are important non-pharmacological interventions to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease in non-pregnant individuals,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Emelie Lindberger, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, and was published online on October 13, 2025, in Scientific Reports.

The observational study design only allowed the assessment of associations rather than causality. A large proportion of participants were not included due to non-compliance, technical difficulties, insufficient wear time, or loss to follow-up.

Open access funding for this study was provided by Uppsala University. The authors declared having no competing interests.

More than a year has passed since Bill C-64, the Pharmacare Act, received Royal Assent.

The bill was enacted on October 10, 2024, to develop national, universal pharmacare in Canada for the roughly 1.1 million Canadians without drug insurance. The government has signed bilateral agreements with British Columbia, Manitoba, Yukon, and Prince Edward Island. Those agreements are valued at CAD $928 million over 4 years, starting in 2026.

The core principles of the bill include ensuring that pharmaceuticals are accessible regardless of location or income, minimizing financial barriers, prioritizing patient safety, and advocating for universal health coverage across Canada.

As a first step, the bill has focused on providing coverage for diabetes and contraception medications at little or no cost. It established a fund to improve Canadians' access to supplies needed to manage and monitor diabetes, such as syringes and glucose test strips. It also established the Canadian Drug Agency and tasked it with developing a national formulary, a bulk purchasing strategy, and a strategy for the appropriate use of prescription drugs. 

The four bilateral agreements affect roughly 18% of Canadians, including an estimated 3.8 million Canadians with diagnosed diabetes, and more than 1.7 million women of reproductive age.

The remaining provinces have opposed the adoption of the Pharmacare Act on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that the federal plan risks disrupting coverage for Canadians who already have insurance. Officials in Quebec and Alberta argue that healthcare falls under provincial jurisdiction. They oppose what they consider to be federal interference with their existing public and private prescription drug insurance plans. 

The federal government has attempted to allay these concerns. “Early feedback from the rollout of pharmacare coverage in Manitoba and Prince Edward Island indicates that removing cost barriers for contraception and diabetes medications is making a positive difference for patients,” noted Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada in a statement. “The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the existing agreements, and we are working with provinces and territories to support better outcomes for all Canadians. The Government will continue to monitor and evaluate the existing pharmacare agreement.”

“There are several potential benefits to Bill C-64,” Seema Nagpal, MD, chief science officer at the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, told Medscape Medical News. “Having said that, the implementation details of the pharmacare program are not yet very clear. When will it expand? What is included? What is the role of private insurance? Are there criteria for access? Does the process place an additional administrative burden on physicians? The answers to these questions impact [drug] access. We want to ensure that all Canadians get access to evidence-based medications that are recommended by Canadian guidelines, and this bill may point us in that direction,” said Nagpal.

But others express greater doubt. The benefits of the bill as it currently stands are limited, according to Joe Farago, executive director of market access at Innovative Medicines Canada, a national association of pharmaceutical companies. “Amending the bill would better address the uninsured across Canada, which would make the most of the funding that's laid out, and this would offer patients and clinicians better access to the medicines they need.” 

The bill is focused on a single public payer approach, which would transfer costs that employers now cover to the public system, Farago explained. This change would limit the value of the funds to transfer because the public system would now bear the cost of running programs, managing formularies, negotiating prices, and processing claims. “To gain the most value for patients, you need to allow provinces to allocate funds to their public programs while preserving the dual market [ie, the availability of public and private insurance] that is established across all the provinces. For example, patients with private coverage benefit from much faster, broader, and easier access to medicines.

“Public programs have the most to gain from expanding their coverage or from reducing the out-of-pocket burden for patients, which tends to be the focus of those who are advocating for a universal program,” he continued. “Canadians who have private coverage have broader access to many classes of diabetes drugs. And, of course, contraceptives are covered on most employer programs. If the coverage is expanded on the public-only programs, clearly, that would benefit patients. The current position of patients with diabetes is that the list [of medications] being offered doesn't cover all the diabetic medication, so it limits access.”

But Bill C-64 has its supporters, too. “This is a monumental win for workers and their families,” said Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), in a statement. “For too long, people across this country have had to choose between putting food on the table and paying for the medications they need. Bill C-64 brings us one step closer to ending that predicament, but we still have work to do. 

“Canada's unions urge all levels of government to move swiftly and decisively to ensure that this is just the beginning. Bill C-64 sets the framework, but it is essential that provincial and territorial governments sign bilateral agreements to implement the program fully and equitably across the country,” Bruske added. 

The CLC has called on the federal government to ensure that the Committee of Experts, which was established to make recommendations about the future of national pharmacare, is free of conflicts of interest that could influence its work. “We will keep pushing for a truly universal, single-payer pharmacare program, as recommended by the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare, which was headed up by former Ontario Health Minister Dr. Eric Hoskins,” the statement continued.

Nagpal and Farago reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Among US veterans, same-day receipt of both the 2024-2025 COVID‑19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine was associated with lower risks for emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths compared with receipt of the influenza vaccine alone.

“The evidence may help inform ongoing discussions about the value of COVID-19 vaccines in the current epidemiologic landscape,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Miao Cai, PhD , Research and Development Service, Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System, and the Veterans Research and Education Foundation of St. Louis, Missouri. It was published online on October 8, 2025, in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The demographic composition of the cohort — predominantly older, White, male veterans — may limit the generalizability of the study. Although numerous covariates were adjusted for, residual confounding could not be fully ruled out. Safety and variant‑specific effectiveness were not assessed.

The study was supported by a grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Two authors disclosed consulting for Pfizer.

An immune checkpoint inhibitor already approved for advanced cancers is set to become a new standard of care in the adjuvant setting for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) across Europe.

The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a favorable opinion for Libtayo (cemiplimab, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) as adjuvant treatment for adults with CSCC at high risk for recurrence after surgery and radiation. 

The recommendation follows compelling results from the global phase 3 C-POST trial, in which Libtayo reduced the risk for disease recurrence or death by 68% compared with placebo. 

CSCC is a nonmelanoma skin cancer that ranks among the most common cancers globally. In the European Union, nonmelanoma skin cancer incidence overall is projected to rise by 40% by 2040. Although surgery often successfully treats it, many patients present with high-risk disease that behaves more aggressively, leading to greater recurrence and progression risks.

The active substance of Libtayo is cemiplimab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells. Through PD-1 binding, it blocks cancer cells from exploiting the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.

C-POST enrolled 415 participants, who were then randomly assigned to receive either cemiplimab (n = 209) or placebo (n = 206) for up to 48 weeks. 

Participants faced high recurrence risk due to nodal characteristics such as extracapsular extension or three or more involved lymph nodes, and/or non-nodal characteristics including in-transit metastases, T4 lesion, perineural invasion, or locally recurrent tumor with one or more additional poor prognostic factors.

The treatment protocol involved administration of cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for the initial 12 weeks, followed by 700 mg every 6 weeks for the remaining 36 weeks, or placebo. 

At a median follow-up of 24 months, cemiplimab reduced the risk for disease recurrence or death by 68% compared with placebo, which was the primary endpoint. Estimated 24-month disease-free survival reached 87.1% with cemiplimab compared with 64.1% for placebo. Benefits extended across all patterns of recurrence. Locoregional recurrence occurred in 4% of cemiplimab-treated patients vs 17% of placebo recipients, while distant recurrence affected 5% vs 13%, respectively. Disease-free survival events totaled 24 in the cemiplimab arm compared with 65 in the placebo group. 

The safety profile was consistent with established data for cemiplimab monotherapy in advanced cancers. While adverse events occurred at similar overall rates in both treatment arms (91% with cemiplimab vs 89% with placebo), grade 3 or higher events were more frequent with active treatment (24% vs 14%). 

The most reported adverse events with cemiplimab included fatigue, pruritus, rash, diarrhea, arthralgia, hypothyroidism, and maculopapular rash. Hypertension was the only grade 3 or higher adverse event occurring in more than 2% of patients in the cemiplimab arm. Adverse events led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 10% of patients receiving cemiplimab compared with 2% of those receiving placebo. Two patients in each treatment arm experienced fatal adverse events.

The positive opinion from the CHMP is an intermediary step because this medicine is under additional monitoring. A final decision on the marketing application from the European Commission is expected in the coming months. This follows an approval for the same indication by the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this month. 

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product characteristics, which will be published on the European Medicines Agency's website in all official EU languages after a decision on this change to the marketing authorization has been granted by the European Commission.

A tiny wireless chip implanted in the back of the eye and a pair of high-tech glasses have partially restored vision to people with an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration. In a clinical trial led by Stanford Medicine researchers and international collaborators, 27 out of 32 participants had regained the ability to read a year after receiving the device. 

With digital enhancements enabled by the device, such as zoom and higher contrast, some participants could read with acuity equivalent to 20/42 vision.

The results of the trial will be published Oct. 20 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The device, called PRIMA, developed at Stanford Medicine, is the first eye prosthesis to restore functional sight to patients with incurable vision loss, giving them the ability to perceive shapes and patterns - also known as form vision.

""All previous attempts to provide vision with prosthetic devices resulted in basically light sensitivity, not really form vision,"" said Daniel Palanker, PhD, a professor of ophthalmology and a co-senior author of the paper. ""We are the first to provide form vision.""

The other senior author is José-Alain Sahel, MD, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The lead author is Frank Holz, MD, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Bonn in Germany.

The two-part device consists of a small camera, mounted on a pair of glasses, that captures images and projects them in real time via infrared light to a wireless chip in the eye. The chip converts the images into electrical stimulation, effectively taking the place of natural photoreceptors that have been damaged by disease.

PRIMA is the culmination of decades of development, prototypes, animal trials and a small first-in-human trial.

Palanker first imagined such a device 20 years ago, when he was working with ophthalmic lasers used to treat eye conditions. ""I realized we should use the fact that the eye is transparent and deliver information by light,"" he said.

The device we imagined in 2005 now works in patients remarkably well.""

Daniel Palanker, PhD, Professor, Ophthalmology, Stanford Medicine

Participants in the new trial had an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration, known as geographic atrophy, that gradually erodes central vision. Over 5 million people globally are affected by the condition, and it is the most common cause of irreversible blindness among the elderly.

Macular degeneration destroys light-sensitive photoreceptors in the center of the retina, the thin neural tissue in the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals that then travel to the brain. But most patients retain some photoreceptor cells that allow peripheral vision as well as the retinal neurons that relay information from photoreceptors. 

The new device takes advantage of what is preserved.

The 2-by-2-millimeter chip that receives images is implanted in the part of the retina where photoreceptors have been lost. The chip is sensitive to infrared light projected from the glasses, unlike real photoreceptors that respond only to visible light.

""The projection is done by infrared because we want to make sure it's invisible to the remaining photoreceptors outside the implant,"" Palanker said.

The design means patients can use their natural peripheral vision along with the prosthetic central vision, which helps with orientation and navigation.

""The fact that they see simultaneously prosthetic and peripheral vision is important because they can merge and use vision to its fullest,"" Palanker said.

Because the chip is photovoltaic, meaning it needs only light to generate electric current, it can operate wirelessly and be implanted under the retina. Previous eye prostheses required an external power source and a cable running out of the eye.

The new trial included 38 patients older than 60 who had geographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration and worse than 20/320 vision in at least one eye.

Four to five weeks after implantation of the chip in one eye, patients began using the glasses. Though some patients could make out patterns immediately, all patients' visual acuity improved over months of training.

""It may take several months of training to reach top performance - which is similar to what cochlear implants require to master prosthetic hearing,"" Palanker said.

Of the 32 patients who completed the one-year trial, 27 could read and 26 demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity, which was defined as the ability to read at least two additional lines on a standard eye chart. On average, participants' visual acuity improved by 5 lines; one improved by 12 lines.

The participants used the prosthesis in their daily lives to read books, food labels and subway signs. The glasses allowed them to adjust contrast and brightness and magnify up to 12 times. Two-thirds reported medium to high user satisfaction with the device.

Nineteen participants experienced side effects, including ocular hypertension (high pressure in the eye), tears in the peripheral retina and subretinal hemorrhage (blood collecting under the retina). None were life-threatening, and almost all resolved within two months.

For now, the PRIMA device provides only black-and-white vision, with no shades in between, but Palanker is developing software that will soon enable the full range of grayscale.

""Number one on the patients' wish list is reading, but number two, very close behind, is face recognition,"" he said. ""And face recognition requires grayscale.""

He is also engineering chips that will offer higher resolution vision. Resolution is limited by the size of pixels on the chip. Currently, the pixels are 100 microns wide, with 378 pixels on each chip. The new version, already tested in rats, may have pixels as small as 20 microns wide, with 10,000 pixels on each chip.

Palanker also wants to test the device for other types of blindness caused by lost photoreceptors.

""This is the first version of the chip, and resolution is relatively low,"" he said. ""The next generation of the chip, with smaller pixels, will have better resolution and be paired with sleeker-looking glasses.""

A chip with 20-micron pixels could give a patient 20/80 vision, Palanker said. ""But with electronic zoom, they could get close to 20/20.""

New research reveals that the number and complexity of cancer clinical trials since 2001 have varied across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with economic growth contributing to disparities, but only to a certain extent. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Although LMICs are expected to experience the greatest global burden of cancer in the coming years, cancer clinical trials are disproportionately concentrated in high-income countries. Because evidence suggests that LMICs have increased the number of cancer clinical trials over the last few decades, researchers investigated disparities in the number and complexity of such trials among LMICs over time and according to economic changes.

Between 2001 and 2020, a total of 16,977 cancer clinical trials in LMICs were registered. The Asian countries of China and South Korea experienced strong economic growth and increases in clinical trials. Similar trends, though less impressive, were observed in Eastern European countries and the Western Asian/Southern European country of Turkey.

Conversely, South and Southeast Asian countries like India, Thailand, and Vietnam-which also experienced strong economic growth-had mainly inconsistent growth in clinical trials. The North and South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were able to increase their number of clinical trials despite relative economic stagnation. Among African countries, Egypt showed strong economic growth with a corresponding increase in clinical trials, but no such correlation was seen in South Africa.

Taken together, the findings suggest that economic growth is a contributor but not the single determinant of cancer clinical trial growth among LMICs.

We believe these data offer valuable insights for LMICs aiming to enhance clinical research.""

An international research team led by the Medical University of Vienna has demonstrated for the first time that thyroid hormone plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. By blocking a specific thyroid hormone receptor, cancer growth was inhibited in both animal models and tumor cell cultures. The study results, currently published in the top journal Molecular Cancer, thus provide a new approach for the treatment of prostate tumors, especially in a phase where current methods fail.

The research team led by Olaf Merkel, Brigitte Hantusch and Lukas Kenner (all from the Clinical Department of Pathology at MedUni Vienna) and first author Aleksandra Fesiuk (Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy at MedUni Vienna) focused on the role of the thyroid hormone receptor TRβ (thyroid hormone receptor beta) in tumor development. In laboratory experiments, activation of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) led to a sharp increase in prostate cancer cells. However, when TRβ was inhibited with NH-3, an active substance currently used only in research for the targeted blocking of TRβ, the growth of cancer cells decreased significantly.

This effect was confirmed in animal models: tumors treated with NH-3 remained smaller or developed significantly more slowly. NH-3 proved particularly effective in models of so-called castration-resistant prostate cancer - a form that continues to grow despite hormone deprivation therapy and is currently difficult to treat. Blocking TRβ also led to a loss of the androgen receptor signal, which is normally activated by male sex hormones and plays a central role in the progression of the disease. Data from patient cohorts support these findings: tissue samples showed increased levels of TRβ in prostate tumours compared to healthy tissue. Furthermore, genetic analyses show that mutations in many prostate cancer patients alter thyroid hormone signalling pathways.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Austria. In its early stages, the disease is usually treated with hormone deprivation therapies that reduce the influence of testosterone. However, most patients develop resistance to these therapies. Effective treatment options are currently limited at this stage. The latest findings have identified a previously unknown mechanism that opens up new perspectives: ""Our results suggest that TRβ is not only a driver of tumor growth, but could also serve as a potential target for new drugs,"" says study leader Lukas Kenner. The study found that combining NH-3 with established androgen receptor inhibitors was particularly interesting, as it showed increased efficacy in preclinical experiments.

By teaching artificial intelligence to spot every bite a child takes, scientists are revealing hidden eating patterns that could transform how we prevent obesity from the dinner table outward.

Study: ByteTrack: a deep learning approach for bite count and bite rate detection using meal videos in children. Image credit: Andrii Spy_k/Shutterstock.com

Eating behaviors shed light on the risk for overconsumption and obesity. A new study published in the journal Frontiers in Nutrition presents a deep learning system to analyze bite behavior among children, using videos that record children's meals.

Meal microstructure describes the various behaviors that occur during a bout of eating: bites, chews, bite rate, and bite size. Analyzing meal microstructure helps to identify individual eating patterns and their variations across a spectrum of food types and uncover the mechanisms that underlie eating disorders and obesity.

Children who develop obesity are more likely to take larger bites and eat faster, both of which increase the amount of food consumed. Preventive interventions could be tailored using observed meal microstructure, providing a novel means of curbing this epidemic.

The gold standard for analyzing bite and microstructure is manual observational coding, which involves manually viewing video recordings of children's eating behaviors and annotating them with timestamps. Though very reliable and accurate, this method is labor-intensive and requires large amounts of time, in addition to being costly.

Compared to manual coding, automated bite detection systems could be much more efficient and scalable. However, these mostly use adult data from acoustic sensors and accelerometers, based on preset motion limits. Such sensors may misinterpret drinking, or gesturing, for instance, as bites.

Again, various methods of eating (with spoons, chopsticks, or by hand) could cause issues with detection by increasing the difficulty of the act. Moreover, the wide variability of the act itself makes it difficult to automate its detection across different settings.

This has led to the use of automated platforms to detect bites. These platforms may use location-based criteria (hand-face distance, mouth opening) or optical flow methods to track movements across successive frames. However, they cannot reliably distinguish eating behavior from other movements that are especially common in children.

This has prompted interest in deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), mostly trained and tested on tightly controlled video recordings of eating, often by adults. In the real world, such videos are uncommon; the norm is poor lighting and differences in eating movements. Deep learning technology could help overcome interpretation difficulties caused by such artefacts.

ByteTrack is a deep learning system that uses video-recorded child meals to find the bite count and bite rate. It was trained on 242 videos (1440 minutes) recorded from 94 children aged 7-9, who each completed four meal sessions one week apart. A 52-video subset was used to train the face detection component of the system. The videos were augmented to introduce real-world-like changes in the recording conditions.

For the video recording, the children ate four meals, one week apart, comprising the same food but in different amounts. The system works in two stages. The first stage is used for face detection, locking on the face of the target child while ignoring other people and objects.

Two systems were used for this purpose, one focusing on rapid face recognition and the other on recognition in challenging situations when the face is partly blocked. The combination thus aims to achieve efficient and accurate face detection.

The second uses this clean data to distinguish bite activity from other movements. For this purpose, an EfficientNet convolutional neural network (CNN) was combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent network. The model adjusted for blur, low light, change in orientation, rotation, camera shake, and hands or utensils blocking the view of the mouth. The results obtained by the model were compared against manual observational coding.

ByteTrack testing showed high accuracy of recall and precision, at >98%. This showed that the technology balanced speed with the ability to tolerate variable visual appearances related to the bite behavior.

The second stage showed moderate performance in bite detection, achieving on average 79% precision, 68% recall, and an F1 score of ~71%. There was an overall overcounting of bites, especially during the early part of the meal. Longer eating sessions or the later part of the meal tended to be associated with undercounting bites.

The reasons include rapid biting and falsely increasing bite detection. Later, children begin to lose interest in the food, which could produce more movement, including those that block the mouth, reducing bite detection.

It had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.66 with the gold-standard coding, though videos where the child moved too much or where hands or utensils blocked the mouth were less reliable. Even so, ByteTrack reflects real-world situations more accurately, with other people present while the child ate (around 80% of the recorded meals included additional people to simulate natural mealtime environments).

It is less intrusive than other wearable sensors mounted on eyeglasses or bite counter watches that must be switched on and off, potentially disrupting the natural flow of the eating process. Though ByteTrack must be started and stopped manually, it is not yet optimized for real-time bite detection. Still, it remains less intrusive and closer to naturalistic observations than wearable systems.

Smartphone cameras could be used for natural recording in the future, and combined with platforms like ByteTrack, provided data privacy can be ensured. The time and effort saved by such technological applications is enormous, indicating a vast need for their development. In addition, these eliminate sources of human error like fatigue, inexperience, and misinterpretation by using the same criteria to interpret all videos. Further enhancement is needed before such platforms are available for real-time use.

This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a scalable, automated tool for bite detection in children's meals.”

ByteTrack is the first automated system specifically developed to analyze pediatric eating behavior, and its moderate success is encouraging.

The limitations of this method were apparent, and newer techniques need to be devised to increase reliability in the presence of occlusions or with high movement. Future work is required to make the platform more robust across different populations and under different recording situations.

A research team from the University of Zurich and the University Children's Hospital Zurich has developed a new approach for treating children with malignant tumors of the nervous system. By combining an approved drug with a specialized diet, they were able to slow down tumor growth and stimulate cancer cells to mature into normal nerve cells.

Neuroblastomas are malignant tumors of the nervous system and rank among the most common and aggressive solid tumors in children. Most affected children are younger than five years of age. Particularly in high-risk neuroblastoma, the prognosis remains poor despite intensive treatment, with only half of children being cured.

A research team led by Raphael Morscher, research group leader and attending physician at the University of Zurich (UZH) and the University Children's Hospital Zurich, has now developed a novel therapeutic approach together with international partners. The researchers focused on a drug-diet combination with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a drug recently approved in Switzerland. DFMO inhibits the production of so-called polyamines, which play a key role in tumor cell growth in children.

We discovered that the effectiveness of DFMO can be more than doubled in mice when a targeted, proline- and arginine-free diet is applied under controlled conditions.""

Raphael Morscher, research group leader and attending physician at the University of Zurich (UZH) and the University Children's Hospital Zurich

The diet amplifies the drug's effects by additionally blocking the formation of polyamine precursors.

Rather than destroying the cancer cells, the treatment drives them to mature. This puts a stop to the tumor's unrestrained cell division, and the cells begin to transform into more mature nerve cells - a natural process that is blocked in neuroblastoma.""The treatment not only slows down tumor growth but also brings about a functional change in the cancer cells,"" says Morscher, describing the new therapeutic approach. In the pre-clinical mouse models, the tumors grew significantly more slowly or even regressed - and the treatment was well tolerated. It targets protein production in cancer cells by preventing specific genetic blueprints from being correctly read and translated. This changes the cells' function and promotes the maturation of the cancer cells.

Raphael Morscher's research team is now collaborating with international partners at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Princeton University to prepare the therapy for clinical application. ""To bring this innovative approach into clinical trials, we are using an enzyme that replaces the diet in children. Our goal is to offer affected children a new and gentler treatment option in the future,"" says Morscher.

Cyclana Bio, a biotechnology company pioneering tissue-level approaches to women's health, today announced the close of a £5M pre-seed funding round, co-led by NfX and Eka VC, and including Cocoa VC, Wilbe, and Angel investors. The investment will enable Cyclana Bio to develop functional disease models and its platform, dedicated to revolutionising women's health through tissue level therapeutics, starting with the discovery of treatments for endometriosis.

Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating lifelong condition that affects 1 in 10 women worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the disease physiology of endometriosis remains poorly understood and treatment options remain limited. Cyclana Bio is addressing a need to better serve millions of women by developing physiologically relevant models and utilising AI-driven multi-scale data integration to enable the discovery of druggable targets to improve treatment outcomes.

Cyclana Bio has demonstrated the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in endometriosis, where dysregulation of the ECM causes inflammation and loss of tissue function. Until now, drug development strategies to treat endometriosis have focused on intracellular mechanisms, failing to target the interaction between cells and the ECM, and have resulted in sub-optimal treatment efficacy. The Company is focused on building whole tissue models of disease, harnessing menstrual fluid, received from donations from an observational clinical trial, and lab-based modelling to uncover early biomarkers of disease and identify novel targets for drug development. Initially focused on endometriosis, Cyclana Bio's whole tissue-based methodology represents a promising approach to address other underserved chronic inflammatory diseases that share similar tissue-level mechanisms.

Our mission at Cyclana is not just to close the gender health gap but propel women to the forefront of drug discovery. We are redefining how therapies are developed, starting with the basic science, by zooming out and studying disease at the level where it truly emerges: the tissue itself. By raising venture capital as our first source of financing, we are building a model with the consumer, the patient, at the centre. We now have not only the privilege but also the responsibility to generate the best pipeline to bring new treatments to the clinic.""

Dr. Léa Wenger, CEO and Co-Founder, Cyclana Bio

""Our goal is not just to develop new treatments, but to change the framework of biomedical discovery itself,"" Prof. Kevin Chalut, CSO and Co-Founder, Cyclana Bio, added. ""By starting with women's health, we're addressing one of the greatest unmet needs in medicine. In doing so, we will not only cure a debilitating disease many women suffer from, we will also set the stage for a broader transformation in how we understand and treat chronic disease.""

In a landmark public health achievement, Fiji has been validated by the World Health Organization (WHO) for eliminating trachoma as a public health problem. Trachoma, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and the world's leading infectious cause of blindness, no longer poses a public health threat in the country.

Trachoma is the first NTD to be eliminated in Fiji. Fiji is the 26th country to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem and the 58th country globally to eliminate at least one NTD.

WHO congratulates Fiji and its network of global and local partners on reaching this milestone. Future generations of Fijians have been given a precious gift in being set free from the suffering that trachoma has inflicted on their ancestors.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

Trachoma is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis and spreads through personal contact, interactions with contaminated surfaces and on flies that have been in contact with eye or nose discharge of an infected person. Repeated infections can lead to scarring, in-turning of the eyelids, and ultimately blindness. Globally, the disease remains endemic in many vulnerable communities where access to clean water and sanitation is limited.

""Fiji's success in eliminating trachoma is a beacon of what's possible when communities, governments, and partners unite behind a shared goal"", said Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. ""This is a celebration of the power of Pacific leadership and the impact of sustained investment in health. WHO congratulates Fiji and is committed to supporting countries across the Region in advancing health for all so that no one is left behind.""

Trachoma was once a significant public health problem in Fiji, with medical reports from the 1930s and community-based surveys in the 1950s documenting widespread disease and risk of blindness. By the 1980s, the condition had declined markedly, with cataract and refractive error emerging as the main causes of vision loss.

Concern however was renewed in the 2000s, when rapid assessments suggested high levels of active trachoma in children, prompting the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to launch a comprehensive programme to better understand the situation and take necessary action.

Since 2012, Fiji has undertaken a series of robust, internationally supported surveys and studies, including population-based prevalence surveys and laboratory testing, to understand the local epidemiology of trachoma and distinguish it from other causes of eye disease. This sustained effort, integrated with school health, water and sanitation initiatives, and community awareness programmes, has confirmed that trachoma is no longer a public health problem in Fiji and that systems are in place to identify and manage future cases.

 ""Fiji's elimination of trachoma is a defining moment for health equity in the Pacific,"" said Honourable Dr Ratu Atonio Rabici Lalabalavu, Minister of Health and Medical Services of Fiji. ""This achievement reflects years of coordinated action – across villages, health facilities and regional platforms – demonstrating unwavering commitment of our health- care workers, communities leading the change. As we celebrate this milestone, we call on our donors and partners in the Pacific and beyond to continue supporting accelerated action of neglected tropical diseases to address other diseases not only in Fiji, but across the Pacific"". 

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases and conditions associated with devastating health, social and economic consequences. They are mainly prevalent mostly among impoverished communities in tropical areas. WHO estimates that NTDs affect more than 1 billion people.

The targets included in the Road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030 cover the prevention, control, elimination and eradication of 20 diseases and disease groups by 2030.

Since 2016, 13 Member States in the Western Pacific Region, which covers 38 countries and areas, have been validated by WHO for eliminating at least one NTD. Of these, six (Cambodia, China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Viet Nam) have successfully eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. Trachoma elimination is part of broader progress on NTDs in Fiji and the rest of the Western Pacific Region.

WHO continues to support countries in their efforts to eliminate trachoma and other NTDs, ensuring healthier lives for all, particularly the most disadvantaged.

In a city, coworking hubs bring people and ideas together. Inside cancer cells, similar hubs form-but instead of fueling progress, they supercharge disease. That's what researchers at the Texas A&M University Health Science Center (Texas A&M Health) have discovered inside the cells of a rare and aggressive kidney cancer.

Their new study, published in Nature Communications, shows how RNA-normally just a messenger-gets hijacked to build liquid-like ""droplet hubs"" in the nucleus. These hubs act as command centers, switching on growth-promoting genes. But the team didn't stop at observing this-they created a molecular switch to dissolve the hubs on demand, cutting off the cancer's growth at its source.

The cancer they're investigating, called translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC), affects children and young adults and currently has almost no effective therapies. It is caused by TFE3 oncofusions-hybrid genes formed when chromosomes swap and fuse in the wrong places.

Until now, how these fusion proteins drove such aggressive tumors remained unclear. The Texas A&M team found that these fusions enlist RNA as structural scaffolds. Unlike their traditional role as passive messengers, these RNAs now actively assemble droplets, known as condensates, that cluster key molecules together. These droplets become transcriptional hubs-hotspots that switch on cancer-promoting genes.

""RNA itself is not just a passive messenger, but an active player that helps build these condensates,"" said Yun Huang, PhD, professor at the Texas A&M Health Institute of Biosciences and Technology and senior author.

The researchers also discovered that an RNA-binding protein called PSPC1 acts as a stabilizer, reinforcing the droplets and making them even more powerful engines for tumor growth.

To untangle this hidden process, the team leaned on some of today's most advanced tools in molecular biology:

By layering these techniques, the researchers built the clearest picture yet of how TFE3 oncofusions hijack RNA to build cancer's growth hubs.

Discovery alone wasn't enough. The team wanted to know: If the droplets are cancer's engine, can we shut them down?

To test this, they engineered a nanobody-based chemogenetic tool-essentially a designer molecular switch. Here's how it works:

The result? Tumor growth ground to a halt in both lab-grown cancer cells and mouse models.

""This is exciting because tRCC has very few effective treatment options today,"" said Yubin Zhou, MD, PhD, professor and director of the Center for Translational Cancer Research. ""Targeting condensate formation gives us a brand-new angle to attack the cancer, one that traditional drugs have not addressed. It opens the door to therapies that are much more precise and potentially less toxic.""

For the research team, the most powerful part of the study wasn't just watching RNA build these hubs but seeing that they could be dismantled.

""By mapping how these fusion proteins interact with RNA and other cellular partners, we are not only explaining why this cancer is so aggressive but also revealing weak spots that can be therapeutically exploited,"" said Lei Guo, PhD, research assistant professor at the Institute of Biosciences and Technology.

Because many pediatric cancers are also driven by fusion proteins, the implications extend far beyond tRCC. A tool that can dissolve these condensates could represent a general strategy to cut off cancer's engine rooms at the source.

tRCC makes up nearly 30% of renal cancers in children and adolescents, but for patients and families, treatment options are limited and outcomes are often poor. This research not only explains how the cancer organizes its growth machinery but also offers a tangible way to stop it.

This research highlights the power of fundamental science to generate new hope for young patients facing devastating diseases.""

Yun Huang, PhD, Professor, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M Health

Just like cutting power to a coworking hub halts all the activity inside, dissolving cancer's ""droplet hubs"" could shut down its ability to grow. By showing how RNA actively builds these hubs-and by designing a way to dismantle their scaffolding-Texas A&M Health scientists have uncovered both a weakness and a new path toward treating one of the toughest childhood cancers.

A new benchtop analyzer from Siemens Healthineers is making quality drug testing easier to perform, to help prevent inaccurate results no matter where, or by whom, testing is conducted. The helps identify substance use, monitor therapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs, and perform serum toxicology testing. It also offers automated specimen validity testing to detect substitution, adulteration, and dilution of urine samples, to flag suspicious samples early and prevent the bottleneck that delays results when creative methods to cover up recreational or illegal drug use are attempted. The broad drug testing capabilities of the Atellica DT 250 Analyzer make it an ideal instrument for use in clinical settings such as physician offices and hospitals, and in non-clinical settings where operator skill may vary by user, such as treatment and pain management centers, forensic laboratories, military, and employment testing.

While drug testing is commonly known for determining whether harmful substances are present in one's system or being misused, it also provides important information that helps doctors care for their patients. Determining potential drug interactions, ensuring prescribed medications are metabolized within therapeutic ranges, and optimizing medication dosing are all important drug testing needs that depend upon reliable results.

Quality should be non-negotiable when the stakes for drug testing are so high. We engineered an easy-to-use, reliable, and highly productive instrument that offers flexible testing capabilities to match individual drug testing needs and reduce operational costs that are top of program directors' minds.""

Duncan Porter, head of Syva, Immulite, and Plasma Proteins for Siemens Healthineers

The Atellica DT 250 Analyzer, which is now widely available globally, streamlines drug testing capabilities previously limited to larger, floor-standing models onto one benchtop analyzer. It can process 225 test results per hour, a 69% increase in productivity over the legacy Viva-ProE drug testing system from Siemens Healthineers, with first results provided in as soon as eight minutes. The instrument relies on widely validated reagents, the trusted Syva EMIT technology, and offers an immunoassay menu of more than 65 assays for use with urine, serum, and plasma (blood) samples. It also offers 10 open channels for customizable, user-defined testing for added flexibility.

Pre-eclampsia is one of the most serious complications in pregnancy, affecting millions of women and newborns worldwide and potentially life-threatening. Despite intensive research, it has remained unclear what processes in the placenta lead to the disease. Now, a research team led by the Medical University of Vienna has discovered a previously unknown mechanism that plays a decisive role in the development of pre-eclampsia. The results, currently published in the journal Nature Communications, could open up new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment.

Led by Claudia Gundacker, Sebastian Granitzer and Raimund Widhalm (all from the Institute of Medical Genetics at MedUni Vienna), the research team investigated why the so-called sFlt-1/PlGF ratio - a blood value that is considered the most important indicator of impending pre-eclampsia - becomes unbalanced in affected pregnant women. They found that two proteins, the amino acid transporter LAT1 and the transcription factor NRF2, play a central role. These two molecules work together to control angiogenesis, and to protect cells from oxidative stress - i.e., from an excess of harmful oxygen compounds. If this interaction is disrupted, the imbalance that is typical of pre-eclampsia occurs. The researchers were also able to show that increased oxidative stress is not the cause of the disease, as previously assumed, but rather a consequence of it.

""We have found a mechanism that regulates oxidative stress in a cell. Even more significant is the finding that this mechanism is dysregulated in pre-eclampsia,"" explains study leader Claudia Gundacker.

A better understanding of these mechanisms opens up new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of pre-eclampsia - and thus for the health of mothers and children.""

Claudia Gundacker, Medical University of Vienna

Pre-eclampsia usually occurs in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The disease is characterised by high blood pressure and increased protein excretion in the urine and, without timely treatment, can lead to serious complications for both mother and child. Often, the only option is early delivery. Women and children affected by pre-eclampsia also have an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases later in life. The new findings from MedUni Vienna help to better understand the disease at a molecular level and could, in the long term, help to develop new approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

A new cancer clinical trial by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) shows that a drug that utilizes the body's immune system to target and eliminate cancer cells appeared to reduce the risk of distant metastases for an aggressive form of skin cancer when given immediately after surgery, but did not significantly reduce the overall risk of recurrence, which was a co-primary endpoint of the trial. The randomized phase 3 STAMP trial (EA6174) is the largest clinical study to date evaluating pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy, as adjuvant therapy for Merkel cell carcinoma following surgical removal of the tumor.

The STAMP trial found that after two years, 73% of patients receiving pembrolizumab showed no cancer recurrence, compared with 66% among those who did not receive the drug. Although this difference did not reach statistical significance, patients receiving pembrolizumab had a 42% lower risk of developing distant metastases-cancer spreading to organs such as the liver, lungs, or bones – which was a secondary objective of the study.

""The STAMP trial provides the first evidence that immunotherapy with pembrolizumab after surgery may help people with Merkel cell carcinoma by preventing their cancer from returning in organs considered distant from the site of the original disease,"" said lead investigator Janice M. Mehnert, MD, co-chair of the ECOG-ACRIN Melanoma Committee and director of Melanoma and Cutaneous Medical Oncology at NYU Langone Health's Perlmutter Cancer Center.

This is much-needed good news for people who are living with the highly aggressive cancer that is Merkel cell carcinoma.""

Janice M. Mehnert, Co-Chair, Melanoma Committee, ECOG-ACRIN 

Merkel cell carcinoma is a fast-growing cancer that begins in the skin's sensory cells, often appearing as a single, painless bump on sun-exposed areas. Although skin cancer is by far the most common type of cancer in the United States, Merkel cell carcinoma, also called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, is highly uncommon, occurring in no more than three out of one million people annually. It is extremely aggressive, with fewer than half of patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis.

The phase 3 multicenter study (NCT03712605) was conducted from 2018 to 2023 and involved 293 patients whose tumors had been surgically removed. Of these, 147 were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab infusions after surgery, while 146 were observed without additional drug therapy. Some participants also received radiation as advised by their physicians.

Because Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare tumor, Mehnert emphasized that national collaboration is essential for recruiting patients for a trial of this scale. Supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), ECOG-ACRIN opened the study at over five hundred hospitals and cancer centers nationwide, through the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network.

Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy known as a PD-1 inhibitor. Its mechanism of action involves blocking the PD-1 protein receptor, which cancer cells exploit to evade immune attack. Pembrolizumab allows immune cells to detect and attack tumors more effectively. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (brand name KEYTRUDA®) for treating recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.

Overall survival, the other co-primary endpoint of the trial, continues to be followed and will be reported at a later date.

Dr. Mehnert will present the trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2025 Congress on Monday, October 20 in Berlin, Germany.

Women are significantly more likely than men to develop Alzheimer's disease. Earlier age at menopause is associated with a greater risk for late-life cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. A new study suggests that this risk is even higher in women who carry the APOE e4 gene variant or who have systemic inflammation. Study results will be presented at the 2025 Annual Meeting of The Menopause Society in Orlando October 21-25.

There are a number of reasons why women are more likely than men to develop Alzheimer's disease, including women's longer life expectancy, hormonal changes and genetic predispositions like the APOE4 gene. In a new study involving nearly 2600 women, researchers investigated whether the association between age at menopause and memory decline was modified by the APOE e4 genotype and/or systemic inflammatory markers.

They found that APOE e4 carriers showed the strongest association between earlier menopause and faster memory decline. In more than 250 participants with available data for inflammatory markers, higher levels of inflammation exacerbated the effect of earlier menopause on memory decline. Post hoc analyses suggested that the effect of inflammation exacerbating menopause-related memory decline was stronger in APOE e4 carriers than in non-carriers.

As a result, the researchers concluded that the presence of APOE e4 and age-related inflammation strengthened the link between earlier age at menopause and faster memory decline, suggesting that these factors may be especially salient contributors to Alzheimer's disease dementia risk in women with earlier menopause.

More detailed results will be discussed at the 2025 Annual Meeting of The Menopause Society as part of the abstract presentation entitled ""Inflammation and APOE e4 genotype modify the link between earlier menopause and memory decline.""

Approximately 20% of Alzheimer's therapeutics in development target genetic and inflammatory factors. Yet, sex differences and female-specific risk factors like menopause are often overlooked in clinical trials. Understanding how female biology influences Alzheimer's disease risk is key to ensure we develop effective treatments for all individuals at risk.""

Madeline Wood Alexander, University of Toronto

""Given that women are at greater risk for Alzheimer's disease than men, understanding the nuanced sex- and gender-specific mechanisms underlying these differences is essential for the development of targeted, individualized preventive and treatment strategies,"" says Dr. Stephanie Faubion, medical director for The Menopause Society.

The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) released a new clinical practice guideline on the surveillance of Barrett's esophagus, the only known precursor to esophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma), a highly lethal cancer whose incidence has risen substantially over recent decades.

The guideline provides eight evidence-based recommendations and several key implementation statements to help clinicians monitor patients after a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus, a condition associated with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 

What's novel here is our move away from a one-size-fits-all approach. We focus on risk stratification and doing endoscopy right - because quality drives earlier detection of neoplasia and better outcomes.""

Sachin Wani, MD, Study Guideline Author, American Gastroenterological Association

The guideline emphasizes the need for regular monitoring in many patients with Barrett's esophagus who do not exhibit dysplasia or cancerous changes, while noting situations where monitoring isn't necessary (such as very small segments measuring less than 1 cm). It also provides clear recommendations on when monitoring can be safely stopped, considering age, overall health, and potential benefits. 

For patients who merit surveillance, AGA strongly recommends using high-definition white-light endoscopy in combination with chromoendoscopy to improve detection of Barrett 's-related neoplasia, paired with structured sampling protocols and expert pathology review of abnormal cells, called neoplasia.

The panel also suggests daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy as the preferred preventive strategy over no PPI therapy and over anti-reflux surgery. Key implementation statements have focused on tailoring surveillance intervals based on the length of the Barrett's segment, and surveillance strategies for patients with Barrett's esophagus diagnosed with indefinite dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia. 

To address emerging but still evolving technologies, the guideline makes no recommendation for or against the routine use of advanced sampling techniques or biomarkers. Instead, it provides practical guidance for clinicians who choose to use these tests, while highlighting ongoing studies that will define their future role. This document highlights the overall limitations in existing literature and knowledge gaps in the evidence base to guide future research endeavors. 

""We believe these are exciting technologies that will, in the future, significantly impact how we manage patients with Barrett's esophagus,"" said guideline author Perica Davitkov, MD. ""Our guideline provides, for the first time, direction on how these tools might be applied in both community and academic centers. Several ongoing high-quality studies will further define the role of these advanced techniques in risk stratification and in detecting Barrett's-related neoplasia."" 

Patients with Barrett's esophagus-related dysplasia or cancer should be referred to specialized centers for management. The guideline panel does not expect any impacts on cost or access, as chromoendoscopy is already integrated into modern endoscopic systems and PPIs are widely available. Training and implementation remain essential to ensure that the benefits of these recommendations are realized in practice. 

In patients with columnar-lined esophagus <1 centimeter with intestinal metaplasia without neoplasia, AGA suggests against endoscopic surveillance.

In patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for Barrett's esophagus, AGA recommends using a combination of high-definition white light endoscopy plus chromoendoscopy compared with white light endoscopy alone. 

In patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for Barrett's esophagus, AGA makes no recommendation for or against the use of wide-area transepithelial sampling as an adjunctive sampling technique to a structured biopsy protocol. 

In patients diagnosed with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, Barrett's esophagus with indefinite for dysplasia, or Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, AGA makes no recommendation for or against the routine use of p53 assessment as an adjunct test to histopathology to predict progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma.

In patients diagnosed with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus, Barrett's esophagus with indefinite for dysplasia, or Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, AGA makes no recommendation for or against the routine use of Tissue Cypher testing as an adjunct test to histopathology. 

In adult patients with Barrett's esophagus, AGA suggests the use of daily PPI therapy compared with no PPI therapy for the prevention of neoplastic progression of Barrett's esophagus. 

In patients with Barrett's esophagus, AGA suggests the use of PPIs over surgery for the prevention of neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. 

This guideline is the second installment in AGA's updated three-part series on Barrett's esophagus, following the 2024 guideline on endoscopic eradication therapy, with a third guideline on screening expected in 2026.

Barrett's esophagus is a change to the lining of the esophagus (the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach). These changes happen in a small number of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Barrett's esophagus is a change in the type of cell that occurs in the esophagus and does not typically cause any symptoms. Over time, there can be changes within the cells (dysplasia) that increase the risk of developing one type of cancer in the esophagus called adenocarcinoma. 

GERD is common, but most people with GERD do not get Barrett's esophagus. Tobacco use and being overweight are important risks for developing Barrett's esophagus. Most people with Barrett's esophagus do not get cancer, but because the risk is higher than for people without Barrett's esophagus, it is recommended to monitor for changes over time.

A new study led by Rice University's Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede has revealed that protein clumps, or plaques that clog the brain, associated with Parkinson's disease are not merely waste; they can actively drain energy from brain cells. These clumps, composed of a protein called alpha-synuclein, were found to break down adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule responsible for powering nearly all cellular activities.

Published in Advanced Science Oct. 16, the research demonstrates that when ATP binds to these clumps, the protein reshapes itself to trap the molecule in a small pocket. This process causes ATP to break apart and release energy, functioning similarly to an enzyme. This unexpected finding could change scientists' understanding of the damage caused by these clumps, which are hallmarks of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. 

""We were astonished to see that amyloids, long thought to be inert waste, can actively cleave ATP,"" said Wittung-Stafshede, professor and the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Chair in Chemistry and Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Scholar. ""The protein folds around ATP and essentially transforms the plaque into a molecular machine.""

The researchers began by creating uniform clumps of alpha-synuclein in the laboratory. They first tested whether these clumps, which contain ordered protein aggregates that adopt amyloid shapes, could break down simple chemical compounds before progressing to the actual biological substrate, ATP. Their experiments demonstrated that the protein clumps could accelerate the breakdown of ATP.

To understand this process, the research team employed advanced imaging techniques, specifically cryo-electron microscopy, collaborating with specialists in Switzerland. The images indicated that when ATP attaches to the clump, a normally loose part of the protein folds over the ATP binding site, creating a pocket that traps ATP. This pocket is lined with positive charges that facilitate the breakdown of ATP.

That folding over, or forming a lid, is what transforms a passive aggregate into a reactive enzymelike structure.""

Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and the Charles W. Duncan Jr.-Welch Chair in Chemistry, Rice University

To validate their findings, the researchers altered the protein to remove the positive charges in the pocket one by one. The modified proteins still formed clumps but were unable to break down ATP or form the special pocket, highlighting the significance of that specific structure for the reaction to occur.

This research suggests that protein clumps in the brain may cause more harm than previously believed. By breaking down ATP, these clumps could disrupt essential cellular functions, including the systems responsible for clearing them away. In this sense, the clumps might evade the body's natural cleanup mechanisms.

Given the ability of the protein clumps to change shape upon binding to specific molecules, scientists see potential for developing treatments. If small molecule drugs can lock these clumps into harmless shapes, it could help mitigate their harmful effects.

The study also implies that natural substances in the brain may influence the shapes of protein clumps in patients, possibly explaining why distinct clump shapes are found in different neurodegenerative diseases.

To test if amyloid chemical reactivity occurs in mixtures of components from real brain cells, the researchers exposed extracts from neuronal cells to the protein clumps. They found that many compounds in the mixture underwent chemical changes, indicating that the clumps act on several molecules present in cells in addition to ATP.

If the findings are confirmed within living cells, this discovery could help explain why brain cells in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's face energy shortages, DNA damage and other forms of chemical stress that ultimately lead to cell death.

As these diseases become more prevalent with an aging global population, identifying new underlying mechanisms such as this enzymatic activity could lead to improved treatments or even prevention.

""We want to learn how to stop neurodegenerative diseases at the source, directly detoxifying damaging species, instead of just treating symptoms as we do today,"" Wittung‑Stafshede said.

Co-authors of this study include Lukas Frey and Roland Riek from ETH Zürich and Fiamma Ayelen Buratti, Istvan Horvath, Shraddha Parate and Ranjeet Kumar from Chalmers University of Technology. Buratti is currently continuing her research with Wittung-Stafshede at Rice.

The research was supported by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Synapsis Foundation Switzerland.

SEATTLE – In a moment 25 years in the making, the No. 17 Washington women's soccer team secured its first conference championship since 2000, claiming the Big Ten Regular Season Championship with a 1-0 win over No. 15 Wisconsin at Husky Soccer Stadium on Sunday.

With a match in hand, the Huskies sit five points clear at the top of the league table with an undefeated record of 8-0-2 in league play, clinching the second conference championship in program history

Sophomore Alex Buck delivered the decisive moment for the Huskies, converting a penalty kick in the 53rd minute. From there, the Dawgs did what they've done all season long, locking down the Badgers on the defensive end for their ninth clean sheet of the season.

In a drag-it-out dogfight of a defensive battle, the Huskies led Wisconsin on shots 9-4.

With offensive opportunities limited in the first half, the Huskies were the more threatening side.



After Jadyn Holdenried's shot from inside the box was saved by Badger keeper Drew Stover in the 27th minute, Buck nearly put UW ahead in the 41st, seeing her attempt cleared off the line by a Wisconsin defender.

Seven minutes after the restart, Buck was dragged down inside the 18-yard box. After a VAR review confirmed the call, the Medina, Washington, native took the ball herself and fired a rocket into the bottom corner despite Stover getting a hand to the attempt.

With the lead in tow and a stout, organized defense behind the ball, the Huskies killed off the final 37:58 of the clock before flooding onto the field as the title celebrations commenced.

Locked in as the league's No. 1 seed, Washington will conclude the regular season next Sunday at Oregon before turning its attention to the Big Ten Tournament, with the quarterfinal round set for Nov. 2. In West Lafayette, Indiana.

Twenty-four players have been called up.

Three USA players found the net in the win.

LaBonta replaces Sam Meza on the roster.

Brooklyn FC has named former U.S. national team great Brian McBride as its first general manager, ahead of its inaugural season in USL Championship next year.

McBride will also oversee the club's women's side, which is currently in its second season competing in the Gainbridge Super League, also a USL property.

It'll mark McBride's return to a front-office role after having previously been GM of the USMNT from 2020 through the 2022 World Cup.

“It was unique,” McBride told The Athletic of why he joined Brooklyn FC. “Their vision, what they're thinking – the amount of impact I can have, not just on the sporting side, but on the organization really drew me to it.

“The vision is to build something the community will be proud of. Not just the soccer side. Having something where Brooklyn can go and call their own.”

With McBride leading the group, Brooklyn will now focus on hiring a head coach and filling the club's inaugural roster ahead of its first match in March 2026. McBride says he expects the coaching search to go quickly and will work with that person to help build the first team squad.

The current USL Championship regular season is wrapping up this weekend before the playoffs kick off. The future of the league is exciting, with owners voting earlier this year to implement promotion and relegation in the future. In doing so, USL will be the first professional soccer league in America to take that leap.

“It's a great situation for clubs – not great for owners, of course,” McBride said with a laugh. “It makes every game meaningful. MLS has their way and they're doing great, but USL is committed to doing it (their way). It benefits the players. I experienced it in England and Germany. I think it's a positive in the end.”

The league is still a ways from that happening and details still need to be finalized. The plan is for USL to implement pro-rel in 2028 when it launches a new first division.

Along the way, Brooklyn plans to get the club off and running to be ready for the next evolution of USL. McBride said the organization is working to secure pre-existing training facilities for the near-term before hopefully building its own in the future. It also aims to have a functioning academy in the future.

For McBride, an all-time great USMNT forward who enjoyed a successful club career largely at Fulham, the Columbus Crew and Chicago Fire, Brooklyn is his first job working for a team since acting as GM of the USMNT through the last World Cup cycle. He feels his experience there will suit him well as he builds Brooklyn from the ground up. One of the players under his watch with the U.S., Tim Weah, was named part of Brooklyn FC's ownership group back in May 2024.

“Those experiences were very beneficial,” McBride said of his time as USMNT GM. “I wanted to build something that felt like a family. Families argue at times, they have great times together, but everybody has the same goal. That's my philosophy. That was the case during my time with the national team.”

by Unfiltered Soccer

Tim Howard and Landon Donovan disagree with AC Milan over their reported frustration with U.S. Soccer for playing Christian Pulisic vs Australia.

TOPICS:

Last week, while on national team duty with U.S. Men's National Team, the team's star player, Christian Pulisic, suffered a low-grade hamstring tear in a 2-1 win over Australia.  Pulisic exited the match after thirty minutes and now faces a spell on the sidelines while he recovers.

In the wake of the injury, reports surfaced suggesting that AC Milan, Pulisic's club team, was upset with U.S. Soccer for playing him at all in a game that they viewed as being of relatively low importance.  The 27-year-old had been experiencing some issues with his ankle in the preceding weeks and came off the bench for roughly 20 minutes in the Americans previous match against Ecuador.

On this week's episode of Unfiltered Soccerwith Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the two U.S. Soccer legends rejected the notion that Mauricio Pochettino was wrong to play Pulisic against the Aussies.



“Every game for the U.S. matters,” said Howard.  “They haven't had their team together for a major tournament like the Gold Cup. They don't have a World Cup qualifying [campaign]. So actually, this was essentially... a World Cup qualifier for us. It was an opportunity to get our team together and to fight for points.”

Donovan echoed Howard's sentiments and noted that Milan's frustration is particularly vexing considering the ways in which U.S. Soccer has helped them previously.  “Go back and look what Pochettino did in the past in letting Christian go. He didn't bring him in this summer to the Gold Cup. So he goes and he gets injured. It happens. It's part of the game.”

Additionally, during his first window as USMNT Manager in October of 2024, Pochettino allowed Pulisic to fly back to Italy early, missing a match vs arch-rival Mexico in the process.

Howard did suggest that there are certain situations where a player might be feeling the effects of overuse and could be at greater risk for injury, but this did not appear to be one of those situations.

“It's not like it's April and [Milan] had Champions League, Serie A, and then a national team game on the back end of it. This is the beginning of the season. So, muscle injuries happen. I think it's crazy for Milan to suggest that he shouldn't have played.”

Pulisic will now likely miss the USMNT's next two friendlies in mid-November against South American opponents, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Before Real Madrid can look ahead to El Clásico at the weekend, they must first take on Juventus in a heavyweight Champions League encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu.

Barring one lopsided defeat to Atlético Madrid, Los Blancos have executed a near-flawless start to their first season under Xabi Alonso. Real Madrid have claimed 10 wins in 2025–26, and two have already come in the Champions League.

The Spanish giants are hoping to remain perfect on Europe's biggest stage when they host Juventus on Wednesday evening. The two clubs clashed in the United States during the summer in the FIFA Club World Cup round of 16, and Real Madrid walked away with a 1–0 victory.

Three months later, Alonso's XI will look different, especially given Los Blancos' current injury list. David Alaba, Antonio Rüdiger, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dani Carvajal, Dean Huijsen, Ferland Mendy and Dani Ceballos are all unavailable for the clash. 

Here's what Real Madrid's XI could look like against Juventus.

FREE NEWSLETTER. New SI FC Newsletter Global Embed. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. dark

GK: Thibaut Courtois—The Belgian will hope to replicate his Club World Cup quarterfinals performance and make it two clean sheets in two matches against Juventus.

RB: Federico Valverde—Carvajal and Alexander-Arnold are back in training, but the right flank will belong to Valverde until either player regains full match fitness.

CB: Raúl Asencio—A disappointing summer is a thing of the past for Asencio, who has filled in admirably in times of emergency this season. The defender gets the nod as Alonso awaits the return of Huijsen.

CB: Éder Militão—The Brazil international is the leader of Real Madrid's backline, but must not take any risks with the Clásico just days away.

LB: Álvaro Carreras—Carreras has quietly delivered solid performance after solid performance since his struggles in the Madrid derby, but he is in for a large test against Francisco Conceição.

CM: Arda Güler—The 20-year-old has gone from barely playing last season to becoming a key member of Alonso's XI. Güler already has eight goal contributions in 2025–26.

CM: Aurélien Tchouaméni—Arguably the unsung hero of Los Blancos' strong start, Tchouaméni is a force to be reckoned with in the middle of the park.

CM: Jude Bellingham—Bellingham is coming off his best performance since his return from injury. With the Clásico on the horizon, the England international could be rested, but Alonso might be more tempted to experiment with both Güler and Bellingham in the midfield.

RW: Franco Mastantuono—What Mastantuono lacks in production he makes up for with his dribbling ability and creativity on the right wing. The Argentine is always a threat with the ball at his feet.

ST: Kylian Mbappé—The Frenchman will look to extend his scoring streak to 12 consecutive matches in Wednesday's clash. Mbappé already has 15 goals to his name this campaign.

LW: Vinícius Júnior—The 25-year-old returns to the XI as he continues his pursuit of his first European goal contribution this season.

After a successful 2024/25 season with Chelsea, Enzo Maresca's stock in the game has grown massively.

Last term, Chelsea were able to win the Club World Cup and Conference League under the 45-year-old.

They also managed to qualify for the Champions League after finishing fourth in the Premier League.

Since then, it has been claimed that Juventus have an interest in Maresca, and if the Italian wants to join them or another big club one day, it may not be too difficult for him to get a move.

According to The Telegraph, Maresca has just signed up with Gestifute, an agency that is run by super-agent Jorge Mendes.

Mendes is widely regarded as the most powerful agent in football, and his client list of managers includes the likes of former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and Aston Villa's Unai Emery.

Ultimately, with Mendes behind him, it will not be hard for Maresca to find another club if he ever wants a new challenge, especially after his recent success at Stamford Bridge.

However, Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali would be silly to let the former Leicester manager go so easily. Right now, he is one of the best coaches in the game; they have to keep hold of him.

Again, Maresca has done a magnificent job in west London after winning the Club World Cup and Conference League trophies and securing Champions League qualification.

He is also a very modern-day coach who wants to play a possession and attacking-based style of football.

Maresca has been doing that at Chelsea while getting results. It would be a huge blow if Mendes facilitated a move to another side.

Thankfully, the ex-Manchester City coach still has a contract until 2029, with Chelsea having the option to extend it by a further year.

At Chelsea, his man-management has been pretty efficient. For example, it was recently reported that Maresca promised to give Marc Guiu an opportunity if he kept working hard in training.

Maresca delivered on that promise and ended up getting a very promising performance from Guiu in Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest last Saturday. 

If Maresca does end up leaving Chelsea for whatever reason, there are a couple of managers who could be the perfect replacement for him.

One option that Chelsea would surely have to consider is Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. Based on his style and Premier League experience, Iraola would be ideal for Chelsea.

Their former midfielder Cesc Fabregas is yet to coach in English football's top division like Iraola, but again, he is another individual who would bring a similar philosophy to Maresca's to Stamford Bridge.

The World Cup winner is doing an excellent job at Como right now, recently leading them to a 2-0 victory against Juventus in Serie A. ","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Sports Interactive has signed a multi-yeaer partnership with FIFA to bring more licenses to Football Manager games. 

The deal grants the Football Manager series official licences for FIFA's major tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Canada, Mexico, and the USA.

Starting with Football Manager 26, the series will feature officially branded FIFA tournaments, including the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup.

Getting set for launch 

The partnership also coincides with a revamped, playable International Management mode coming in a 2026 content update for FM26 across all platforms ahead of the FIFA World Cup 26.

Full details are yet to be shared, but Sports Interactive confirmed that FM26 will include official kits for all 48 FIFA World Cup 26 teams, along with authentic broadcast graphics and tournament branding for next year's edition.

The new FIFA deal comes after Sega and Sports Interactive cancelled FM25 across all platforms due to development challenges, marking the first time the series has skipped a release since 2004. 

The title, which was set to deliver the series' biggest technical and visual leap through a switch to the Unity engine, faced setbacks related to player experience and interface design. FM26 will now launch globally on November 4th, 2025. ","{'href': 'https://www.pocketgamer.biz', 'title': 'PocketGamer.biz'}","soccer"

Well that was an unexpected announcement, wasn't it? Football Manager 26 will have a revamped international management module later in its cycle complete with a FIFA license, on top of the Premier League license at launch.

FM26 will be the latest entry into the iconic Football Manager series with a brand new game engine, UI (user interface) and loads of other new features such as licenses never before seen in the franchise.

But wait, FM26 wasn't going to have international management at all, was it? Well...

""We took international management out of FM25 because only five per cent of people were playing it and the reason for that wasn't because they didn't want to play it, it's just because it wasn't very good,"" Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson OBE openly told indy100.

""We wanted to take the time to actually really improve international management and we spoke to a bunch of real life international managers to find out how we could make it a better mode.

""We have the design all sorted for it, we know exactly what we're doing, we haven't done all the engineering yet because we wanted it to come out as part of a content update later on.""

  Miles Jacobson speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention in 2016  Getty Images

The FIFA license means FM26 will include the official licenses for the World Cup, Women's World Cup and Club World Cup with further tournaments, such as the Youth World Cups across men's and women's football, to follow.

As well as that, there will be a completely revamped international management module in a content update.

Jacobson revealed it all came about because the studio has been working with FIFA on the World Cup of Football Manager - and that Sports Interactive actually previously turned down the chance to work with FIFA before that.

He said: ""The same people who helped put FIFAe together are also the people that do the licensing for video games and they previously approached us about the possibility to work with them before the World Cup of Football Manager in 2024.

""We actually said 'international management isn't great inside the game, so, no'. 

""But doing FIFAe, we got to know that team better and started talking to them about what our plans were and it makes total sense going into a World Cup year to be an official part of the tournament.

""We want to give users the experience they deserve with international management with this revamped mode.""

  - YouTube  www.youtube.com  

The new FIFA World Cup license will have all the details and graphics expected - which is exactly why it's not available at launch.

""FIFA can't give us the broadcast graphics yet as they don't exist,"" Jacobson explained. ""They're not going to have those assets until January time so we can't make it look like the real tournament until those are in place.

""But it's really exciting; like with all the league deals, they are trusting us with their IP and to do a good job with it. It's a pretty big honour.""

The international management module will release as part of a content update later in the year and Jacobson said there are plans to release fresh content throughout each game's cycle more frequently.

He said: ""We'll gradually add new features instead of just patching it. We're delighted with the Premier League license and we're delighted to be working with FIFA directly.""

Football Manager 26 on PC and Mac, Football Manager 26 Console on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass, Football Manager 26 Touch through Apple Arcade and Football Manager 26 Mobile through Netflix all release on 4 November. Football Manager 26 Touch releases on Nintendo Switch on 4 December.

The advanced access beta on PC through Steam and Epic Games launches on 23 October and can be accessed be pre-purchasing the game.

Since the Club World Cup, FC Porto has shown how Samu Aghehowa is one of the most promising young talents in world football, as the Spanish striker stood out in the group stage despite the team's poor campaign. The Spanish striker's excellent start to the season is prompting Chelsea to step up their efforts behind the scenes, preparing a substantial offer of over €100 million for next summer.

Spanish media reports suggest that Chelsea are keen to strengthen their attack ahead of next year's transfer window, and Aghehowa has emerged as a key target. The London club, winner of the UEFA Europa Conference League and the FIFA Clubs World Cup in 2024/25, is closely monitoring the young striker and would be willing to invest a record amount to sign him, overcoming any competition.

Aghehowa has taken a huge leap forward in his career since transferring from Atlético Madrid to FC Porto, having previously been loaned to Deportivo Alavés in the 2023/24 season and winning a gold medal with the Spanish national team at the 2024 Paris Olympics. In his first full season at Porto, he shone, and in the 2025/26 campaign he scored eight goals in just nine games in all competitions. This high performance caught the attention of several top clubs, with Chelsea among the main interested.

Although Chelsea has recently strengthened its offense and made important signings such as Liam Delap and João Pedro, the Blues remain interested in at least one more major signing and are therefore willing to invest in Aghehowa as a high-impact option in the medium/long term.

Porto's board, for its part, would be reluctant to part with its star player, but an offer in the region of €100 million or more could make the deal irresistible. That is precisely why it will be interesting to see how the situation unfolds for the striker and what his decision will be: whether to stay at Porto or take the biggest leap of his career by moving to the Premier League.

For Real Madrid and Endrick, the start of the new season has brought more questions than answers.

After arriving with immense expectation and wearing the club's iconic No.9 shirt, the Brazilian teenager has spent the first months of Xabi Alonso's reign watching from the sidelines.

He has been named in several matchday squads but his wait for a first appearance of the season goes on.

It was not meant to be this way with Endrick ending his debut campaign with seven goals in just 847 minutes but a hamstring injury suffered in May did halt that momentum and forced him to miss the Club World Cup where academy graduate Gonzalo Garcia stole the spotlight with four goals in six matches.

Since then, the 21-year-old Spaniard has become a trusted deputy to Kylian Mbappe whose blistering start of 15 goals in 11 games has made him the first name on Alonso's teamsheet.

And now according to Fabrizio Romano, Madrid now expect Endrick to leave on loan in January and the player himself wants minutes to boost his chances of making Brazil's 2026 World Cup squad.

According to the French outlet L'Equipe - Marseille remain interested in signing Endrick on loan when the window opens and with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Amine Gouiri set to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations, the French side are searching for attacking depth.

Endrick is believed to be open to the move, viewing it as an opportunity to play consistently and strengthen his World Cup ambitions while gaining valuable experience in European football.

TORONTO — A prominent spectator for the Blue Jays' run to the World Series expects to rejoin the action Friday at Rogers Centre.

“I'll be ready,” shortstop Bo Bichette said after his Blue Jays topped the Mariners, 4-3, to clinch their first trip to the Fall Classic since 1993. “I don't know how they'll use me, but I'll be ready.”

Earlier on Monday, manager John Schneider told reporters that Bichette, a two-time All-Star, was continuing to progress in his rehabilitation from the left-knee injury that ended his regular season. Bichette collided with Yankees catcher Austin Wells in early September, resulting in a sprain of Bichette's posterior cruciate ligament.

Bichette attempted to ramp up his activity after the American League Division Series but still appeared to be feeling discomfort. He was subsequently left off the AL Championship Series roster.

“I probably felt comfortable enough to play about four days ago,” Bichette said Monday night.

Bichette, 27, has been resurgent on offense in his final season before he will become eligible for free agency. After a career-worst, injury-marred campaign in 2024, he hit .311/.357/.483 with 18 home runs. In his absence this month, the Blue Jays have turned to Andrés Giménez at shortstop. The infielder has hit .263/.317/.447 with two home runs in 11 playoff games.

Bichette's last postseason experience came in 2023. He went 4-for-8 with four singles against the Minnesota Twins in that year's AL Wild Card Series.

An African country larger than the United Kingdom has been banned from competing at the World Cup.

Next summer's tournament will feature 48 countries and will be jointly hosted by the United States of America, Canada, Mexico.

So far, 28 sides have already secured qualification, with England the only European country to have guaranteed their place.

Other home nations Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland still have a chance of making it, but will likely need to go through the play-offs.

Advert

In Africa, Algeria, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia have all secured qualification automatically.

While Cameroon, DR Congo, Gabon and Nigeria will battle it out in two semi-finals and a final next month for the continent's final spot.

But one African territory that will not be heading to the World Cup is Western Sahara.

Advert

The region is a non-self-governing territory, defined by the United Nations as a territory ""whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government.""

It has been described as Africa's last colony, with Spain ruling it until 1976, when it attempted to transfer administration to Morocco and Mauritania.

Roughly 70% of the region is occupied by Morocco and the remaining 30% is controlled by the Polisario Front, a nationalist movement demanding independence from Morocco.

Western Sahara covers a huge stretch of North-West Africa, with a total area of 272,000 km2, compared to the UK at 244,376 km2.

But it is far more sparsely populated, with a population of approximately 560,000, while the UK is home to an estimated 69 million people.

Western Sahara have their own football team, run by the Sahrawi Football Federation.

But because they are not a member of CAF or FIFA, the team cannot compete in World Cup qualifiers or the tournament itself.

Instead, Western Sahara are members of World Unity Football Allegiance, an international body for football teams not affiliated with FIFA.

WUFA only has 19 members, including the Chagos Islands, Yorkshire and Kashmir.

The long-running territorial dispute over Western Sahara has even found itself in the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

In February, Cas upheld an appeal by the Algerian Football Federation after Moroccan club RS Berkane were allowed to wear a kit showing an extended map of the country.

The Confederation of African Football approved the design, despite the map including the disputed territory of Western Sahara.

It caused a row that led to both games between RS Berkane and Algeria's USM Alger being called off.

Nottingham will bid for a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to be a host city for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2035.

In July, Nottingham City Council submitted an expression of interest to be one of 20 shortlisted cities in the UK - the only country bidding to host the tournament.

The authority's plan to put a bid forward was approved at a council meeting on Tuesday, with the final selection of between 14 and 16 host cities expected to be made by FIFA in 2030.

But the plans rely on Nottingham Forest's redevelopment of the City Ground to meet stadium requirements.

""If this redevelopment does not take place or is delayed, the opportunity to host the tournament in the city would not be possible,"" council documents stated.

The plans, which were approved by Rushcliffe Borough Council in the summer, will see the existing Peter Taylor Stand demolished and replaced with a 10,000-seater stand, increasing the City Ground's overall capacity to 35,000.

Labour Leader of the council Neghat Khan said hosting the Women's World Cup had the potential to bring more than ""£20m in economic benefit"". 

The council must now sign the FIFA host city agreement by 31 October and the bid will be formally submitted to FIFA on 28 November. 

FIFA will make a decision on the UK's bid - the only bid to host the tournament - by April 2026.

It has been 69 years since England hosted a FIFA World Cup and 29 years since Nottingham hosted a major international football tournament - Euro 96.

The tournament will take place over 39 days and will be made up of 48 national teams.

It is expected that Nottingham would host seven matches if it were to be selected.

Khan said: ""We're committed to working with partners across the city to ensure Nottingham is ready to take full advantage of this opportunity.

""Whilst we're proud to be considered as a potential host city, we fully respect that if the UK is successful in its bid to host the tournament, it will be FIFA who decides which host cities are selected.

""For now, we're focused on showing how ready and enthusiastic we are to play our part in what could be a truly historic event.""

Colin Parr, the council's corporate director for communities, environment and resident services, said hosting the tournament was a ""tantalising prospect for the city"".

""It will hopefully inspire a generation of women and girls to be the next generation of Lionesses,"" he added. 

The government is expected to contribute 55-60% of host city costs.

Zohran Mamdani is smiling, but this time his cause for excitement has little to do with the New York City mayoral race.

“God bless you, Ruben Amorim!” he says.

Mamdani, the Democrat nominee, is two weeks out from the ballot which will determine whether he sees off competition from independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who lost out to him in the primary, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Polls consistently place Mamdani, a 34-year-old New York state assemblyman, as the frontrunner in a three-horse race. But on Sunday evening, his mind briefly wandered from politics to the battle to win the Premier League title.

He is pleased with Amorim, the head coach of Manchester United, because they unexpectedly won 2-1 away to reigning champions and arch-rivals Liverpool earlier in the day. This was good news for Liverpool's title challengers Arsenal, the team Mamdani has followed since he was a child and are now three points clear at the top of the table.

“Four defeats in a row for Liverpool,” he grins. “Beautiful.”

Unusually for a New York City mayoral candidate, Mamdani has chosen to ingrain soccer issues into his campaign.

On Sunday night, he attended a community soccer tournament his campaign called the ‘Cost of Living Classic', with his fans sporting campaign-issued blue, white and orange scarves.

In September, he launched a “Game Over Greed” petition. This called on FIFA, soccer's world governing body, to reverse its dynamic pricing policy for the 2026 men's World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico next June and July. It also asked FIFA to reinstate a cap on ticket resales for the tournament, and set aside 15 per cent of tickets for local residents at a discount.

The biggest sporting event in the world is happening in our backyard. But most New Yorkers will be priced out of watching it live.

FIFA's first batch of tickets went on sale over the past month, with prices ranging from $60 for the cheapest group-stage seats to $6,730 (just over £5,000) for the most expensive tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, a few miles west of New York City. However, those prices were subject to variable pricing, meaning they adjust based on demand. FIFA raised ticket prices for nine World Cup games within the first day of tickets going on sale. In a statement in September, FIFA said its pricing model reflects existing market pricing in the United States for major entertainment and sporting events.

Mamdani's interest in the issue is multifaceted.

Firstly, he is a genuine soccer fan. Campaign aides say he catches moments of Arsenal games in the car on the way to events. His speechwriter Julian Gerson says references to other leading soccer players in one address were replaced by Mamdani, who wanted to include Bukayo Saka and William Saliba because they are among his favorites in the Arsenal squad. In a diverse city, Mamdani's personal love of soccer also plays well with younger cohorts, who are key to his support, as well as being another tool to connect with immigrant communities across New York's five boroughs.

Born in the east African country of Uganda, Mamdani moved with his family to New York at the age of seven, and then fell in love with Arsene Wenger's Arsenal side, which won three Premier League titles between 1998 and 2004.

“My uncle is an Arsenal fan,” Mamdani explains. “He introduced me. Wenger was one of the first managers to really bring African players into the EPL. I grew up with Kolo Toure, Kanu, Alex Song, Lauren and Emmanuel Eboue. I had the Invincibles (the Arsenal team which won the 2003-04 Premier League title without losing any of the 38 matches) as magnets on my fridge. I loved David Seaman, Sylvain Wiltord, all these guys. I've gone to a few Arsenal games, many with my uncle. It really has been a big part of my life and my identity.”

In the context of the mayoral race, soccer and its ticket pricing are relevant to New York because eight World Cup matches will take place at MetLife Stadium, even if FIFA's host city agreement is with both New York City and neighboring New Jersey. It is also becoming an increasingly political matter, with U.S. President Donald Trump twice floating the possibility of moving already-scheduled tournament games to different cities.

And with his campaign against FIFA's pricing, Mamdani has identified a political opportunity to tie his affordability and cost-of-living platform to an event that will dominate next summer across the United States and beyond.

“As a lifelong soccer fan, I have grown up with memories of the World Cup; whether watching on TV or being there myself,” he says. “I went in 2010 to South Africa. I know what this tournament represents, which is the most popular tournament in the world, and also what it could be, which is a celebration of the world's game.

“Yet these kinds of policies from FIFA are ones that threaten to price out the very people that make this game so special. In our fight for making the most expensive city in America affordable, it's a fight that is not limited just to housing, childcare and public transit. It also extends to the moments that give New Yorkers such joy, which will be the World Cup next year.”



Mamdani acknowledges that he is facing an uphill battle to influence FIFA's policy, although he points out the organization has now confirmed it will retain ring-fenced allocations set aside for specific fan categories at a fixed price. FIFA has not, however, clarified how many tickets will be set aside or what the fixed price point may be. Mamdani, who did not say whether he has had any meetings with FIFA since he launched his petition, says he wants clarity on this matter.

“That is only part of what we are demanding,” he says. “We are demanding the end of dynamic pricing for the World Cup. But it shows that they (FIFA) are paying attention, and also that there's still more work to be done.

“I've spoken to a number of New Yorkers who tried to buy tickets, and it wasn't only an issue of just how unaffordable the tickets were, but also just the mess of that system. There's a desperate need for more clarity and for more of a commitment that this be a tournament for people who already call the city home.”

He describes some of the more extreme resale prices as “absurd”. He adds: “FIFA is clearly trying to pursue its initial goal of maximising revenue and looking to take every step such that they could do so.”

FIFA might argue that revenues from the World Cup are redistributed across the global game, funding soccer federations which require this financial support to function.

Mamdani counters: “I don't think a stable future for soccer can be built upon the denial of working-class fans being able to watch the game themselves. The more you look into where these revenues are spent, the thinner some of the arguments are that are made by FIFA.”

What about those who question whether it is the place of politicians to involve themselves in sporting matters?

He bristles: “Sport has been so commercialized and corporatized that fans have become viewed as a commodity. It is the place of leaders to step up when we see profit as the only motive, to an extent where so many who used to attend these very events can now not even conceive of doing so.

“What I'm asking for in my petition is all precedented. This is how FIFA has operated in the past. These are demands to simply return to the ways in which they engaged with previous World Cups. We have become numb to the continued commodification of the game, where asking FIFA to just do what they're doing in Mexico (where ticket resale is prohibited) is seen as an audacious request.”

He adds: “So much of what we celebrate about the atmosphere of a soccer stadium is tied to the affordability of that same stadium. We talk about cauldrons of noise becoming libraries. That is an economic story.

“It is a horrible experience as a fan to try to buy tickets. When I tried to buy tickets to the Cricket World Cup last year, which was taking place on Long Island, it was unbelievable how difficult it was and how much you had to engage with scalping as a fact of life.”

Would he be as prepared to make this challenge to FIFA a broader mission beyond soccer? Would he say the same to the NBA's New York Knicks or NFL's New York Jets?

Advertisement

“Absolutely. This is a vision of a city where New Yorkers can do more than just struggle, where they can also enjoy themselves and do so without having to mortgage their dreams in order to be a spectator.

“We've seen a number of artists respond to the backlash of dynamic pricing by ending it for their own concerts. It's time that FIFA follows that lead and that we make it clear that we will explore legislative solutions and interventions so that we continue to have a place for working-class fans.”

Following Mamdani's petition, The Athletic reached out to the offices of mayors in every host city to see if any would echo the specifics of his complaints. None did. So why does Mamdani think this is so important?

“I can't speak to why other mayors haven't spoken to this directly,” he says. “I can tell you I've had a number of New Yorkers reach out to me, some of whom don't share my politics on many other issues, who've been heartened by the understanding that it is actually a political question whether we price New Yorkers out of sporting events, out of cultural events.

“There's been this growing sense of resignation that when your favorite team or your favorite artist comes to town, you will either have to put the money you would have spent on rent towards that ticket, or you will have to watch online.”

If Mamdani wins the election, challenges may come not only from FIFA but also from Trump. The U.S. president has called him a communist — Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist — warning that New York may see federal funding cuts if he becomes mayor. Is Mamdani concerned about this?

“I think his threats are inevitable,” Mamdani says. “The question is how we respond to them. We've seen this president's policies are ones that not only endanger the ability of anyone looking to plan out their visit to this city but they're also ones that have led many to question whether they would be safe in the city, specifically regarding ICE (the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency).

Advertisement

“This (World Cup) is a moment where we are welcoming the world. Yet I've had many reach out to me to ask if there will be ICE agents outside of the stadium or, ‘Will I have to carry my documentation on me at all times?' These are the kinds of conditions the president is making right now in New York City and across this country.”

During this summer's Club World Cup in the U.S., FIFA received complaints from fans about alleged sightings of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE officials at stadiums hosting matches. In a statement to The Athletic in September, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said that despite the reports made to FIFA, neither ICE nor CPB conducted enforcement, describing it as “another case of fear-mongering.”

Mamdani has also urged the Trump administration to facilitate access for those seeking to attend next year's World Cup and make clear that visitors are welcome. He says that New York City is anticipating a $4billion drop in tourism revenues “this year alone.”

He says: “I am running to lead this city to make clear that this is a city not just of the world, where 40 percent of us were born outside of this country, myself included, but one that welcomes the world. We need to do everything in our power to make that message clear to each and every person.”

Should Mamdani win power, he says he will appoint a World Cup czar in the Mayor's office to assist the New York/New Jersey host committee and FIFA.

“We want this to be a tournament that has a legacy for New Yorkers, not just those who come to visit us for a few weeks or a month,” he says. “That means using this as an opportunity to expedite permitting reform that we have here in New York City, so we can have more outdoor events and live streaming of these matches, and bring the tournament to schoolchildren across the five boroughs.

“I remember when I've gone to games, one of the biggest stresses is how long are you waiting for the train or the bus? There's real work to be done to ensure that that is a seamless experience for anyone.”

Advertisement

Now we know how he wants to fix FIFA and New York City, is there anything Mamdani would change about soccer itself?

“I've become a hater of VAR (video assistant referees),” he sighs. “Just the delays. I like the goal-line technology, it's quick, but I'm, ‘VAR out'.”

And what about his beloved Arsenal? Is this finally going to be his team's year after three consecutive years of second-placed finishes in the Premier League?

“There were a lot of jokes when we won the (Democrat) primary about how unexpected a feeling it must be for an Arsenal fan,” he says.

“Every year, I'm just as confident. Every year after disappointment is one of hope. But this one will be different.”

 Francis Amuzu plays for Gremio in Brazil

Gremio forward, Francis Amuzu has dismissed claims that his renewed desire to play for the Black Stars is driven by Ghana's qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

According to Francis Amuzu, his motivation to play for the Black Stars is far more personal and has nothing to do with the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The 26-year-old, who previously turned down a national team invitation in 2022, recently declared his readiness to wear the Ghana jersey, a decision that has stirred mixed reactions among fans and pundits.

Many believe Amuzu's timing is no coincidence, coming just days after Ghana qualified for the next World Cup. 

Francis Amuzu declares readiness to play for Ghana at the 2026 World Cup

But speaking to Asempa FM, the Belgium-born winger stressed that his choice stems from a deep sense of pride and a promise to his father that he will play for Ghana.

“To be honest, it is not for the World Cup. Two years ago, I made my Ghanaian passport. Now I'm reading news that because of the World Cup I want to come. 
No, it is not because of that. It is also part of my decision to play, also because of my father,” Amuzu explained.

He further revealed that preparations for his switch to represent Ghana started long before the World Cup qualification was secured.

“My agent contacted someone in Ghana. They told me let's make the passport ready and everything. I was like, no problem, I will do it for sure, so I did the passport and everything, and now I have my Ghanaian passport. I am proud of it because it can help me for many things, not only for the national team,” he added.

Amuzu's connection to Ghana runs deep. His father, Theophilus Amuzu, is a former Hearts of Oak player who also represented Ghana at the U20 level.

Man City's injury-plagued midfielder facing fight to resurrect his career","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ballon-dor-broken-what-next-rodri-man-city-injury-plagued-midfielder-fight-resurrect-career/bltefc93625051bb930","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

Manchester City's Champions League visit to Villarreal should have been a triumphant homecoming for Rodri, a return to the club that made him. But the midfielder will get no warm welcome back from his former fans at the Estadio de la Ceramica on Tuesday as he instead recovers from a hamstring injury that has raised further doubts over his ability to get back to his best a year after undergoing knee surgery.

Rodri was born in Madrid and took his first steps in organised football with Rayo Majadahonda and then Atletico Madrid, but he became a professional with Villarreal. Atletico let him go in 2013 as they believed he lacked the physical presence needed to make it so, aged 17, he moved to the Yellow Submarine. Not wanting to put all his eggs in one basket, he also enrolled in a degree in Business Studies at the University of Castellon and moved into student accommodation.

And when he broke into the Villarreal first team in 2015, his fellow students were shocked to see the midfielder who was coming up against Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi each week walk past them in hallways on their way to doing laundry. ""People flipped out when they saw Rodri still living in student halls when he started playing in La Liga,"" friend Valentin Henarejos told Marca. ""He shared space with everyone. He liked to be with his friends or sit on the sofa with everyone. But of course people were shocked to see him play ping pong or put on the washing machine.

""When he got to La Liga he didn't change on a personal level, he lived the same way training, travelling to matches, resting and studying. He managed the step up well.""

Rodri, who drove an Opel Corsa and had a 'half-broken' mobile phone when he was starting out, said Villarreal ""gave me everything"" and was ""the ideal place to grow as a footballer"", but he did not stick around long. Atletico signed Rodri in the summer of 2018 for €20 million just before he had turned 22, and one year later more than tripled their investment when he was sold to Manchester City for €70m (£62.5m), where he became the Cityzens' record signing at the time. 

It proved to be money very well spent as Rodri helped guide City to four successive Premier League titles and scored the goal that delivered them the Champions League at long last. Having helped Spain win Euro 2024 - their first major international trophy for 12 years - he won the Ballon d'Or, the first-ever City player to do so and the first Spaniard since Luis Suarez in 1960. Not bad for an aspiring business student!

But Rodri now faces a careeer crossroads as the niggling injuries have piled up since he tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in September 2024. There are genuine fears that that he will never be the same player again, certainly not the resilient athlete who could play every match and practically guarantee that his team would win whenever he was on the field.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

John Beddington, the longtime tennis administrator who was one of the first tournament directors of the event that is now called the Nitto ATP Finals, passed away last week aged 83.

For more than five decades, Beddington was a key figure in the sport who shaped many, including the best players in the world and children in need. From laying the groundwork for some of the sport's biggest events to giving back to the community, he has left tennis far greater than he found it. 

Beddington was tournament director of the Commercial Union Grand Prix Masters from 1972 through 1976, and later played a critical role in Barclays becoming the title sponsor of the tournament when it moved to The O2 in London.

Three years later, Beddington became Executive Vice President of Tennis Canada and remained with the organisation until 1995. He was tournament director for what is now the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers. 

In that capacity, Beddington not only built one of the best tournaments in the world — it is now an ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 event — but left a positive impression on the biggest stars in the sport.

Ivan Lendl, a former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, won the Canadian event six times between 1980 and 1989.

“I got to know John through the Canadian Open. We stayed in touch over the years,” Lendl said. “John was a great guy, I always enjoyed seeing him at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. John did a fantastic job in Toronto and Montreal. I appreciated his wicked sense of humor and was very sad to hear about John's passing.”



Valerie Tetreault, Vice President of Communications, Professional Events and Tournament Director of the National Bank Open in Montreal, said that everyone associated with Tennis Canada and Canadian tennis mourns Beddington's passing.

“The word trailblazer is sometimes used too often, but in John's case it is absolutely fitting. He dedicated his life to the growth of our sport both in Canada and on a global level,” Tetreault. “His influence on our flagship WTA and ATP 1000 tournaments, the National Bank Open presented by Rogers in Toronto and Montreal, cannot be understated and their growth into the prestigious, world-renowned events they are today is in large part down to him. 

“His legacy in Canadian tennis is enormous, and he will be remembered for the incredible footprint he leaves behind on our sport.”

Two years ago, Beddington was honoured at Wimbledon by the International Tennis Hall of Fame and the International Tennis Federation with the Golden Achievement Award.

“I have been fortunate to have had a very long career in tennis and was lucky to be around when tennis went open in 1968,” Beddington said at the time. “I'm thankful for the tremendous mentors, colleagues, and great friends I've made around the world in the sport over the years. It has been rewarding to see the sport thrive globally and I'm happy to have been able to play a role in tennis' global development.”

Beddington also was a co-founder of the longtime ATP Champions Tour event held at Royal Albert Hall in London and helped launch countless other tournaments.

Throughout his time in the sport, Beddington raised close to £2 million for charity, supporting several causes and organisations, including Give It Your Max, for which he was patron. The goal was to try to keep kids off the street and instead introduce them to sport.

Give It Your Max posted on Instagram: “John's kindness, vision, and enthusiasm will be deeply missed, but his impact on the tennis world - and on the lives he helped to change through our programmes - will continue to be felt for many years to come.”

Beddington is survived by his wife, Roseann Madden Beddington, and his sons, David Paul Madden Beddington and James Edward Beddington.

And she's soared in spite of it all.She's telling that story 30 short seconds in a striking new advertisement for the upcoming ""Wicked"" sequel, ""Wicked: For Good.""In the ad, the two-time Grand Slam champion swings freely on the tennis court in tribute to the two-part Hollywood blockbuster by director John M. Chu, which is based on the Stephen Schwartz musical that tells the ""untold story"" of the famous witches of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" Elphaba and Glinda.Wearing on-theme pink and green, Gauff speaks to her experiences as a wunderkind-turned-superstar in a clip that's jam-packed with allusions to the vivid world of Oz.Read more: Jim Courier: A movie will be made about “inspirational” Coco Gauff after US Open strugglesThe lines of the tennis court are transformed into a yellow (gold) brick road as Gauff plays a point, as positive and negative news headlines swirl around her. But instead of being brought down by the pressure, she soars, inspired by the word ""unlimited"" written across the sky.

To stage an international event like this week's Challenger Hamburg requires the dedication of many committed individuals. Ball kids, player transportation, tournament liaisons and much more must be organized and coordinated before and during the tennis.Even the on-court staff had to make its way to northern Germany. For the line umpires in particular, this presents a unique challenge. Last year, the 22-member crew that monitored the baseline, sidelines and service lines at the venue of the Hamburg Tennis Association came from twelve different nations.📲 🖥️ Stream ATP Challenger Tour Sioux Falls this week on the Tennis Channel appHow do you become a line umpire?“You need a specific qualification to work as a line umpire at a Challenger event,” explains Vlada, a tennis umpire from the Ukrainian Tennis Federation.

Such training consists of a theoretical and a practical section.Vlada holds an even higher qualification, the so-called White Badge.

Selection is based on the event's requirements and the individual officials' experience. Line umpires can apply to take part in specific tournaments, after which the Chief of Officials picks the suitable candidates and invites them.On court, they work in rotation: 45 minutes on, followed by 45 minutes off.“At indoor tournaments it's easier for me to stay focused. You're not affected by outside factors like sun or wind,” explained Maria, a sports management student from Ukraine who lives in Kyiv.“This week we have an outstanding team, I'd even say one of the best,” said Guilherme from Lisbon. He has been active for over a year and also worked at the ATP event in Estoril. He loves his home tournament, but his big dream is to be on the lines at Roland Garros in Paris.On average, line umpires work 25 to 30 tournaments per year, which also means keeping an eye on costs. This varies from event to event.“We usually arrange our own travel. The hotel is generally provided,” explained Miljan from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who has been part of this traveling circus for ten years.

Miljan also points to a growing issue that economists would describe as the substitution of labor with capital. With the introduction of electronic line-calling at many tournaments, the job of the line umpire is becoming redundant. Technology now makes the calls on whether a ball is in or out, with only one chair umpire overseeing play. This is already standard at ATP Tour events.“This makes competition among line umpires tougher, because fewer of us are needed,” Miljan said.At Challenger level, however, this often-expensive technology is not yet a widespread option for organizers.Activities off the courtEven though line umpires travel widely, there is usually little time for sightseeing. During a tournament week, they spend almost all their time at the venue. Especially in winter, when days are short, there's little room for leisure activities.And one important rule must always be observed.“We're under a strict alcohol ban for 12 hours before match start,” Vlada reported.

World No. 2 Jannik Sinner headlines the draw and will open his title bid against Daniel Altmaier, a player he recently defeated at the Rolex Shanghai Masters.Sinner first played in Vienna in 2019, when, ranked No. 119, he needed a wild card to enter the main draw. But even then, tournament director Herwig Straka recognized his potential.“It's only a matter of time before Jannik Sinner breaks into the Top 100. He will certainly play a decisive role in shaping the future of the ATP Tour,” he said back then.👉 READ MORE: Inside Jannik Sinner's Vienna returnThe Italian required another wild card in 2020, before his big breakthrough in 2021. After reaching the semifinals that year, he cracked the Top 10 of the ATP Rankings for the first time. In 2022 he advanced to the quarterfinals, before crowning his fifth and most recent Vienna campaign in 2023 with a dramatic final victory over Daniil Medvedev. The three-set battle, lasting three hours and four minutes, went down as one of the tournament's greatest matches.The Erste Bank Open has long held a special place in Sinner's heart. At the 2021 trophy ceremony, after thanking his team in English, he charmed the sold-out Stadthalle by switching to his unmistakable South Tyrolean dialect: “Jetzt red ma amoi deitsch.” (“Now let's speak German.”)Sinner has often emphasized the special bond he feels with Vienna: “This is a great tournament that helped me with wild cards when I wasn't high enough in the rankings to enter directly,” he said in 2023. “People in Vienna have always looked after me very well. I feel very comfortable here, so the Erste Bank Open will continue to be very important for me in the coming years.”

Entering Basel ranked just four spots below his career-high of No. 42, Fonseca was looking to snap a two-match losing streak after defeats in Brussels and Laver Cup, where the youngster made his debut in the team competition.His first opponent would not be easy as he drew Mpetshi Perricard, a 22-year-old Frenchman armed with one of the biggest serves in the men's game.

Fonseca took that momentum into the second set, where he claimed the lone break of the match en route to a 3-0 lead and served his way towards the finish line.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

Oscar Piastri's Drivers' Championship lead took a hit at the United States Grand Prix as he finished fifth on Sunday, and lost a total of 23 points to Max Verstappen across the weekend in Texas.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri is searching for answers behind his lack of pace at the United States Grand Prix weekend as Max Verstappen dominated to significantly close the gap at the top of the standings.

While the points margin between Piastri and his McLaren team mate Lando Norris has ebbed and flowed throughout the 2025 season, Verstappen remained on the fringes of the picture, with his deficit standing at 104 points following the Dutch Grand Prix.

However, the Red Bull driver has out-qualified and out-raced both McLaren drivers in every session at the subsequent four Grands Prix, with the gap between him and Piastri now just 40 after the Australian could only claim fifth in Austin while Verstappen won.

Having struggled for pace across the Austin weekend and finishing 29.678s off the lead, as well as retiring at Turn 1 of the Sprint in a collision involving Norris, Piastri is determined to find answers for his difficulties in Texas.

“Today was what it was,” he reflected. “I think, with the pace that I had, I did more or less everything. I gained a spot at the start and couldn't really ask much more with the pace that I had.

“We need to try and understand why the pace was lacking this weekend, but not everything was bad. With the pace I had, I tried to execute the race the best as I could, and that's all I can ask for.”

Asked how much of a threat he is feeling from Verstappen and Norris – who finished in second place to close his own points gap to the leader down to 14 – Piastri added: “Obviously, Max is closing in and so is Lando, but the gap has not been comfortable at any point this year.

""Yes, it has been a bit bigger at certain points, but at no point has it felt like I could relax or sit back.

“My mentality hasn't changed, and it certainly won't now. I'm just trying to do the best job I can every weekend and naturally, the results will take care of themselves.”

Formula 1 moves on to Mexico City next weekend as the three championship contenders prepare to battle it out once again.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies gives his verdict on Max Verstappen's victorious drive at the United States Grand Prix.

Red Bull boss Laurent Mekies was full of praise for Max Verstappen after his dominant victory at the United States Grand Prix, believing we are witnessing ""history in the making"" as he chases a fifth straight Drivers' Championship title.

Verstappen's sumptuous weekend in Austin, where he won the Sprint and the Grand Prix as well as bagging pole for both, reduced his gap to Championship leader Oscar Piastri from 63 points to just 40, with five races and two further Sprints to come this season.

The Dutchman was 104 points behind Piastri just four races ago, having conceded that he was not in the Championship fight back in the summer. But that has all turned around after a dominant string of performances, the Red Bull man having won three out of the last four Grands Prix.

“I think watching Max driving is watching history in the making… He surprises us every time he goes out on track, he surprises us on how much he's pushing us between a session and another, how much sensitivity he has in stuff that sometimes we can see and sometimes we cannot see,” said Mekies after Verstappen's fourth win in Austin.

“He has been investing himself so hard into supporting the team, supporting the project to get back to competitiveness.

“I'm sure then when you are actually starting to fight for this better position, I'm sure it brings even more out of him.”

Verstappen might have had the perfect weekend on paper, but with the two McLaren cars tripping over each other in the Sprint, and then Lando Norris being held up by Charles Leclerc in the race, it was hard to assess the exact level of Red Bull's dominance.

The Dutchman was certainly faster over one lap, with Norris having a fair chance to beat him in both Qualifying and Sprint Qualifying, but the picture in the race itself over longer runs remains less clear.

“Were McLaren really so far away or not, or are we going to have a wake-up call in Mexico? That's how we approach it,” Mekies continued.

“Of course, if you look at the string of results – second, first, first, second, first – then of course it's outstanding. It's a fantastic moment and everybody should be proud of it, especially the people you don't see, the ones that are back in the factory and we try to continue with that intensity.”

Verstappen remains the driving force behind the team, having scored 306 of their 331 points this season, and can take advantage of the two McLaren drivers taking points from each other.

And now, the Dutchman seems to have a car under him that he can really attack with. Even some issues in the Sprint were ironed out by the team, who continue to push to make sure nothing is left to chance as Verstappen pursues what at many times this season looked an unlikely bid for a fifth straight World Championship.

“You know we don't separate Max and the car and the team,"" Mekies added. ""It's one group and, as we said, Max is not sitting outside of the project, watching the project, he's at the heart of the project.

“We do not feel we are in a dominant position, but we certainly feel that we have cancelled out a large part of the deficit we had in the first part of the season and now it's down to the last details.

“Don't get me wrong, even on a weekend like today there will be things we can learn, there will be things that we didn't get fully right and that's where our focus, that's where our intensity goes – analysing our data and challenging each other because that's what we do and getting the car in the best possible shape for Mexico.”

Lewis Hamilton believes things are finally beginning to gel at Ferrari, with a pair of strong performances across the United States Grand Prix weekend.

Lewis Hamilton expressed relief after a strong weekend at the United States Grand Prix left him feeling that he has “finally” made a much-needed breakthrough with Ferrari.

The seven-time World Champion may not have achieved his goal of a maiden podium with Ferrari at the Circuit of The Americas, but a pair of fourth place finishes across the Sprint and Grand Prix marked an uptick in performance following a recent dip in results.

“I'm finally feeling like I'm on top of the car,” said Hamilton. “I think we still have some improvements we could make. We can definitely extract more, particularly on my side, because Qualifying wasn't as good as I had hoped and the start wasn't great.

“There are always areas to improve, but it's positive going into the next race, so I hope we can have an even better weekend.”

After dropping back from Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc in the opening stages on Sunday, Hamilton recovered and passed his team mate for third shortly before Leclerc, who had started on soft tyres, pitted.

Going longer relegated Hamilton back to fourth, and he was unable to close the margin for a second time, but a strong team result of third and fourth closed the gap to Mercedes in the Teams' Championship, leaving the 40-year-old satisfied with his work.

“We can definitely take a lot of positives,” he added. “Just the way we have extracted points this weekend – given we haven't upgraded the car, we are still somehow just there or thereabouts.

“I got a bad start, managed to still get a good Turn 1, which then recovered the start. I was kind of in the fight at the beginning and got Charles before his stop but lost a bit of time there to Lando.

“After my stop, I came out so far behind, so the strategy wasn't ideal, but a perfect result in terms of points for the team.”

The board of directors is also considering other “strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.”


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	Sounds like Warner Bros. Discovery is for sale after all.


	Amid swirling reports of bidding interest by Paramount Global, the WBD board of directors says is it “has initiated a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” That's the first acknowledgement of a (metaphorical) “For Sale” sign hanging from the iconic WB water tower.

	In a press release on Tuesday morning, the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors said it has received “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties.” And it's listening.

	“Strategic options” include continuing with the previously announced split and spin, a la NBCUniversal and Versant, a “transaction for the entire company” or “separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses.” There is even the potential for “an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. and spin-off of Discovery Global to our shareholders.”


	Basically, it's all on the table.


	“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally,” David Zaslav, the president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement. “We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.”

	











	“It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,” Zaslav added. “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.”


	Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that new Paramount owner David Ellison made a $20-per-share bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which was dismissed. It is currently unclear who is making these other “unsolicited bids,” although David Faber at CNBC mentioned on-air Tuesday that Comcast and Netflix have made inquiries. THR has reached out for comment to both of those companies.


	“Our decision to initiate this review underscores the Board's commitment to considering all opportunities to determine the best value for our shareholders,” Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors, said. “We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value. That said, we determined taking these actions to broaden our scope is in the best interest of shareholders.”


	There is no deadline for this review; WBD is continuing to work toward its previously announced separation, which will keep its studios, HBO and HBO Max in one bucket (led by Zaslav) and boot its basic cable channels (the Turner channels and Discovery channels) and streamer Discovery+ to a new company led by current Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels.

	











	Also on Tuesday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery announced a price hike for its HBO Max streaming service. So, there's a dollar extra per month per subscriber in value for a buyer!

The streamer has won the rights to global sensation and plans projects that are scripted and unscripted, live-action and animated.  


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	The Catan franchise may have taken the longest road to a Hollywood adaptation, but the hit board game has finally struck a deal to bring the iconic resource-management strategy game to the screen. 


Netflix has won the rights to the Asmodee board game and plans an array of projects — scripted and unscripted, live-action and animated. The streamer describes the TV and film projects as set in “a place where settlers must navigate bountiful and varied landscapes, shifting alliances and limited resources, while robbers roam the land.”

	“Anyone who has played Catan knows that the intense strategy at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,” said Jinny Howe, head of scripted series, U.S. and Canada, Netflix. “We're thrilled to partner across series, features, animation and games to bring this world to life for hardcore ‘Settlers' and new fans alike.”


	Originally released in Germany in 1995 as The Settlers of Catan, the game is set on the fictional island where players must scramble for resources. The game has sold more than 45 million copies globally and been translated into over 40 languages. In 2010, The Washington Post dubbed it “the board game of our time.” 


	“Millions of people are enjoying Catan since it was created and for many, it remains a gateway to modern board gaming,” said Thomas Koegler, CEO of Asmodee. “I'm thrilled to see the game expanding to a larger audience who will discover the richness of its universe, I find it exciting for the future of the brand. It's also a testament that board gaming is truly part of pop culture and a popular form of entertainment in everyone's homes, and I'm delighted to continue Asmodee's relationship with Netflix.” 

	











	“When our father Klaus Teuber first introduced Catan 30 years ago, he imagined an aspirational world where people would gather by trading, building and settling together — both at the table and beyond it,” added Benjamin and Guido Teuber, co-CEOs of Catan GmbH. “This collaboration with Netflix marks an exciting new chapter in that journey. For three decades, Catan has connected families and friends around the world. Now, we're thrilled to see it inspire storytelling on a global stage — staying true to our father's vision of creativity, strategy and human connection.”


Catan hasn't been without a bit of controversy, as the game has been described as advocating settler colonialism. 


	Netflix has built up the largest army of game titles to adapt in recent years. In addition to Catan, the streamer also has Castlevania, Family Pack (The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow), Exploding Kittens, an upcoming Assassin's Creed series, a  Monopoly reality competition series, and a Gears of War  film.

After season two's penultimate episode, King unpacks building a future and supe family with Marie and Jordan, and why “a lot of her hatred for Marie is actually hatred for herself.”


							By 

	Abbey White


Associate Editor & News Writer


[This story contains spoilers from Gen V season two, episode seven, “Hell Week.”]


	For Keeya King, the Gen V actress portraying Marie Moreau's estranged sister Annabeth, her surprise onscreen debut in the season's fifth episode was actually her last to film. “As an actor, you're kind of like, ‘How am I supposed to do this and we haven't even got the story?' But that's the point of acting, and you always shoot things out of order. I went on my own and imagined the scene, and then when it came to shooting all the other stuff, I had that in my memory.”

					'Gen V' Showrunner Explains the Shifting Powers -- and Power Players -- of Season 2		
			









	The moment is a near-death experience, in which Marie (Jaz Sinclair) pushes her powers to save Annabeth after the younger Moreau's throat is slit in Elmira. The sequence was “a blast,” according to the actress. “Actually shooting that sequence was insane. We just had a blast doing the cut on my neck, and then all the blood everywhere. We have a great makeup team.”


	Annabeth's emergence was two seasons in the making, and sets the Moreau women on a path of reconnection after years of resentment and guilt around their parents' death. Over the course of several episodes, the two have gone from reluctant roadtrippers to a tentative supe team and family, thanks in part to friends like Emma (Lizze Broadway) and Jordan (Derek Luh, London Thor). 

	











	Amid the constant do-or-die situations, the sisters have expanded their relationship and — as is later revealed — both of their powers as the threat of Cipher looms. Yes, Annabeth is also a supe with a form of precognition, or the ability to know or become aware of future events before they happen. Though how she got those powers versus her sister — from V or something else  — is not made totally clear. 


	As for when she got them, while Marie was sent away and abandoned after their parents' deaths, Annabeth hid her powers from Aunt Pam (Judith Scott) and others, which viewers learn emerged even before Marie's. So early, in fact, that Annabeth saw the duo's parents die before it happened. 


	Regardless, with episode seven, Marie finally has her sister back and the two seem to be healing. But being so focused on protecting her newly found sister, as well as others she loves like Jordan and her friends, has left Marie's relationship with her ragtag family strained. And that's largely thanks to a potentially dangerous singular vision that she and only she can stop Cipher and possibly even Homelander (Antony Starr). 


	As Marie dances with the darker potential of her powers and how to reckon with her Odessa origins, Annabeth plays a key role alongside Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas), Cate (Maddie Phillips) and Jordan in helping keep her powerful sister — someone she's always thought of as a monster — from crossing the line into the thing they both hate, and ultimately someone who could more closely resemble Homelander.  

	











	In the conversation below tied to episode seven, The Hollywood Reporter spoke with King about Annabeth's own supe origins, getting over the fear of her sister and the monstrous supe trope, and the family and collective power Annabeth is building with Marie's friends and partner on her own journey ahead of the season two finale. 


	***


In episode six, while in the bunker, Zoe Neuman (Olivia Morandin) positions Marie as a savior, very different from how viewers understand Annabeth's relationship to her sister. How does that moment, alongside the fact that Marie essentially saved Annabeth from death, affect her opinion of her sister and whether Marie's actually a hero or villain?


	In season one, we see [Annabeth] say, “You're a monster. You killed them.” So she has that feeling that her sister is a monster. But then we see Zoe say [she's] a savior, and it starts to change. She's like, “What do you mean? This young woman is looking at my sister as a hero? That's not what I know.” We begin to see little glimpses of Annabeth starting to change her mind, not only about Marie, but also about supes. Annabeth is a supe, but she hates being a supe because of her experience when she was younger. Supes are monsters. They're not good people. That's what she believes. 


	But then she started to spend time with all of these strangers, and is learning maybe these powers can be used for good. I also do think there's jealousy when she sees Zoe, this young girl having a relationship with her sis. She wants that. She has Aunt Pam, but Aunt Pam actually isn't blood related. She's our mom's friend. So we start to see, especially in episode six, Annabeth wanting to have a sister relationship again. But that would mean complete forgiveness and complete understanding of Marie, and also supes. 

	











In episode seven, viewers see Marie use her powers against her friends following this conversation in Stan Edgar's bunker about whether Marie is similar or different from Homelander. In that somewhat unsettling scene, the camera focuses on Annabeth's face, and she has a big reaction. What is running through her head in that moment? 


	That reaction is so complex. I think it's a bit of, “Wait, is Marie turning dark, evil? What's happening there?” But this is also coming from the visions that she's having. So it's also like, “Wait, what are these visions trying to tell me?” Because she's also trying to understand her powers. So what are the visions trying to show, how do we fix it, and how do we get out of it? It's a layered set of emotions. Ultimately, I do think Annabeth is trying to believe Marie is a good person even though she did some horrible things; she killed our parents. She does want Marie to live and survive, but is she going to be taken over? Is she actually strong enough to handle it? 


When talking to Pam in episode three, Marie discovers that Annabeth was the “real miracle” and that no medical intervention was supposedly needed in her conception. Viewers later learn Annabeth is a supe like her sister. Did the writers address with you whether Annabeth received V from her parents? And why do you think she holds them in such high regard and resents Marie, despite the fact that they're the reason both Marie and Annabeth have their powers? 


	I was sat down by our showrunner Michele [Fazekas], who told me I was also given powers at inception. I was also told that my powers developed before Marie. But the thing is, she didn't understand what they were. She just thought they were dreams, [that] something was wrong with her. So a lot of her hatred for Marie is actually hatred for herself. We're human beings, so sometimes we blame other people, but eventually, girl, you need to take some accountability. They're [also] kids who don't know what they have. No one's there to explain it to you. These kids are given these powers they just don't know how to control yet.

	











	I do think Annabeth resents her parents as well, and is upset with them. It's so interesting having you bring up this question. So Annabeth dies, obviously, and is resurrected by Marie, but I toyed with the idea of what would it be like? Who do I see in the afterlife? I saw images of my parents and what they would say. As I was thinking about it, they were like, “I'm sorry. We're sorry, but we love you both, and you'll be back. Marie will bring you back.” So I embedded that in my performance, as in, they told me that they apologize and they love us, and eventually they would love for us to sort of reconcile and be a family again. 


By episode seven, Annabeth has settled in a little more with Marie's friends, learning more about Marie and her relationships and life, and what it is to be a supe. Do you think she accepts herself at this point? Do you think she wants to be a part of and has found power in this collective family with Marie, or does she still want to go back to Pam ahead of what's on the horizon? 


	There's still a lot of grief about our parents passing, about a lot of time wasted. What's really cool is that we see later on Annabeth has to spend time with Jordan and Emma, and she sort of embraces this supe life, and what it could look like, how you could do it, or how you can exist in a way that's helpful to humanity [with them]. Maybe they're not so bad. I do think she eventually starts leaning towards thinking, maybe what's inside of me isn't so bad. Maybe I should give this life, especially with Marie, a chance. She starts leaning towards that, and I do think it's greatly in part, because of her time with Jordan.

There are more than 300 staff members aiming to unionize at the 9:30 Club, The Anthem, The Atlantis and Lincoln Theatre.

Business Writer


	Workers at Washington D.C.'s major concert venues are working to unionize. 


	Production staff as well as employees in food services, box office and those staffing the door at D.C.'s 9:30 Club, a well-known venue that helped launched the careers of bands including Nirvana and R.E.M, as well as at The Anthem, one of the larger East Coast venues with a capacity of 6,000, The Atlantis and Lincoln Theatre, have asked management at I.M.P. to allow the process to move forward for voluntary recognition of the unionization efforts.

	On Monday, workers from those venues delivered petitions to I.M.P. management on behalf of the more than 300 organizing staff members, calling for card check agreements, in which the employer agrees to recognize a union as an employee group's collective bargaining representative, if the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit sign authorization cards. 


	The union push comes as workers are pushing for higher wages, more consistent schedules and better work safety, as some workers can be asked to lift heavy materials and manage crowd surfers.

	“I love working here, but we just want better support from our employer,” said Hunter Spears, who works door staff. “I've taken boots to the face. I've been thrown up on. I've hurt my wrist catching crowd surfers.” 

	











	“We work at an internationally renowned venue, and we deserve to be treated like we work at an internationally renowned venue. I don't feel like we are treated with dignity,” said stagehand and audio engineer Lee Reber, who works at The Anthem as well as I.M.P.'s U Street corridor venues.


	Departments at 9:30 Club, the Atlantis, and Lincoln Theatre that deal with food, beverage and staffing the door and floor are organizing with support from UNITE HERE Local 25. Sound and stage production staff at the U Street corridor venues and Anthem have reached out to IATSE Local 22, the behind-the-scenes entertainment union. I.M.P.'s box office staff across all four venues are organizing with IATSE Local 868.

The singer complained this week after his 1986 Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 hit was used without permission in a trolling video by the president.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	The Trump meme presidency continued to (t)roll down the highway on Monday (Oct. 20) when the White House responded to a request for comment about Kenny Loggins‘ demand that officials remove an unauthorized use of one of his biggest hits in an offensive AI-generated video.


	In a statement on his Instagram on Monday, the singer slammed Trump's use of his 1986 Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 Top Gun hit “Danger Zone” in a clip posted on Oct. 18 featuring an AI Trump, wearing a crown, flying a “King Trump”-labeled fighter jet and dumping what appears to be torrents of human excrement on protesters at the massive “No Kings” rallies on Saturday.

	











	“I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately,” Loggins wrote of what he called the completely “unauthorized” use of the song, adding that he was not asked for permission, and if he had been, he would have denied. “I can't imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together.”


	The deployment of the scatological clip by the 79-year-old president is the latest example of the White House's use of artificial intelligence to create memes intended to troll their perceived enemies. In the latest case the target was peacefully protesting American citizens concerned about what they see as eroding democratic norms from what experts have said is an increasingly imperial presidency.

	











	According to EW, when the magazine asked the White House for comment about Loggins' statement, an official rep responded with a Top Gun meme: a picture of stars Tom Cruise and Anthony Edwards on the tarmac with the movie's superimposed catchphrase “I Feel the Need For Speed.”


	Organizers said the massive No Kings rallies on Saturday decrying what protesters say is the authoritarian bent of the Trump administration featured 2,600 events in nearly every state that drew more than seven million attendees, making it one of the largest mass protests in U.S. history.


	Loggins joins a long list of musicians who have lashed out at Trump for using their music without permission in his campaign and White House videos. Just recently, the members of Blue Öyster Cult distanced themselves from the president after “(Don't Fear) The Reaper” was used in an AI clip that mocked Democrats via a fake band video featuring VP JD Vance on drums and a cloaked Trump hitting a cowbell while new lyrics scroll across the screen trolling Democrats.


	Since his first presidential term, Trump has been called out by number of songwriters and performers for unauthorized use of their music at his rallies, in ads and in political attack messaging, including Adele, Beyoncé, Celine Dion, Foo Fighters, the estates and families of Laura Branigan, George Harrison, Sinéad O'Connor and Tom Petty, as well as Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Pharrell, Rihanna, Neil Young, Ozzy Osbourne, the Rolling Stones, Panic! at the Disco and many more.

Lauren Daigle's ""You Say"" sparks one of the season's most emotional Battles.

Snoop Dogg used his first steal of the season on The Voice Monday night (Oct. 20), stepping in after Niall Horan chose to advance Kirbi following an emotional Battle-round performance of Lauren Daigle's “You Say.”

	“It was beautiful,” Horan said. “It was emotional, it was everything we want in a Battle. What's really hard is you two have become such good friends over this. Kirbi, that rasp is so beautiful at the top of your register. Not many people have that. Like Snoop said, you looked like a veteran up there. Carolina, the way you started that song, to sing low in your register, straight out of the gate, was so impressive.”


	Ultimately, Horan chose Kirbi, explaining, “She really gave me the emotion that I wanted from that song.” But before Carolina could exit, Snoop hit his button, using his first successful steal of the Battle rounds to add her to his team.


	“The thing I loved about Carolina the most was her growth, hearing her from the Blinds to now,” Snoop said. “You could tell she's ready.”


	Elsewhere in the episode, Max Chambers and Aarik Duncan performed “Just the Two of Us,” drawing praise from Snoop for their chemistry. “You complemented each other instead of outworking each other,” he said, adding that Max would be his pick for the win. Horan agreed, saying, “Aarik, you've taken it to a different level, man. You really stood out in a great way. And Max, you're just a complete natural.”

	











	Other Battle pairings included Aiden Ross and Ava Nat performing Niall's own duet “What a Time,” while Leyton Robinson and Manny Costello took on Chris Stapleton's “Think I'm in Love With You.” Vinya Chhabra and Conrad Khalil sang “It Takes Two,” and Team Snoop's Emmanuel Rey and Mindy Miller delivered “Angel From Montgomery.”


	Heading into the final night of Battles, each coach has one more pairing left. Michael Bublé also has one steal remaining.

	Kool G Rap and Grand Puba were the honorees at the Paid in Full Foundation's 2025 Hip Hop Grandmaster Awards celebration. The third annual fundraising gala on Saturday (Oct. 18) also included two inaugural award presentations: the Quincy Jones Award given to funk icon George Clinton and the Contributor Award, presented to pioneers Kool Rock Ski of the Fat Boys and Jalil Hutchins of Whodini.

	After accepting his award, Grand Puba said, “Amazing! This was the BET, VH1 and the Grammy Awards all rolled into one. It's the biggest honor I could have ever imagined.”


	Held in Las Vegas at the Bellagio Resort & Casino, the PIFF gala drew a mix of music artists and other celebs. Among the attendees were Dr. Dre, Nas, Ludacris, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds, Gayle King, Fab 5 Freddy, Rakim, Scarface and Kool Moe Dee.


	Serving as host was 2025 Grammy Lifetime Achievement honoree and 2024 Hip Hop Grandmaster Award recipient Roxanne Shanté. “Let me explain it with a rhyme,” said Shanté about the gala. “A night of fun with family and friends. Dancing and singing from beginning to end. You can't stay in your seat, every moment on stage is a hip hop treat. The smiles, the energy, the room filled with cheer. It was an honor to host. I can't wait until next year. That's the Hip Hop Grandmaster Awards.”

	











	Founded by Ben and Felicia Horowitz in 2022, the Paid in Full Foundation is a nonprofit charitable organization based in Las Vegas. Doug E. Fresh, who was also in attendance, underscored the importance of the foundation's annual awards show in an email to Billboard.


	“I turned down a major HBCU Homecoming show this weekend because the Paid in Full Grandmaster Awards are that important. You clear your calendar for something this powerful that it should be televised. In my nearly 45 years in the music business, I've never seen an awards show with this much class, integrity and genuine love for hip hop pioneers.”


	He continued, “Before the Paid in Full Foundation, supporting fellow pioneers was something that naturally fell to those of us who have had the ability to assist. Now, thanks to what Ben and Felicia Horowitz have formed, more pioneers can get the proper recognition and support they deserve — not just to live, but to continue creating beautiful art. To whom much is given, much is required; that's why I will always show up.”

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Netflix has closed a deal for the exclusive global rights to popular multi-player board game Catan. Under the wide-raging pact, the streamer will develop live-action and animated film and scripted TV series as well as unscripted projects and video games based on Catan by Klaus Teuber, originally released in 1995 as The Settlers of Catan, which has sold over 45 million copies and has been translated into over 40 languages.


	This marks the first attempt at bringing to the screen the fictional island of Catan — a place where settlers must navigate bountiful and varied landscapes, shifting alliances, and limited resources, while robbers roam the land. The game blends strategy, resource negotiation, and world-building.

	“Anyone who has played Catan knows that the intense strategy at the core of the game has endless opportunities for some serious drama,” said Jinny Howe, Head of Scripted Series, US and Canada, Netflix. “We're thrilled to partner across series, features, animation, and games to bring this world to life for hardcore ‘Settlers' and new fans alike.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Darren Kyman from the game's publisher Asmodee, Pete Fenlon from Catan Studio (an Asmodee studio), and Teuber's sons Guido Teuber and Benjamin Teuber will produce all projects under the deal alongside Roy Lee from Vertigo Entertainment.


	“Millions of people are enjoying Catan since it was created and for many, it remains a gateway to modern board gaming,” said Thomas Koegler, CEO of asmodee. “I'm thrilled to see the game expanding to a larger audience who will discover the richness of its universe, I find it exciting for the future of the brand.”  

	











	The deal extends Asmodee's existing relationship with Netflix, which spans the streamer's 2024 French film Family Pack, based on Asmodee's card game The Werewolves of Millers Hollow, as well as Asmodee creating board games based on popular Netflix shows such as Ozark, Squid Game, Stranger Things and Bridgerton.


	“When our father Klaus Teuber first introduced Catan thirty years ago, he imagined an aspirational world where people would gather by trading, building and settling together — both at the table and beyond it,” said Benjamin and Guido Teuber, co-CEOs of Catan GmbH. “This collaboration with Netflix marks an exciting new chapter in that journey.”


	In addition to Family Pack, other game-to-screen Netflix adaptations include  Arcane, Castlevania, Exploding Kittens as well as the upcoming  Assassin's Creed series, Clue and Monopoly  reality competition series, Magic: The Gathering animated series, the Dungeons and Dragons live-action series Forgotten Realms and the Gears of War  film.


	The deal was negotiated by CAA and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson and Christopher on behalf of Asmodee and Catan GmbH.

HBO Max is joining the price inflation wave sweeping through the streaming business, hiking the cost of its ad-supported and ad-free plans.


	Basic with Ads is going up $1 a month to $10.99, the service announced Tuesday, with the Standard plan rising $1.50 to $18.49 and Premium going up $2 to $22.99.


	The new prices go into effect immediately for new subscriptions. Existing monthly subscribers will be notified 30 days in advance of their plan renewing, with the higher prices starting from their next billing date on or after November 20.

	As of June 30, HBO Max parent Warner Bros. Discovery said it had 125.7 million paying subscribers to all of its streaming services. That blended stat includes HBO Max as well as legacy linear subscribers to HBO, who have access to the streaming service. The company will report its third-quarter financials on November 6.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	HBO Max was rebranded from Max earlier this year, undoing a revamp unveiled in 2023. It is a key asset in the mix as WBD undergoes a strategic review of its operations after receiving interest from multiple parties in acquiring all or part of the company. Paramount has submitted an initial bid to acquire the company but the offer was refused. WBD had earlier announced plans to split into two separate companies by next spring.


	Compared with the days of the direct-to-consumer streaming boom of 2019 and 2020, when a handful of major new players entered the market to challenge Netflix, prices have jumped sharply across the board. Disney's initial strategy was to wow consumers with an affordable price point on Disney+, which launched at $7 a month. Apple, similarly, came in a dollar cheaper than that in 2019. In the intervening years, as the difficult economics of streaming became fully apparent, especially for legacy media companies managing linear TV's decline, the calculus changed. Prices across the board have risen, with many services at or approaching double their initial cost.

	











	WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels, speaking at a Wall Street conference in 2023 a few months after the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, addressed the topic of streaming prices, leaving little doubt about the company's intentions. “There's no doubt that these products are priced way too low,” he said.

Thank you, but no.

Release Batgirl.

Tipping point is soon or now. To do this while thousands are out of work, with millions struggling to survive and get basic needs met, is utterly disgusting. There is no bottom.

All so Zas can get richer on this deal.

He has enough vests.

I am cancelling and urging all my friends to do the same.

This right here. Enough is enough. I pay annually but cancelled 2 months ago knowing Zas is greedy.

just like all the other streaming services not named “netflix”, hbo max is not a profitable platform. so he needs the margins to look at least somewhat attractive for the impending sale.

if people actually subscribed to these services, the prices wouldn't need to go up. but almost nobody does, because content creators are putting out more interesting and relatable content than hollywood.

EXCLUSIVE: Lindsie Landsman, whose father Todd Chrisley and stepmother Julie Chrisley were recently pardoned by President Trump and released from prison, is speaking out over her family's actions.


	Landsman is set to reveal that she has been threatened into silence, blamed for actions she didn't take, and blackmailed by members of her own family on her podcast.


	Landsman, who recently changed her name, starred in five seasons of USA Network's hit reality series Chrisley Knows Best, is set to spill the tea on episodes of her two podcasts – The Southern Tea and Coffee Convos, which she hosts with Teen Mom star Kail Lowry.

	“I never had any intention of doing this. The Lifetime documentary of my family came out… and a lot of the things that were aired were inaccurate depictions of what has transpired,” she said.




			Watch on Deadline		







Lifetime's The Chrisleys: Back to Reality highlights a number of challenges faced by members of the family, include Lindsie, the eldest daughter who is largely estranged from the family.


	Lindsie contacted Georgia's Department of Revenue and the FBI after her father's indictment, including asking for a restraining order against him. She told the FBI that her father had been attempting to exploit her. She previously claimed that Todd had threatened to leak a sex tape of her if she didn't lie for him in court.


	“The prosecutors read the letter Lindsie wrote to the FBI,” Savannah said in The Chrisleys: Back to Reality. “We're no longer family.” Chase added, “If your blood will screw you over, then a stranger definitely will.”

	











	On October 22, the first episode featuring Landsman's response will air on The Southern Tea with a second part airing on Coffee Convos on October 23. There will be a third part airing exclusively on Patreon on October 24 with the full audio of part three released on October 29. The conversations will be moderated by Lowry.


	She will divulge, for the first time, how the experience has affected her emotionally, psychologically, and personally, as a daughter, a woman, and a mother trying to protect her peace and “reclaim her story”.


	Lindsie is set to “share her truth” in her own words, supported by documentation including legal letters, emails, and filings that have never been made public before.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: A senior Channel 4 executive has said that the UK network is planning further AI experiments after screening a show hosted entirely by a machine-generated presenter.


Channel 4 unleashed AI journalist Aisha Gaban on Monday night in Will AI Take My Job?, but only revealed to viewers in the final seconds of the documentary that she was not a real human.


	The intentionally provocative stunt was firmly within Channel 4's remit to push creative boundaries and challenge audiences. Filmed as part of C4's Dispatches strand, it was the network's second most-watched show of the day, with 564,000 viewers.

	Louisa Compton, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs, told Deadline that it was “quite scary”  how quickly Gaban became realistic, as producer Kalel Productions kept iterating on the presenter alongside Seraphinne Vallora, an AI marketing agency.


	“This was a stunt designed to address the concerns that come with AI, how easy it is to fool people into thinking that something fake is real,” said Compton, who is leading on artificial intelligence commissioning for Channel 4 and helped draw up the broadcaster's AI principles.


	“I was actually surprised at how human she looked, how she had the odd wrinkle when she spoke, and actually how she managed to convey warmth in places.”

Did you notice anything different?This is Britain's first-ever AI TV presenter in a documentary. Viewers were kept in the dark until the very end.  It's part of a stunt aiming to show just how convincing AI has become, and how quickly it's improving. pic.twitter.com/APfH4ge3U6


	Compton said Gaban's limitations were obvious, however. Producers were unable to recreate her sitting in a chair interviewing subjects, meaning her on-screen contributions were limited to pieces to camera. Gaban's words were also scripted by the production team.

	











	Others pointed out that Gaban is not about to start replacing human-led journalism. “We're still a considerable way from AI being able to do live TV journalism,” a well-known British news anchor told Deadline, adding that it is hard to replicate the ability to “think, analyse and react” with “experience, knowledge and human empathy.”


	Compton has no plans to revisit Gaban, but said that AI will continue to be woven into shows she commissions. Channel 4 has experimented with using AI to anonymise interviewees in the past, including in the two-part series Kill List: Hunted by Putin's Spies. 


	Compton added that her team is also testing how AI can be used in documentary reconstruction scenes, though these have yet to screen on Channel 4.  


	The upsides of AI are not lost on others either — even those whose job it is to represent the interests of TV presenters. Mary Greenham, a seasoned agent to stars including Andrew Marr and Fiona Bruce through her agency NewsPresenters, said: “Do I think my presenters are at risk of losing their jobs? No. 


	“What AI can do is help with certain elements of production. That, in turn, will free up resources so that they can be directed towards actual frontline journalism, to uphold standards and make the editorial judgements that underpin trust.”


	Compton said: “Obviously, as a journalist, there's so much about AI that is alarming, not least the dangerous spread of misinformation. But used responsibly, ethically, and transparently, there are lots of exciting ways it can be used in productions — both on- and off-air.”


	She added: “Our priority is on premium, fact-checked, duly impartial journalism, and delivering that — as well as big investigations and analysis — is something AI can never do.”


	Jonathan Shalit, chairman of InterTalent Rights Group, which reps the likes of Andrew Neil and Susanna Reid, applauded Channel 4 for sparking a debate about AI presenters. “I would say to people, ‘Rather than look at AI as the enemy, look upon it as a new friend,'” he said. “It's not going to actually replace a personality. Big stars develop a relationship with the viewers. But for a one-off stunt, it's brilliant.”

					By Jill Goldsmith 

Co-Business Editor


	Game on! With Warner Bros. Discovery in play and set to split in half next year, the company said Tuesday that it's received unsolicited interest from “multiple parties” for the entire company as well as for Warner Bros., and is launching a review of strategic alternatives.


	The statement by the WBD board of directors follows an initial overture by David Ellison's Paramount Skydance for WBD ahead of a planned separation of the fast-growing streaming and studios operation, to be called Warner Bros., from the more challenged linear television business, Discovery Global, creating two stand-alone public companies. The Ellison camp's offer was rebuffed as too low amid speculation that giants from Apple to Comcast to Netflix might jump in pre-split or make a play for a solo Warner Bros. afterward. Netflix said recently that a deal on its part is unlikely.

	











	Hollywood studios are rare commodities not often up for sale. It's been an unusual moment for the industry with one having just changed hands in August and another now formally on the block. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market,” said WBD CEO David Zaslav. “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.”


	Read the full statement below.


	Warner also said today it will continue to pursue a split for a mid-2026 timeframe as it considers offers. As part of the review, it will also consider an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros and spin-off of Discovery Global to shareholders.

	











	WBD's goal in the maneuver was always to enhance the value of its studio and streaming assets as a stand-alone business, untethered to cable networks, where viewership has been steadily dwindling. Zaslav is following Comcast's playbook, with the NBCUniversal parent set to spin off most of its cable networks early next year into a new stand-alone company called Versant. Further consolidation in the cable industry is seen as inevitable.


	WBD shares are up about 9% this morning to near $20 on the news. Gauging interest, or lack thereof, in WBD will likely be a feature of CEO Q&As on conference calls this month and next as media companies kick off earnings season with Netflix first up this afternoon. 


	Here's WBD's full statement today:

While Warner Bros. Discovery (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: WBD) continues to advance its previously announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, its Board of Directors today announced it has initiated a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.Through this process, the Warner Bros. Discovery Board will evaluate a broad range of strategic options, which will include continuing to advance the Company's planned separation to completion by mid-2026, a transaction for the entire company, or separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses. As part of the review, the Company will also consider an alternative separation structure that would enable a merger of Warner Bros. and spin-off of Discovery Global to our shareholders.“We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today's evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally. We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward,” said David Zaslav, President and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.Zaslav added, “It's no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.”“Our decision to initiate this review underscores the Board's commitment to considering all opportunities to determine the best value for our shareholders,” added Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., Chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors. “We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value. That said, we determined taking these actions to broaden our scope is in the best interest of shareholders.”There is no deadline or definitive timetable set for completion of the strategic alternatives review process. Other than the separation transaction that is already underway, there can be no assurance that this process will result in the Company pursuing a transaction or other outcome. Warner Bros. Discovery does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the review of strategic alternatives unless and until the Board approves a specific transaction or otherwise determines further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.

Keep making the big bucks while you run a legendary brand into the ground, David! You deserve it, buddy!

DZ cannot create value, or unlock value as a manager of assets. He can simply use bankers to sell the company, so that he, and his chums can make money, and in the process cheat (being kind) employees, etc. Welcome to the new age of robber barons.

Warner Brothers, HBO, and, DC Entertainment should stay together. The rest I don't care about.

Comcast needs to get their act together or might lose rights to another theme park attraction and other things, such as  Sky and HBO partnership

He's barely gotten his elbows onto Jack Warner's desk and already looking to unload.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Bob Vylan frontman has no regrets about anti-IDF chants at Glastonbury Festival","https://www.avclub.com/bob-vylan-glastonbury-louis-theroux","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 03:33:00 GMT","

During their set at the Glastonbury Festival in June, the punk-rap duo Bob Vylan became a lightning rod of controversy. Starting an anti-IDF chant that declared “death, death, death to the IDF,” frontman Bobby Vylan joined Kneecap as the posterboys of the pro-Palestinian movement. The public display of anti-Zionist sentiment started a domino effect. Their agency, UTA, dropped them; the U.S. State Department revoked their visas, causing them to cancel their U.S. tour; Prime Minister Kier Starmer made a statement about it, accusing them of antisemitism. It was a big deal. Yet, after all that, Bobby Vylan says he'd do it all over again.

In his first interview since the controversy, Bobby Vylan, whose real name is Pascal Robinson-Foster, told Louis Theroux on The Louis Theroux Podcast (via Rolling Stone, because the episode doesn't release until tomorrow) that he has no regrets about the incident. “If I was to go on Glastonbury again tomorrow, yes, I would do it again,” he says. “I'm not regretful of it. I'd do it again tomorrow.” It really is a matter of perspective. The “disproportionate” backlash Vylan faced was “minimal,” especially “compared to what people in Palestine are going through.” Ultimately, the only people that he angered with the whole thing were people he believes perpetuated a genocide, so he doesn't even know what he should regret. “Oh, because I've upset some right-wing politician or some right-wing media?” If anything, he says, the controversy brought the conversation back around to Gaza, which is what he was trying to do in the first place.

“My whole issue with this thing is that the chant is so unimportant,” he says. “What is important is the conditions that exist to allow that chant to even take place on that stage. And I mean, the conditions that exist in Palestine. Where the Palestinian people are being killed at an alarming rate. Who cares about the chant?” Theroux conducted the interview ahead of the October 9 ceasefire deal, which, unsurprisingly, hasn't completely stopped the bloodshed.

In an Instagram post, Vylan says that “turned down every interview request from every media outlet, newspaper and tv channel you can think of.” However, he reached out to Theroux because he has “become increasingly aware that if I do not add my voice to the mix our story will be told for us.” He continues, “I am well aware the problems of talking to someone so affiliated with the BBC, Spotify etc, but when you have been under such a global attack by the media as we have been, the response must too have (potential) global reach and Louis whether you personally like him or not, has that reach.”

Bobby Vylan's Louis Theroux Podcast episode will be available on Spotify tomorrow. A clip from the interview can be found on Louis Theroux's Instagram page.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Yorgos Lanthimos neuters the politics of Bugonia's alien conspiracy","https://www.avclub.com/bugonia-review","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 16:02:30 GMT","

Society has been rapidly hurtling toward self-destruction in the years since 2003, when the Korean cult classic Save The Green Planet! was released. The film's unhinged and morbidly comedic observations regarding ecological collapse, corporate greed, and conspiratorial thinking as a trauma response have since crystalized into cultural truths, particularly in an increasingly fascistic America. Yet Bugonia, Yorgos Lanthimos' English-language remake of Jang Joon-hwan's film, squanders every opportunity to meaningfully adapt this premise for the director's postmodern sensibility. Lacking distinctive social commentary, meaningful character development, or a salient environmental angle, the update feels all but incapable of speaking to the moment.

The overarching premise of Jang's film is largely preserved, save for a few key alterations. Always on point, Jesse Plemons plays Teddy, a reclusive, greasy-haired beekeeper who has dedicated his life to proving that not only do aliens walk among us, but they occupy crucial positions of power and siphon critical Earthly resources. Teddy has indoctrinated his sweet and easily manipulated cousin Don (Aidan Delbis) into this intricate conspiracy. Together, they plan to kidnap Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone), the powerful CEO of the pharmaceutical company Auxolith, who Teddy has pinpointed as an extraterrestrial hailing from Andromeda PK 45. Their ramshackle ambush proves shockingly successful: They transport an unconscious Fuller to their basement, hoping that she will eventually grant them passage onto her mothership when it returns to Earth during the forthcoming lunar eclipse. 

This all follows from the original, the most notable change being that the captured CEO is a woman, but this gender-swap yields little reward. Before she's kidnapped, Michelle goes through her daily routine—a self-defense lesson, red light mask session, an assortment of daily supplements—but this is merely fodder for a brief fight scene and a single quip about how her exorbitantly expensive cosmetic procedures have her looking exceptionally youthful for a 45-year-old woman. Any insight into the poignancy around women, from celebrities to CEOs to every woman in between, feeling pressure to assimilate to the same tired beauty standard is untouched by Bugonia. (At the very least, not one lazy “girlboss” joke was uttered.)

For several days, Teddy and Don try to torture a confession out of Fuller. This mostly entails an excruciating electroshock contraption, emphatically homemade, after which Teddy is even more convinced of the CEO's Andromedan heritage, though the metrics he cites are nonsensically vague. Those who've seen Save The Green Planet! can map where the plot goes from here: There is an unexpected personal connection between Teddy and Fuller; the importance of bees to the Earth's ecosystem is expounded upon; a nosy but feckless cop (Stavros Halkias, far more subtextually perverted than necessary) starts poking around Teddy's property. It's not entirely disappointing that The Menu and Succession writer Will Tracy hews closely to the blueprint of Jang's well-calibrated movie, but it is a missed opportunity to reassess the central characters' stakes—be they delusional or justified. 

At the very least, Plemons is terrifying and pathetic as Teddy, a tortured soul whose only liberation lies in becoming a torturer himself. But no character depth is cultivated, save for an underwritten tangent involving his comatose mother (Alicia Silverstone). The unfortunate backstory of Save The Green Planet!'s central protagonist is woven into the story more elegantly this time around, allowing for the audience to ruminate on the conflicting factors that both support and discredit his conspiracy. But knowing even more about Teddy and Don—their family, upbringing, and dynamic—would have intensified the weight of their claim eventually being proven correct or crackpot. Plemons is an expert at commanding even the slimmest of roles (his character in Civil War is on screen for about five minutes, and is easily the most chilling and memorable), but there just isn't enough narrative meat to chew on here. The lack of pronounced personalities all around is also a disservice to Stone's character. Particularly now, when the assassination of CEOs is considered by some to be a necessary reckoning, why should anyone care if a fictional one—undoubtedly embroiled in dubious practices—lives or dies? 

Bugonia is a Greek word, one which refers to the ancient Mediterranean belief that bees spontaneously spawn from the carcasses of dead animals. Though bees are a fixation of Teddy and Fuller (one fosters their habitat, the other depletes it), this concept is never directly addressed. However, its final scene—the most artistically congruent with Lanthimos' previous output, a shocking series of images with no emotional resonance—hints at a new hope if not for humanity, then for the ecosystem that allows life to thrive on Earth. Bugonia is faithful to its source material, but unable to reinterpret Save The Green Planet! for our imperiled era. The chaotic cacophony that surrounds us may be difficult to parse, but Lanthimos' approach amounts to a dull buzz in one's ear—not nearly loud or direct enough to cut through the noise of cultural and political dissonance.

Writer: Will Tracy

Allows us to bask in the glow of a new Daily Show that doesn't include commentary on the most nauseating news stories our backsliding democracy has to offer. The No Kings protests saw some 7 million Americans take to the streets in their best inflatable frog costumes to stand against authoritarianism, and that gave Jon Stewart a lot to smile about. After weeks of listening to Mike Johnson talk to us like we're idiots, claiming that the “hardest core” of Marxists would be wreaking havoc across the fracturing United States, No Kings Day went off without a hitch, with 2,700 events held throughout the country, making it one of the largest single-day protests in history. Even more surprising, as Stewart points out, “zero mass shootings.”

Still, as the fearmongering from the Republican Party was replaced by Grantifa, the conservatives pivoted. Instead of calling the inflatable unicorns terrorists, they feigned surprise at the allegations that Trump was in any way a monarch. Thankfully, Stewart always carries a colonial wig and a copy of the Declaration of Independence with him. While Trump probably isn't beating the label, especially after bulldozing the East Wing of the White House for a tacky ballroom, Stewart hit on a better word for how Republicans view the president: Deity.

“The ironic part about Republicans complaining that he is being dubbed a king is that in their minds, he has already surpassed that title anyway and moved on to a much higher calling,” Stewart says. “He's not a king. He's a deity, sent by God to bring peace to all of mankind, a Jesus-like figure. I mean, I get it. There is a lot of crossover.”

Cutting to talking heads describing President Trump as a “miracle worker” who is saving Christianity, Stewart delighted in the absurd sycophantic surrogates begging for Trump to notice them. (Poor, Eric.) More importantly, he played a quick game of “Jesus or Trump” to figure out if Trump is merely a king or the King of Kings. It's a harder game than you'd think.



It was nice to have some good news for a change, and as a treat, here's Stewart's interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, who put it all much more succinctly: These are religious people, and their religion is greed.

For a company that once greenlit an entire series about Obi-Wan Kenobi, Disney has become rather picky about its Star Wars projects. While many of its canceled movies could be chalked up to avoiding more Rise Of Skywalker-sized rakes, few of these unmade projects feel like missed opportunities. However, in a new interview with the Associated Press, Adam Driver introduced us to an unmade Star Wars project we'll be thinking about for many, many years to come. Following the sequel trilogy, Driver pitched Disney a Ben Solo movie directed by Stephen Soderbergh. Alas, despite Soderbergh directing and a script by Scott Z. Burns, The Hunt For Ben Solo was never meant to be, namely because Disney CEO Bob Iger and co-chair Alan Bergman couldn't wrap their heads around Ben Solo surviving the last movie.

Surprisingly, Driver has “always been interested in doing another Star Wars” and has been talking about returning to the series since 2021. “With a great director and a great story, I'd be there in a second,” he says. “I loved that character and loved playing him.” He made good on that promise, bringing in his Logan Lucky director, Stephen Soderbergh, and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns, to work on the Ben Solo Star Wars story. It was, in Driver's opinion, “one of the coolest fucking scripts I had ever been a part of.” “We presented the script to Lucasfilm. They loved the idea. They totally understood our angle and why we were doing it,” Driver says. “We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman, and they said no. They didn't see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”

Reached for comment by AP, Soderbergh says, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I'm just sorry the fans won't get to see it.” But the more Driver describes it, the more we want to see the movie in his head. “We wanted to be judicial about how to spend money and be economical with it, and do it for less than most but in the same spirit of what those movies are, which is handmade and character-driven,” Driver says. “Empire Strikes Back being, in my opinion, the standard of what those movies were. But [Soderbergh] is, to me, one of my favorite directors of all time. He lives his code, lives his ethics, doesn't compromise.”

Now, try as we might, six years later, the only thing we remember about Rise Of Skywalker is still Babu Frick. (Frankly, we're surprised Iger could remember how that movie ended.) Using the Force (read: YouTube) to rewatch it, it seems that Kylo Ren uses the last remnants of his powers to resurrect Rey before stealing a kiss, dying, and becoming a Force ghost. Oh, we see how it is, Palpatine can return somehow, but not Ben Solo. Anyway, The Mandalorian And Grogu hits theaters next year, followed by Shawn Levy's Starfighter.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","HBO Max costs more, starting now","https://www.avclub.com/hbo-max-price-hikes-effective-immediately","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 14:50:26 GMT","

If you were debating whether or not to finally pull the trigger on an HBO Max account, you may have waited one day too long. The streamer just announced a new round of price hikes, effective immediately for new users. That means the Basic With Ads tier will cost you $1 more per month than it would have yesterday; it's now $10.99. The Standard tier has also been raised $1.50 per month to $18.49, and the Premium tier has been raised $2 per month to $22.99. 

Existing monthly and yearly subscribers have a little more time to prepare. Monthly users will be notified of the increases 30 days in advance of their next billing date (on or after November 20), while yearly subscribers will not be affected until their plan is up for renewal. (They'll also be notified 30 days in advance.) 

HBO Max last raised its prices in June 2024—back when it was still just “Max.” It's not the only platform to undergo a price hike (or a name change, for that matter) this year. Disney+ and Hulu price increases also go into effect today, following Peacock, Netflix, and Apple TV (now minus the “+”) earlier in the year.

In its announcement of the price hikes (per Variety), WBD touted its ever-increasing library to distract subscribers from their ever-decreasing bank accounts. New series that were just added or will soon be added to the streamer include It: Welcome to Derry, The Chair Company, I Love LA, Game of Thrones prequel A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, and new seasons of The Pitt and Industry this upcoming January. It's now up to users to decide whether these shows are worth an extra dollar or two per month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","X to start basically leasing desirable handles to users","https://www.avclub.com/x-handle-marketplace-leasing-usernames","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 14:15:43 GMT","

Want to snag a really cool X handle that was previously being used by an inactive account? Now you can—with a ton of catches. This past weekend, a new X account called “Handle Marketplace” posted the somewhat ominous message, “Handles are coming…” with a link to join a “waitlist” at handles.x.com. Digging into a “How It Works” page clarifies the new initiative… somewhat. “The X Handle Marketplace is our first-of-its-kind platform for redistributing handles that are no longer in active use, but still attached to old accounts,” it reads. That's a good idea in theory—how many of us have substituted a number for a letter or added a string of numbers at the end because the spelling we wanted was already taken? But this is Elon Musk's X we're talking about, which means you'll have to pay for the privilege. The Handle Marketplace is only available to Premium+ ($40 per month) and Premium Business Full Access ($1,000 per month) subscribers.

If you're forking over that much money for—lest we forget—a service that used to be totally free, at least the handle itself will be complimentary… sometimes. “Priority” handles (given examples include “@GabrielJones,” “@PizzaEater,” and “@ParadoxAI”) are free to request and will remain that way if your request is honored—unless you decide it isn't worth it to continue paying $40 per month to post online and cancel or downgrade your subscription. Then the handle goes back to the Marketplace, and you're left with your boring old non-priority handle. 

“Rare” handles, on the other hand, are a bit more complicated. X defines “rare” handles as those that generally include “short, generic, or culturally significant names” (examples include “@Pizza,” “@Tom,” and “@One”). This type of handle can be purchased directly, but only if a user is invited to do so; yes, that additional fee will be on top of the $40 or $1,000 per month they're already paying, but they will get to keep the handle if they cancel their Premium subscription. (Price points will be “determined by a number of factors including popularity of word, character length, and cultural significance.” X hasn't shared prices for specific handles as of this writing, but they'll apparently range from $2,500 to over seven figures “depending on demand and uniqueness.”) The rare handles will also occasionally be released in “public drops” where multiple users can apply, with the winning user determined by their “past contributions to X,” their “intended use of the handle,” and their “engagement and reach on the platform.” Of course, we assume this will be spearheaded by the same guy who gave us “MechaHitler,” which means @Pizza will probably start spewing some truly abhorrent nonsense.

Longtime Hallmark star Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe is bravely sharing each step of her breast cancer journey with fans, including facing hard things like potential hair loss from chemotherapy. 

On October 20, 2025, the “Signed, Sealed, Delivered” actress, who revealed 10 days earlier that she'd been diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, posted on social media that she headed into her second chemotherapy infusion wearing a cold cap. The therapy tactic has been shown to reduce the amount of chemo-induced hair loss in some patients, per the American Cancer Society. From trying on wigs to cutting her hair shorter, Lowe is facing this side effect of treatment with humor and hope. 

A post shared by Crystal Lowe (@officialcrystallowe)

Lowe's first step in her treatment plan is 12 weeks of chemo, her dear friend and co-star Kristin Booth shared in her Instagram Stories shortly after Lowe shared her diagnosis in an essay written for People magazine. 

In that essay, Lowe said that before a double mastectomy, she would be receiving weekly infusions of Doxorubicin. The chemo is nicknamed “The Red Devil” by many patients because of its bright red color, toxicity, and potentially harsh side effects, per the Moffitt Cancer Center. But to feel more in control of the situation, Lowe shared on Instagram that she'd decided to name her chemo after the red-headed warrior Agnes.

At the infusion center, Lowe filmed herself joking around as she stuck maxi pads to her cheeks and face to protect her skin from the freezing cold cap. The next view was of her in her infusion chair, with the cap wrapped around her head and strapped under her chin. 

“So, I'm cold capping and this is what my life is like now,” she said with a smirk. “I feel like my face looks like a Snapchat memoji. It's really cold and I can't hear anything because I have maxi pads on my face.”

Shaking her head, she said again, “This is my life. How's your morning going?”

In the caption of her post, Lowe shared, “The idea is to use dry ice to freeeze the hair follicles so that your hair doesn't fall out. Unfortunately I was too overwhelmed to start week one so I started week two which only gives you a 50/50 chance to keep your hair. This requires a ton of help from a partner of a friend but honestly I believe it's always worth trying everything!” 

A post shared by Crystal Lowe (@officialcrystallowe)

In a time lapse photo of her getting her cut into a shoulder-length bob on October 18, Lowe wrote, “Ok…let's talk hair. I'm not gonna lie. The hair journey has been the toughest by far. When you first get diagnosed you immediately go to…oh no, I'm gonna lose everything. My boobs, my hair, life as I know it.” 

“But underneath it's really about losing control,” she reasoned. “The fear of the unknown has been by far…the worst part of this journey. I read that cutting your hair shorter helps mitigate that feeling. And when your hair does fall out it's not as traumatizing because it's smaller clumps. So that's what I did. I got a cute bob for the first time ever. If your going through what I am. This is a nice way to get some control back ❤️”

In another video, she had a little fun trying on different wigs, including a purple one she said was her favorite. 

After Lowe completes chemo, she'll have a double mastectomy, radiation, and reconstruction surgeries, she shared with People. She has a circle of friends who've helped raise over $10,000 through a GoFundMe campaign for expenses, given that she can't work much during treatment, and she said Hallmark has pushed back production on a “Hannah Swensen Mystery” she's set to direct. 

Lowe also has two kids — a nine-year-old daughter and three-year-old son with her husband, Mike Tomasevich. 

I will pray for you and continue to watch you on signed sealed delivered. You are super on the show and one of the best show for families on television. God bless you and heal you. Please trust the higher power. He answers prayers amen.

Sending prayers for your quick and complete recuperation. For sure, God will be beside you, and very soon, will have the pleasure to see you back again.

John Stamos is standing behind his Full House co-star Lori Loughlin as the former Hallmark star goes through a very public separation. 

After 28 years of marriage, Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli separated earlier this month, with the actress's representative, Elizabeth Much, confirming the news to People, adding that they “are living apart and taking a break from their marriage. There are no legal proceedings at this time.”

And now, Stamos is weighing in and sending love to his on-screen wife, while also specifically speaking out about Loughlin's involvement in the 2019 college admissions scandal.

Stamos and Loughlin created a very close bond, having played husband and wife on the popular show “Full House,” and have stayed friends after the show ended.

During an appearance on Josh Peck and Ben Soffer's “Good Guys” podcast, the topic of Loughlin's split from Giannulli was brought up, and Stamos praised his co-star, calling her a “saint.”

“For 40 years I've known her,” Stamos said. “You know, you can see through people after a few years, but this woman's a saint. I'm just heartbroken for her right now.”

He went on to call him a “terrible narcissist,” and said that Loughlin “put up with a lot over the years [with] this guy.”

And on the topic of the 2019 college admissions scandal, Stamos made it clear that he believes Loughlin had nothing to do with the incident that saw her serve two months in prison while Giannulli served five months.

“I really tried to be there for her during this time and also with the college scandal,” he added. “I'm not going to debate whether she had much to do with it or not. I know she didn't.”

He added that she's “not a liar,” and even told Stamos at the time that “Mossimo handles all that stuff,” when he called her after the scandal broke.

A post shared by John Stamos (@johnstamos)

On the episode of Josh Peck and Ben Soffer's “Good Guys” podcast, the pain Stamos felt for his friend was very clear.

“All of a sudden they're split up and I know she's just devastated,” he said. “For a girl who, you know, has lived her life really well, [is] a good person, a good mother, a good wife. I know all this for a fact. To be thrown into, now, this separation and exploding, blowing up her family this way. And I just hate to see her go through this.”

This is very kind of you. I know you sign on for no privacy but really people, get a grip, she is still a human being and it's nobody's damn business what she does personally. I pray she is happy and remains as beautiful as she is. Go Lori!!!!

Yes. I just wish Hallmark would do some more of her Garage mysteries.

She will get thru this. She has a strong spirit . thank you for staying with her on this

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","SEE: Rachael Ray Teams Up with Victoria & David Beckham's Son","https://entertainmentnow.com/food-tv/rachael-ray-brooklyn-beckham-food-festival-photos/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 05:41:00 GMT","

Rachael Ray is back — and she's glowing. The beloved chef and TV personality, 57, looked happy, healthy, and full of energy as she co-hosted the Blue Moon Burger Bash 2.0 with Brooklyn Beckham on Friday night at the New York City Wine & Food Festival.

In video obtained by TMZ, Ray could be seen laughing with Beckham and greeting guests with her signature warmth. Fans quickly took to social media to express their joy, with one writing, “She's looking fine here,” and another adding, “So happy to see her smiling again.”

The uplifting appearance follows months of public concern about Ray's health and for longtime fans, her radiant return was a welcome reassurance that their favorite chef is thriving.

Back in July, Ray raised eyebrows after an event for her gin brand reportedly left fans uneasy. According to the Daily Mail, attendees said she arrived “20 minutes late” and appeared “a little off” during meet-and-greets, giving hugs and posing for photos in an overly familiar way.

The event ended in less than an hour, and reports of her behavior sparked online chatter about her well-being.

Earlier in May, fans also expressed concern after Ray appeared in a cooking video where she seemed to slur her words and mentioned having “a couple of bad falls.”

Despite the speculation, Ray looked healthy and confident during her recent appearance on “The Drew Barrymore Show,” where she chatted candidly about life after her long-running daytime talk show ended in 2023.

A post shared by Rachael Ray (@rachaelray)

Her latest public outing at the NYC Wine & Food Festival reaffirmed her upbeat energy and charm, with attendees noting that she looked “relaxed and glowing” throughout the event.

Ray first rose to fame on the Food Network with her approachable recipes and “30-Minute Meals” series before becoming a household name with “The Rachael Ray Show.”

Known for her down-to-earth style and relatable personality, she continues to inspire fans through her culinary ventures and lifestyle projects.

These days, Rachael Ray is also finding peace abroad — and her dog is loving it. In a recent interview with Us Weekly, Ray shared that she spends much of her time in Italy because her rescue pup, Bella Boo Blue, prefers the calm countryside to the bustle of New York City. “She hates New York City. Bella is not a New Yorker at all,” Ray joked.

Ray rescued Bella in June 2020, naming her in honor of her late pit bull, Isaboo, who passed away earlier that year at the couple's home in the Adirondack Mountains. “Isaboo taught us more about unconditional love and empathy than we could have ever imagined,” Ray once wrote.

Now, Bella enjoys a slower pace of life. “She has a swimming pool and 66 hectares to run around on, and everything is very quiet and fresh,” Ray said. “We have huge gardens, a vineyard, and olive trees — I just prefer that life.”

With her recent public appearances, the Emmy-winning chef seems focused on moving forward with positivity, and fans couldn't be happier to see her doing well.

The 2025 Middleburg Film Festival is the latest to bestow Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” its Audience Award for Narrative Feature, but this time, the Focus Features release shares the honor with Hikari's “Rental Family, set to be released by Searchlight Pictures.

Though the award still supports the idea that “Hamnet” is the one fall festival premiere most likely to be a Best Picture Oscar frontrunner next year, especially since it also won the coveted People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, it being tied with “Rental Family” helps paint a picture of how there can be plenty of films that excite audiences outside the New York/Los Angeles bubble.

Keep in mind, the Audience Award process at Middleburg is similar to the one at Toronto, in that any film screening at the festival is eligible. And the harsh thing about Toronto this year was how many well-received premieres, be it “Rental Family” or “Roofman,” seem to have their awards campaigns tanked by not winning said People's Choice Award, as if their worth is tied to their potential to win an Academy Award.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Rental Family,” which closed the 2025 Middleburg Film Festival, with writer/director Hikari present to receive a standing ovation, was described by IndieWire critic David Ehrlich as “a gentle little movie that recognizes truth and performance as two sides of the same coin.” Pegged as a crowdpleaser before it had publicly screened anywhere, the response the Brendan Fraser response received at Middleburg, from an audience that primarily consists of wealthy film enthusiasts in the D.C., Maryland, and Virginia area, quite a few who work in the film industry, proved that initial read to be justified. Worth noting “Frankenstein,” the runner-up for the People's Choice Award at Toronto, also screened at Middleburg.

Another film that had arguably been overshadowed at other festivals, but got its turn in the spotlight at Middleburg was “The Cycle of Love,” which took the Top Documentary Prize. Another Telluride world premiere a la “Hamnet,” the film tells the true story of an Indian man cycling 6,000 miles cross-continent on bicycle to find his love. Other documentaries that screened at the festival include Netflix's “Cover-Up” and National Geographic films “Love+War” and “The Tale of Silyan,” yet “The Cycle of Love” has yet to find a distributor. One can imagine the filmmakers hope the Middleburg audience's reaction can be leveraged in a partner ready to campaign the film as a true Best Documentary Feature contender.

 










Though it won the Jury Prize after its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” which won the Top International Prize at Middleburg, has also yet to find a distributor, even though it is directed by two-time Oscar nominee Kaouther Ben Hania and has already been selected to represent Tunisia for Best International Feature.

Outside of actual prizewinners, this particular regional crowd anecdotally hailed a mix of the expected, like Palme d'Or winner “It Was Just an Accident” from director Jafar Panahi or Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” and unexpected like A24 romantic comedy “Eternity,” starring Elizabeth Olsen (programmed as the Saturday Spotlight film), and Searchlight Pictures' “Is This Thing On?”

A portion of the older crowd seemed to still have difficulty with “After the Hunt,” or even “If I Had Legs, I'd Kick You,” which features a visceral performance from Rose Byrne, but were very warm on most of Netflix's slate of films, from Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” which opened the festival, to Richard Linklater's “Nouvelle Vague,” and Rian Johnson's “Wake Up Dead Man,” the latest installment in the “Knives Out” franchise.

“We're thrilled to see how our slate of films connected so profoundly with our audiences,” said Middleburg Film Festival Executive Director Susan Koch via statement. “The humanity and emotional depth of these four films clearly struck a chord, reflecting the kind of bold, globally minded storytelling our festival strives to champion.”

That $750 million California approved to get productions back to the Golden State is starting to pay off. 52 different film projects were selected to receive tax credits under California's Film and Television Tax Credit Program, Governor Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday. 

Among the projects that will shoot here, a variety: a third “Jumanji” movie, Michael Mann's “Heat 2,” the new film from the Daniels that just got dated for release in November 2027, a film titled “The Fifth Wheel” starring Kim Kardashian and directed by Eva Longoria for Netflix, and a new Blumhouse movie called “Sunday” based on the book. 

 










On the indie side, there's “Palm Springs” director Max Barbakow‘s new film “Epiphany” starring Bill Murray and Kristen Wiig, “The Incredible Heist of Hallelujah Jones,” which stars Janelle Monáe and has Taika Waititi and Ishi Metkar with Waititi Productions as well as Monáe and Maresa Pullman with Wondaland Pictures producing, “A Tree Is Blue” produced by Dakota Johnson, and the Mila Kunis-produced film “Nightwatching.”

And there's always a few hidden gems among these announcements, and of the 52 films, there's also a new untitled Mike Mills movie, which would be the first movie he's directed since 2021's “C'mon C'mon,” and a comedy starring Jessica Williams and Jake Johnson that's also untitled.




			Popular on IndieWire		






If and when all these projects do roll cameras, they are projected to bring $1.4 billion into the state's economy and employ roughly 8,900 cast and crew along with 46,400 background performers as measured in days work over a total 1,664 filming days. The California Film Commission says this is double what the last round — before the tax credits were upped to $750 million — managed to generate.

“The film and television industry is the cornerstone of California's creative economy — revitalizing the job opportunities, business growth and economic prosperity for families. These investments reaffirm that California isn't just where stories are told, it's where the future of storytelling is built,” Governor Newsom said in a statement. 

“This round of awards demonstrates the outstanding scope of our program. We are welcoming projects from major franchises to independent films led by visionary artists,” said Colleen Bell, Director California Film Commission. “There's real momentum building. With 52 new projects, we're seeing storytelling thrive once again, creating thousands of jobs and supporting local businesses in communities across the state. California's film industry is not just rebounding, it's redefining what's possible.”

 










FilmLA last week released data showing that production in Los Angeles specifically had again declined from last year, despite the changes to the tax incentive program, but FilmLA was projecting that it would see growth soon with exactly these sorts of projects on the way. 

But we've also written that these tax credits are not a panacea, and some indie filmmakers still see issues with restrictions on the credits, like that it only covers below the line work, not the cast that can chew up big parts of your budget, and that there are no exemptions or special considerations for post-production work done in the state. 

But at the very least, we're getting a new Mike Mills film.

The Sundance Film Festival has just announced new details for its final edition in Park City.

In January 2026, the festival will offer a bevy of events honoring its longtime home, as well as its founder, Robert Redford. The late actor died in September at the age of 89. He had made Park City the festival's home, having become a Utah resident starting in the late 1960s. As such, the 2026 Sundance Film Festival will screen one of his great movies, “Downhill Racer,” as a tribute — it also happened to be filmed in part in Boulder, Colorado, the new home of the festival starting in 2027. IndieWire named Redford's work in “Downhill Racer” as one of his greatest performances.

Taking place from January 22 to February 1, 2026, in Park City and Salt Lake City, Sundance will even feature a series of select talks at the Egyptian Theatre on Main Street, which had previously announced it would sit out the final Park City Sundance. The Park City Legacy program will be concentrated during the window of January 27-30.

Several all-time Sundance classics will screen at the final Park City edition, including “Saw” from a 2024 restoration, a world premiere 20th-anniversary restoration of “Little Miss Sunshine,” “Half Nelson,” and a very recent restoration of Gregg Araki's “Mysterious Skin,” with the filmmakers and select cast in attendance. Also screening as part of the Park City Legacy Films sidebar at Sundance 2026 are Barbara Kopple's “American Dream” to commemorate the documentary's 35th anniversary, Lynn Shelton's “Humpday” as a tribute to filmmakers who've passed away, and Reginald Hudlin's cult classic comedy “House Party.” The legacy films will be followed by cast and crew Q&As.

As for Sundance's main slate of world premiere films, the festival is still heads down screening some half a dozen movies a day ahead of lineup announcements later this fall.

In terms of events for the Park City farewell, Sundance will also host a culminating event on January 30 as a celebration of the city's locals who've supported the festival for decades. Other events planned for the final Park City edition include Celebrating Sundance Institute: A Tribute to Founder Robert Redford as well as a directors brunch at Sundance Mountain Resort.

IndieWire's Eugene Hernandez told IndieWire that this upcoming Sundance's artist-first initiatives are in keeping with Redford's adage that “everyone has a story.”

 










Tickets for the entire Sundance program will go on sale Wednesday, October 22, at festival.sundance.org/tickets.

In 2023, the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles launched the first edition of PROOF, a short film festival dedicated to showcasing movies by emerging filmmakers hoping to use their shorts as proof-of-concepts for more ambitious features. This November, PROOF returns to the Cinematheque in an expanded form that includes special screenings, panels, development funds for award-winning shorts, and a “Pitch Deck Show & Tell.”

For the third edition of PROOF, screenings of the proof-of-concept shorts will run alongside centerpiece programming that includes “Film Financing Today,” a panel that will discuss how projects are getting made in today's shifting entertainment landscape, and “Next Steps: From a Short to a Feature,” a returning PROOF signature panel spotlighting filmmakers who have successfully expanded short-form work into features or television.

 








Related Stories ‘Selena y Los Dinos' Trailer: Netflix's Smash Hit Sundance Doc Puts the Focus Back on Selena's Groundbreaking Music Sundance Sets Tributes to Park City and Robert Redford — Plus ‘Saw,' ‘Little Miss Sunshine,' and More Restorations — for Utah Farewell 

Building on that idea of exploring how filmmakers have leveraged shorts into feature film work, the festival will also host the Los Angeles premiere of “Atropia.” The winner of the Dramatic Feature Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance, “Atropia” was originally a short film before it evolved into a full-length feature, and both the short and the feature will screen at PROOF. Writer/director Hailey Gates and star Alia Shawkat will appear for an in-person Q&A between the short film and the feature film.

 










This year, PROOF will also present “Pitch Deck Show & Tell” selections, an event that will give filmmakers the opportunity to present their pitch decks and project ideas to a live audience of peers, industry professionals, and potential collaborators. Presenting both feature and series concepts, participants will have five minutes to pitch after which they'll receive real-time feedback from filmmakers, producers, and executives to help refine their projects and take them to the next stage.

As in previous years, however, the festival's primary mission is to empower the next generation of cinematic storytellers by providing a forum for their proof-of-concept shorts. These shorts will be eligible for awards given by a jury featuring Miranda Sarah Einy (producer, “Happy Place”), Rachel Goldfinger (creative executive, Playgrounds), Sarah Marie Flores (creative executive, Anarchists United), Remy Solomon (writer and content creator), Brett Robinson (development executive), Liz Sargent (writer/director), Riley Chapman (coordinator, New Line Cinema), Sara Koch (casting director), Kesila Childers (producer and development executive), Aisling Scott Lynch (creative executive, Fourth Wall), Reiko Napier Moreno (independent producer/manager), and Yuky Shen (executive assistant, Kindred Spirit).

 










Five juried awards will be presented at the festival's end, along with one audience choice award. The newest juried award is the “Shot on Film” Award sponsored by Kodak. The award will be granted to a filmmaker that shot their project either partially or completely on film, and they will receive an in-kind grant of $5,000 of Kodak Motion Picture Film Stock and/or Processing.

In addition, the newly created PROOF Development Fund will provide unrestricted grants to the winners of the festival, intended to directly support key next steps in their creative journeys — whether that's bringing on a line producer, hiring a casting director, securing legal counsel, attending markets and festivals, or funding other early development needs. The 2025 Grand Jury Prize winner will receive $2,500, with additional grant money available for other festival awardees.

The festival will run November 7 – 9 at The Culver Theater in Culver City. Individual tickets to screenings, blocks, and panels are now on sale at the American Cinematheque‘s website.

One of the most popular and acclaimed movies out of Sundance 2025 was Isabel Castro's “Selena y Los Dinos,” a musical portrait of “The Queen of Tejano Music” and the band that helped create her signature sound fusing cumbia with Latin pop to create something truly unique.

In fact the film was such a hot property that Sundance and the filmmakers had to pull “Selena y Los Dinos” from the Sundance online screening platform after fans started showing clips from the movie they'd recorded off their screens.

Castro previously directed “Mija” and she brings a particularly sensitive and appreciative perspective for what Selena Quintanilla achieved, before her unthinkable murder at age 23. She leans into how much of a family affair Los Dinos actually was, with Selena's manager being her father, her brother being her producer, and her sister her drummer.

This is a doc not at all focused on the circumstances of her death and concerned more for celebrating and recognizing the impact of Selena's life. As such it spends considerable time going into the cultural complexities of her career: Like many Tejano families, the Quintanillas did not speak Spanish. But a market for her among white America was elusive, so she learned Spanish as her career took off after incidents such as being unable to converse with the crowd at a concert in Mexico.

 










As IndieWire freelancer Esther Zuckerman wrote in her review out of Sundance, “You watch as Selena herself recognizes how she has to mold herself for the sake of success. She learns Spanish so she can hold her own in any tongue. Interested in fashion design, she shapes her own iconic look — the sparkly bras and high-waisted pants.” 

“As the movie moves closer to the end of Selena's life, you realize time is running out for Castro to get into the full drama around her death. But then it's almost a relief when you understand that Castro is not going to spend the time rehashing that. The name “Yolanda” — a reference to Yolanda Saldívar, the fan-turned-murder — is only uttered once, in passing. It's a choice that rips the killer of any power, leaving Selena in charge of her narrative.” 

“What lingers is the complete sadness that this woman, who broke so much ground and was set to break so much more, is no longer present. In her family members' and her bandmates' faces, you can see how raw their sorrow still is. But “Selena y Los Dinos” is no mere tribute, it is a vibrant argument for Selena's humanity, as well as her status as a legend.” 

Netflix will start streaming “Selena y Los Dinos” on Monday, November 17. Check out the film's first trailer below.

For a while, Kevin Parker was sculpting some of the most prismatic yet accessible hits around, searching for that secret place where producers like Phil Spector, Dave Fridmann, and Quincy Jones found the answer to pop. Once as beloved as any other early-'10s indie starlets, Tame Impala have become so synonymous with a particular strain of fancam-ready groove-pop mush that it's easy to forget why everyone liked him in the first place. But if I may, let me offer that the same quality that launched Parker to ubiquity has always been his greatest strength. Lonely kids who haven't found their way to Popol Vuh and Soft Machine yet deserve headphone music to bliss out to, too.

Though people have been accusing Parker of defaulting to classic rock tropes ever since his heyday, he has never seemed particularly beholden to those constraints. Sure, he loves the Beatles, but he's equally enraptured by Orbital, Timbaland, Rihanna, and countless other corners of the mainstream music world past 1970. After all, we're talking about a guy who realized the transportive powers of dance music after hearing “Stayin' Alive” on shrooms in the back of his friend's car.

Is it Parker's fault that his snare rolls on Lonerism were too crisp? That his basslines on Currents were too juicy? Now that he's at the top of the mountain and co-writing Dua Lipa flops, penning songs for Minions sequels, and collecting Grammys for his most generic tracks yet, Deadbeat arrives asking the question: What's left to do for the psych-rock prodigy turned dance-pop consultant?

Become a DJ, of course! As the singles and appearances on the Lot have hinted, Deadbeat follows Parker taking his inclination with DMT-pen dance music to its logical conclusion, though there's a little more happening under the hood. Parker's hardly the first person to pick up on a general raviness in the air these past few years, and throughout Deadbeat, he trots out one four-on-the-floor genre after another, ensuring we know that he likes all this stuff even if he can't clinch the argument that he should actually be making it.

Been dying to hear what Tame Impala progressive house might sound like? “Ethereal Connection” will make you reconsider. Wondering when Kevin Parker would finally have his “I need a one dance” moment? Of course not, but here you go anyway. This all presents Parker with an opportunity to let go of his usual perfectionism, to give us a rawer look into his psyche as he ponders his place in a world he helped create. From the sound of it, he seems lost.

One of Parker's strengths has been his ability to tap directly and relatably into the outcast's mindset. Not the cool outcast, mind you, but the true lames of the world—the Charlie Browns kicking their pebbles as they walk home, eternally uninvited to the party. Deadbeat proves that even though Parker is now wildly successful and married with kids, not much has changed for him mentally. “I'm a loser, babe,” he repeats on “Loser,” wailing about trying to get his shit together over an Anatolian psych riff that's about as energetic as an executive ball clicker. “No Reply” paints an even drearier picture, as Parker mumbles over a lo-fi house beat that he can't make it out tonight, his excuse being that, “You're a cinephile/I watch Family Guy.” It's the kind of line that'd be easier to laugh with instead of at if it weren't one of the only memorable lyrics on the entire record.

Like many wayward souls before him, Parker turns to hedonism in his search for purpose. Inspired heavily by the tradition of bush doofs (outdoor raves, for those who don't speak Aussie), Parker takes to the decks with an amateurism that could be charming if it all didn't sound so stale. “My Old Ways” opens the album with a jazzy piano lick that might achieve liftoff in better hands; but Marshall Jefferson he is not, so we're largely stuck on repeat while the track shuffles along for five minutes, unable to decide if it's just an intro or actually going somewhere.

It still might be his most successful attempt—“Oblivion” sinks to an absolute nadir as Parker aimlessly spritzes his falsetto over a limp dembow rhythm that barely musters an ounce of what, say, DJ Python would do with it. He wastes the first half of “Not My World” wafting through one of the emptiest, most nothing beats of the year, eventually arriving at a shimmering bell-tone melody that actually doesn't sound too bad. But is there really a reason for you to reach for this over one of the countless deep house producers out there who can actually pull this style off with finesse? Over and over, Parker ends up in the mushy middle: He strains for the highs of a side-long R&S epic on the trancey, eight-minute “Ethereal Connection” without ever finding release, and continually sabotages whatever momentum he manages to build on the closing Balearic snoozer “End of Summer.”

Between all these would-be workouts are some serious misfires. “Piece of Heaven” is a half-hearted Enya-meets-“Hollaback Girl” mashup that refuses to deliver on its promise of fun, and the dead-on-arrival Brian Wilson-lite throwaway “See You On Monday (You're Lost)” really sounds like something we weren't supposed to hear. It's admirable for Parker to throw himself into something new and continue to redefine how people think of him. But the sense of craft that made Tame Impala stand out in the first place is all but gone. Instead of lavishly reminding us of simple joys like a snappy R&B beat switch or a good flanger-pedal drop, we get drum machines sloppily plugged into guitar amps and left to spin their rudimentary loops; none of this stuff ever really explores how freeing, powerful, or even therapeutic dance music can be.

The worst part is that, through it all, I can still hear a world where this could've been something—the sound of a bad trip, a bleary comment on adulthood and success, or just hard, hypnotic rhythms soundtracking Parker's spiral into self-doubt. Most of these songs aren't offensive on their own: “Dracula” may not be anything special, but its cheesy boogie is catchy enough. “Afterthought” would have been the weakest and most repetitive song on Currents, but that still makes it the strongest thing here. The cumulative effect, though, is exhausting, a daisy-chain of shaky half-measures that doesn't even feel particularly committed to being depressing.

The other issue is that Parker already tested out many of these dance-hybrid attempts with better results on his last album, The Slow Rush. In that record's standout moments, you could see how the concept of Parker rebuilding house tracks from the ground up with his analog disco setup could potentially lead to lush and novel ends. But on Deadbeat, Parker mostly just seems enamored with the sound of big, empty beats thudding out into space. On the first single from his debut album, Parker sang, “There's a party in my head/And no one is invited.” Fifteen years later, he's blown that image up to superclub proportions; it's a sad spectacle to behold.

By my count, Militarie Gun can claim the hookiest song of 2025 if we're judging “B A D I D E A” by sheer quantity. There's Ian Shelton's surly, stuttering verse cadence, perfectly suited for a guy who's about to get payback for every bad check his mouth wrote. Then there's the gleaming synth line that pops in after the first chorus and the hip-swinging surf-rock drums right before the second chorus. Those were all meant to pique Doja Cat's interest before Shelton decided to keep the instrumental for himself and added the chorus, spelling out the title like a gooned-out “Hot to Go!.” With all of that, you might miss Shelton's trademark “oof oof” ad-lib, which is mixed lower than the tambourine. That was Militarie Gun's tether to their hardcore roots on their 2023 debut, Life Under the Gun, and it sustained damn near the whole album. It only appears one other time on the band's second full-length, which is not the most important thing about God Save the Gun but perhaps the most telling: Militarie Gun are no longer satisfied with merely being “pop” in relation to other hardcore bands.

Two years prior, Militarie Gun intended the lyric “I don't care what you do, just do it faster!” as a sarcastic summation of grindset culture, even if the band shared its devotion to efficiency and optimization. The ultimate compliment for Life Under the Gun wasn't “catchy,” but “punchy,” their songs direct and delivered with a stiff jaw and clenched fist. The exact opposite is true on God Save the Gun; half the time, if a song reaches two minutes, it might as well add a bridge that gets it to three. The tempos are dialed down to the point where Shelton actually has to sing to keep pace. “Pressure Cooker”? Nah, “I Won't Murder Your Friend” and “Thought You Were Waving” simmer or are downright chill, even for a couple of tough-talking PSAs.

Whereas most hardcore bands' relationship with Britpop goes no further than a respect for Oasis' bluster or Stone Roses' merch, Militarie Gun are working with pre-psychedelic Beatles harmonies this time around. If the acoustic guitars and synth strings of “Daydream” weren't enough, Shelton longs to “go back to the start” and welcomes the obvious comparisons to “The Scientist.” Yes, this is a guy who also fronts a powerviolence band, but also one who hired an engineer that allows Militarie Gun to namedrop Adele in their press materials.

There are also interludes and phone recordings littered throughout that posit God Save the Gun as the most indulgent of pursuits: the concept album. Shelton has always used rehabilitation and redemption as primary muses, considering whether the carceral or 12-step versions can truly offer any lasting change. In the past, he's done so as an invested outsider, writing about his brother's incarceration and his experience around AA meetings. On God Save the Gun, Shelton himself is the primary subject matter: a guy who avoided substances most of his life but proved to be a quick study once he started drinking at age 30.

Or, to quote the namesake of the brief “Isaac's Song,” Shelton is the dark center of the universe. He screams “just throw me away!” on “Fill Me With Paint,” and the very next song is called “Throw Me Away.” The repetition is likely intentional, an honest accounting of the persistent self-pity, self-deprecation, and self-flagellation that flourishes between the pink cloud of early recovery and the dark abyss of addiction. But at some point between the equally self-explanatory “Maybe I'll Burn My Life Down,” “Laugh at Me” and “Wake Up and Smile,” whatever necessary tension once existed between the Mellotrons and mosh parts has all but vanished. The unvarying Buzz Bin shimmer and hungover shame transforms God Save the Gun into a longform experiment in trying to rewrite “My Own Worst Enemy.”

Then again, it's an admirable ambition for a group that seemed a bit stuck between stations on Life Under the Gun. “Do It Faster” reaped the spoils of the supposed post-GLOW ON boom, appearing in a Taco Bell ad and the WWE 2k24 soundtrack with a cosign from Post Malone's wrestling avatar. But the more aggro-inclined fans at LDB Fest and Knocked Loose shows saw them as kindred labelmates of Soccer Mommy and Manchester Orchestra. If the Turnstile comparisons were reductive the first time around, Shelton yelling, “It's never enough!” on “Fill Me With Paint” ensures they aren't going away. But that specific choice of words seems like an unintentional coincidence more than a direct homage, since the same sentiment reemerges on the next two songs: “the drugs never seem to be enough,” “too close, not close enough.” Shelton may have hit rock bottom, but he's convinced there's gold underneath.

Trace it closely enough and indie rock's attitudinal arc falls into decade-long trends: apathy in the 1990s, irony in the 2000s, earnestness in the 2010s. If the genre plays its hand in cycles, then Chicago band Cusp—firmly a 2020s act—should be the '90s reincarnated; they've already got the mix of melodic alt-rock guitars and college radio twee on lock. But singer-guitarist Jen Bender isn't trying to fool anyone by playing it indifferent—least of all herself. On their sophomore album, What I Want Doesn't Want Me Back, Cusp place one foot in front of the other on the journey to self-assurance, where overcoming small struggles is rewarded with small wins. They aren't as flashy or aloof as forebears like Speedy Ortiz or Built to Spill, but Cusp are champions of bringing beauty to our humdrum realities. As Bender sings near the album's end, “If you're having fun/It's enough for me.”

True to its title, much of What I Want Doesn't Want Me Back concerns itself with the pursuit of validation, both as a band and as humans. What does the upper hand really get you if you lose it? How beneficial is healthy thinking if it can't bump your salary to a living wage? In “Oh Man,” Bender tests how material possessions and relationships inform our identity, before finding her lightbulb moment: “Something that shines/Doesn't reflect onto yourself.” Her voice flits between quotidian sing-speaking and crooning with a tangible longing. Whenever she observes her surroundings mid-song—tracking her footsteps, holding the sun in her palm—Bender brings a humility that feels anchored in the American heartland. Here, what keeps you up at night isn't necessarily high-stakes drama; it's back-to-basics questions of “How?” and “Why?” that go to the root of all things.

Bender's at her lyrical best when she confronts her faults while leaving room for forgiveness. In “Follow Along,” she admits to obsessively comparing her insecurities: taking notes on a friend's apartment decor, decoding footwear as a status symbol, studying reserved conversationalists in the effort to become mysterious. The song shifts, from a riff-forward rock single into a dreamy waltz with a distorted hook; so does Bender, who turns from a jealous checklist scribe dreaming of a makeover to a level-headed girl remembering why she's good enough already: She's a quick learner, loyal friend, and eager helper. “I am not slick,” she sings. “But I'm gonna get strong.”

Cusp's sizable growth between their debut album, 2023's You Can Do It All, and What I Want Doesn't Want Me Back coincides with leaving Rochester, New York, for Chicago, Illinois. Once relocated, they expanded their lineup to a quintet—Bender, guitarist Gaelen Bates, bassist Matt Manes, drummer Tommy Moore, and keyboardist Tessa O'Connell—and broadened their sound beyond the early grunge-tinged alt-rock recorded before they moved. Although Cusp are still a proud guitar band in sound and a shoo-in on their new home of Exploding in Sound, they find exponential depth in their instruments by incorporating kittenish synths (“Oh Man”), country pedal steel (“The Upper Hand”), and ample tambourine (“Give Up Your Garden”). They're particularly adept at braiding vocal harmonies that gussy up their louder inclinations, with Moore and O'Connell lending their voices alongside Bender. Cusp turn into the indie-rock band next door; they aren't overdressed or looking to impress, and they're all the more charming because of it.

In under half an hour, Cusp adjust their lens to capture a tiny corner of their world, sharpening their focus on the minutiae and the mundane in equal measure. Whether coming to terms with inactivity stunting life in the midtempo sway of “Extracurricular Hell” or the necessity of pain to contrast joy in the harmony-rich “Give Up Your Garden,” Cusp are refreshingly candid and casual. “This thing is legitimate,” Bender sings repeatedly, gaining steam, during the album's outro; plug in any interpretation—her band, her family, her life altogether—and it makes sense. Forget the sunglasses-on indifference or fully transparent confessionals. By setting life, and in the process themselves, to scale, Cusp present an indie-rock version of the world that's oddly reassuring in its scope. It's the coolest thing about them.

Watch the cover's Alexander Brown–directed video, about two friends on a night out in London, below.

Calvi said in a press release, “So many songs are about romantic love. But I wanted to highlight the romance of the chosen family, the depth of connection that isn't tethered to heteronormative ideals. It's such a powerful song about the yearning for intimacy.

	Rosalía is unveiling new details about her album Lux, which drops Nov. 7. On Monday, the Spanish singer officially shared the album cover and track list details of her upcoming project, released via Columbia Records.


	Rosalía recorded Lux with the London Symphonic Orchestra conducted by Daníel Bjarnason, and executive-produced it. According to a statement, the album “traces a widescreen emotional arc of feminine mystique, transformation, and transcendence — moving between intimacy and operatic scale to create a radiant world where sound, language, and culture fuse as one.”


	While it's unclear which songs will feature guests, the press release confirms that the record will include Björk, Portuguese fado singer Carminho, Spanish flamenco star Estrella Morente, Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz, música mexicana star Yahritza, and experimental musician Yves Tumor. The boys choir Escolania de Montserrat i Cor Cambra Palau de la Música Catalana will also be part of the album.

	











	The album is broken up into four movements, and the physical versions of the LP will include 18 songs while digital versions will include 15. Among the physical exclusives are “Focu ‘Ranni” and “Jeanne” from MOV III, and “Novia Robot” from MOV IV. The album also includes songs titled “Porcelana,” “Mio Cristo,””Memória,” and “La Perla.”

	The singer announced the album with a Times Square billboard, where she's wearing a sheer white veil over her hair, posing against a soft blue backdrop and the word “LUX” repeated in a serif font. Beneath the album title, the release date — Nov. 7 — is written in simple text, with what seems to be a logo for the project.

	











	Since 2022's Motomami, Rosalía has dropped a string of standalone singles, including “LLYM” in 2022 and “Tuya” in 2023. That same year, she released RR, a collaborative EP with Rauw Alejandro and teamed up with Björk on “Oral.” More recently, she joined Lisa on “New Woman” and Ralphie Choo on “Omega.”

Jon Stewart addressed the “No Kings” protests that took place over the weekend on a new episode of The Daily Show, describing it as “a great day for democracy and, apparently, an even better day for people across this country who always got cast as ‘ensemble' in their high school's musical.”


	Stewart recounted Fox News' dramatic response to the protests, playing a series of clips promising a “crazy” rally filled with Antifa members and Marxists. “And so this weekend we sat in our bunkers, doors locked, windows boarded, muskets and cyanide pills at the ready, prepared for whatever the hardest-core had in store,” Stewart said. “Do your worst! Display your Marxism to its fullest.”


	He continued, “Actually, there was kind of an incredible turnout that was somewhat inspiring: seven million Americans, zero mass shootings. Zero!” The host showed a photo of the enthusiastic crowd reaction. “That's just sad,” he quipped. “No mass shootings? My God. I look forward to Republicans apologizing sincerely for implying that these Americans were— what's the word I'm looking for—deplorable.”

	











	Fox News, of course, did not backtrack, with reporters instead saying that the protestors looked silly not serious. “Make up your mind, Fox,” Stewart replied. “You complained it would be a terrifyingly shit-your-pants protest. And now you are complaining about how boringly unpants-shitting it was.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The news network mainly complained that many of the protestors were old white Boomers. “Extra, extra! Read all about it: This country has too many angry old white people, says—hold on—Fox News,” Stewart said. “Fox News says, ‘Why are old white people so angry?' ‘Fox News mad that there are so many old white people in America.'” He added, “I don't think Fox News is mad. I think they're jealous.”

	











	Stewart then showed footage of the Tea Party protests during the Obama era. “Imagine a bunch of old white people in costumes angrily protesting the direction and overreach of an ever-encroaching federal government,” he joked. “I mean, preposterous. That's in no way a movement that could sweep the midterms and then be harnessed by a charismatic demagogue to remake an entire political party. I mean, it's laughable.”

	The host broke down some of the happenings at protests around the country, including dancers and a group acting out a scenario where ICE agents were “beaten” by Uncle Sam on top of the Constitution. “Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot stress this enough: This is why you do not cut funding for the arts,” Stewart said. “You don't want to do this shit on the cheap. Clearly, it was a great day for democracy and, apparently, an even better day for people across this country who always got cast as ‘ensemble' in their high school's musical.”


	Stewart compared Trump with several past kings, finding the president lacking in his royal tendencies. Eventually, Stewart concluded, “Look, maybe Trump isn't an all-powerful king, the kind who can do whatever he wants. But he's undeniably king-adjacent, king-esque, moving for more. He's the imitation crab of kings right now. The ‘I can't believe it's not king.'”

R
oy Wood Jr. has performed on virtually every kind of stage American comedy has to offer, from small, cutthroat clubs in the Deep South to sold-out theaters and televised specials that reach millions. At 46, he knows exactly who he is and what he wants to say, and he wants to make sure no one interferes with his freedom to say it. When he arrives to the Manhattan loft where we're taping our interview, clad in jeans and a light-gray T-shirt and jacket (“I'm matching the rug, that wasn't on purpose”), Wood asks if anyone on his team gave me any “no-fly zones” in terms of topics. “It hasn't been a problem the past couple of years, but old agents and shit would come behind my back and go, ‘Don't ask him about that,'” he says. I reassure him they didn't.


	Wood is most famous from his stint on The Daily Show, an experience he calls “the best eight years of comedy learning that you could ever receive.” He left in 2023, after Comedy Central spent months waffling over who would replace outgoing host Trevor Noah, only to bring back Jon Stewart and a rotating cast of anchors. To Wood, Noah's departure and the show's recalibration aligned with his own reexamination of his goals. “I knew I wanted to do something different,” he explains. 

	











	He's now hosting a weekly program, CNN's American take on the BBC panel show Have I Got News for You, with Amber Ruffin and Michael Ian Black, currently in its third season. And he's written a memoir, The Man of Many Fathers (out Oct. 28), that's a raw examination of his relationship with his own dad — radio host and journalist Roy Wood Sr., who co-founded the National Black Network — his upbringing in the post-Civil Rights-era South, and his journey through masculinity. 

	











	With a journalism degree from Florida A&M and a decade spent in radio before throwing himself into stand-up, Wood is deeply informed on the issues facing America today. Much of his career has been focused on human connection and fostering understanding with the different people he's met traveling the country, whether as a correspondent or a touring comic. That experience shows. He's a loose and easy talker who can pull a laugh out of you with little more than a widening of his eyes.

	In a time when the country feels almost irreparably broken along its partisan fissures, and political comedy has become a minefield for controversy, Wood is looking to bridge the gaps in his own way, and maybe leave behind a few lessons of his own for others to pick up. “The comedy helps me, so I do it onstage, in case it'll help somebody else,” he tells me. “I don't know if it will, but if it does, good.” 


Politics in America can feel pretty bleak right now. How do you even begin to make it funny? I think you make it truthful first, and from there, funny will follow. There are a lot of things happening right now that you can't necessarily go, “Well, what's the funny part of all the deportations?” But if you go, “What's the funny part about the policies, or the hypocrisy of it, or National Guard troops sleeping in public because you sent them there without hotel accommodations,” you can find moments of truth in the midst of all of this calamity. And through that, you're able to find the humor.


Is comedy — finding that humor — a way to process everything that's happening in this country? For me, comedy is a way to process everything. But as a Black American in this country, I don't necessarily feel any new weight, if that makes sense.


Of course.There's always weight. There's always some injustice. There's always somebody dead that shouldn't have died. I've been doing comedy for 27, 28 years now. So there isn't some sort of “Oh, what? They're doing what now? Well, let me really dial in and really make it funny.” I don't think any comedian that attacks issues in this world is doing anything different than they were 10 or 15 years ago. John Oliver or Jon Stewart or Bill Maher — take your pick — they're doing what they've always done, but it feels different, affects you differently. Water tastes different when you're thirsty.

	I don't think any comedian sits down to write the joke that's going to heal you: “I see you're in pain. Here, try this joke.” We're here to provide an escape. The solutions, that's not our responsibility.

	











In your memoir, you write about how certain men you encountered in your life helped you navigate pitfalls. I wonder if politics, and political comedy, has itself been kind of a father figure, something that helped you navigate the experiences you were living.My dad was a radio news journalist, and he covered every global conflict you can name from the 1950s up until the L.A. riots. I grew up in a house where there was a room my pops had that was just for C-Span. He recorded it all day, and then would pull quotes from the sessions to play on his news radio, commentary shows, or whatever.


	So I grew up constantly digesting the news, but my father also [was] extremely pro-Black and extremely about Black Americans getting what they deserve from this country. So the narrative that I was fed was enough for me to not necessarily seek that out, journalistically speaking. I got a degree in journalism, but because I wanted to be [ESPN anchor] Stuart Scott. I wanted to be funny, I wanted to talk about sports. 


	Then you graduate, and you're bathing in student-loan debt, and it's hard to find a good job. “Oh, wait, this country is set up against me. This is just like they were telling me in Florida A&M.” And the material changed. I was early thirties [when I started], I'm 46 now. So there was a long stretch of me just doing jokes about your roommate eating your Oreos before I got to Confederate flags, and the Kaepernick protest, and police reform, and VA hospitals not treating the troops with respect. Any topics I've talked about in my last four specials, none of that was reached in the first 15 years.

“Being a road comedian gives you a different perspective on voters. You don't see a party, you just see a person.”


You cut your teeth on the comedy circuits of the South. How did you begin introducing that material? Late in the set, that's for sure. Performing in the South, being a road comedian, gives you a different perspective on the voters of this country. Because you don't see a Republican Party, you just see a person. And they voted Republican. There's a difference when you're viewing Republicans through graphs and pie charts and Gallup polls versus you being at a comedy club on a Thursday in a red state and telling jokes to voters who would never vote for your interests, and there being some degree of synergy and understanding. 


	It definitely puts into perspective that most people in this country are voting to preserve themselves. And that's what politicians tap into. “I got to find the one thing you really care about, and make you think that I care about that the same as you.” That's what Trump did — Trump went out in Middle America and looked under them rocks, found a couple of votes over here, found a couple of votes over here, and here we are.


People can feel, like you said, very disconnected from things that don't impact their immediate environment. When you were growing up, media was much more local. The arbiters of news were very connected to the people around them in a community.Corporate consolidation of print media and the death of local reporters.

	











How has your experience meeting people and building connections with audiences around the country been affected by that transformation? My pops had a call-in show where he talked to people. Then he would do speaking engagements at Black churches. Then he would go and be a guest journalism professor at XYZ college for a semester. He took me to a barbershop in Birmingham every two weeks where all of the Black politicians — the movers and shakers, the city councilmen, all of that type of stuff [went]. So I started understanding how local politics work, and the importance of local reporters.


	The difference between then and now, and this is coming from me also working 10 years in radio, is that everything is cookie-cutter. I think it's 80 percent of radio stations are owned by five companies, or something. All of these radio stations don't hire local DJs anymore. They got one person that lives in St. Louis that's voice tracking to nine different markets. So how can the radio be the voice of the community and give the community access to uplift one another? Then you put the rise of social media on top of that. Now, the truth is only what you choose to believe. The truth becomes what makes you feel good, not what actually is. So most things, locally, are missed because of the monopolization of media. 


You've talked a bit about the reasons you left The Daily Show. Did you feel you had outgrown it? I don't want to say outgrown, but I understood what the objectives and the directives of the show are, and some of the stuff that I wanted to start doing. I was feeling that, if I'm here, “Well, what do I want to talk about?” Of course there's going to be Trump stuff, election stuff. But, man, that would've been really fun, while we were in Atlanta, to go talk at Black colleges about whether they're going to live or die. I knew for sure this wasn't going to be the place for that type of stuff. 


	Perfect example, a while back there was a viral moment on TikTok with a bunch of Black people from Scotland, and Black America was all shocked that there were people who looked like us, but sound Scottish. I happened to be in Scotland at the time, and I went out and interviewed Black people who were born in Scotland. That was a very fun, self-produced field piece. And if I were to take that same construct and put that within The Daily Show or maybe even within CNN, it's going to take two weeks. So being able to just follow my impulse and go do something on 48 hours' notice and have it back out on the internet within 36 hours, that was exciting. That's the shit I want to keep doing more of.


It sounds like you're returning to the roots of the person you described in your memoir, the person that first entered comedy.What's really odd is that that Black-college story, it's exactly the type of story my dad would've done. Now, he would've been angry, and it would've been no jokes. But you just start reverting into different thoughts, man.

	











	At The Daily Show, one of the main things I learned is that there's always a third side or another angle to the issue that's not being considered. I'm grateful that my first comedy special didn't come out until I started working there. I think also, watching Trevor Noah and how he did interviews with adversarial guests, you seek to understand, don't necessarily seek to be right. Sometimes you can talk people into not agreeing with themselves if you've got enough time to take a long enough walk. 


	People talk about Saturday Night Live and what a comedy college that is. I put The Daily Show in that same realm.… I learned a lot about why people think the way they think politically. And it really confirmed a lot of what I thought from being on the road. I could go into a red state and know that if I'm going to do the joke about police reform, I can't lead off with it. But if I do the joke about college football and then the joke about police reform, then you're with me. And so The Daily Show was “How do I gain that type of trust in under 30 seconds with a man on the street?” 

“My mother picked cotton, got fire-hosed. How do you explain to that woman, ‘Yeah, I'm going to tell jokes and get on BET.'”


Do you feel like CNN and Have I Got News for You are striking the balance you were looking for?To a degree. CNN gives me a platform to present everything that happened that week, and we get to exist in the silly stuff as well. It's not just “Oh, the administration is going to take away Medicaid this week.” It's also “Guess who this person was before Botox?” And we show you an un-Botoxed face of a political figure.


	We have blue and red guests on, sitting elected officials. And we get to dabble in what's happening, why it's happening, and then try to have a breather on the back side. 


Did you see a second Trump term? I didn't see a second Trump term happening. And then when Kamala came in, I was like, “Oh, they might get it now. They might get it.” 


	I think that there is a patent disregard for Middle America voters, and their opinions and thoughts aren't held with the same degree of importance or priority. I don't think you were ever going to beat Trump by telling Trump supporters, “Just look at the guy.” And that's the playbook that a lot of liberals ran. And I'm not just talking about liberal politicians, I'm talking about liberals as a group, where they just go, “That guy is ridiculous, how could you vote for that guy?” 


	Logic isn't necessarily going to be the weapon, it might need to be love. And then from that, you hope that they find some logic. But just yelling and berating people, done that for eight years. 


Has it surprised you to see media and entertainment companies cave to the Trump administration?That was a new curveball. I don't think Daily Show will ever bend the knee in that regard. You want to talk about a show that's going to die on its sword, it will be Jon Stewart and all of my friends at that desk. 

	











The White House Correspondents' Dinner this past year, for the first time in several years, was not hosted by a comedian.Ooh, that shit was bland. Shout-out to all the journalists, though. I know it's to celebrate journalism. 


I would love to hear what it was like when you hosted in 2023, because to me, the White House Correspondents' Dinner is often just self-congratulatory pageantry.It's the most stressed I've been as a performer next to the Apollo Theater. Amateur Night at the Apollo, that is the peak of anxiety.


Really? I'd take 1,000 Correspondents' Dinners before I … Amateur Night at the Apollo is not to be played with. With the Correspondents' Dinner, no matter what, half the room's going to love the joke. You just don't know when and you don't know [which] joke. The Apollo, there's a chance everyone will hate your guts in unison, and there's no recovery.  But I did [the Correspondents' Dinner] under the Biden administration, so the vibes were different. It wasn't necessarily an adversarial audience, but you definitely take your shots. My first joke was a joke on Biden.


Yeah. About being old.Yes. To his face. I called you old and forgetful to your face. Now, granted, strategically I had to do that because no one knows who I am in that room. I'm on The Daily Show so you trust the résumé, but you don't really know my face. You're not completely sure who I am. So I have to punch the biggest person in the room first to get equity with everyone.


Your book is a love letter to your son about how you became the person you are, the fathers who shaped you. I'm curious how fatherhood is changing your work. I became very aware of the world. My comedy is just silly: “Oh, Captain America got a Black sidekick. That's crazy. He a white dude from the racist times. Ha, ha, ha.” Perfectly fine joke to do on Craig Ferguson. All right. Fine. 


	Son gets born: “Yo, we got to figure out what's going on with these Confederate flags and this discrimination, and we have got to get to the bottom of Black-history museums being under attack.” This idea of “What world am I leaving for him? And what did I do to try and change it?” That became a bigger thing. 


	The other thing is that I started wanting to be home more, so the way I toured had to change. The thing you deal with when you travel for a living is the balance of providing versus being present. And you don't know whether or not you did too much of one or the other, and you won't know for another 10, 15 years. My son's liable to come in the house in 10 years and cuss me out and say, “You was never around.” 


	So even now when I'm out of town, we FaceTime, we talk, we engage. I show him what's going on at the gig and the venue. Or if it's a new city he doesn't know anything about, I'll go out on a walk and explore the city, which forces me to essentially be a local reporter. So then when I get onstage locally, I'm tuned the hell in to what's going on in this market. So in a lot of ways it's made me a better performer. 

	











You tagged along with your own dad for many of his work outings.A lot of hanging with my dad and having a front-row seat to his stuff [was] him not wanting to babysit. My dad didn't want to pay for child care, so “Come with me. I'm interviewing Jesse Jackson backstage at the Democratic [Convention] 1988”-type shit. I'm sitting back there with a coloring book while Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson chop it up with my dad. “You remember, Roy. We were down in Selma. Remember the Selma thing when they hit us over the head? That was a good time.”  


This book is about fathers and manhood, but I want to touch on your mother, who seems to me like your true spiritual core. My parents were separated until I was in the third grade, so it was just me and her. My mother, her work ethic and her grind, and her dedication to just doing the work and good things will happen to you, a million percent is me. 


	This is a resilient, hardworking woman who never stopped showing me that she appreciated and loved me. And I've spent the rest of my life trying to reciprocate that feeling to her. And that's our dynamic. My mother's my best fan, my biggest supporter, even when she didn't understand why I wanted to do the things I wanted to do. She found out I was sleeping in the Greyhound bus stations to do gigs, and she put a down payment on a car. She hated that I did comedy, but you also don't want your son sleeping at a bus station. I used to joke onstage — I said I could start porn tomorrow and my mom would ask me what type of lube do I use on set.

“I've done nobody wrong in this industry. Ain't never lied to nobody, never stole a joke. I've tried to be a good person.”


You describe the first fight you can remember having with her, and realizing that even if she didn't give you the response you wanted, you had a voice and she was listening. How do you deliver that same message to your son?By giving him the same freedom — but be respectful. If you have an opinion on something, speak it. I said, “You still might not get what you want, but by all means you have an opinion. You have some degree of agency.” You have to be careful about it because you also don't want to raise a kid who thinks they know everything.


That's hard to do. I knew everything up until I didn't.


I have not made a single mistake.But I would not be extending that courtesy to my son if it wasn't extended to me by my mom. I got arrested when I was 19 for stealing credit cards, so I was suspended from school. That's when I started officially doing stand-up. It comes time to get back into school. She finds out that I'm doing comedy. She's furious. Fucking furious. And so I go, “Hey, I understand that you're mad because you think that comedy is going to keep me from getting an education, so let's do this: I'm not going to stop doing comedy, and there's nothing you can do to stop that. But how about this: If I can make good grades, will that give you some sense of peace about me doing comedy?” And she said, “Yeah.” And I go, “Cool. That's what I'll do, and we don't have to talk about this ever again.” My first semester back, I made the dean's list. And slowly but surely the ice starts melting between us. 

	











That must be incredibly hard to do, when your 19-year-old is telling you, “This is how it's going to be.” It speaks a lot to who your mother is that she realized, “OK. This is it for him.”Yeah. And here's the irony: That college degree was the only thing that protected me when I went out into the workforce when I graduated. She was right. That college degree, when I went to go work at that radio station and they're debating on whether or not to hire you, and you got to check yes on that felony box, but I'm also a stand-up comedian with a degree in broadcast… The broadcast degree has been the secret weapon in so many things, including The Daily Show. Because those last two years of school are where you learn all of the practical applications of broadcast news. And what is the job of a Daily Show correspondent, if not a funny person who knows journalism? So she was right with that. It came in handy.


	My mom was the child of sharecroppers in Mississippi. My mother picked cotton, marched for everything. How do you explain to that woman who's fought and gotten beaten and fire-hosed, “Yeah, I don't know about this education shit. I'm going to tell these jokes and get on BET.”


You'd never get away with it.Her brain cannot compute — because there's something so linear about education. You do this and then you get the piece of paper, and you show them the piece of paper and they give you money, and then you retire in 40 years. Where comedy is, you do it, and maybe you're good, maybe you're bad. And even if you're good, maybe they still don't like you. And then you develop a cocaine habit, and maybe that's it.


You're at the age and status now where I'm sure people come to you for advice. If someone else were to write this book and there was a chapter about the time they met Roy Wood Jr., what would you like that chapter to say about you?That I gave as much advice as I could. I came up with a lot of gatekeepers who didn't want to help. But I have tried within the profession to be a good person and to help where I can. I try to be forthright with young comedians about what they're getting into. Most leave a conversation with me horrified, but that's because I operate from fear when it comes to achieving. There's no light at the end of the tunnel, the light is the train coming around the other end. 

	











	I've done nobody wrong in this industry. There's ex-girlfriends where I could've been a better boyfriend. Absolutely. But in this shit, ain't never lied to nobody. I never stole a joke. I never underpaid anybody. I try to overpay. I try to hire folks that deserve an opportunity. I've tried to always contribute positively. And when I'm dead and gone, any comedian that says otherwise is a fucking liar. Especially the one that tried to fuck my girl back in '08.

	Police have arrested two more men allegedly connected to the stabbing death of convicted sex criminal and former Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins.


	Watkins, 48, died earlier this month after being attacked at the HMP Wakefield prison in West Yorkshire, where he was serving a 29-year jail sentence. Watkins was found guilty of a string of heinous sexual offenses in 2013, including crimes against young children and babies.


	Just one day after Watkins' death, two men were arrested and charged with murder: Rashid (Rico) Gedel, 25, and Samuel Dodsworth, 43. The West Yorkshire police announced that two more men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder on Tuesday, Oct. 21. 


	The two men were not identified by name, though their ages were given as 23 and 39. Police said both will be interviewed today, after which they'll be bailed out and returned to prison while the investigation continues. 


	James Entwistle, a senior investigating officer of the West Yorkshire Police, said in a statement, “Extensive enquiries remain ongoing in relation to the murder of Ian Watkins and these arrests form part of that. Ian Watkins' family are being updated as the investigation progresses. However, we do not anticipate any immediate developments at this stage.”

	Watkins was previously attacked at HMP Wakefield in August 2023 by three other prisoners. They reportedly stabbed Watkins and took him hostage for six hours before he was eventually freed by corrections officers. 

	











	Prior to his arrest and conviction, Watkins and Lostprophets were a successful band that had sold over 3.4 million albums and had hits like “Last Train Home” and “Rooftops.” The band ended not long after Watkins was arrested in September 2012 after police executed a drugs search warrant at his home and seized a large number of computers, mobile phones, and storage devices. He later pleaded guilty the sex offense charges against him, with a judge said “plumbed new depths of depravity.”

	In the 30 years since her death, Selena Quintanilla's story has been told and retold dozens of times. Between the classic 1997 Gregory Nava biopic starring Jennifer Lopez and the 2020 Netflix series starring Christian Serratos, generations of fans have come to know the contours and edges of her rise to fame — the early years in South Texas with her family band, Selena y Los Dinos; their progression from local parties and nightclubs to concert venues across the U.S. and into Mexico; the self-titled debut album; and the string of hits and successes that followed. All of it earned her the title the “Queen of Tejano,” leading up to the album she hoped would allow her to cross over with English-speaking audiences, released less than four months after she was killed. 


	Through countless posthumous releases, collaborations, and tributes, Selena has become one of the most influential and well-known figures in Latin music history. And yet, the upcoming Netflix documentary Selena y Los Dinos manages to do what feels impossible: deliver a new perspective on Selena's story — this time, in her own words. Rolling Stone has an exclusive first look at the trailer here. 

	











	The documentary, which is out on Netflix Nov. 17, premiered at Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and later to an emotional hometown audience at SXSW in March. An intimate scrapbook of never-before-seen home videos, concert footage, and present-day interviews with her family and former bandmates comes together to paint a vivid portrait of Selena, not just as the superstar, but also the hard-working daughter, the teasing sister, the loving wife, the dedicated bandmate, and the ambitious young Mexican-American woman grappling with the weight of her success.

	For years, Selena's sister Suzette had kept a treasure trove of archival videos at the family's Q-Productions offices in Corpus Christi. And though she'd never planned to share it, in the decades after her sister's death, she wondered if they might serve as inspiration for future generations of Latinos. “I had always wanted to leave behind something more personal than what the Selena movie or the Netflix Selena series had to offer,” Suzette tells Rolling Stone. “This is a personal glimpse into our lives of us coming together as a family.”

	Suzette and the family looked for filmmakers who could shape the footage into a cohesive narrative, and came across Emmy-Award winning director Isabel Castro. 


	After watching her 2022 documentary, Mija, which explored the beauty and sacrifice of being a first-generation daughter through the story of two young Latinas trying to break into the music industry, they reached out. “It was a surreal experience and an unbelievable honor,” Castro tells Rolling Stone. 


	Tasked with combing through mountains of footage, Castro spent two years poring over every cassette, VHS tape, and DVD in storage, tracking Selena's rise, from her first-ever recorded performance to her transformation into one of Tejano's biggest and brightest stars. 


	Captured in various stages of her life, new pieces of the singer fall into place: in a home movie, a young Selena with wild, frizzy hair trades jabs with her sister about their clothes; in an old interview, she admits she's lost touch with her friends because she's always on the road; footage filmed by Suzette documents the band's big trip to Hollywood, where Selena beams before signing her first major record deal with EMI. “Going over all the videos of what our life was then brought on different emotions,” Suzette says. “Nothing will ever heal my heart, but it made me feel happy to be able to sit back and see what we created together and to realize our hard work paid off.”


	The viewer also sees Selena studying Spanish, acutely aware of the pressures attached to her identity as a Mexican American performer. But just as crucially, we also see her bucking against the expectations placed on her as a Mexican American woman.

	When one interviewer questions her description of herself as “dominant and aggressive,” Selena responds confidently in Spanish saying, “You have to be … There are a lot of men in this business, and if you can't speak for yourself, they'll run you over.” 

	











	In a story that is sometimes outweighed by its tragic end, Selena y Los Dinos manages to radiate joy by showing Selena as a human being, vibrating with energy, determination, and an infectious sense of humor. “For me, what makes me so emotional is that every time you see it, you want the ending to be different,” Castro says. 


	The director spoke with Rolling Stone about the making of the documentary, her relationship to Selena, and how she helps this film will add to the singer's legacy. 


When the Quintanilla family first reached out to you about this project, I'm assuming there were a million thoughts going through your mind. Did you have any fears or hesitations about signing on?Oh my God, I had so many fears going in. First and foremost, because it's just such a deep sense of responsibility to be entrusted with this archive and to be tasked with the decision of whether or not to include certain parts of it in this official documentary. But also, threading the needle between all these different facets of her story was really difficult. 


What was your initial reaction to the idea of a Selena documentary? When they first reached out, my first instinct was one that I think a lot of people have, which was “Why are we telling the story now? Why are we telling it again? What is the function of that?” So I was honored and excited, but I was also a little bit apprehensive. I didn't know how we would be able to tell her story in a new way, which was my goal. 


What was it that made you say yes?As soon as I saw the archive, I realized not only that there was a way to tell the story in a new way, but I also realized that the family was at a point in their lives that they were ready to talk about it in a way that they never had before. With those two things combined, I thought we were going to make the film something completely special. 


	I also realized the importance of telling the story again for new generations, for new audiences that might not know her or her music. So for all those reasons, even though I had some initial questions and doubts, as soon as I went down to Corpus Christi to meet the family, I knew I wanted to do this film more desperately than anything I've ever wanted to do in my career. 


What was your connection to Selena prior to making this documentary?I mean, the movie was deeply inspiring to me. I'm Mexican, and I moved to the United States when I was a really young girl, and I grew up in New England in a town that was not really diverse. When I first saw the movie, it was this really seminal moment in the formation of my identity, where I saw somebody that spoke to me, and to what I was experiencing as a Mexican American. My connection to Selena really began with that movie, and I grew up watching it all the time. 

	











In a lot of ways, the documentary feels like a perfect companion piece to the 1997 film. It touches on a lot of the same moments, but with the added insights from Selena, the family, and the band members themselves. I watched the movie so many times over the course of digitizing the archive, doing research, and going into the interviews. It served as inspiration in that it takes a similar approach in not fixating on her death, and exploring the things that played out behind the scenes. The movie was also really significant for the family, so it provided a way for us to talk about and reference different points in their lives. 


	Now that the documentary is finished, it's been really fun and exciting to go back to the movie and see the ways in which Selena is almost commenting on these different plot points from this narrative I grew up knowing by heart. I feel like the documentary is an opportunity to hear directly from Selena about her life. 


The documentary doesn't spend much time on Selena's death, or her killer. Was that a conscious choice you made going in?Right from the beginning, what I told the family is that I just wasn't really that interested in her death. In my opinion, people get a little bit preoccupied with this story of how she died, and to me, it's this totally nonsensical tragedy. It just wasn't as interesting to me as getting a better understanding of the trajectory of her career, her life, and trying to understand who she was as a person through all of this footage. 


Tell me a little bit about the archival process for this film. How much material were you sorting through, and how did you decide what you wanted to use?This was the first archival film I've ever made, and I feel like I just jumped right into the deep end. Me and [producer J. Daniel Torres] ended up traveling to Corpus Christi over a dozen times. We added it up at one point, and it was over six months that we spent going through raw material, logging footage, and trying to find the best version of it. We transcribed every interview Selena ever did, from her earliest interviews, all the way until her untimely death. That was all over the course of two years, just screening the footage with Ricky [Vela, Selena's former bandmate], who still works at Q Productions. 


What were you looking for in these mountains of footage? We wanted to find moments in her interviews that spoke to her emotional experience. It was really important to me that this story be told through the archive as opposed to being told through interviews. I wanted the interviews to provide supplemental and emotional context to what we were seeing. It wasn't until we'd seen the entire archive and digitized it that we started interviews, so that was over two years into the process before we even brought cameras down. We wanted to have the story tracked, but I also thought it was really important that we build up a relationship with the family, and build a kind of shared understanding of what we wanted the film to be. 

	











How did going over this footage change your understanding of who Selena was?To me, what emerged during the process was Selena's personality. I've seen videos of her performing, I've seen her interviews, and she was always so poised. Even from a young age, she was incredible at stepping onto a stage and just immediately turning on. But the moments that I felt closest to her were when you see her backstage, and you get a window into what she was really like. She was just really funny. When I tried to understand the charisma of Selena, because she really has this magnetism that is just impossible to turn away from, I think her humor is a really big part of it. 


Over the years, there's been one major voice “missing” from most of the interviews about Selena: her mother, Marcella. How did her participation in this documentary come about? The interview with Marcella was so unbelievably special and unique, because she doesn't like to be in front of the camera, understandably so. At first, she wasn't sure whether or not she wanted to do an interview for this film, but one day she called us and said, “I'm ready. I want to do the interview.” It's the first time she's done an interview in almost 30 years, and it was shorter in comparison to the others in the film, but it was so incredibly powerful. That conversation was so authentic and it really came from her heart. 


Selena's relationship with Chris Perez is so important to understanding who she was, but their elopement also represents a challenging time for Selena and her family. How did you want to go about that? The interview with Chris was so beautiful and so crucial. He was part of this moment in Selena's life where she kind of went against her family's wishes, and that created tension between her and her family. But I really genuinely feel now that they're so close and it was important both to Chris and to the family that he was a part of this project. Their love story was ultimately such a big part of Selena's story, and also of her growing older and making her own decisions.

In the documentary, we hear from the family directly about the elopement. They all seemed hurt about the way it happened, but all these years later, Suzette comes around saying she's glad Selena didn't wait, because “she got to experience love.” Yeah, it's a really beautiful line, because I think it also speaks to the fact that there's so much love there for Chris. Even though it's a fraught moment in the story at the time, it really lands in a place of love and respect for what they had.

	











Suzette and the Quintanilla family talked about this documentary being an opportunity to introduce Selena to new generations of fans. How do you hope the film plays a role in adding to her legacy? The goal from the beginning was to hear from Selena herself. I think from watching the raw footage of her, you really get a sense of what she was feeling and what she was experiencing as this unbelievable professional trajectory was playing out, and as her star was growing and growing. I hope that what's different with this film is that it gives people the chance to connect, on an intimate and emotional level, with Selena, her family, and their music.

W
ithin minutes of arriving at the studio for their Musicians on Musicians shoot, Redman and Black Thought are exchanging daps and catching up like old friends — because they are. The two voluble MCs, who took parallel paths to fame in the Nineties, laugh and swap stories in the dressing room while the cameras are getting positioned a few feet away. When it's time for the filmed conversation to start, they simply walk over to the set and keep talking — about how they've inspired each other to step up their lyrical techniques; about close friends gone too soon; about how much they've enjoyed their recent collaborations at Roots Picnic events in L.A. and Phila­delphia. Redman, 55, is feeling creatively energized after the 2024 release of Muddy Waters Too, a sequel to his classic 1996 album, Muddy Waters, and Black Thought, 52, shares that the Roots are almost done with their first album since 2014. When they reach the end of the time allotted for this conversation, nearly two hours after it starts, these microphone masters don't want to stop. “One more question!” Redman insists. “We want to do another hour,” Black Thought adds, with a laugh.

	











Redman: When did our paths first cross? I know my path started from the Roots album [1996's Illadelph Halflife]. You all was in my CD player. You all was part of my growth of dopeness and the caliber of how I should be spitting — especially you, bro, especially songs like “[Concerto of the] Desperado.” You held the high bar of what an MC should be.

	











Black Thought: Wow. Me and Malik [B], who, rest in peace, was the other MC earlier on in the Roots — in college, all we used to listen to was your shit! I had a suspicion that you were a Roots fan. But when you dropped that line, “I love to burn to the roots” [on LL Cool J's 1997 song “4, 3, 2, 1”], that was it. “I told you! You heard, he said it!” That was validating for me as an MC, and for the Roots. Because when we came out, we had the live instrumentation, but we had to approximate the sample sound. We were always concerned about how that was going to be received. I felt like me and Malik almost had to rap harder. We had to overcompensate as writers, as lyricists, as performers to make folks comfortable with the fact that we were playing with a big upright bass.

Redman: I can honestly say, bro, on the Muddy Waters album, when me and [Method Man] did this song called “Do What Ya Feel,” that whole round was inspired from you. If you listen to it, you'll hear how I caught your flow a little bit. Especially then, I was deep in the Roots. Every time I go overseas, Roots is my first CD I'm popping in for that excitement, for that hype I need to get before stage.


Black Thought: That means so much, bro. [Questlove] is going to lose it when I tell him.


Redman: Plus, I always admire it, too, like, “How the fuck do you remember all these rhymes, bro?” Your brain is crazy! I got to spend two months with the headphones on in the gym trying to go over songs and remember them. You, bro, when you do the Picnic or the show we just did out in L.A. — the rhymes onstage, you wasn't even using the prompter. It was there, but you wasn't even using it. I'm like, “Damn, man, how the fuck he writing rhymes to our beat?”


Black Thought: I think there's something to be said about the level of professionalism that MCs from our graduating class have in our flexibility, the way that we keep it malleable. We expect to have to improvise.… I'm a little bit younger than you. I was born in '73 in October, a couple months after they say hip-hop came along after the party up at Sedgwick [Avenue in the Bronx]. You were three or four years old, though, right? Do you remember as a young person what it felt like when hip-hop came? I have no memories of a time when it didn't exist.

Redman: Yeah, it was Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. When I first heard “The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash,” I was like, “Wow, what is this?” And then it moved on to Run-D.M.C. When I first seen them — not just heard them, but when I seen them with the black leather and the Adidas — I was like, “I got to be a part of this music.” It was something that changed my life, meaning I don't care about the money, I don't care about the fame, I just want to do this the rest of my life, for the love of it.… Who was your inspiration artist that helped mold you?


Black Thought: My top five … Who's at the top is ever-changing, but Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, Rakim, Run-D.M.C. on any given day. You talk about representation. When I was a young person, seeing people like LL Cool J, Special Ed, MC Lyte — it spoke to the power of youthful expression and how dope the young creative mind was. I was always looking for some resemblance of myself in the arts, and I got it from hip-hop during that period. 


Redman: That's right.

	











Black Thought: Man, Biz Markie blew my mind playing a joint one time. He was like, “Yo, you aren't up on this.” It was you and Biz freestyling at a park in Queens. That was a crazy freestyle!


Redman: Rest in peace, my big bro. Shout-out to Biz. He lived in downtown Newark. He allowed me to pull up on him at his crib, go through records. He was like, “Roll with me.” At the time, I was in the streets making money. I had to make a choice.


Black Thought: Yeah. That often is the case.


Redman: I made the choice of going full-fledged in the music, but my pockets was a little empty, so I still had to hustle a little bit. Biz took me around battling for money. I was up in New York airing motherfuckers out, bro, for some change. That park in Queens was supposed to be a battle, and they were going to tape it, and the dude didn't show up. Biz was like, “All right. Before we get out of here, we're just going to kick some bars.” After that freestyle, Stretch and Bobbito picked it up on their radio show, and then Sway and Tech picked it up on their show out there in L.A. They was like, “Yo, who is this dude?” I got to give a lot of credit to Biz.


Black Thought: He understood mentorship. If you were dope, if he saw a level of brilliance in you as a DJ, producer, MC, he was going to try and encourage that.


Redman: Are any of your kids in hip-hop or doing bars?


Black Thought: My youngest son, who's only 10, seems to be the most musical. My oldest son, who's 25, he went to college for music. He's got a degree in theory. But do he got bars? I got five sons and a daughter. Only two of them seem like they're even leaning toward music. I try not to impress it upon them, so they can figure it out.

“MCs from our graduating class… We keep it malleable. We expect to have to improvise.”


Redman: None of my kids want to do music. My daughter goes to school right here in Manhattan. She wants to do more acting and behind-the-camera stuff, and I admire that, because she got character, like me.


Black Thought: Oh, nice.


Redman: But none of them want to do rap. I'm like, “OK, I'm fine with that.” [Laughs.]


Black Thought: How about your skydiving hobby? Have your kids done that with you?


Redman: No. 


Black Thought: Who's like, “OK, cool, I'll go skydiving with you”? Has Meth done it with you?


Redman: No, no.… I reached out to Snoop. He's like, “Yo, I got to think about that, cuz.” Meth just said, “No, I'm not doing that.” What I love about it is that when you're in the air, there's no judgment. There's no racial standards in the air. Once you get in that plane and you got your parachute on and you're ready to dive, it don't matter if you're Black, white, poor, or rich. This is not a sport that you can throw money at and be like, “Yo, I'm going to kill it because of my team.” None of that shit matters when you're on that plane and ready to jump. That's one of the reasons I don't smoke no more — you always have to be disciplined when you're skydiving. I tell anyone, if you want to challenge yourself, come take a skydive and feel what I feel.


Black Thought: Which is beautiful. Get out of your comfort zone.

	











Redman: When are you going to do it, bro?


Black Thought: Oh, man. [Laughs.]I was hoping that you didn't think I was asking. 


Redman: Well, I'm asking. I will lay out the red carpet for you, bro.


Black Thought: What's it like in the sky when you're falling down?


Redman: You're falling, like, 100-something miles per hour. You have to arch your body, hands up, and that's how you get balanced. You always gotta check your altitude awareness and make sure you know when you're pulling your parachute. I've had seven malfunctions, where it was a 50/50 chance if I would live or not.

“Once you get in that plane and you're ready to dive, it don't matter if you're Black, white, poor, or rich.”


Black Thought: Whoa. What?!


Redman: Yeah. But I followed my procedures, and I didn't panic. I had a line twist. When you're spinning that fast in the air going down, your first thing to do is panic, but I didn't. I actually fixed it. When I landed, my instructor — shout-out to Pedro, shout-out to Space Skydive in Texas — he was like, “Yo, you're an official skydiver.” I think you should try it, bro. I'm not going to pressure you on camera, but it's something to look into.


Black Thought: Me and Jimmy Fallon went to Puerto Rico, and we did this zip line. At the time, it was the highest, longest zip line, called the Beast. That's the closest I've ever come, I guess, to skydiving. You're laying flat and your legs are out. It was an adrenaline rush that I didn't think I was going to love, but I loved it.


Redman: How did you guys land the Jimmy Fallon gig? Yo, I remember the day he announced that. He said, “The Roots will be my band.” … When you guys got that job, it was a win for our culture, honestly. We looked at you all and we applauded. It was a win for hip-hop.


Black Thought: Shout-out to Jimmy Fallon. Man, the way we got the gig, Jimmy was always a huge music nerd. He's a huge, huge Beastie Boys fan. That's the first band that took the Roots on tour. We learned the ropes from them. When everything changed in '07, '08, [after] Napster hit and the way people were receiving their music changed, Jimmy came around and said, “I'm thinking about doing the Late Night show, and I need a band. Would you guys be interested in doing it?” We thought it was bullshit until he kept coming around.


Redman: You didn't grasp it the first time he asked?


Black Thought: Not at all. It was a year and some change. We would show up at a gig, and he'd be in our dressing room, like, “Hey, hey, what's up? I was serious about what we talked about.” He was dedicated. He showed up a bunch of times pitching it. This was around the time that we had just got done working on Dave Chappelle's show. It was so much uncertainty at that time that it sounded good to have a day job. But we didn't want it to mean the end of the Roots.


Redman: For Red and Meth, we did the movie How High. You know how it is in hip-hop. Once you get on that screen, people are like, “Oh, he isn't bodying the mic no more.” We were blessed that people still accepted us as those underground dudes that still got bars. Did anything like that happen to the Roots?


Black Thought: It was a concern. What we wound up doing was just to lean into the seriousness, the gravitas of the music that much more. So if you listen to the Roots albums from [2010's] How I Got Over, the last three or four Roots records, they get progressively shorter, but more densely packed and more conceptual. 


Redman: Mm-hmm. I always looked at you like, “This guy has his life together.” When people think of Black Thought, it's always controlled. It's “You would never see me sweat.” And I know that's a part of healing, because that's the level I'm on now — self-healing, self-awareness, self-love. How important is that?


Black Thought: It is of utmost importance. Rich Nichols, who was the Roots' longtime manager — he was my entrée into the space of spirituality, meditation, veganism, all that stuff. I was a young person when he came into my life, and he came at a time when I really needed that guidance and discipline. I met Rich two or three years after I lost my mom. I lost my father at a super-young age, one or two. And then my mom passed away when I was in high school. We were already the Roots, Quest and I. And Rich came along and filled the void. He changed our lives.

	











Redman: I want to tell young artists to learn more about themselves. I follow these three words: transparency, accountability, and vulnerability. If you don't know what it means, you should look it up. Once I started following those words, it changed my life. I'm just now learning more of what self-love is. Because I'm a hip-hop baby — I've been on tour since 19 years old, bro, so it's been a fast life for me all those years. The only way we can make a change is if we change ourself.… I asked you that because you've always been a gentleman that I respected, besides the music. You always carried yourself as a man of integrity and intelligence.


Black Thought: I appreciate that, bro. It's emotional intelligence that we strive for. It is never easy, right?


Redman: You know what? This was something I needed from you. I appreciate you building with me.


Black Thought: Thank you, brother. This is a dream come true for me.

Perhaps we should be proud of our state's status as a hotbed of UFO sightings.

This article was originally published by Oddsconsin, a blog by cartographer Howard Veregin about Wisconsin's odd and unusual history, sites, and locations. Sign up for Oddsconsin's mailing list here.

Oddsconsin—where we explore peculiar and sometimes mysterious features of Wisconsin's human landscape.

Wisconsin has more unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings per capita than any other state in the Upper Midwest. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) lists 2,544 sightings in Wisconsin since 1947. With a 2020 population of 5.9 million, that means 4.32 sightings per 10,000 people. Compare that number to Iowa (4.00), Minnesota (3.88), Michigan (3.78), and Illinois (3.45). Wisconsin is clearly a destination for visitors from other planets.

In the U.S., the highest numbers of UFO sightings per capita occur in the west and southwest, including Washington (9.68), Montana (9.67), Oregon (8.72), New Mexico (8.25), Idaho (7.75), Wyoming (7.39), and Arizona (7.31). Alaska (9.05) and the New England states of Vermont (9.81), Maine (9.12), and New Hampshire (8.99) also report high numbers.

Sightings occur in every corner of Wisconsin. The largest concentrations are in Milwaukee, Madison, and Green Bay. But almost every Wisconsin city has at least a few. UFO shapes include spheres, ovals, orbs, disks, cigars, triangles, diamonds, and circles.  Lights and fireballs are very common. Sometimes, there are multiple UFOs flying in formation.

The NUFORC database is based on reports submitted by the public. NUFORC makes no claims about the validity of the reports. Obvious hoaxes have been omitted, but most reports are unedited.

Some sightings involve alien encounters. For example, a 1990 Madison report of a bright orange light (“witnessed by friend and cat”) describes how an alien slid to the ground on a tree branch. The alien was wearing “almost caveman-like clothing, chest bare, head huge and brain-shaped.” (UFO Sighting 35073)

Another case (Milwaukee, 2009) reports “three translucent inter-dimensional beings out my window three times in 2 weeks [as] I was sitting on my recliner in my living room.” The witness describes the aliens as having “very long arms and the width of their bodies were about six. Their height was maybe one foot… The face was cone shaped.” (UFO Sighting 72662)

Another report from South Milwaukee in 1970 describes two aliens as “short beings wearing long black over coats and large brimmed hats… they had no face. It was completely blank and white.” (UFO Sighting 5549)

A Kenosha account from 2019 states, “I seen an alien that looked like a reptoid, and it looked back at me.” (UFO Sighting 144809)

Given the variety of alien descriptions, perhaps Wisconsin is being visited by beings from multiple planets.

Encounters with aliens sometimes lead to violent reactions. The 1990 Madison report cited earlier states, “The guy I was with was about to shoot at him [the alien] but his gun didn't work.” (UFO Sighting 35073)

A more colorful example comes from Marshall in 2023. A father and his son were on a youth deer hunt, and the son wanted to shoot something. Seeing a flying object cresting a hill, the father, initially thinking it was a turkey vulture, said, “Well shoot that…wait…what is that?? It don't have any wings!! What the hell is that!” It turned out to be a copper-colored rectangle flying at 35 to 45 mph and making no sound. The father “considered shooting it” with his .338 Winchester Magnum but decided this was irresponsible. (UFO Sighting 187358)

The city of Stoughton, with a 2020 population of about 13,000, has had nine sightings. This gives a frequency (6.83 per 10,000), above the state average.

One report from 1997 tells of a UFO crash. An individual, fishing at the locks (presumably the Yahara River Locks just north of the city) felt a low vibration and saw a bright flash over his head, which then slammed into the marsh behind a copse of trees. It was a terrifying experience. “I left right that second and didn't go back for a few minutes to pick up my fishing equipment.” (UFO Sighting 118620)

This individual also reported having “a strange group of memories from my youth that I believe are of me being abducted on a few different occasions.” Another Stoughton account states that, in 1966, the witness' entire family was abducted by aliens. The incident was recalled due to the aid of “hypnotherapy sessions or by a method of self-hypnosis.” The witness described one alien as having an “orange monkey face.” Another alien, who “looked like a movie star,” had extreme carnation-pink skin and was “wearing what looked like a snowmobile suit.”  Other aliens inside the spacecraft were chalk white with big fish eyes. Some of these aliens probed the witness, shoving something up his right nostril and other bodily orifices. (UFO Sighting 88640)

Who's to say whether these incidents are real or fictional? Some might be imaginary, others hoaxes, but with so many sightings in Wisconsin, can we really conclude there's nothing going on? We might not have an explanation, but there are too many reports of fireballs and flying cigars to simply disregard the evidence. Perhaps we should be proud of our state's status as a hotbed of UFO sightings. Welcome to Wisconsin, UFO capital of the Upper Midwest!

Do you believe in ghosts? It's a great time of the month to ask that question as we approach Halloween.

But what you may think is a ghost or a presence may be explained away pretty easily.

Local paranormal specialist Alex Matsuo is deeply involved in ghosts, ghost stories, haunted houses, and making sure that it's not just a tree branch scratching the side of your house when the wind blows that's freaking you out.

At a lecture Monday night in Arlington, Virginia, at the Glencarlyn Library, Matsuo laid out all the things she and her team look at when someone calls them and says their house is haunted.

“First we try to debunk” what are some of the things that may explain something weird in your neighborhood, she said, noting that a feeling of being watched can be explained by uneven floors in your house.

“Even if it's very subtle, that feeling of being off balance can create that experience,” Matsuo said.

Matsuo said odd smells in your house can be explained by “walls and carpets that have absorbed smells and only emit them under certain conditions.”

Also on the list is faulty wiring that may explain flashing lights; an animal that's actually the noise behind unexplained footsteps; and mental illness.

“First, I say call your doctor, then call us,” she joked.

But having experienced a paranormal presence herself, Matsuo said, “Ultimately, if we do run into something we can't explain, then that makes it more interesting.”

While living in California, Matsuo was in a bad car accident and ended up in the emergency room with another patient who died. However, for a period of eight months, the man wearing a distinct leather jacket showed up in many places.

“I saw the man who died everywhere,” she said.

Matsuo said this went on until the Greek Orthodox Church sent a woman to anoint her. After going through a guided meditation, the ghost went away.

Matsuo will be hosting another lecture later this month on Arlington's haunted places, including a home supposedly haunted by Jim Morrison, the famed lead singer of The Doors.

A newly tracked interstellar comet, which has been dubbed 3I/ATLAS and is likely to pass the sun, Jupiter, Mars and Venus this autumn, but nowhere near Earth, has sparked some unexpectedly Jewish reflections.

Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor of astronomy, has posited that comets and space debris might be products of extraterrestrial intelligence and has theorized that there is a 60% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS is an extraterrestrial construction. Loeb has also informed the Jewish Journal of Greater Boston that the Messiah may well be extraterrestrial in origin.

Elsewhere, Loeb has suggested that after the arrival of extraterrestrials on Earth, “old religions might die and new religions might be born,” implying the possible end of Judaism, as one of the old-time religions.

The professor has stated that he is “very proud” of Jewish tradition because “there's a lot of wisdom in it,” which might be seen as a neat understatement. But at the same time, in a blog he has declared that because the earth is no safe haven for Jews, it might be a good idea to move to outer space, where there are no lethal proprietary struggles of the Middle East type nor any antisemitism.

In any case, the way the solar system is developing, within 7.6 billion years, astronomers tell us, the sun will swell into a red giant and vaporize the Earth. To sidestep this fate, Loeb hints that Jews might kvell for trillions, instead of mere billions, of years by relocating to a distant planet, any one of untold numbers currently uninhabited.

This notion, although meant perhaps only half-seriously, overlooks the Jewish tradition of earth as a potentially blessed place for Jews, however long the blessing lasts. The biblical Book of Isaiah uses the term Beulah (from the Hebrew word for married) to refer to the land of Israel after its restoration, a symbolic state of being in a blessed covenant with God on earth, not in outer space.

At the same time, Loeb has cautioned that extraterrestrial visitors might have malign motives and earthlings would not be able to oppose them;  on the other hand, ETs might also be nicer and better than humans. Last month, Loeb claimed that, since interstellar visitors “must have survived” for billions of years, they might follow the principle of “survival of the kindest.”

Justifying his assertion that roaming extraterrestrials seeking earthly contacts might be benevolent, Loeb stated: “Lonely people do not engage in blind dates if they believe that their dating partners are likely to be serial killers,” going on to observe that such interstellar wandering lonely hearts are “motivated to seek partners if they believe that kindness is abundant on the dating scene.”

Whatever the eHarmony aspect of intergalactic dating might be, the concept of visitors from outer space who are kind to Jews and others is contradicted by Loeb's repeated claims that interstellar comets could also be espionage vehicles with menacing intent. These dire predictions have worried some readers, while annoying fellow astronomers who have called them mere distractions, implying that the time spent denying Loeb's much-publicized, highly improbable theories might be better used for further research.

Still, Loeb is far from the first to associate Yiddishkeit with extraterrestrial phenomena — the tradition goes back at least as far as the vision of a chariot-like structure with four wheels described in the Bible's Book of Ezekiel, symbolizing God's omnipresence, omniscience and mobility.

The 17th century cult leader Abraham Miguel Cardozo saw faces in the moon, including the False Messiah Sabbatai Zevi and the mystic Isaac Luria. More recently, the Jewish psychiatrist John Mack, also affiliated with Harvard, investigated unproven claims of alien abductions, including one made by an Israeli woman who, under hypnosis, recalled a former 13th century life as an Arab merchant famed for justice and benevolence.

These and other examples have been examined by David Halperin, an expert on Jews and UFOs, who alludes to the eminent American Jewish astronomer Carl Sagan, who was open-minded about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, but concluded that as yet, no purported discoveries had been proven scientifically.

In a recent blog post, Loeb, who has previously likened his detractors to those who dismissed Galileo, Madame Curie, and the Wright Brothers,  compared himself  to a Jewish child prisoner in Theresienstadt concentration camp who drew idealized images of a “better world” rather than the grim reality of a Nazi jail. Loeb noted that he and others who dream “of a better world than Earth” might “guide [humanity] to the promised land” by encountering aliens.

Whatever one thinks of these comparisons, Jews have long sought and found extraterrestrial inspiration in earthly phenomena, and the wisest scientific mavens, including Sagan and others, have remained temperate, whether or not such theories turned out to be factual. May the same turn out to be the case with 3I/ATLAS.

RelatedJewish tradition sees eclipses as bad omens. Many American Jews are seeking totality anyway.,

Television is in the Harlan Coben business, and to paraphrase Inglourious Basterds' Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), business is definitely a-boomin'. This year alone has seen a set of new Coben adaptations dropping on Netflix, including Missing You, Just One Look, and Caught. Meanwhile, Prime Video's Lazarus (not to be confused with the anime series released earlier this year on HBO Max) is penned by Coben alongside BAFTA-winner Danny Brocklehurst, and it's a dark and twisty murder mystery with a mysteriously supernatural edge. The often tense series is kept continually fresh and novel thanks to a barrage of moving parts that mostly work. Its more unusual, otherworldly scenes are a standout element and the secret sauce of Lazarus' success, but a few persistent narrative issues hold it back from full greatness.

The new series follows Joel Lazarus (Sam Claflin), a forensic psychologist who returns home after the death of his father, Dr. Jonathan Lazarus (About Time's Bill Nighy). As Joel spends copious time in his father's office attempting to make some sense of the tragedy (and of a very odd suicide note), he starts to have some, well, haunting experiences about his father's old clients. The tragedy also brings back an obsession with the murder of Joel's beloved sister Jenna (Alexandra Roach) 25 years prior, a set of factors leading to an increasingly set of terrible reveals as Joel tries to unearth the truth. Is there foul play in his father's supposed suicide? What's the truth behind his sister's tragic murder? Can he figure out what's behind his increasingly odd experiences in his father's office, or is his sanity merely suffering under the strain?

The centerpiece of Lazarus is an intense and emotional performance from Sam Claflin. It's a difficult role, given that Joel's simultaneously trying to solve his father's death, the cold case of his sister's killer, the mystery of what the hell is happening with his visions, and his struggle with sanity while managing all of the above. Claflin lands complicated emotional beats with an intelligent on-screen presence while also being believably harried in the process. Nighy brings an air of guarded authority to a character with mysterious hidden layers. He shares an excellent and believable onscreen relationship with Claflin, and the pair do a great job navigating a series of tense exchanges. Alexandra Roach also excels as Joel's sister Jenna, a kind but somewhat eccentric character who gives Joel a much-needed sounding board.

The series' drama is propelled by interesting reveals and surprises, alongside a gradual succession of Joel's supernatural experiences. Between that dynamic and carefully dreamy cinematography in the odder moments, Lazarus has a novel quality to it. The surprises (which won't be spoiled here) largely work, though many of the story's events wouldn't fully feel new if the arguably supernatural events were removed. As an entire package, Lazarus manages to feel fresh, but the explanations at its center are a mixed bag. One of its biggest mysteries, that of the senior Lazarus' suicide, wraps up with a true surprise, but another major plotline might feel fairly steadily telegraphed and predictable to anyone with a firm command of genre storytelling.

Ultimately, Lazarus is an engaging if uneven viewing experience. The central performances are unsurprisingly solid, and the more otherworldly elements create a unique feeling that permeates several major moments. The transition between those parts and the rest is fairly seamless, with well-structured pivots between divergent investigations and narrative threads. As for the supernatural, some elements work better or make more sense than others — most significantly in the series' first two episodes, before they're normalized in the world. A key twist at the end is relevantly foreshadowed, but it's still a bit of a reach.

It's hard to make a thriller investigation series feel fully new, given how prominent the genre's themes are. As a consequence, a series has to find something special to really stand out. Lazarus does so by balancing a carefully threaded set of narratives against a protagonist beset by the ghosts of the past, and it's a largely successful affair — but altogether, Lazarus is a pretty good series that falls shy of being a great one.

Harlan Coben's Lazarus boasts an intriguing mystery, standing out thanks to unusual supernatural elements, but its genre tropes don't fully click.

Lazarus follows a man's return home after his father's suicide, where he encounters unexplainable disturbances. As he delves into the mystery of his father's death and his sister's murder from 25 years ago, he becomes entangled in a series of cold-case murders.

Blending myth, culture, and modern fantasy, Tanamor's darkly inventive novel explores identity, belonging, and the monsters that unite—and divide—us.

 (PRUnderground) October 21st, 2025

Acclaimed Filipino-American author Jason Tanamor brings a thrilling fusion of folklore and urban fantasy to life in “Vampires of Portlandia,” a genre-bending tale that transports readers from the Philippines to the eccentric streets of Portland, Oregon. With a cast of supernatural beings, a deep cultural heartbeat, and a narrative that questions what it means to belong, Tanamor's novel has been hailed as both a gripping fantasy and a poignant exploration of identity.

When matriarch Marcella Leones relocates her family of aswang—shape-shifting vampires from Filipino mythology—to Portland, she hopes to shield them from persecution. Her dying wish is simple: for her descendants to live peacefully among humans. But after she passes, her grandson Percival inherits her powers and her promise. When a mysterious rise in murders threatens to expose their existence, Percival and his love interest Penelope Jane must uncover who broke the aswang covenant—and why.

As the investigation unfolds, they discover that Portland's supernatural underworld runs far deeper than imagined, teeming with were beasts, witches, ghouls, and viscera who have long called the city home. What follows is an atmospheric, fast-paced tale that blends Filipino legend with modern sensibilities, creating a world where myth and reality coexist—often uneasily.

“'Vampires of Portlandia' is about more than monsters,” says Tanamor. “It's about immigration, family, and the struggle to find community when you feel like an outsider. The aswang are metaphors for cultural identity—they're trying to survive in a world that doesn't understand them.”

Known for his distinctive voice and fearless storytelling, Tanamor has crafted a fantasy that's as socially conscious as it is supernatural. Readers who enjoyed “The Witcher” or “American Gods” will find similar layers of myth and meaning—woven here through a distinctly Filipino lens. The book also celebrates the growing diversity of speculative fiction, offering representation and cultural nuance rarely seen in vampire lore.

With rich world-building, complex characters, and a narrative pulsing with heart and heritage, “Vampires of Portlandia” cements Jason Tanamor as a unique voice in modern fantasy. It's a story that dares to ask: what if the monsters we fear are just trying to live like us?

Perhaps we should be proud of our state's status as a hotbed of UFO sightings.

This article was originally published by Oddsconsin, a blog by cartographer Howard Veregin about Wisconsin's odd and unusual history, sites, and locations. Sign up for Oddsconsin's mailing list here.

Oddsconsin—where we explore peculiar and sometimes mysterious features of Wisconsin's human landscape.

Wisconsin has more unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings per capita than any other state in the Upper Midwest. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) lists 2,544 sightings in Wisconsin since 1947. With a 2020 population of 5.9 million, that means 4.32 sightings per 10,000 people. Compare that number to Iowa (4.00), Minnesota (3.88), Michigan (3.78), and Illinois (3.45). Wisconsin is clearly a destination for visitors from other planets.

In the U.S., the highest numbers of UFO sightings per capita occur in the west and southwest, including Washington (9.68), Montana (9.67), Oregon (8.72), New Mexico (8.25), Idaho (7.75), Wyoming (7.39), and Arizona (7.31). Alaska (9.05) and the New England states of Vermont (9.81), Maine (9.12), and New Hampshire (8.99) also report high numbers.

Sightings occur in every corner of Wisconsin. The largest concentrations are in Milwaukee, Madison, and Green Bay. But almost every Wisconsin city has at least a few. UFO shapes include spheres, ovals, orbs, disks, cigars, triangles, diamonds, and circles.  Lights and fireballs are very common. Sometimes, there are multiple UFOs flying in formation.

The NUFORC database is based on reports submitted by the public. NUFORC makes no claims about the validity of the reports. Obvious hoaxes have been omitted, but most reports are unedited.

Some sightings involve alien encounters. For example, a 1990 Madison report of a bright orange light (“witnessed by friend and cat”) describes how an alien slid to the ground on a tree branch. The alien was wearing “almost caveman-like clothing, chest bare, head huge and brain-shaped.” (UFO Sighting 35073)

Another case (Milwaukee, 2009) reports “three translucent inter-dimensional beings out my window three times in 2 weeks [as] I was sitting on my recliner in my living room.” The witness describes the aliens as having “very long arms and the width of their bodies were about six. Their height was maybe one foot… The face was cone shaped.” (UFO Sighting 72662)

Another report from South Milwaukee in 1970 describes two aliens as “short beings wearing long black over coats and large brimmed hats… they had no face. It was completely blank and white.” (UFO Sighting 5549)

A Kenosha account from 2019 states, “I seen an alien that looked like a reptoid, and it looked back at me.” (UFO Sighting 144809)

Given the variety of alien descriptions, perhaps Wisconsin is being visited by beings from multiple planets.

Encounters with aliens sometimes lead to violent reactions. The 1990 Madison report cited earlier states, “The guy I was with was about to shoot at him [the alien] but his gun didn't work.” (UFO Sighting 35073)

A more colorful example comes from Marshall in 2023. A father and his son were on a youth deer hunt, and the son wanted to shoot something. Seeing a flying object cresting a hill, the father, initially thinking it was a turkey vulture, said, “Well shoot that…wait…what is that?? It don't have any wings!! What the hell is that!” It turned out to be a copper-colored rectangle flying at 35 to 45 mph and making no sound. The father “considered shooting it” with his .338 Winchester Magnum but decided this was irresponsible. (UFO Sighting 187358)

The city of Stoughton, with a 2020 population of about 13,000, has had nine sightings. This gives a frequency (6.83 per 10,000), above the state average.

One report from 1997 tells of a UFO crash. An individual, fishing at the locks (presumably the Yahara River Locks just north of the city) felt a low vibration and saw a bright flash over his head, which then slammed into the marsh behind a copse of trees. It was a terrifying experience. “I left right that second and didn't go back for a few minutes to pick up my fishing equipment.” (UFO Sighting 118620)

This individual also reported having “a strange group of memories from my youth that I believe are of me being abducted on a few different occasions.” Another Stoughton account states that, in 1966, the witness' entire family was abducted by aliens. The incident was recalled due to the aid of “hypnotherapy sessions or by a method of self-hypnosis.” The witness described one alien as having an “orange monkey face.” Another alien, who “looked like a movie star,” had extreme carnation-pink skin and was “wearing what looked like a snowmobile suit.”  Other aliens inside the spacecraft were chalk white with big fish eyes. Some of these aliens probed the witness, shoving something up his right nostril and other bodily orifices. (UFO Sighting 88640)

Who's to say whether these incidents are real or fictional? Some might be imaginary, others hoaxes, but with so many sightings in Wisconsin, can we really conclude there's nothing going on? We might not have an explanation, but there are too many reports of fireballs and flying cigars to simply disregard the evidence. Perhaps we should be proud of our state's status as a hotbed of UFO sightings. Welcome to Wisconsin, UFO capital of the Upper Midwest!

Smith applauds NBA player's COVID stance: ‘We see all the conspiracy theories … props to hi","https://www.nj.com/sports/2025/10/espns-stephen-a-smith-applauds-nba-players-covid-stance-we-see-all-the-conspiracy-theories-props-to-him.html","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

ESPN's Stephen A. Smith has taken a more favorable stance on Kyrie Irving over the last few years, and now he's backing the NBA player's anti-vax ideas.

Speaking on the ""7PM In Brooklyn"" podcast, Smith supported Irving's refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, saying he was “right” not to take it. 

While with the Brooklyn Nets for the 2021-2022 season, Irving was initially sidelined for all home games after declining to receive the vaccine. The NBA did not have a mandate in place but ordered players to follow local laws.

“Kyrie's a good brother,” Smith said. We used to butt heads because he used to miss work too damn much.

“And I'm like, yo man, this brother's electrifying, I want to see this brother dancing on the basketball court. I don't want to hear no sh*t about no COVID vaccines. Get your a** on the court. We see you. Now, obviously in hindsight, the brother's right because we see all the conspiracy theories that came out. And props to him for having the foresight to see that. We didn't see that at the time.”

Smith was not clear about what “conspiracy theories” backed Irving up in his eyes. The CDC currently recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for “most” people 18 and over to prevent illness, hospitalization and death.

Conspiracy theories about Princess Diana's death left Virginia Giuffre feeling scared and powerless after allegedly being made to have sex with Prince Andrew, as she was surrounded by people with immense power and influence, her posthumous memoir reveals.

Prince Andrew's accuser passed away by suicide in April at the age of 41 but before her death she completed her memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' which has been released today (October 21). Nobody's Girl's collaborator, Amy Wallace, wrote at the beginning of the bombshell memoir: “She wanted all her suffering to have accomplished something.”

What subsequently emerged from Giuffre's 400-page, diary-style account was a clear determination to expose how power, corruption and alleged sexual exploitation left lasting scars on victims like herself.

Prince Andrew is referenced 88 times in Nobody's Girl as Giuffre provided graphic details of her alleged abuse by the late financier and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Among shocking revelations, the memoir discloses Giuffre's account of being 17 and staying at Ghislaine Maxwell's London home when Maxwell told her Prince Andrew would be joining them for dinner.

“Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince,” she wrote. However, what allegedly followed was anything but a fairy tale.

Giuffre recounted that after allegedly having sex with Andrew for the first time, she was left deeply affected by conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death, feeling vulnerable and powerless among people who, in her words, “wielded vastly more clout than I ever would"".

“I hadn't wanted to have sex with the prince, I said, but I felt I had to,” Giuffre wrote, expressing her belief that escaping Epstein and Maxwell's control was impossible.

She recalled her then-boyfriend Tony Figueroa being “scared that I was alone in a foreign country with people so powerful; he said he understood why I felt powerless,” and noted that “less than four years earlier, Lady Diana had died in a car accident, prompting some conjecture (never proven) that the Royal Family had somehow been involved.”

Giuffre added: “Tony and I agreed that, especially while I was abroad, I needed to keep Epstein and Maxwell happy.”

Giuffre, from California, accused Epstein and his associate Maxwell of sexually abusing and trafficking her when she was a teenager in the early 2000s. Epstein was first convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

He operated a vast sex trafficking ring involving underage girls and powerful individuals until his arrest in July 2019 and subsequent death in August 2019. He died in 2019 by suicide while in jail awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Maxwell, a British socialite, was Epstein's close confidante and was convicted in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming young girls for abuse. Giuffre has been one of the most prominent voices exposing the abuse and seeking justice for Epstein and Maxwell's victims.

In 2015, Giuffre accused Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her in 2001, when she was 17 years old, as part of Epstein and Maxwell's sex trafficking network. Andrew has consistently denied all allegations made against him by Giuffre and has stated that he has no recollection of ever meeting the Californian woman.

In a 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said: ""It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened."" He also claimed he had ""no recollection of ever meeting"" Giuffre and provided an alibi for the night she alleges the abuse took place.

Despite his denials, Prince Andrew settled a civil lawsuit brought by Giuffre in early 2022 without admitting any wrongdoing.

Dario Amodei

Anthropic Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei put out a lengthy blog post pushing back at “inaccurate claims” about its policy positions days after White House AI czar David Sacks criticized the company's calls for more AI regulation.

In the post, published Tuesday, Amodei stressed that Anthropic has been aligned with the Trump administration on “key areas of AI policy,” including publicly praising a set of executive orders intended to bolster US competitiveness on artificial intelligence. Amodei said he also met President Donald Trump during a July AI and energy summit in Pennsylvania, “where he and I had a good conversation about US leadership in AI.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Shares of Google parent Alphabet sank 3% on Tuesday after OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Atlas, an artificial intelligence-powered web browser.

OpenAI posted a five-second video on X showing three browser tabs that say ""Livestream,"" ""Today"" and ""10 a.m. PT."" The company's CEO Sam Altman highlighted the upcoming launch in a separate post, writing that it's for a new product he's ""quite excited about!""

On YouTube, OpenAI published a link to a livestream titled ""Introducing ChatGPT Atlas."" In the description, the company describes the product as its ""new browser"" and said it's available globally on macOS with Windows, iOS and Android coming soon. 

In January, OpenAI unveiled Operator, an agent that uses a browser to complete tasks, but it has yet to release a standalone browser product. Launching a browser would put the company in direct competition with rivals like Google and Perplexity AI, who are jostling to attract users and win market share with their offerings.

Earlier this month, Perplexity announced that its AI browser web browser Comet is available for free worldwide.

The Comet browser is designed to serve as a personal assistant that can search the web, organize tabs, draft emails, shop and more, according to the company.

Google rolled out a Gemini model in its Chrome browser in September, which allows users to ask for help understanding the contents of a particular webpage, work across tabs, or do more within a single tab, like scheduling a meeting or searching for a YouTube video.

            The Israeli military said Tuesday that two coffins carrying the apparent remains of deceased hostages had crossed the border into Israel.
    


            “Two coffins of deceased hostages, escorted by IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops, crossed the border into the State of Israel a short while ago and are on their way to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine, where identification procedures will be carried out,” according to a statement from the IDF and Israel Security Agency (ISA).
    


            Israel's Ministry of Health confirmed later that the bodies had arrived at the institute, where teams were working “as quickly as possible” to identify the bodies and investigate their causes of death.
    


            If their identities are confirmed, they will be the 14th and 15th deceased hostages to be transferred to Israel since the US-proposed ceasefire deal was signed on October 9.
    


            Earlier Tuesday, the Prime Minister's Office said Israeli forces had received the two coffins in Gaza after being handed over from the custody of the Red Cross in the war-torn territory.
    


            The IDF asked the public to act with “sensitivity and wait for official identification, which will first be communicated to the families of the deceased hostages.”
    


            “Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the deceased hostages,” the IDF said in an earlier statement.
    


            Hamas' armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said earlier Tuesday that the transfer of two hostage bodies was scheduled to take place.
    


            Before Tuesday's announcement, Hamas had returned 13 of the 28 bodies of deceased hostages agreed to be released in line with the ceasefire agreement with Israel, the latest of which was identified on Monday as Sergeant Major Tal Haimi.
    


            All 13 of those bodies have now been formally identified.
    


Vance downplays concerns over ceasefire in visit to Israel as Trump administration officials privately worry



            Under the Trump administration's ceasefire agreement, Hamas was supposed to return all the living and deceased hostages within the first 72 hours of the ceasefire going into effect. Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza.
    


            Hamas has said “significant efforts and special equipment” are needed to recover the bodies in Gaza. One of the bodies handed over by Hamas under the agreement last week did not belong to an Israeli hostage, according to the Israeli military.
    


            Initial assessments at the time suggested Hamas misidentified the body rather than intentionally sending the wrong one, an Israeli source said.
    


            The latest hostage release is underway hours after US Vice President JD Vance touched down in Israel and the Trump administration moves to implement the next phase of its ceasefire plan.
    


            Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas affirmed their commitment to the ceasefire deal after Israel accused Hamas of carrying out an attack that killed two IDF soldiers, prompting waves of airstrikes.
    


            Both Hamas and the Israeli military accused the other of violations.
    


            Vance on Tuesday downplayed concerns about the fragility of the ceasefire between the two warring parties but declined to put a timeline on the return of all deceased hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament.
    


            “It is a focus of everybody here to get those bodies back home to their families, so that they can have a proper burial. Now, that said, this is difficult. This is not going to happen overnight,” Vance said at a press conference in Israel.
    


            The US vice president also said some of the deceased hostages are “buried under thousands of pounds of rubble. Some of the hostages, nobody even knows where they are. That doesn't mean we shouldn't work to get them.”

The management of the Louvre Museum has been criticized for prioritizing diversity over competence in key appointments, following a daylight robbery in which the French crown jewels were stolen.

The controversy has centered on the Louvre's security chief, Dominique Buffin, whose appointment was hailed in French media last year as part of a gender-balance drive. Buffin, who previously held posts in the police and the Culture Ministry, became the museum's first female head of security last September after being appointed by director Laurence des Cars, herself the Louvre's first woman to hold the position.

Marion Marechal, a member of the European Parliament and niece of veteran right-wing politician Marine Le Pen, said France had become the “laughingstock of the world” over what she called the “ridiculous theft.” 

“This humiliation cannot go unanswered,” Marechal wrote on X on Monday, urging Culture Minister Rachida Dati to demand the immediate resignation of des Cars and Buffin, who she accused of being appointed “as part of a feminization policy.” 

Marechal said the approach came “at the cost of forgoing competence and endangering the nation's cultural heritage.” 

The Louvre, home to masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa, has faced criticism for security lapses and modernization delays. A state audit had found security systems to be “old and inadequate” before the heist. Former Louvre director Pierre Rosenberg warned as early as 1998 that the museum's security was “fragile.” 

Investigators said they were pursuing several leads and have not ruled out an inside job, though early evidence points to organized crime. The Louvre remained closed to visitors on Monday as police reviewed CCTV footage.

Graham Platner says he didn't know historical associations of skull-and-crossbones tattoo he got on his chest in 2007

US politics live – latest updates

The Maine Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner attempted to get ahead of potential opposition research by disclosing and explaining a skull-and-crossbones tattoo he has on his chest that resembles Nazi imagery, along with an embarrassing personal video.

In a video interview with Pod Save America that aired on Monday, Platner said he and fellow marines got matching tattoos at a parlor in Split, Croatia, in 2007 while deployed overseas.

He said that he wanted to address the issues himself before opponents could weaponize them, saying there isn't anything “worse” or “different” than his problematic Reddit posts that have come back to bite his campaign in recent days, and insisting that he had no knowledge of the imagery's historical associations.

“We chose a terrifying looking skull and crossbones off the wall because we were marines and skulls and crossbones are pretty standard military thing,” he said, “and we got those tattoos, and then we all moved on from our lives.”

The tattoo in question resembles the Totenkopf, or “death's head” symbol, which was adopted by Hitler's SS during the Nazi era and became particularly associated with the SS-Totenkopfverbande, the branch responsible for guarding concentration camps, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

When reached for comment, Platner said: “I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that” the tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol. He said he was “already planning to get this removed”.

The skull is in full view in video footage he shared with the media company, which shows him dancing in his underwear at his brother's wedding, lip-syncing Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball in a performance for his sister-in-law.

He emphasized in the interview that he was “not a secret Nazi” and pointed to his Reddit comment history as evidence of his opposition to Nazism, antisemitism and racism. “I would say a lifelong opponent,” he stated.

The US military already has a policy that checks for extremist, racist and sexist tattoos, and Platner added that the Nazi connection never came up during security screenings, including when he joined the army national guard after his marine service and later for the state department when he worked as security detail for the US ambassador to Afghanistan.

“The fact that I've managed to go from communist to Nazi in the span of four days according to people who are trying to do this to me I find to be quite a spectacular turn of events,” Platner said.

The disclosures come as Platner's insurgent campaign faced newfound scrutiny. On Friday, he issued a video apology for inflammatory Reddit posts spanning 2013 to 2021, which included calling police officers “bastards”, questioning why Black people tip less, and appearing to agree with characterizations of rural white voters as “racist” and “stupid”.

His former political director, Genevieve McDonald, a former state representative who resigned on Friday over the Reddit comments, remained very skeptical about Platner's explanation of the tattoo.

“Platner prides himself on his extensive knowledge of military history,” McDonald said. “While he may not have known what his tattoo meant when he selected the image, it is not plausible he remained ignorant of its meaning all these years.”

Platner has emerged as a significant figure in a competitive Senate race to flip Maine, drawing hundreds to town halls and raising nearly $4m while positioning himself as critical of the Democratic establishment, including the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, who he said he would not support.

In the podcast interview, Platner maintained he was not trying to conceal the tattoo.

“I can honestly say if I was trying to hide it I haven't been doing a very good job for the last 18 years,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Hi, this is Yuliia Taradiuk reporting from Kyiv on day 1,336 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU)  has ""destroyed"" two Russian light aircraft used for intercepting drones, the service said on Oct. 21.

According to SBU, planes were placed at airfields in a Russian-occupied territory and used to shoot down Ukrainian long-range drones. 

Exiled Mariupol's mayoral adviser, Petro Andriushchenko, said on Oct. 21 that one of the airfields — the private Korsak airfield — is located near the rural settlement Pryazovske in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, 80 kilometers from the front line.

The video footage released by the SBU shows the moment the planes were struck in an operation by the SBU's Special Operations Center ""A.""

""This work to 'clear the way' for our long-range drones ensures uninterrupted strikes on Russian rear areas,"" the SBU said.

""The SBU continues to strike the occupiers with all available means. They will pay justly for every crime they commit!""

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

Russia has not officially commented on the reported strikes.

Explosions occurred at oil refineries in Romania and Hungary on the evening of Oct. 20, both of which have links to Russia, local media reported on Oct. 21.

Russian oil remains a key source of revenue for Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. Despite the European Union's push to fully phase out Russian energy, several member states continue to receive supplies.

A midday explosion occurred at the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiesti, southern Romania, on Oct. 20.

The facility, owned by a subsidiary of Lukoil, one of Russia's largest privately owned oil and gas companies, had reportedly been offline since Oct. 17 due to a planned technical inspection, according to Hungarian newspaper Vilaggazdasag.

An explosion also occurred at Hungary's largest oil refinery, located in the city of Szazhalombatta, which receives crude oil from Russia, according to Hungarian media outlet Telex.

The Danube Refinery, situated 27 kilometers (about 17 miles) from Budapest and owned by the Hungarian oil company MOL, caught fire on the evening of Oct. 20 following the explosion. Firefighters managed to contain the blaze by the morning of Oct. 21.

No injuries or fatalities have been reported.

The exact cause of the incident remains under investigation. The Szazhalombatta facility, considered the most advanced in Hungary's oil refining sector, may now face a temporary shutdown.

The refinery is supplied with crude oil from Russia through the Druzba pipeline.

Russian drone attacks on the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy and on a city in Chernihiv Oblast killed at least four people and injured 16 on Oct. 21, local authorities said.

Russia attacked Novhorod-Siverskyi, Chernihiv Oblast, with Shahed-type drones, and about 20 sites were hit, Governor Viacheslav Chaus wrote on Telegram.

Four civilians were killed – two men and two women. Seven people were injured, including a 10-year-old girl.

""(The girl) is being transported to the regional children's hospital. One of the injured is in serious condition, while the others are in moderate condition,"" Chaus said. ""There is a lot of destruction in the city.""

Nine civilians were injured in a drone attack on Sumy, Governor Oleh Hryhorov said on Oct. 21.

""A drone strike targeted the crossroad. Cars and civilian infrastructure were damaged. All victims are receiving the necessary medical assistance,"" Hryhorov said. He added that emergency services are working at the site of the attack.

Sumy and Chernihiv oblasts, which border Russia to the north, have been a repeated target of Russian incursions and shelling since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto has said Italy is prepared to cover the costs of U.S. weapons purchases for Ukraine through a special procurement program, Bloomberg reported on Oct. 20.

Speaking at a meeting of defense ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization last week, Crosetto said that Italy is ready to pay for the weapons, as they are crucial to Ukraine's efforts to repel Russia's war, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke to Bloomberg.

Italy has developed at least 10 military aid packages for Ukraine. According to sources, Rome's contributions included providing air defense systems like SAMP/T batteries.

Belgium still plans to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets but they won't arrive for at least one year, Belgium Defense Minister Theo Francken told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Oct. 21.

Speaking at the European Policy Center (EPC) forum, Francken said it will give F-16s to Ukraine after it receives and commissions newer U.S.-made F-35 jets. The first three F-35s were delivered on schedule.

""Now (F-35s) have to become operational, which I think will take a year or a year and a half,"" Franken said. ""Once we have operational capability, we will be able to transfer our F-16s to Ukraine."" 

He said that the F-35 rollout process is ""a very important phase"" for the Belgian Air Force and is directly linked to the transfer of F-16s to Ukraine. 

Francken also added that Belgium is part of NATO's nuclear deterrent, so its transition to the F-35 is of strategic importance.

Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot said on Aug. 26 that the first F-16s could be delivered to Ukraine in the coming months. As of Oct. 21, Kyiv hasn't received any F-16s from Belgium.

Ukraine received its first U.S.-made fighter jets last year from Denmark and the Netherlands.

Russia is intensifying attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as international pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin begins to ease, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Oct. 21.

Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy sector in recent months, just as a cold snap drives up demand and puts additional strain on the country's power infrastructure.

""In Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts, restoration work is underway across all affected areas following Russian strikes on our energy infrastructure. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, (Russian forces) even used FPV drones to target transformers,"" Zelensky wrote on Telegram.

Zelensky added that every region has the necessary resources to restore energy infrastructure, and that special services are doing everything they can — as should diplomats and political leaders.

""Just a few weeks ago, Putin was under real pressure and facing the threat of Tomahawk missiles, and he immediately showed a willingness to return to diplomacy. But as soon as that pressure eased even slightly, the Russians began backing away from diplomacy and trying to delay dialogue,"" Zelensky said.

Less than a week ago, hopes that the U.S. would provide Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles and place real pressure on Russia were high, but were derailed by a phone call from Putin to the White House.

The U.K. is ready to deploy troops to Ukraine if U.S. President Donald Trump secures a peace deal with Russia, Sky News reported on Oct. 21, citing British Defense Secretary John Healey.

Healy gave a lecture at London's Mansion House, where he said the U.K. is prepared to spend over £100 million on a potential deployment of British troops to Ukraine.

""So, as President Trump leads the push for peace here in Europe, we are ready to lead the work to secure it in the long-term,"" Healey said.

""For our Armed Forces, I am already reviewing readiness levels and accelerating millions of pounds of funding to prepare for any possible deployment into Ukraine,"" he added.

The defense secretary's plan involves preparing military personnel to join a multinational force that would assist in securing Ukraine's borders, after a potential ceasefire.

Healey also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin considers Britain his ""number one enemy"" due to the country's support for Ukraine. Additionally, he warned of a ""new era of threat"" and mentioned that the likelihood of a broader conflict in Europe has not been this high since the end of the Second World War.

The Ukrainian parliament on Sept. 17 ratified a 100-year partnership agreement with the U.K., marking a deepening relationship between the two countries.

Russia's Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery ceased operations following a Ukrainian drone attack, Reuters reported on Oct. 20.

The Novokuibyshevsk refinery, located in Russia's Volga region, is part of Rosneft's Samara group of refineries, which also includes the Kuibyshevsk and Syzran plants.

The refinery halted primary crude processing on Oct. 19, following the second drone attack in a month, industry sources told Reuters.

Two crude distillation units — CDU-11 with a capacity of 18,900 metric tons per day and CDU-9 — were taken offline in the strikes, the sources said.

A fire at the ATAN oil depot in the village of Hvardiiske, located in Russian-occupied Crimea, reignited with increased intensity, the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported on Oct. 21.

The facility had been previously targeted by Ukraine's Special Operations Forces on Oct. 17, sparking a blaze that sent smoke billowing for dozens of kilometers.

Light smoke was still rising from the site by noon on Oct. 20, with three fire trucks actively dousing a burning tank. By the following morning, the fire had grown more intense, with a thick column of smoke visible above the facility, Crimean Wind said, citing local residents.

Residents also reported hearing air defense systems and spotting drones flying over the village on the night of Oct. 21.

It remains unclear whether the renewed fire is connected to the reported drone activity, according to Crimean Wind.

Ukrainian drones launched a ""massive air attack"" on Russia's Bryansk and Rostov oblasts overnight on Oct. 21, local authorities claimed, injuring two people and causing limited damage.

In Chernihiv Oblast,  a heat supply facility and an energy facility were damaged, Governor Viacheslav Chaus reported. ""As a result, the power supply in Chernihiv and the northern parts of the region has been cut off,"" he said.

The attacks come amid Russia's intensifying aerial campaign targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of the winter months.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

Ukrainian forces carried out a large-scale attack involving Storm Shadow missiles against Russia on Oct. 21, striking the Bryansk Chemical plant, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported. 

""A massive combined missile and air strike was carried out, including the use of air-launched Storm Shadow missiles, which successfully penetrated the Russian air defense system,"" the General Staff said. 

The operation was carried out jointly by Ukraine's Air Force in coordination with the Navy, Land Forces, and other military units. 

The attack hit the Bryansk Chemical Plant in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, the General Staff said. The consequences of the strike are still being assessed. 

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims at the time of publication. 

The Bryansk Chemical Plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel components, which Russia uses in ammunition and missiles launched against Ukraine. The General Staff described the plant as a ""key facility"" in Russia's military-industrial complex. 

The U.K. designated the Bryansk Chemical Plant in its Sept. 12 package of sanctions against Russia. The factory has also been sanctioned by the U.S. 

The plant has been targeted in previous strikes, some of which reportedly involved long-range ATACMS missiles. 

The U.K.-supplied Storm Shadow missiles have a range of between 250 and 560 kilometers (155-349 miles), depending on the version of the weapon. Equipped with advanced navigation systems, they are designed to fly close to terrain at high speeds, enhancing their effectiveness in striking critical targets.

Ukraine has previously used Storm Shadows to strike targets in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk oblasts, as well as in Russian-occupied Crimea. 

The latest strike comes the same day that President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukrainian long-range attacks on Russia ""may hold the indispensable key to peace.""

Zelensky had hoped to win a promise of long-range Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine during his Oct. 17 meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, Trump said he wanted to avoid escalation with Russia and said he planned to hold a bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

But plans for the U.S.-Russia talks fell apart, as the Kremlin refused to accept Trump's call for Kyiv and Moscow to freeze the battle lines and call a ceasefire. U.S. officials said on Oct. 21 that there were no plans for Putin and Trump to meet in the near future. 

""Russia continues to do everything to weasel out of diplomacy — and as soon as the issue of long-range capabilities for us — for Ukraine — became less immediate, Russia's interest in diplomacy faded almost automatically,"" Zelensky said on Oct. 21. 

""This signals that this very issue — the issue of our deep strike capabilities — may hold the indispensable key to peace.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also do not plan to meet in person in the near future, though they held a ""productive"" call on Oct. 20, a State Department spokesperson told the Kyiv Independent.

The Bryansk Chemical Plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel components for the Russian military. It has been sanctioned by the U.S. and U.K. 



The former head of Ukraine's state-owned grid operator Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, says his opponents were likely behind a law enforcement raid on his home on Oct. 21, in a phone call with the Kyiv Independent.



The perpetrators were allegedly planning to set fire to the Bucharest headquarters of Nova Post, Ukraine's largest private courier.

Maria Lvova-Belova openly said around 20,000 Ukrainian children have been taken by Russia,



Explosions took place at the Petrotel-Lukoil refinery in Ploiești, southern Romania, as well as at Hungary's largest oil refinery in Szazhalombatta.

The Kulevi facility, Georgia's first full-cycle oil refinery, was launched earlier this month as part of efforts to reduce dependency on fuel imports.

Russian drone attacks on a city in Chernihiv Oblast and Sumy kills at least four and injures 16 on Oct. 21, local authorities reported.

The Kyiv Independent is excited to introduce its 2025 Holiday Gift Guide — a handpicked selection of over 90 meaningful gift ideas from more than 75 Ukrainian brands. 

Tetyana Berezhna had been serving as acting minister since August and previously worked as deputy economy minister from June 2022.

""We strongly support President Trump's position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,"" a joint statement read.

Ivan Uss reportedly signed a contract with the Russian army on Jan. 17 but died just weeks into his service.

""In Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts, restoration work is underway across all affected areas following Russian strikes on our energy infrastructure. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, (Russian forces) even used FPV drones to target transformers,"" Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on Telegram.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

A 29-year-old chess grandmaster has died suddenly in what has been described as “a massive loss to the world of chess”.

Daniel Naroditsky, a child prodigy who wrote books on strategy and live-streamed his games, died on Monday, according to a statement from the Charlotte Chess Centre in North Carolina, where he trained and worked as a coach.

“The Naroditsky family shares the sad news of Daniel's unexpected passing,” a spokesman said. “Daniel was a talented chess player, educator, and beloved member of the chess community. We ask for privacy as the family grieves.”

A family statement said: “Let us remember Daniel for his passion and love for the game of chess, and for the joy and inspiration he brought to us all every day.”

“This is a massive loss for the world of chess,” Hikaru Nakamura, chess world number two, said in a social media post.

Mr Naroditsky, who regularly posted videos and livestreams of games against competitors to his 500,000 YouTube subscribers, played a “pivotal role in popularising chess content online”, the International Chess Federation said.

Following the news of his death, an X post by Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik and rumours of his feud with Naroditsky were circulated online.

“Not a doctor, but looks like something ‘very else' than sleeping pills. Hope, if any, real friends of him will care,” Mr Kramnik said, referring to a recent live-stream he had watched by Naroditsky in which the American apparently appeared “strange”.

He added: “All in all, typical [in] today's world of chess, the only thing everyone cares about is ‘looking great' and pretending there are no issues... and try helping to solve them.”

Mr Kramnik had previously accused the 29-year-old, among others, of cheating by allegedly using computer programmes that present them with the best set of options in any situation.

They have all denied the accusations.

Speaking on the C-Squared podcast, hosted by grandmasters Fabiano Caruana and Cristian Chirila, Naroditsky last year said the allegations against him had taken a deep toll.

No cause of death was given for the California-born player, who won the Under 12 world championship and spent several of his teenage years writing strategy books.

Naroditsky, who became a grandmaster at the age of 18, was always ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess. He also was highly skilled at blitz chess, where players have as little as one or three minutes to complete their games against the clock.

He won the US National Blitz Championship in August. At the time of his win, the International Chess Federation, known by its French acronym Fide, placed him 18th in the world and sixth in the US for blitz chess.

As news of death emerged, fans and fellow players posted tributes on social media.

Dutch chess grandmaster Benjamin Bok said he had known Naroditsky since they were young players.

“I still can't believe it and don't want to believe it,” Mr Bok wrote on X. “It was always a privilege to play, train, and commentate with Danya, but above all, to call him my friend.”

Nakamura said he was “devastated” by the news and described the player's death as “a massive loss for the world of chess”.

Ukrainian Oleksandr Bortnyk said: “He was a very talented chess player. But more, he was a very good guy. Very kind guy. He was a good friend.”

Naroditsky posted his final video on YouTube last Friday and titled it “You Thought I Was Gone!?”.

In it, he said he was “back, better than ever” after taking a creative break from streaming.

Neither Mr Kramnik nor the Charlotte Chess Centre responded to inquiries from The Telegraph

The Trump administration has ordered government employees not to take or share photographs of construction work happening at the White House.

Pictures of the building's East Wing being torn apart, apparently taken from the adjacent Treasury Department building, were shared online widely on Tuesday.

Footage showed an excavator ripping into the East Wing's façade, smashing the windows as work began to construct the 90,000 square foot ballroom.

After the images were shared online, staff at the Treasury Department were instructed not to share pictures of the building work.

“As construction proceeds on the White House grounds, employees should refrain from taking and sharing photographs of the grounds, to include the East Wing, without prior approval from the Office of Public Affairs,” a Treasury official said in an email to staff on Monday, according to The Wall Street Journal.

The US president previously said the ballroom's construction “won't interfere” with the East Wing.

Tree clearing and other work to prepare the site for the ballroom project started in September.

“I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House ballroom,” Mr Trump posted on his Truth Social social media platform on Monday.

He added: “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernised as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete.”

“I am honoured to be the first president to finally get this much-needed project underway,” he said.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump brushed off criticism over the demolition, saying the sound of the construction work was “music to my ears.”

“We're building a world-class ballroom. For 150 years they've wanted a ballroom,” Mr Trump told a lunch for Republican Senators at the White House as the sounds of machinery could be heard in the background.

“You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back. You hear that sound? Oh, that's music to my ears. I love that sound.”

Mr Trump, who made his fortune in construction and real-estate, added: “When I hear that sound, it reminds me of money. In this case it reminds of lack of money because I'm paying for it.”

The US president has said that he is partly funding work on the giant ballroom while private and corporate donors will cover the rest.

Karoline Leavitt, Mr Trump's press secretary, responded to critics of the project on Monday by sharing examples of former presidents' White House renovations.

Among the building work listed was Theodore Roosevelt's building of the West Wing in 1902 and Harry Truman's extensive White House renovations in 1948.

“Construction has always been a part of the evolution of the White House,” Steven Cheung, White House communications director, wrote on X.

“Losers who are quick to criticise need to stop their pearl clutching and understand the building needs to be modernised. Otherwise you're just living in the past.”

The White House has insisted that it does not need approval from the National Capital Planning Commission for the demolition, only for new construction.

The commission is responsible for approving construction and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area. Its chairman, Will Scharf, is also the White House staff secretary and a top aide to Mr Trump.

However, it has not approved the construction yet and it is unclear whether the White House has submitted the ballroom plans to the agency. The commission's offices are closed because of the US government shutdown.

Mr Trump has already carried out extensive redecoration of the White House since returning to office.

He has covered the Oval Office in gold ornaments and fittings which mimic the style of decor at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

He also paved over the grass in Jackie Kennedy's Rose Garden, saying his female guests' high heels were sinking into the lawn.

Mr Trump said he wants to create a ballroom because the largest room in the White House – the East Room – only has space for 200 people.

In July, he said building for the ballroom would “respect” the existing East Wing.

“It will be near but not touching [the East Wing] – and pays total respect to the existing building,” Mr Trump said.

The new ballroom will have space for around 1,000 and will be completed before Mr Trump's second term ends in January 2029 at an estimated cost of $200m (£150m).

Earlier this year, the US president spoke fondly of his renovation plans when he met Ursula von der Leyen, the European Council president, at his ornate Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland to hammer out details of a trade deal.

“You know, we just built this ballroom and we're building a great ballroom at the White House,” Mr Trump said.

“No president knew how to build a ballroom I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful.”

The East Wing is traditionally the base for the First Lady.

Melania Trump's staff packed their belongings and cleared their desks in September before the demolition, the New York Times reported.

A Treasury spokesman told The Telegraph: “Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details.

“Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images.”

Three decades ago, it cleared a path that led toward the likes of the DOGE wrecking crew.

The human condition includes a vast array of unavoidable misfortunes. But what about the preventable ones? Shouldn't the United States provide for the basic needs of its people?

Such questions get distinctly short shrift in the dominant political narratives. When someone can't make ends meet and suffers dire consequences, the mainstream default is to see a failing individual rather than a failing system. Even when elected leaders decry inequity, they typically do more to mystify than clarify what has caused it.

While “income inequality” is now a familiar phrase, media coverage and political rhetoric routinely disconnect victims from their victimizers. Human-interest stories and speechifying might lament or deplore common predicaments, but their storylines rarely connect the destructive effects of economic insecurity with how corporate power plunders social resources and fleeces the working class. Yet the results are extremely far-reaching.

“We have the highest rate of childhood poverty and senior poverty of any major country on earth,” Senator Bernie Sanders has pointed out. “You got half of older workers have nothing in the bank as they face retirement. You got a quarter of our seniors trying to get by on $15,000 a year or less.”

Such hardship exists in tandem with ever-greater opulence for the few, including this country's 800 billionaires. But standard white noise mostly drowns out how government policies and the overall economic system keep enriching the already rich at the expense of people with scant resources.

This year, while Donald Trump and Republican legislators have been boosting oligarchy and slashing enormous holes in the social safety net, Democratic leaders have seemed remarkably uninterested in breaking away from the policy approaches that ended up losing their party the allegiance of so many working-class voters. Those corporate-friendly approaches set the stage for Trump's faux “populism” as an imagined solution to the discontent that the corporatism of the Democrats had helped usher in.

While offering a rollback to pre-Trump-2.0 policies, the current Democratic leadership hardly conveys any orientation that could credibly relieve the economic distress of so many Americans. The party remains in a debilitating rut, refusing to truly challenge the runaway power of corporate capitalism that has caused ever-widening income inequality.

The Democratic Party establishment now denounces President Trump's vicious assaults on vital departments and social programs. Unfortunately, three decades ago it cleared a path that led toward the likes of the DOGE wrecking crew. A clarion call in that direction came from President Bill Clinton when, in his 1996 State of the Union address, he exulted that “the era of big government is over.”

Clinton followed those instantly iconic words by adding, “We cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.” Like the horse he rode into Washington — the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), which he cofounded — Clinton advocated a “third way,” distinct from both liberal Democrats and Republican conservatives. But when his speech called for “self-reliance and teamwork” — and when, on countless occasions throughout the 1990s he invoked the buzzwords “opportunity” and “responsibility” — he was firing from a New Democrat arsenal that all too sadly targeted “handouts” and “special interests” as obsolete relics of the 1930s New Deal and the 1960s Great Society.

The seminal Clintonian theme of “opportunity” — with little regard for outcome — aimed at a wide political audience. In the actual United States, however, touting opportunity as central to solving the problems of inequity obscured the huge disparities in real-life options. In theory, everyone was to have a reasonable chance; in practice, opportunity was then (and remains) badly skewed by economic status and race, beginning as early as the womb. In a society so stratified by class, “opportunity” as the holy grail of social policy ultimately leaves outcomes to the untender mercies of the market.

Two weeks before Clinton won the presidency, the newsweekly Time reported that his “economic vision” was “perhaps best described as a call for a We decade; not the old I-am-my-brother's-keeper brand of traditional Democratic liberalism.” Four weeks later, the magazine showered the president-elect with praise: “Clinton's willingness to move beyond some of the old-time Democratic religion is auspicious. He has spoken eloquently of the need to redefine liberalism: the language of entitlements and rights and special-interest demands, he says, must give way to talk of responsibilities and duties.”

Clinton and the DLC insisted that government should smooth the way for maximum participation in the business of business. While venerating the market, the New Democrats were openly antagonistic toward labor unions and those they dubbed “special interests,” such as feminists, civil-rights activists, environmentalists, and others who needed to be shunted aside to fulfill the New Democrat agenda, which included innovations like “public-private partnerships,” “empowerment zones,” and charter schools.

Taking the Government to Market

While disparaging advocates for the marginalized as impediments to winning the votes of white “moderates,” the New Democrats tightly embraced corporate America. I still have a page I tore out of Time magazine in December 1996, weeks after Clinton won reelection. The headline said: “Ex-Investment Bankers and Lawyers Form Clinton's Economic Team. Surprise! It's Pro-Wall Street.”

That was the year when Clinton and his allies achieved a longtime goal — strict time limits for poor women to receive government assistance. “From welfare to work” became a mantra. Aid to Families with Dependent Children was out and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families was in. As occurred three years earlier when he was able to push NAFTA through Congress only because of overwhelming Republican support, Democratic lawmakers were divided and Clinton came to rely on overwhelming GOP support to make “welfare reform” possible.

The welfare bill that he gleefully signed in August 1996 was the flip side of his elite economic team's priorities. The victims of “welfare reform” would soon become all too obvious, while their victimizers would remain obscured in the smoke blown by cheerleading government officials, corporate-backed think tanks, and mainstream journalists. When Clinton proclaimed that such landmark legislation marked the end of “welfare as we know it,” he was hailing the triumph of a messaging siege that had raged for decades.

Across much of the country's media spectrum, prominent pundits had long been hammering away at “entitlements,” indignantly claiming that welfare recipients, disproportionately people of color, were sponging off government largesse. The theme was a specialty of conservative columnists like Charles Krauthammer, John Leo, and George Will (who warned in November 1993 that the nation's “rising illegitimacy rate… may make America unrecognizable”). But some commentators who weren't right-wing made similar arguments, while ardently defaming the poor.

Newsweek star writer Joe Klein often accused inner-city Black people of such defects as “dependency” and “pathology.” Three months after Clinton became president, Klein wrote that “out-of-wedlock births to teenagers are at the heart of the nexus of pathologies that define the underclass.” The next year, he intensified his barrage. In August 1994, under the headline “The Problem Isn't the Absence of Jobs, But the Culture of Poverty,” he peppered his piece with phrases like “welfare dependency,” while condemning “irresponsible, antisocial behavior that has its roots in the perverse incentives of the welfare system.”

Such punditry was unconcerned with the reality that, even if they could find and retain employment while struggling to raise families, what awaited the large majority of the women being kicked off welfare were dead-end jobs at very low wages.

A Small Business Shell Game

During the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton fervently mapped out paths for poor women that would ostensibly make private enterprise the central solution to poverty. A favorite theme was the enticing (and facile) notion that people could rise above poverty by becoming entrepreneurs.

Along with many speeches by the Clintons, some federal funds were devoted to programs to help lenders offer microcredit so that low-income people could start small enterprises. Theoretically, the result would be both well-earning livelihoods and self-respect for people who had pulled themselves out of poverty. Of course, some individual success stories became grist for upbeat media features. But as the years went by, the overall picture would distinctly be one of failure.

In 2025, politicians continue to laud small business ventures as if they could somehow remedy economic ills. But such endeavors aren't likely to bring long-term financial stability, especially for people with little start-up money to begin with. Current figures indicate that one-fifth of all new small businesses fail within the first year and the closure rate only continues to climb after that. Fifty percent of small businesses fail within five years and 65 percent within 10 years.

Promoting the private sector as the solution to social inequities inevitably depletes the public sector and its capacity to effectively serve the public good. Three decades after the Clinton presidency succeeded in blinkering the Democratic vision of what economic justice might look like, the party's leaders are still restrained by assumptions that guarantee vast economic injustice — to the benefit of those with vast wealth.

“Structural problems require structural solutions,” Bernie Sanders wrote in a 2019 op-ed piece, “and promises of mere ‘access' have never guaranteed black Americans equality in this country… ‘Access' to health care is an empty promise when you can't afford high premiums, co-pays or deductibles. And an ‘opportunity' for an equal education is an opportunity in name only when you can't afford to live in a good school district or to pay college tuition. Jobs, health care, criminal justice and education are linked, and progress will not be made unless we address the economic systems that oppress Americans at their root.”

But addressing the root of economic systems that oppress Americans is exactly what the Democratic Party leadership, dependent on big corporate donors, has rigorously refused to do. Looking ahead, unless Democrats can really put up a fight against the pseudo-populism of the rapacious and fascistic Trump regime, they are unlikely to regain the support of the working-class voters who deserted them in last year's election.

During this month's federal government shutdown, Republicans were ruthlessly insistent on worsening inequalities in the name of breaking or shaking up the system. Democrats fought tenaciously to defend Obamacare and a health-care status quo that still leaves tens of millions uninsured or underinsured, while medical bills remain a common worry and many people go without the care they need.

“We must start by challenging the faith that public policy, private philanthropy, and the culture at large has placed in the market to accomplish humanitarian goals,” historian Lily Geismer has written in her insightful and deeply researched book Left Behind. “We cannot begin to seek suitable and sustainable alternatives until we understand how deep that belief runs and how detrimental its consequences are.”

The admonitions in Geismer's book, published three years ago, cogently apply to the present and future. “The best way to solve the vexing problems of poverty, racism, and disinvestment is not by providing market-based microsolutions,” she pointed out. “Macroproblems need macrosolutions. It is time to stop trying to make the market do good. It is time to stop trying to fuse the functions of the federal government with the private sector… It is the government that should be providing well-paying jobs, quality schools, universal childcare and health care, affordable housing, and protections against surveillance and brutality from law enforcement.”

Although such policies now seem a long way off, clearly articulating the goals is a crucial part of the struggle to achieve them. Those who suffer from the economic power structure are victims of a massively cruel system, being made steadily crueler by the presidency of Donald Trump. But progress is possible with clarity about how the system truly works and the victimizers who benefit from it.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Making such a purchase amid a government shutdown is “completely vile,” one Democrat said.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

The Department of Homeland Security has signed a $172 million contract to buy two top-of-the-line private jets for use by Secretary Kristi Noem and other leaders, reports say, amid a lengthy government shutdown threatening crucial services for everyday Americans.

The purchase is for two Gulfstream G700 jets, which are advertised by the company as planes with the “most spacious cabin in the industry,” the New York Times reported. A record of the sale, by the Coast Guard, was posted on the government's federal procurement website on Friday.

The Washington Post also reported on the sale, but cited documents saying that the sale totalled $200 million.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

The jets are slated to be used by Noem, who has faced scrutiny for her frequent use of Coast Guard resources, and other top DHS officials, the agency said in a statement on the purchase. 

“These aircraft are required to provide official travel for the secretary of homeland security, deputy secretary homeland security, commandant of the Coast Guard, vice commandant and Atlantic and Pacific commanders as specified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Department of Homeland Security policy,” the agency wrote.

However, in a post on X, the agency said that the Times's headline was false, contradicting its own statement. 

“More LIES from the failing @nytimes! These government planes are for the brave men and women of the @USCG. The NYT wants our leaders to be incapable of responding to national emergencies while in the air, leaving DHS to be without leadership anytime the secretary is airborne,” DHS's account wrote.

Democrats have sharply criticized the purchase, which comes amid one of the longest government shutdowns in history, which has left thousands of federal employees in limbo and is threatening to take away food benefits for millions of women and children. 

Two House Democrats have requested more information on the purchase in a letter, and Rep. Bennie Thompson (Mississippi), the top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security said the purchase is “wholly inappropriate” and “completely vile” amid the shutdown.

“Such spending is blatantly immoral — and probably illegal — and Congress must investigate,” Thompson said.

Washington Republicans want to spend $0 on making health care affordable, but they support:– $200M for Trump's ballroom– $172M for Kristi Noem's private jet– $51M in taxpayer-funded political ads– $10M to promote Trump's Scotland golf course

Because Noem has reportedly implemented a much criticized policy that she must personally approve any purchase, contract, or grant over $100,000, Noem has presumably personally signed off on the jet purchase.

It's unclear where the funds for the jets came from. In Republicans' budget bill earlier this year, $50 million was appropriated for a new jet for the Coast Guard for Noem's personal use. Noem defended the purchase in a press conference on Monday, saying that it was paid for by the appropriated funds in the budget bill. However, the updated purchase well exceeds that figure. 

The department has said that the purchase is necessary to ensure equipment is up-to-date, but the Coast Guard has a wide variety of equipment not related to Noem's travel that needs replacing, as critics have noted. The secretary is frequently criticized for her frequent travel to other countries for photo ops. She has also faced scrutiny for reports that she is living rent-free in a large, waterfront home that's typically not used by the homeland security secretary, but rather by the Coast Guard's top admiral. Typically, if Cabinet secretaries live in military housing, they pay rent, reports say.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

            President Donald Trump is leaning on a new appeals court ruling that endorsed his deployment of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, as he urges the Supreme Court to let his administration carry out a similar effort in Chicago.
    


            Describing those protesting the administration in Chicago as “rioters” who are leading a “violent resistance,” the Trump administration told the justices Tuesday that its decision to deploy the National Guard is unreviewable by courts or – at the very least – is entitled to great deference.
    


            “If the president's determination is reviewable at all, such review must be extremely deferential,” the administration told the Supreme Court, pointing to recent decisions from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals that endorsed “the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland to address similar violent resistance to federal immigration enforcement.”
    


            In one of the most significant emergency cases involving the second Trump administration to reach the Supreme Court so far, the justices are reviewing whether lower federal courts were correct to block Trump from deploying hundreds of guard members to an ICE facility in Chicago's suburbs.
    


            The Supreme Court is likely to hand down a decision in the Chicago case quickly, potentially within a few days.
    


            Trump's broader campaign to deploy the guard on US soil was buoyed this week when a divided three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit said the president was entitled to deference when making decisions about when such deployments are necessary.
    


            The full 9th Circuit is weighing whether to reconsider that decision.
    


            Though the case before the Supreme Court is focused on Chicago, the decision will almost certainly spill over into other litigation playing out as Trump seeks to send the National Guard to multiple US cities. In its latest filing, the Department of Justice framed Trump's decision to send the Guard into Illinois as a response to what it described as a broader national threat.
    


            “As the Ninth Circuit recognized, ‘the president can, and should, consider the totality of the circumstances,' and it is error for courts to ‘discount evidence they deem less relevant,'” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court. “That is especially so where, as here, the events in Chicago are not occurring in a vacuum, as violent riots have occurred in Los Angeles and Portland, a shooter tried to murder federal agents in Dallas, and Mexican cartels are offering bounties on DHS personnel.”
    


            The states fighting Trump have scoffed at the idea that protests merit sending in the troops. When she temporarily blocked the deployment in Illinois earlier this month, US District Court Judge April Perry disputed the administration's description of what has been happening on the ground at the ICE facility in Broadview. Perry, nominated by former President Joe Biden, pointed to what she described as a “troubling trend” of the administration of “equating protests with riots.”
    


            The Chicago-based 7th Circuit largely upheld Perry's temporary order.
    


            To make its case for the deployments, the Department of Justice has relied on a Supreme Court decision from 1827 – Martin v. Mott. The case dealt with Jacob Mott, a member of the New York militia who disobeyed President James Madison's order to mobilize during the War of 1812. The Supreme Court rejected Mott's argument that Madison had misjudged the danger and wrote that “the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen belongs exclusively to the president.”
    


            Chicago officials have balked at the notion that the protests against ICE agents are akin to an invading foreign army.
    


            “State and local law enforcement officers have handled isolated protest activities in Illinois, and there is no credible evidence to the contrary,” Illinois officials told the Supreme Court in their own set of written arguments this week.
    


            “The War of 1812,” they wrote, “entailed ‘vastly different' facts than the record below.”

            The federal government shutdown is now the second-longest in history. We're on Day 21, and if it lingers into early November, Congress could surpass the current record of 35 days – from, as it happens, the first Trump administration.
    


            Who knows if we'll get there. There is a premium in these debates on appearing resolute. That means neither side telegraphs that it might fold – right up until the moment one does.
    


            But there are also a number of dynamics pushing us toward an especially prolonged shutdown right now.
    


            And at the top of that list is the blame game, where we're in uncharted territory.
    


            But plainly: History suggests it's Democrats who would eventually back down. But they seem to have relatively little reason to do so right now.
    


            Generally speaking, it's the side that made extraneous policy demands that loses politically in shutdowns. In this case, that's the Democrats, who are demanding an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. People overwhelmingly say they don't like using shutdowns as leverage – by massive margins, in fact.
    


            But public opinion on this shutdown hasn't gone that way.
    


            President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Democrats were “getting killed in the polls.”
    


            “The public understands what they're doing; they're doing the wrong thing,” Trump added.
    


            This does not appear at all accurate.
    


            In fact, every quality public poll has shown Trump and Republicans continue to shoulder more blame than Democrats.
    


            In a Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted October 15-20, Americans blamed congressional Republicans more than Democrats, 50%-43%.
    


            The gap was larger in a CNBC poll conducted October 8-12. It showed Americans blamed Trump and the Republicans over Democrats, 53%-37%. (Independents blamed Trump by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, 58%-21%.)
    


            Before the shutdown started, polls showed the blame game favoring Democrats by between 7 and 11 points. Polling since it started has shown it favoring Democrats by between 7and 17 points.
    


            The other longest shutdowns on record were in 1995-96 (21 days) and 2018-19 (35 days), both of which involved Republicans making the policy demand.
    


            In both cases, the blame game was against the GOP from the start and seemed to get worse as things dragged on.
    


            In 1995-96, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll before the shutdown showed people were prepared to blame Republicans by 11 points. Polling after the shutdown began showed the GOP getting blamed by more than 20 points.
    


            In 2018-19, pre-shutdown polling showed Americans were predisposed to blame Trump and the Republicans by 14-15 points. Most quality polls after it began showed Americans blaming the GOP by 20 or more points.
    


            In both cases, the GOP was arguably fighting a losing battle before things even got started, and then it became clear they weren't winning either politically or policy-wise. So they gave up.
    


            That's been flipped on its head now.
    


            A big reason appears to be that what Democrats are demanding is actually popular – unlike, for instance, the GOP's demand of building Trump's border wall in 2018-2019. The new Reuters-Ipsos poll shows 72% of Americans and even 51% of Republicans want health care subsidies to be extended. Those numbers have also been consistent.
    


            The question is whether Americans believe the policy goal that they very much want is worth continuing the shutdown.
    


            That could be a tougher ask, especially as some key impacts of the shutdown set in. Federal employees will miss their first full paycheck later this week, for example. Small business loans will be held up. Aid to low-income Americans like food stamps could soon be halted.
    


            But the looming impacts cut both ways. November 1 is as an especially important deadline for Democrats' policy demand. It's when open enrollment for the Obamacare plans begins.
    


            At that point, many Americans would begin to see the significantly higher premiums caused by letting the subsidies lapse – in most cases doubling or close to doubling, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.
    


            There is a school of thought that Democrats could give up at that point, believing they had forced Republicans to own the premium hikes and that they had cast a spotlight on the fact that the GOP stood in the way of renewing them.
    


            But if you're a Democrat and you're looking at these polls, you have to be intrigued by the possibility of holding out. What if Republicans really get scared about owning those premium hikes – like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and even Trump's own pollster have warned them – and suddenly feel compelled to come to the table?
    


            Democrats haven't had many wins since the November election, and this situation presents at least the possibility of a very significant one.
    


            Perhaps as significantly, how would a Democratic base that has sharply criticized their party's leaders for their lack of fight react to their side throwing in the towel when it looked like they were on the winning side of the issue?
    


            Plenty will play out over the next 10 days. But the plot is significantly thicker than in past shutdowns.

            Elon Musk lashed out at Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a series of insulting posts on his social media platform X on Tuesday, after Duffy suggested NASA may sideline SpaceX from its moon mission.
    


            Musk, SpaceX's CEO, called Duffy “Sean Dummy,” accused him of having a “2 digit IQ” and posted sophomoric memes aimed at Duffy.
    


            “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America's space program?” Musk asked in a post Tuesday morning, which he pinned to his X profile. (Duffy, a former member of Congress, is a world champion lumberjack speed climber.)
    


            On Monday, Duffy said in an interview with CNBC that he believes SpaceX, which has a $2.9 billion contract to provide the lunar lander astronauts would ride to the moon's surface, is lagging behind schedule, potentially thwarting NASA's efforts to return humans to the moon before China amid a new space race.
    


            “So, I'm going to open up the contract. I'm going to let other space companies compete with SpaceX,” he said.
    


            “They do remarkable things,” Duffy told Fox News about SpaceX on Monday, “but they're behind schedule.” NASA's pivotal moon-landing mission, called Artemis III, is planned for as soon as mid-2027.
    


            Musk spent Tuesday morning posting about how SpaceX is “the only company to successfully human-certify a new orbital space vehicle in the US” and resposting criticisms of Duffy.
    


            Musk also responded to reporting from the Wall Street Journal that Musk ally Jared Isaacman may be back in the running to lead the agency, as Duffy jockeys to fold NASA completely under the Transportation Department. Trump had pulled Isaacman's nomination for NASA administrator earlier this year – the same week Musk departed his role in Washington. Though Trump cited Isaacman's “prior associations” as the reason for pulling the nomination, CNN previously reported that a faction of people in Trump's inner circle advocated against Isaacman after Musk left Washington and shortly before Musk's very public falling out with the President.
    


            But Isaacman — who has twice flown to orbit on SpaceX capsules he commissioned — has reportedly been back in the running, and a source familiar with the matter confirmed he has met with Trump.
    


            “Sean Dummy is trying to kill NASA!” Musk posted on Tuesday, as well as reposting others' praise for Isaacman.
    


            Isaacman told CNN he has “never expressed confidence about renomination at any point” and that he has “a lot of respect for Secretary Duffy and I have always enjoyed the time I've spent with him.”
    


            “I'm grateful to all the supporters and to President Trump for the consideration, and most of all, I just wish to see NASA continue to shine as the world's most accomplished space agency,” he added.
    


            In a statement, a spokesperson for Duffy said that the transportation secretary “never said he wants to keep the (NASA) job himself.”
    


            The spokesperson added that Duffy has suggested NASA “might benefit from being part of the Cabinet, maybe even within the Department of Transportation,” but reiterated he has not said he would like to become NASA's permanent leader.
    


            “The President asked him to talk with potential candidates for Administrator, and he's been happy to help by vetting people and giving his honest feedback,” the spokesperson said. “The bottom line is that Secretary Duffy is here to serve the President, and he will support whomever the President nominates.”

            President Donald Trump has made a series of inaccurate claims in recent days about the Insurrection Act, the old law he has mused about invoking to deploy troops to some US cities.
    


            The law – more precisely described as a collection of related laws from the 18th and 19th centuries – grants presidents sweeping authority to deploy both active-duty and National Guard troops to states, if certain vague conditions are met, and to have them perform the domestic law enforcement from which the military is normally prohibited.
    


            The White House did not respond to questions about Trump's inaccurate assertions. Below is a more detailed fact check.
    


            Trump has criticized the lawsuits that have followed his decisions to deploy National Guard troops to cities like Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, Memphis and Washington, DC, using legislation that is narrower than the Insurrection Act. After mentioning the Insurrection Act, Trump told reporters Sunday: “I could use that, and everybody agrees you're allowed to use that, and there's no more court cases, there's no more anything. We're trying to do it in a nicer manner, but we can always use the Insurrection Act if we want.”
    


            But it's “categorically false” that there couldn't be any court cases regarding a Trump invocation of the Insurrection Act, William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor, said in an interview.
    


            Trump could have fairly said that he would probably start with the upper hand in a future lawsuit challenging his invocation of the act. Banks said the act gives the president “tremendous discretion” and that it is “very heavily weighted on his side.” But it's “of course not true,” Banks said, “to say a court wouldn't review what he's done”; the courts would consider lawsuits over whether there have been violations of the law's own requirements or violations of the Constitution.
    


            Harvard University law professor Jack Goldsmith wrote in an article this month: “To be sure, every single word of the Insurrection Act will be intensely contested in court should the president invoke it. And given the administration's tendency to blunder, to bully, to overstep, and to develop factual predicates inadequately, not to mention the president's always-legally-unhelpful social media activity, litigation might be tough and victory for the administration in every instance cannot be assumed. My point is that if the easy-to-meet statutory predicates are satisfied, and with decently competent lawyering, courts will not be able to stop the president from a very robust lawful domestic use of the military under the Insurrection Act, should President Trump choose to go there.”
    


            As Banks and Goldsmith pointed out, the text of the Insurrection Act is very broad. It says the president can deploy troops to states “whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.” It also says the president can deploy troops to suppress “any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy” if such a situation hinders the execution of laws enough that any part of the public in a state is deprived of a constitutional right and the state has failed to protect that right.
    


            Brennan Center counsel Joseph Nunn noted in an article that the Supreme Court ruled in 1827 that the president alone had the authority to decide what constitutes a situation that required the domestic deployment of “the militia.” But there is an active debate among scholars about how cleanly that 1827 precedent applies to the current situation under Trump, and Nunn wrote that “in subsequent cases, the Supreme Court has suggested that courts may step in if the president acts in bad faith, exceeds ‘a permitted range of honest judgment,' makes an obvious mistake, or acts in a way manifestly unauthorized by law.” He also noted that the Supreme Court has clarified that the courts can review “the lawfulness of the military's actions once deployed.”
    


Stephen Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor and CNN legal analyst, said in an email that a late-1700s precursor to the act “required the President to get judicial approval in advance before he could call out the militia to help execute federal law,” as George Washington then did before quashing a violent tax rebellion in 1794. While this pre-approval requirement no longer exists, Vladeck said, “Given the extent to which this country was founded on outrage over King George's use of the military as a tool to oppress the populace, the idea that Congress would ever, or did, give the president unreviewable power to deploy troops domestically whenever he wants is, for lack of a better word, bollocks.”
    


            Trump told reporters Sunday: “You take a look in the past, some – one in particular president used it 28 times during the course of a presidency.”
    


            That figure is nowhere close to accurate.
    


            The Brennan Center found that Grant was the president who most frequently invoked the act. He invoked it on six occasions in the 1870s amid the White supremacist violence and political upheaval that followed the Civil War.
    


            Three other presidents each invoked the Act on three occasions, according to the Brennan Center: Grover Cleveland in the 1880s and John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.
    


            For example, Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act in 1963 when Alabama Gov. George Wallace attempted to defy desegregation by physically blocking Black students from entering the University of Alabama and again later that year when Wallace tried to use the state National Guard to stop Black students from entering public schools.
    


            Johnson invoked the act in 1965 to protect a civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama after marchers were attacked by law enforcement during a previous attempt. Johnson invoked the act again to deal with riots in Detroit in 1967 and in Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, DC, following the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.
    


            Trump told reporters October 13 that “50% of the presidents have used the Insurrection (Act).” He said in an interview recorded Thursday that “50% of the presidents, almost, have used that,” then told reporters Sunday that “like 50% of the presidents have used the Insurrection Act.”
    


            But Trump's “50%” number is at least somewhat too large even with the “like” and “almost” modifiers, and it's plain wrong without those words attached. The Brennan Center found that 17 of 45 presidents, or about 38%, have invoked the Act or its precursor laws.
    


            It's also worth noting some pertinent context Trump hasn't mentioned.
    


            Of the 30 occasions on which presidents invoked the act, 19 came more than 100 years ago, according to the Brennan Center research. No president has invoked the Act since George H.W. Bush in 1992 (following the eruption of riots in Los Angeles after the police beating of Black motorist Rodney King). And though the act gives presidents the right to deploy troops over opposition from states, the president's decision to invoke the act was backed by state leaders on the vast majority of the occasions.
    


            “There are only a handful of examples, across American history, of presidents using the Act in the face of local opposition – and those have invariably involved contexts in which either everyone agreed as to the threat (e.g., the British invasion during the War of 1812), or where the state was itself violating federal law (e.g., Little Rock),” Vladeck said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Tropical Storm Melissa is expected to become a hurricane. Its track is unclear, but it's bringing a dangerous threat","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/21/weather/tropical-storm-melissa-forecast-track-path-climate","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 15:02:53 GMT","


            Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean Sea, proving this year's Atlantic hurricane season won't be wrapping up quietly.
    


            The storm could slam the northern Caribbean with pouring rain and strong winds as it strengthens over extremely warm water this week. Melissa's worst impacts could center on Hispaniola, where significant flooding and dangerous mudslides are possible for parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti through the weekend.
    


            Melissa was churning about 300 miles south of Haiti with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center.
    


            The storm is expected to hit hurricane status by Saturday, according to the center, but it's still tough to pin down exactly how strong it will become from there.
    


            A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Haiti and a tropical storm watch is in effect for Jamaica.
    


            There's a low, but non-zero chance Melissa directly impacts the mainland United States, though details are still coming into focus. Puerto Rico is much more likely to experience some of the storm's rain.
    


            Here's what we know so far.
    


            Melissa's exact track is still tricky to pin down, but there are two main scenarios forecasters have been monitoring for days. The one looking most likely at this point could spell disaster for parts of Hispaniola; the other could eventually take Melissa close to Central America.
    


            Both involve Melissa first loitering out over the Caribbean Sea for multiple days this week, churning up seas and bringing nasty weather to islands within the storm's reach.
    


            From there, Melissa could take a turn to the north by late week and potentially move close to Hispaniola through the weekend, strengthening into a Category 1 hurricane by Saturday morning. This is the scenario the hurricane center's track for the system reflects.
    


            Melissa is the 13th named storm of the season but is the first to churn in the Caribbean Sea. The lack of storms allowed the Caribbean to become so extremely warm that its water is now basically rocket fuel for storms.
    


            If Melissa taps into that energy, it could explode in strength – something that's happening more often as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. Just this year, three of the four Atlantic hurricanes to date underwent extreme rapid intensification: Erin, Gabrielle and Humberto.
    


            Melissa could bring more than a foot of rain to parts of Hispaniola. It's still unclear exactly what parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti would be subject to the heaviest rain, but the combination of torrential rain and mountainous terrain is a recipe for dangerous flash flooding and mudslides.
    


            Melissa could also deliver a considerable amount of rain to Jamaica and Puerto Rico in this scenario, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.
    


            Alternately, there's still a chance that Melissa misses its window to take a northward turn and instead just creeps west over the Caribbean until it nears Central America — potentially Nicaragua or Honduras — next week. It could make landfall there or take a very late turn to the north and head for Cuba.
    


            The northern Caribbean would likely still receive a few days of wet and windy weather in this scenario, but rainfall totals would be lower, as would the flood risk, with Melissa moving steadily west.
    


            It's unlikely — though not entirely impossible — Melissa will deliver a direct hit to the mainland US. At this time, the storm's most likely impact to the US could be in the form of some rough surf and rip currents along the East Coast next week.
    


            Florida could be in play if Melissa remains a weaker storm for longer and takes a turn to the north later than currently expected. In that case, Cuba and parts of the Bahamas could also be hit with Melissa's wind and rain.
    


            The odds of a hurricane landfall in the US really dwindle at the end of October and into November, but there have been notable late-season exceptions. Most recently, Hurricane Nicole slammed into Florida as a Category 1 in early November 2022 and Hurricane Zeta smashed into Louisiana as a Category 3 in late October 2020.
    


            As Melissa continues to develop in the coming days, its track, strength and threats will come into sharper focus.
    


            Atlantic hurricane season officially ends on November 30, though tropical systems can still form after that date.
    


There's a new world order in the Atlantic Ocean, and Hurricane Erin gave us a frightening peek

A United Airlines plane appears to have collided with a weather balloon while cruising over Utah at 36,000 feet last week, fracturing layers of its windshield and forcing an emergency landing.

A California company called Windborne Systems said it started looking into the situation Sunday, not long after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating. Windborne quickly concluded that the Boeing 737 Max very likely ran into one of its balloons, despite the company's best efforts to prevent such collisions.

The plane, which was flying from Denver to Los Angeles, did not lose cabin pressure and landed safely in Salt Lake City last Thursday. United said 134 passengers and six crew members were aboard.

Windborne CEO John Dean said he was surprised at the extent of the damage to the plane's windshield because Windborne's balloons weigh only 2.4 pounds at takeoff with a simple bag of sand serving as ballast. The impact sent fragments of glass flying in the cockpit. 

The company said it follows all Federal Aviation Administration rules for the size and design of its balloons that gather data to help improve weather forecasts.

“I find this extremely concerning, and unacceptable in the case of a collision, regardless of what the official regulations are, It resulted in injury to a pilot, which I'm simply not okay with whatsoever,” Dean said in a post on X.

The airline referred questions to the NTSB, which isn't responding during the current government shutdown. The NTSB statement didn't mention any injuries.




Dean said in an email Tuesday that data about the location of the flight lined up closely with the last known location and altitude of one of the company's balloons before it stopped transmitting right around the reported time of the collision. Windborne forwarded all of its data to the NTSB, which will ultimately determine what happened.

Windborne has launched more than 4,000 balloons, and the company said it coordinates with the FAA each time, filing notices for pilots and sharing live updates on balloon positions with the FAA.

The company said it has already tweaked the software for its balloons to minimize the time they spend between 30,000 feet and 40,000 feet. It's also looking at different ballast designs to reduce the force of any future collisions and minimize the potential for damage or injuries.

NTSB investigators will release a preliminary report in a few weeks, but the full report might not come for more than a year.

NEW YORK (AP) — A former Amazon delivery driver has filed a lawsuit accusing a federal civil right agency of abruptly and unlawfully abandoning her sex discrimination case and others like it following an executive order from President Donald Trump.

The lawsuit filed by the former Colorado driver demands that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission resume investigating her claims that Amazon discriminates against female drivers by failing to provide adequate bathroom breaks. 

The lawsuit is the latest example of workers and others scrambling to find recourse as federal agencies abandon their cases in response to Trump's shake-up of the country's civil rights enforcement infrastructure. 

The EEOC, which enforces civil rights laws in the workplace, decided last month to discharge any complaints based on “disparate impact liability,” which holds that policies that are neutral on their face can be discriminatory if they impose unnecessary barriers that disadvantage different demographic groups. 

The EEOC's decision came in response to an executive order in April directing federal agencies to deprioritize the use of disparate impact liability. The Trump administration argues that disparate impact assumes any racial or gender imbalance in workplaces is the result of discrimination and leads to practices that undermine meritocracy.

The former driver, Leah Cross, filed a motion Tuesday asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to stay the EEOC's new rule prohibiting investigations and enjoin the agency from enforcing it.




The EEOC has already dropped its sole lawsuit arising from a disparate impact liability charge, a case alleging that the Sheetz convenience store chain's background check practices discriminated against Black, Native American and multiracial job applicants. 

Separately, the agency has dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers and subjected new complaints to a higher level of scrutiny, following Trump's executive order declaring that the government would only recognize two unchangeable sexes.

It's unclear how many worker complaints involving disparate impact liability or LGBTQ+ workers have been sidelined by the EEOC. In her lawsuit, Cross demanded that the EEOC, which handled more than 88,000 discrimination charges in 2024, give the court a list of the disparate impact liability charges it has shut down. 

The EEOC referred questions about the lawsuit to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment.

Cross, who worked as a driver from August to November 2022, filed her EEOC charge two years ago, arguing that the company's delivery schedules make it nearly impossible for drivers to find time to use bathrooms. An EEOC investigator told her lawyers last month it was closing her case because of the disparate impact rule, according to the lawsuit.

Amazon declined to comment on Cross' case but referred The AP to its policies around its drivers, who deliver packages in Amazon-branded vehicles but work indirectly for the company through third-party companies called Delivery Service Partners. Amazon says its technology builds routes that ensure time for two 15-minute rest breaks and a 30-minute meal break. The company also said its Amazon Delivery app provides a list for drivers to see nearby restroom facilities and gas stations.

But in an interview with The AP, Cross said it was so hard for to her stop for breaks that she had to pack a Shewee — a portable urination device for women — as well as a change of pants “in case I ended up accidentally urinating on myself.”

Cross' lawsuit against the EEOC argues that the agency is legally obligated to investigate all charges based on disparate impact liability, which Congress codified in the 1991 Civil Rights Act.

The EEOC “isn't allowed to throw away an entire category of charges without looking into their facts just because the president doesn't like the type of discrimination those charges are based on,” said Karla Gilbride, an attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit.

Gilbride was the EEOC's general counsel until she was fired in January along with two Democratic commissioners in a purge that cleared the way for the Trump administration to root out diversity and inclusion programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and elevate religious rights. ________

WASHINGTON (AP) — A man whose convictions for storming the U.S. Capitol were erased by President Donald Trump's mass pardons has been arrested on a charge that he threatened to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Christopher P. Moynihan is accused of sending a text message on Friday noting that Jeffries, a New York Democrat, would be making a speech in New York City this week.

“I cannot allow this terrorist to live,” Moynihan wrote, according to a report by a state police investigator. Moynihan also wrote that Jeffries “must be eliminated” and texted, “I will kill him for the future,” the police report says.

Moynihan, of Clinton, New York, is charged with a felony count of making a terroristic threat. It was unclear if he had an attorney representing him in the case, and efforts to contact him and his parents by email and phone were unsuccessful.

AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on a threat on a prominent Democrats life.

Moynihan who's 34, was sentenced to 21 months in prison for joining a mob's Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. In January, he was among hundreds of convicted Capitol rioters who received a pardon from Trump on the Republican president's first day back in the White House.

Jeffries thanked investigators “for their swift and decisive action to apprehend a dangerous individual who made a credible death threat against me with every intention to carry it out.”

“Unfortunately, our brave men and women in law enforcement are being forced to spend their time keeping our communities safe from these violent individuals who should never have been pardoned,” Jeffries said in a statement.




House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about the case during a news conference on Tuesday and said he did not know any details of the threat against Jeffries.

“We denounce violence from anybody, anytime. Those people should be arrested and tried,” said Johnson, a Louisiana Republican.

The New York State Police said it was notified of the threat by an FBI task force on Saturday. Moynihan was arraigned Sunday in a local court in New York's Dutchess County. He is due back in the Town of Clinton Court on Thursday.

Dutchess County District Attorney Anthony Parisi said his office is reviewing the case “for legal and factual sufficiency.”

“Threats made against elected officials and members of the public will not be tolerated,” Parisi said in a statement Tuesday.

Moynihan's arrest was first reported by CBS News. 

On Jan. 6, Moynihan breached police barricades before entering the Capitol through the Rotunda Door. He entered the Senate chamber, rifled through a notebook on a senator's desk and joined other rioters in shouting and chanting at the Senate dais, prosecutors said.

“Moynihan did not leave the Senate Chamber until he was forced out by police,” they wrote.

In 2022, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper convicted Moynihan of a felony for obstructing the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Moynihan also pleaded guilty to five other riot-related counts.

OpenAI said Tuesday it is introducing its own web browser, Atlas, putting the ChatGPT maker in direct competition with Google as more internet users rely on artificial intelligence to answer their questions.

Making its popular AI chatbot a gateway to online searches could allow OpenAI, the world's most valuable startup, to pull in more internet traffic and the revenue made from digital advertising. It could also further cut off the lifeblood of online publishers if ChatGPT so effectively feeds people summarized information that they stop exploring the internet and clicking on traditional web links.

OpenAI has said ChatGPT already has more than 800 million users but many of them get it for free. The San Francisco-based company also sells paid subscriptions but is losing more money than it makes and has been looking for ways to turn a profit.

OpenAI said Atlas launches Tuesday on Apple laptops and will later come to Microsoft's Windows, Apple's iOS phone operating system and Google's Android phone system.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a “rare, once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about and how to use one.”

But analyst Paddy Harrington of market research group Forrester said it will be a big challenge “competing with a giant who has ridiculous market share.” 

OpenAI's browser is coming out just a few months after one of its executives testified that the company would be interested in buying Google's industry-leading Chrome browser if a federal judge had required it to be sold to prevent the abuses that resulted in Google's ubiquitous search engine being declared an illegal monopoly.




But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last month issued a decision that rejected the Chrome sale sought by the U.S. Justice Department in the monopoly case, partly because he believed advances in the AI industry already are reshaping the competitive landscape.

OpenAI's browser will face a daunting challenge against Chrome, which has amassed about 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features from Google's Gemini technology.

Chrome's immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft's Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat.

But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market. Microsoft ended up abandoning Explorer and introducing its Edge browser, which operates similarly to Chrome and holds a distant third place in market share behind Apple's Safari.

Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup.

Altman said he expects a chatbot interface to replace a traditional browser's URL bar as the center of how he hopes people will use the internet in the future.

“Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,” he said on a video presentation aired Tuesday.

A premium feature of the ChatGPT Atlas browser is an “agent mode” that accesses the laptop and effectively clicks around the internet on the person's behalf, armed with a users' browser history and what they are seeking to learn and explaining its process as it searches.

“It's using the internet for you,” Altman said.

Harrington, the Forrester analyst, says another way of thinking about that is it's “taking personality away from you.”

“Your profile will be personally attuned to you based on all the information sucked up about you. OK, scary,” Harrington said. “But is it really you, really what you're thinking, or what that engine decides it's going to do? ... And will it add in preferred solutions based on ads?” 

About 60% of Americans overall — and 74% of those under 30 — use AI to find information at least some of the time, making online searches one of the most popular uses of AI technology, according to findings from an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll taken over the summer.

Google since last year has automatically provided AI-generated responses that attempt to answer a person's search query, appearing at the top of results.

But the reliance on AI chatbots to summarize information they collect online has raised a number of concerns, including the technology's propensity to confidently spout false information, a problem known as hallucination.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's pick to lead an office charged with protecting federal whistleblowers appeared to be in jeopardy on Tuesday after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he hoped the White House would withdraw the nomination.

The growing opposition to Paul Ingrassia comes after a Politico report of a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell.” Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having “a Nazi streak” at times.

“He's not going to pass,” Thune told reporters.

Two Republicans who serve on the committee with jurisdiction over the nomination for the Office of Special Counsel job, Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said they do not support Ingrassia's confirmation.

“I'm a no. It never should have got this far,” Johnson said Tuesday. “They ought to pull the nomination.”

Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump's nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support.

Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump's first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist's modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters. And last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report.




According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that “MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his ‘holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.” Politico also spoke to Ingrassia's lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Ingrassia's texts, if authentic, were “foul and disqualifying” He said Trump should pull the nomination of Ingrassia, who works as the White House liaison for Homeland Security.

“He should be fired from his current job within the administration,” Schumer said after reading some of the text messages on the Senate floor. “And he should never hold a position of leadership within the Republican Party or the government ever again.”

The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is scheduled to hear from Ingrassia on Thursday. It was unclear if anything on that front has changed with the panel's chairman, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., saying “we're going to know more on Thursday.”

The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It's also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers.

The office, now under the leadership of acting Director Jamieson Greer, confirmed in August that it was investigating former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith on allegations his investigation into Trump constituted political activity. Smith's lawyers have said the investigation was “wholly without merit,” based on an “imaginary and unfounded” premise.

In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a “highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.”

Ingrassia briefly served in the White House liaison position at the Justice Department. He's also a former right-wing podcast host who promoted the false claim that the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was rigged.

A California mayor's home was struck by gunfire over the weekend during a nearby shooting that police believe was gang-related, according to Stockton Mayor Christina Fugazi's office.

Authorities told Fox News Digital it does not appear to be a targeted or politically motivated incident.

A spokesperson for the Stockton Police Department said officers responded just before 2 a.m. on Oct. 18 after reports of gunfire in the area. A 17-year-old and an 18-year-old were both found to have non-life-threatening gunshot wounds. Detectives later determined that a bullet from the same shooting hit a nearby home, identified as the mayor's residence.

Police also confirmed that no arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation.

Fugazi said her family was unharmed, though the discovery was alarming.

""This could have killed somebody in my household, even myself,"" Fugazi told KCRA.

She told the outlet that at first she thought the sounds were fireworks.

""We heard the pop pop pop pop pop, and we thought it was fireworks at first,"" she said. ""It wasn't until I got the notification from the police department that, no, indeed, it was a shooting.""

Physical evidence confirmed the gunfire.

""We saw the hole in the window,"" Fugazi said. ""Then later on, we also found a number of shell casings.""

In a written statement, Fugazi thanked the Stockton Police Department for its quick response.

""First, I want to thank the men and women of the Stockton Police Department for their swift response and diligent work apprehending one of the suspects,"" she said. ""Their dedication to protecting and serving the people of Stockton is a major reason we've seen significant reductions in crime this year.""

Fugazi noted that Stockton has seen nearly a 50% drop in crime this year, crediting the Police Department, the Office of Violence Prevention and city leadership for the progress.

""I never thought that there would be a bullet, a random bullet coming into my house, into the bedroom,"" she said. ""This shooting is a reminder that none of us are immune from the impacts of crime, regardless of our position or title. This incident only strengthens my commitment to ensuring every neighborhood in Stockton is safe and livable for all our residents.""

Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss the ongoing government shutdown and his take on Operation Arctic Frost that reportedly targeted Republican lawmakers' phone records.

The top congressional Democrats want a meeting with President Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretches on.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that both he and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., reached out to Trump on Tuesday to set up a confab with the president.

The top Senate Democrat said the duo ""urged"" Trump to meet with them, and that they were open to setting up ""an appointment with him any time, any place.""

SENATE DEMS EMBOLDENED BY WEEKEND RALLIES BLOCK GOP PLAN TO END SHUTDOWN FOR 11TH TIME

""Hakeem and I reached out to the president today and urged him to sit down and negotiate with us to resolve the healthcare crisis, address it and end the Trump shutdown,"" Schumer said. ""He should sit — the things get worse every day for the American people. He should sit down with us, negotiate in a serious way before he goes away.""

Congressional Democrats, particularly Schumer and his Democratic caucus, have remained steadfast in their demands for an extension to expiring Obamacare subsidies. Though Senate Republicans have been open to holding a vote on the matter after the government reopens, Democrats want an ironclad guarantee that the subsidies will be extended well before their expiration at the end of this year.

Should Trump relent to their request, it would mark the first meeting among the trio since Schumer, Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., met in the Oval Office a day before the shutdown began.

Lawmakers left that meeting with no agreement to avert the shutdown, which has now dragged on for 21 days.

Senate Democrats have also blocked Thune and Republicans' attempts to reopen the government 11 times. Another vote on the House-passed continuing resolution, which would reopen the government until Nov. 21, is expected on Wednesday.

And like the many attempts before, that latest effort is expected to fail.

Meanwhile, Senate Republicans met with Trump for lunch at the White House Tuesday afternoon.

Speaking to reporters afterward, Thune reiterated that Senate Republicans were united in their war of attrition strategy to continue putting the same bill on the floor again and again. He noted that Trump would likely agree to meet with Schumer and Jeffries, but only after Senate Democrats unlocked the votes needed to reopen the government.

""We have negotiated. I don't know what there is to negotiate. This is about opening up the government,"" Thune said. ""We have offered them several off-ramps. Now, the Democrats want something that's totally untenable. I mean, they want $1.5 trillion in new spending. They want free healthcare for people who are noncitizens in this country. That is just a flat nonstarter. It doesn't pass the Senate. It won't pass the House. It won't be signed into law by the president.""

Sentinel Action Fund President Jessica Anderson and '#Walkaway' campaign founder Brandon Straka join 'Fox News @ Night' reacting to comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., about masculinity and  a rise in political violence from the left.

Labor Union leader Dan Osborn, a candidate for U.S. Senate in Nebraska, has campaigned on being an ""Independent,"" going as far as saying he has no plans to caucus with either major party if elected, but his recent FEC filings paint a different picture.

Osborn has not only been endorsed by leaders of the Nebraska Democratic Party and mobilized fundraising on ActBlue, the Democratic Party's main fundraising platform. He has also accepted donations from several prominent Washington Democrats and Democrat political action committees. 

Among the donors to his campaign are the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and the PACs of former Democrat senators Bob Kerrey and Jon Tester. Democracy Summer, a leadership PAC founded by Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, also donated $2,000. 

The latest FEC filings, released last week, also show Osborn continues to accept fundraising support from The People United, a left-wing super PAC that has supported Democrat ‘Squad' members like Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Summer Lee and Ilhan Omar.

""As an independent, I'll be uniquely positioned to bring together a majority to get it done,"" Osborn's ""Where I Stand"" webpage on his campaign website states in reference to securing the border from illegal immigration. ""I believe we all have more in common with each other than we do with the partisans who run Washington.""

But those ""partisans"" in Washington, at least some, appear to be helping fund his campaign against former Nebraska GOP governor and current junior Nebraska Sen. Pete Ricketts. 

""Dan Osborn is bought and paid for by his liberal, out-of-state, coastal donors,"" a Ricketts campaign spokesman previously said after Osborn announced he would be fighting to get a seat in the Senate for the second election in a row.

In 2024, Osborn came within single digits of defeating Sen. Deb Fischer. Fischer's campaign made similar claims that Osborn was really a Democrat disguising himself as an Independent.

A Fox News Digital review found that during his failed 2024 Senate campaign, Osborn received several $5,000 donations from the leadership PACs of Democratic senators Chuck Schumer of New York, Dick Durbin of Illinois and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, among others. Warren's Senate campaign also donated another $2,000 to Osborn last year.

""Elizabeth Warren is rated as the most far-left politician in Washington,"" Ricketts told Fox News Digital. ""She supports the Green New Deal, taxpayer benefits for illegals and abolishing private healthcare. By accepting campaign funds from Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer and Bob Kerrey, Dan Osborn has shown Nebraska voters exactly who he will side with in the Senate: The same Democrats funding his fake independent campaign.""

Fox News Digital reached out to campaign representatives for Osborn but did not receive a response.

The donations Osborn received recently from folks like Warren, Kerrey, Tester, Raskin and other Washington Democrats amounted to around $15,000 this quarter; however, just days ahead of his race against Fischer in November 2024, Osborn received a big infusion from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) amounting to close to $60,000. Senate Majority PAC, the main super PAC of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats, spent $3.85 million supporting Dan Osborn's 2024 campaign as well, records show.

The agency helping create and run advertisements for Osborn's campaign is called Fight Agency. Fight Agency was founded by a group of Democratic Party strategists, including consultants for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign and the winning Senate bid for Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego.

The agency has worked with left-wing Democrats like New York City socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, Bernie Sanders and progressive Democrat Rep. Greg Casar.

Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., joined 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss what the GOP revealed on the Hunter Biden investigation and the media ignoring Republicans' findings. 

In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, referred former CIA Director John Brennan to the Justice Department for allegedly making false statements to Congress.

Jordan accused Brennan of lying in his 2023 Judiciary Committee testimony by denying that the CIA used the Steele dossier in prepping the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on Russian election interference, and falsely claiming the CIA opposed including the dossier.

The Steele dossier was a series of reports detailing President Donald Trump's alleged ties to Russia. It was compiled and delivered to the FBI in 2016 by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele.

COMEY INDICTED FOR ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENT, OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDING

In Jordan's letter, he alleged subsequent investigations ""confirmed that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid Steele via the law firm Perkins Coie and opposition research firm Fusion GPS to provide derogatory information about Trump's purported ties to Russia, which resulted in the discredited dossier.""

In July 2025, the Trump administration declassified documents which appear to show Brennan approved the decision to include the dossier, despite objections from senior CIA officials.

CHRISTOPHER WRAY REFERRED TO DOJ OVER CLAIMS HE MISLED LAWMAKERS ON CATHOLIC MEMO, CHINA PROBES

During a transcribed interview on May 11, 2023, Brennan stated that ""the CIA was not involved at all with the [Steele] dossier.""

Yet, according to the declassified documents, the decision to incorporate information from the dossier in the ICA ""was jointly made by the Directors of CIA and FBI.""

""Brennan's assertion that the CIA was not ‘involved at all' with the Steele dossier cannot be reconciled with the facts,"" Jordan wrote in the letter. ""As the newly declassified documents show, a CIA officer drafted the annex containing a summary of the dossier; Brennan made the ultimate decision, along with then-FBI Director James Comey, to include information from the dossier in the ICA; and, as discussed further below, Brennan overruled senior CIA officers who objected to the inclusion of the dossier material.""

JAMES CLAPPER, JOHN BRENNAN HIT BACK AT TRUMP ALLEGATIONS ABOUT RUSSIA PROBE AS 'PATENTLY FALSE'

While past the five-year statute of limitations on criminal prosecution, Jordan also accused Brennan of providing false testimony during a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) hearing in 2017 — a move Jordan said ""indicates a pattern of Brennan's willingness to lie to Congress about the Steele dossier.""

""The HPSCI report and the CIA memorandum confirm not only that the Steele dossier was used as a basis for the ICA, but that Brennan insisted on its inclusion,"" Jordan wrote. ""This stands in stark contrast with Brennan's testimony to HPSCI that the dossier was not used in drafting the ICA. … Brennan's testimony before the Committee on May 11, 2023, was a brazen attempt to knowingly and willfully testify falsely and fictitiously to material facts.""

President Donald Trump calls on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats to vote to reopen the federal government.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Democrats are ""holding the entire federal government hostage"" during the shutdown, vowing, ""We will not be extorted on this crazy plot of theirs.""

Trump, speaking during a lunch at the White House Rose Garden, said, ""Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats need to vote for the clean, bipartisan CR and reopen our government. It's got to be reopened right now.

""They are the obstructionists. And the reason they're doing it is because we're doing so well. We're doing well all over the world.""

The president described Schumer as a politician who is in ""deep trouble"" and ""losing in all of the polls.""

The government shutdown is now on its 21st day. 

""You can call it the Schumer shutdown or the Democrats shutdown,"" Trump said Tuesday.

""You can call it whatever you want. And I will say this, that we have Darth Vader, you know, Darth Vader, right?"" the president said in reference to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. ""They call him Darth Vader. I call him a fine man, but he's cutting Democrat priorities, and they're never going to get them back.

""Today I'm calling on every Senate Democrat to stop the madness, to let our country get back.

""In the greatest moment in the history of our country, in terms of wealth, in terms of job creation and in terms of investment coming in, these guys go on strike. It's really a shame. So, I'm asking them to be smart. It's not working. They're getting killed in the polls,"" Trump said. ""The public understands what they're doing. They're doing the wrong thing.""

Trump also said Republicans ""have to win the midterms,"" and ""we're going to end up with a communist mayor in New York,"" a reference to democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.

A man whose son died during a 2017 fraternity hazing ritual at Penn State University warned students and parents of the ills of the practice in an interview with Fox News Digital, saying anyone could become a victim. 

A New Jersey fraternity has been suspended following possible hazing after a student was found unresponsive at an off-campus home last week, according to reports.

Police responded to a 911 call at an Alpha Sigma Phi chapter's house at Rutgers University in New Brunswick on Wednesday, according to ABC6. 

When authorities arrived, they reportedly found a 19-year-old student unresponsive and transported him to a hospital in critical condition.

""Rutgers-New Brunswick remains deeply concerned about the serious incident involving one of our students,"" the university said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""University leadership is in close contact with the student's family, offering support during this difficult time. We hope for his full recovery.""

While the cause of the incident remains under investigation, sources told ABC6 the student came in contact with electricity while at the house. 

A parent of another student living inside the house said the incident occurred while a group of students were listening to music when the victim came in contact with a live wire, according to NJ.com.

Inspection records previously revealed the fraternity house has been the subject of numerous safety violations dating back to 2014, NJ.com reported. 

A July 2025 inspection reportedly identified multiple electrical hazards throughout the property – which is owned by the Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity and managed by the fraternity's national housing branch, CLVEN – and other ""life safety"" issues. 

On Wednesday, the university issued a cease-and-desist order effectively pausing all activities for the fraternity, according to Rutgers' website. The chapter has also been placed on social probation until Nov. 3, 2025, and organizational disciplinary probation until May 18, 2026.

Alpha Sigma Phi's national organization has also placed the chapter on an interim suspension, the fraternity's CEO Gordy Heminger said in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

""Hazing has no part in the Alpha Sigma Phi experience,"" Heminger said. ""It is not condoned nor is it tolerated.""

President Donald Trump isn't ready to direct destructive military strikes against Hamas after the terrorist group violated its ceasefire with Israel.

Trump announced Tuesday that he will “NOT YET” impose force on Hamas with the hope it will “do what is right.” Hamas allegedly killed two Israeli soldiers in Rafah on Sunday, prompting the country to retaliate with strikes.

“Numerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East, have explicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and ‘straighten our Hamas' if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

“The love and spirit for the Middle East has not been seen like this in a thousand years! It is a beautiful thing to behold! I told these countries, and Israel, ‘NOT YET!' There is still hope that Hamas will do what is right. If they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL!” he added.

Trump brokered a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel earlier this month. The president said Monday that the ceasefire was still in effect and it was “going to be very peaceful with Hamas.”

Other Trump-brokered ceasefires around the world have initially seen violations before, in several cases, a more lasting peace. India and Pakistan traded strikes after their ceasefire, as did Israel and Iran, in addition to Rwanda and Congo.

The Israel Defense Forces confirmed the ceasefire was still in effect even after the strikes, saying it began “renewed enforcement of the ceasefire” after the military action. Officials in Washington worry that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will endanger the ceasefire.

Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance traveled to Israel on Tuesday to meet with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner for more talks about the ceasefire.

He's scheduled to meet with Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem on Wednesday.

Gaza accused Israel last week of violating the ceasefire dozens of times, killing over 40 civilians and wounding nearly 150. 

“These violations have included crimes of direct gunfire against civilians, deliberate shelling and targeting, and the arrest of a number of civilians, reflecting the occupation's continued policy of aggression despite the declared end of the war,” a statement from Gaza's media office said.

GAZA CEASEFIRE ‘RENEWED' AFTER STRIKES ON HAMAS, IDF SAYS

Early tensions from the ceasefire resulted in Hamas executing men in Gaza City, possibly as a measure to maintain power as rival gangs wage war in the area.

Trump said last week that Hamas's killing in Gaza “was not the deal” and the United States would be forced to “go in and kill them” if the executions continued.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Treasury Department ordered its employees not to share pictures of the construction on the White House's East Wing.

Photos circulated online of the demolition efforts transforming the East Wing into a new White House ballroom. The directive was issued after the pictures of “dismantling the facade of the building went viral online,” the Wall Street Journal reported. The Treasury Department's headquarters is located directly next to the White House's East Wing, where the construction is happening, enticing many employees to photograph it and post it on social media.

“As construction proceeds on the White House grounds, employees should refrain from taking and sharing photographs of the grounds, to include the East Wing, without prior approval from the Office of Public Affairs,” wrote a Treasury Department official in an email to employees, reported the Wall Street Journal. 

No reason was provided for the restrictions.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump was excited about the start of the East Wing's transformation. He announced the start of the ballroom construction in a post on Truth Social on Monday evening. 

“I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” Trump posted. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!”

The ballroom will be 90,000 square feet and accommodate up to 650 guests. It will be over triple the size of the White House's current seating capacity. The renovation will cost over $200 million and is being funded by private donations, including personal contributions from the president.

“President Trump, and other patriot donors, have generously committed to donating the funds necessary to build this approximately $200 million structure,” the White House announced in July.

CONSTRUCTION CREWS DEMOLISH WALL OF WHITE HOUSE EAST WING FOR BALLROOM CONSTRUCTION

Trump highlighted that the construction of the ballroom will be “zero cost to the American Taxpayer.” 

“For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc,” the president said. “I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) urged President Donald Trump to drop his nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel after inflammatory remarks he allegedly made in a group chat were leaked to the press.

Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, Paul Ingrassia, was accused of making several provocative remarks in a group chat with fellow Republicans, including denigrating Martin Luther King Jr. and saying that he had a “Nazi streak,” in a disputed context. In response, Thune and several Senate Republicans called on the president to recall Ingrassia, saying he wouldn't be approved.

“He's not gonna pass,” Thune told reporters, Politico reported.

Ingrassia is scheduled to testify in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday.

Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and James Lankford (R-OK) also came out against the nominee.

“I'm not supporting him,” Scott said. “I can't imagine how anybody can be antisemitic in this country. It's wrong.”

“I have tons of questions for him,” Lankford said, adding he “can't imagine supporting that.”

The loss of the leader of Senate Republicans will be difficult to overcome, especially as Ingrassia can only lose a handful of Republican votes.

Ingrassia's future was put into question after several alleged inflammatory messages were leaked to Politico, most coming from discussions throughout 2024 in group chats with Republican operatives. Among the alleged remarks were a few in which he denigrated King and several black holidays.

“MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his ‘holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs,” one message read.

“No moulignon holidays … From kwanza to mlk jr day to black history month to Juneteenth,” he allegedly said in another, using an Italian slur for black people. “Every single one needs to be eviscerated.”

A message provided by one leaker showed Ingrassia allegedly saying, “Blacks behave that way because that's their natural state … You can't change them,” during a discussion around why some Republicans believe Democrats make black people into victims.

Perhaps the most controversial was one where he responded to a participant mocking him, saying he “belongs in the Hitler Youth with Ubergruppenfuhrer Steve Bannon,” to which he responded, “I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time, I will admit it.”

Only one of the two leakers who spoke with Politico could recall the context, claiming it wasn't a joke, and an argument ensued. Ingrassia's lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, argued that all the messages could have been edited or taken out of context, but alluded to the “Nazi streak” comment specifically in suggesting it was self-deprecating humor.

“Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,'” he wrote in a statement to the outlet.

“In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” he added.

In a subsequent statement a few days later, Paltzik was more explicit in questioning the authenticity of the messages.

“In this age of AI, authentication of allegedly leaked messages, which could be outright falsehoods, doctored, or manipulated, or lacking critical context, is extremely difficult,” he said. “What is certain, though, is that there are individuals who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs. We do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”

TRUMP TEASES AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR OVER PAST COMMENTS

The group chat was leaked a week after Politico leaked a group chat of around a dozen Young Republican leaders making racist and inflammatory remarks. Several of those exposed have since resigned or been fired.

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) said Tuesday he would back Republicans if they invoked the “nuclear option” to eliminate the Senate filibuster and push through legislation reopening the government.

“There are no winners here. It's not getting better every day here. People are going to start to get really hungry, and I've been fully, fully committed to fund [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program], open up the government,” he said, noting the program is running out of money.

“This is just bad political theater. Open it up,” Fetterman added, speaking to reporters.

When asked whether he would back Republicans in “nuking” the filibuster to allow a House-passed funding bill to clear the Senate with a simple majority, Fetterman said he would.

“Of course. Carve it out for that. Absolutely. We ran on that. We ran on killing the filibuster, and now we love it,” Fetterman responded. “I support it because it makes it more difficult to shut the government down in the future, and that's where it's entirely appropriate. And I don't want to hear any Democrat clutching their pearls about the filibuster. We all ran on it.”

Senate Republicans broadly oppose eliminating the filibuster, with Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) ruling out the prospect as recently as this month, but the idea has gained new currency as GOP members of the House urge their Senate counterparts to take the step as a way to end Democrats' blockade.

The Senate's 60-vote threshold has long blocked partisan legislation, including previous efforts to end shutdowns. Repealing or suspending it, the so-called “nuclear option” would allow the GOP's narrow majority to pass a stopgap funding measure without Democratic support. Fetterman's remarks come as the shutdown enters its 21st day, with key agencies scaling back operations and federal nutrition benefits at risk of running out of money within weeks. 

Senate Democrats under former President Joe Biden sought to transform the legislative filibuster, with wide-ranging proposals from eliminating it altogether to creating policy carve-outs for issues such as federal voting rights, abortion access, and gun control. But Sens. Joe Manchin (I-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), ardent defenders of the legislative hurdle, stood in their way.

On Monday, the Senate failed for the 11th time to advance a House-passed bill to fund the government and end the shutdown. The measure has repeatedly fallen short of the 60 votes needed to move forward, with little indication that the stalemate will break anytime soon.

That's a great movie, but this is s***ty, and now it's like, now real damage is going to, are now touching the lives of regular Americans, and we all lose, and it's embarrassing to our — to our allies and to our enemies abroad,” Fetterman added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Should his mom and I tell him?

Dear James,

I'm a stepdad who wants nothing more than to be a good father to my stepson. He is 14 years old and many years past the divorce trauma involving his mom and his biological dad. His dad is, from my vantage point, a terrible human being in every way you can imagine. He has rarely paid child support. He is an addict and a drunk, and has exposed his kid to legions of drugs and debaucheries.

Although this biological dad's older kids avoid him like the plague, the 14-year-old still strives to be his “favorite.” Bio-dad has done everything he can to pull my stepson into his rotten orbit, exposing him to his life and sending him home with retrograde ideas about women.

My question is: Do we tell the 14-year-old what a bad human his biological dad is?

Dear Reader,

One of the ways in which the great psychiatrist and teacher Elvin Semrad communicated with his pupils was via the Zen-like homemade proverb. “The only time people leave their mothers is when they're ready to go,” he would say. Or: “It's hard to look at the bottom of a well and see what's there.”

And then there's my favorite: “Who can tell anybody anything?” I've been pondering that one for years, rolling it around in my brain-orifice like an Everlasting Gobstopper.

What I get from it is this: Everyone has to learn their own lessons. Hints, counsels, warnings, remonstrations, even encouragements are, in the end, of limited value. We're human, and we have to do it ourselves. “Tell me what to do!” I remember demanding of my first therapist. “Can't you just tell me what to do?!” He made noises of ethical-clinical demurral. His ginger eyebrows wobbled. Had he zinged me with that Semrad line, I might have calmed down.

You can see where I'm going with this, I'm sure. Your stepson is a teenage boy, the definition of volatility and impressionability. By running down his biological father—even if the guy's as much of a waste of space as you say he is—you will only be (temporarily) substituting one set of impressions for another. And that's if your stepson listens to you. The other possible outcome is that you and your stepson get in a fight. His father exists in the world, floundering about and getting high, but the larger and more potent existence that this man has, in your case, is in your stepson's psyche. In there, he's a giant. Mess with the father image and you're asking for trouble.

And here's another thing, a lesson I learned rather late in the day: Parenting is 2 percent what you say, and 98 percent what you do. How you carry yourself, how you react, how you balance your selfhood against the pressures of reality—this is what a child watches and (God help all parents) learns from. It will take patience and biting-your-tongue forbearance, but you need to be the bigger man here. By modeling love, tolerance, grown-upness, dependability, sobriety—all the non-waste-of-space virtues—you'll be telling-without-telling your stepson everything he needs to know.

In dadly fellowship,

James

A new film argues that, in an era of rising authoritarianism, audiences have become too numb to the speculative force of 1984.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

George Orwell was dying when he wrote 1984 in the late 1940s on the desolate Isle of Jura in Scotland's Inner Hebrides. Tuberculosis ravaged his body, and typing thousands of words a day only weakened him further. His skin flaked off. Blisters burst across his throat. Feverish and emaciated, he endured painful procedures to support his failing lungs, but the treatments were too late. Eventually, in 1950, Orwell succumbed to the disease.

Close-ups of microscopic tuberculosis bacteria fill the screen in the opening minutes of the documentary Orwell: 2+2=5—images as bold and unnerving as what follows. Directed by the Oscar-nominated filmmaker Raoul Peck, the film examines an idea popularized by 1984: that blatant falsehoods can, through propaganda, be accepted as truth. That conceit, along with Orwell's state of mind during his final months, has been scrutinized for decades—by high-school students, biographers, and other documentarians. But Peck builds out a bigger argument, using material provided by the Orwell estate—including the writer's letters, essays, and diary entries—to trace the authoritarian tactics that can suppress truth and lay out what he sees as a disturbing pattern: one of wide-scale complacency in the decades after Orwell's death. Generations of readers have recognized the prescient warnings of 1984. Yet according to Peck's film, recognizing that reality can resemble Orwell's dystopian masterpiece has led to numbness, rather than meaningful change.

The tuberculosis-bacteria motif underscores this idea. To compare authoritarianism's rise to an infection is perhaps obvious. But as the microbes spread across the screen, the visual becomes almost hypnotic—and, as Peck recently told me, akin to how dictators overwhelm people's abilities to determine fact from fiction. “It's the same story again and again,” he said, “and we don't learn.”

Peck grew up under multiple authoritarian regimes. At 8 years old, he and his family fled Haiti after François Duvalier, the dictator known as Papa Doc, began his rule. Around the same time that his family moved to the Republic of the Congo, that country's first democratically elected prime minister was assassinated; the following coup placed the despot Mobutu Sese Seko in power. To Peck, Papa Doc and Mobutu followed the same playbook: “They attack intelligence, they attack universities, they attack science, they attack the press,” he said. “They attack every institution that can be a bulwark against them.”

Those memories shaped Peck's approach to Orwell: 2+2=5. A more traditional exploration of Orwell's fiction might turn to interviews with scholars of his work to unpack his resonance. Peck instead explores the idea cinematically, as he did in I Am Not Your Negro, his 2016 deconstruction of James Baldwin's work: He creates an impressionistic collage, featuring scenes derived mostly from Orwell's writings—which are recited by the actor Damian Lewis—or from relevant archival footage.

Read: James Baldwin was right all along

The documentary, Peck said, is intended to convey his frustration that Orwell's name has too often been flattened into an adjective, and 1984 into mere speculative fiction. In one scene from Orwell: 2+2=5, Apple's well-known Super Bowl ad—in which a model hurls a sledgehammer at a Big Brother broadcast—plays on a giant billboard above a busy street as passersby completely ignore it. Perhaps in an effort to unflatten Orwell's warnings, the film points out what it sees as contemporary parallels to Newspeak, the uncanny English used throughout 1984 to prevent the articulation of abstract concepts. (Rather than say something is “great,” Newspeak uses the word plusgood. A more insidious example would be calling any ideas that go against the ruling party “thoughtcrime.”) Peck argues that some world leaders have seemed to embrace the practice of twisting words: In one sequence, he displays a modern glossary of terms—peacekeeping operations, campaign finance, illegals—that he implies obfuscate thornier realities.

While constructing the documentary, Peck thought of Orwell as “a fighting companion,” he told me—a guide rather than an encyclopedia of insights to pull from. He structured the film according to the three tenets of the ruling government in 1984: “War is peace,” “Ignorance is strength,” and “Freedom is slavery.” Then he found pointed visuals to illustrate those ideas. A clip of George W. Bush declaring war on Iraq, for instance, rolls as the first chapter begins, to emphasize how even nontotalitarian countries can use conflict to stoke nationalistic fervor. A graphic charting the slew of banned books in the United States illustrates the power of ignorance, while a montage of security cameras in public spaces underlines the notion of freedom as an illusion. Peck also adds newsreels of world leaders delivering speeches, footage of war zones past and present, and scenes from futuristic Hollywood films, to emphasize the reach of Orwell's ideas throughout time.

The film, as a result, can feel overstuffed. But even when he incorporates discordant images, Peck keeps a close eye on Orwell's vision. For example, he uses AI-generated art during some sequences about the misuse of technological innovation; the moments come off as jarring at first, but they successfully evoke Orwell's description in 1984 of a world in which records and books are produced “without any human intervention.” And the ending of Orwell: 2+2=5, in which Peck knits together recordings of protests—of Russian citizens lining up outside the dissident Alexei Navalny's funeral, of women demonstrating over the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran—brought to my mind a line from Orwell's essay “Why I Write”: “The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.”

Read: What Orwell didn't anticipate

Peck told me that he resisted noting every parallel he saw between Orwell's words and today's reality, because he didn't want to turn the documentary into an ongoing history lesson. (To go into the editing bay and, say, incorporate news reports of the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel being taken off air “would be the trap,” he told me.) If anything, Peck hoped that the film's density and wide scope would illuminate how frequently the past's most painful moments repeat themselves. Knowing that many dictators have come to power through familiar means isn't enough to stop them, the film argues; a democratic system needs “to be renewed and reinforced every day,” Peck said, through a commitment to truth. Such pursuits may be the only way to shake off intellectual paralysis—the only way to remember what 2+2 actually equates.

The justices could hand Trump the power to deploy troops anywhere, anytime — and against Americans.

It's hard to think of a more dramatic question than the issue before the Supreme Court in Trump v. Illinois.

President Donald Trump wants to use federalized troops to quell protests outside an immigration detention facility near Chicago. Two federal courts have ruled that federal law does not permit Trump to do this. But the case is now before a Supreme Court dominated by six Republican justices who rarely part ways with the leader of their political party.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Trump's arguments in the Illinois case, moreover, are quite aggressive. His lawyers claim that the question of when the president may exercise his power to take control of National Guard members, who are ordinarily under the command of state officials, “is committed exclusively to the president” and cannot be reviewed by federal courts. Once Trump does so, his lawyers also claim, “the Guardsmen serve under the command and control of federal military officials and ultimately the President as Commander in Chief.”

Thus, if the justices embrace this argument, Trump could potentially gain unchecked authority to call up the National Guard and order armed guardsmen to “protect” voting precincts in Democratic regions of the country.

The case arises out of Trump's decision to place several hundred members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard under his control and order them to an immigration detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, about 12 miles west of Chicago. Since September, a small group of people have protested against the Trump administration's immigration policies outside of that facility, and some of them have allegedly vandalized federal law enforcement vehicles. Some people have also been arrested for violent crimes, such as aggravated battery.

According to Judge April Perry, a federal district judge who temporarily blocked this deployment, “the typical number of protestors is fewer than fifty,” and “the crowd has never exceeded 200.”

To justify Trump's decision to deploy military personnel to an American town, his lawyers rely on a federal law that permits the federal government to take command of National Guard members if there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Trump, in other words, claims that a small crowd that ranges from a few dozen people to a couple hundred has so overwhelmed the United States' capacity to enforce its own laws that it justifies using the military against US citizens on US soil.

Needless to say, the stakes in the Illinois case are breathtaking. If Trump is allowed to use military personnel to suppress a tiny group of protesters and vandals, then it is unlikely that this Court will place any meaningful limits whatsoever on his ability to deploy the US military against Americans.

If you want to understand the Illinois case, it's helpful to first understand how the framers of the original Constitution understood the role of the military.

The framers were quite fearful that military power would be directed against a nation's own citizens or against state governments that were out of step with whoever ran the federal government. Indeed, they were so fearful that they imagined a country with no permanent national army. This is why the Constitution prohibits Congress from appropriating any money to the army that does not expire after two years.

As the Supreme Court explained in Perpich v. Department of Defense (1990), among the framers, “there was a widespread fear that a national standing Army posed an intolerable threat to individual liberty and to the sovereignty of the separate States.”

The framers did, however, contemplate that each state would maintain a militia — which could, under conditions established by Congress, be called into federal service “to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.”

Though the United States' military might, and its tolerance for standing armies, has obviously grown considerably since the founding, federal law still reflects the framers' fear of military personnel being used to oppress the people or to trample on states' internal governance.

While the president may, in limited circumstances, order the National Guard (the modern version of founding-era militias) into service on US soil, such orders are supposed to be a last resort. The relevant statute permits such use of the National Guard only to repel a foreign invasion, to suppress a rebellion, or when the president is “unable” to otherwise execute US law.

Trump, however, asks the Supreme Court to read these limits to be entirely meaningless. His primary argument is that he can simply declare that a rebellion or similar emergency exists, and the courts can do nothing to intervene even if that declaration is ridiculous. Alternatively, he asks the justices to read words like “rebellion” or “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” so broadly that they encompass a small protest that has never grown beyond a couple hundred people.

Trump's first argument arises out of a single line from the Court's decision in Martin v. Mott (1827) that, if read in isolation, does seem to support his broad claim of authority over the National Guard. Martin involved a previous version of the federal law governing presidential control of the militia, and one sentence of that opinion states that the “authority to decide” whether calling up the militia is justified “belongs exclusively to the President.”

But, as both federal courts that heard the Illinois case concluded, Trump's lawyers read this line out of context. Martin involved a member of the New York militia who refused President James Madison's order to report for federal service during the War of 1812. In that case, the Supreme Court asked a question: “Is the President the sole and exclusive judge whether the exigency has arisen, or is it to be considered as an open question, upon which every officer to whom the orders of the President are addressed, may decide for himself, and equally open to be contested by every militiaman who shall refuse to obey the orders of the President?”

The Court then answered that question with the line Trump's lawyers quote, saying that the president has the authority to decide whether to federalize the militia; it's not each individual person within that militia who holds that authority. Thus, Martin doesn't stand for the proposition that courts may never review whether a president's decision to call up the National Guard complies with federal law. It simply held that members of the militia can't decide on their own whether to report for duty or not.

That leaves Trump's argument that a small gathering of pro-immigration protesters amounts to a “rebellion,” or a mob that so threatens the United States that law will cease to function unless military personnel suppress that mob.

The latter claim is risible on its face. As Judge Perry noted, “federal immigration officials have seen huge increases in arrests and deportations,” despite the fact that several dozen people have been protesting outside of a single immigration detention facility in Illinois. So, the government appears to be executing its laws just fine.

Similarly, Judge Perry defines the term “rebellion” to mean “a deliberate, organized resistance, openly and avowedly opposing the laws and authority of the government as a whole by means of armed opposition and violence.” Thus, mere lawbreaking, or even lawbreaking that seeks to prevent federal officials from carrying out their duties, is not enough. The alleged rebellion must actually threaten the “authority of the government as a whole.”

That definition makes sense, seeing as the word “rebellion” is tucked within a statute that also targets foreign invasions or major uprisings that threaten anarchy. So, it makes sense that the word “rebellion” should be read to encompass similar threats to national security or US stability. A narrow definition of the word “rebellion” also makes sense in light of the United States' history of fearing the use of military forces on domestic soil.

Will that be enough to persuade this Supreme Court? Probably not, given the Republican justices' extraordinarily solicitude for the head of their political party. But a decision authorizing Trump to use the National Guard to suppress a minor protest would be a sharp departure from the nation's history of caution regarding domestic use of the armed forces.

In its brief to the justices, the Trump administration suggests that there's been a breakdown of order outside the Broadview facility. They claim that “federal law enforcement agencies have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence and to divert resources from enforcement efforts to protect federal agents and property.” Meanwhile, the Trump administration says, “local forces have failed to respond, or unaccountably delayed their response, even when federal agents face life-threatening violence.”

Both the Illinois plaintiffs and state and local police, meanwhile, present a more nuanced picture. In their view, while protesters have sometimes engaged in criminal activity, state and local police have been responsive to the federal government's needs, and much of the violence near the facility was provoked by bad policing from federal officials.

Judge Perry summarized the Broadview Police Department's position, saying they believe that the “tone of the protesters” changed for the worse after federal officials made a show of force; “twenty to thirty federal agents parked across the street and walked toward the ICE Processing Center in camouflage tactical gear with masks covering their faces.” Broadview Police also complained that federal officials' “use of chemical agents against protestors ‘has often been arbitrary and indiscriminate,' at times being used on crowds as small as ten people.”

Perry concluded that the state and local police's version of events is more credible than the Trump administration's. Among other things, she noted that some of the Trump administration's declarations to her court contain factual errors or otherwise dubious claims. Two of Trump's witnesses, for example, “refer to arrests made on September 27, 2025 of individuals who were carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents,” but “neither declaration discloses that federal grand juries have refused to return an indictment against at least three of those individuals, which equates to a finding of a lack of probable cause that any crime occurred.”

Judge Perry's determination that the Trump administration is not credible, and that the state and local police's version of events is, matters, because appellate courts are only supposed to second guess a trial judge's factual findings if they are “clearly erroneous.” So, the Supreme Court should presume that the Trump administration's portrait of widespread chaos outside of the Broadview facility is wrong.

But many of the Republican justices are openly hostile toward district judges who do not share their views. And those justices are particularly credulous toward Trump and his administration, especially in cases involving law enforcement.

So, there's a real chance that the Republican justices will resolve the Illinois case by simply assuming that order has broken down in Broadview and then interpreting the law as if Trump's claims are gospel. In the worst case scenario, they could also demand that lower courts defer to Trump even if he uses the military to suppress dissent or to intimidate Democratic voters.

Inside Match Group, there's a common refrain: Tinder is your first dating app, and Hinge is your last.

As the watering hole for young daters, Tinder's success is largely reliant on Gen Z. The young generation's dating patterns have also become increasingly inscrutable: they drink and hook up less frequently, and might even be tiring of dating apps entirely. As Tinder teetered toward becoming out of touch, the platform's revenue plateaued in 2024 with 1% growth year over year and a 7% decline in paying users.

Then came Spencer Rascoff, the bright-eyed Zillow cofounder who planned to reinvent Match Group as CEO. Within months of Rascoff taking the reins, Match Group laid off 13% of the company in May. Tinder CEO Faye Iosotaluno stepped down, and Rascoff chose to lead the property himself.

""Tinder needs a lot of work, and it is therefore my primary focus,"" Rascoff said on Match Group's second-quarter earnings call.

Rascoff has shaken up Tinder. Company leaders told Business Insider why they think the company is headed for a turnaround as product timelines narrow and the app's messaging gets updated.

Their golden goose: Gen Z.

""We are absolutely, with Spencer's arrival, going through a bit of a cultural reset,"" said Hillary Paine, Tinder's VP of product. ""It's reinvigorated the energy at the company.""

Faced with competition from buzzy upstarts and evolving dating habits, the stakes are high for Tinder as it battles to stay relevant with young daters.

Tinder's new Double Date feature — yes, for double-dating — was scheduled to roll out slowly toward the end of 2025. Then Rascoff became CEO, saw the product was performing well, and pushed up the timeline by six months, said Cleo Long, Tinder's senior director for global product marketing.

Tinder is moving faster than ever, three of its leaders said. The company used to have a twice-monthly schedule for shipping code, Long said. Now, it's weekly.

Speed is one of the seven product principles Rascoff laid out in a memo sent to Tinder employees in May. Rascoff wrote that Tinder would employ a ""'ship ship ship' mentality"" and said it was important that data analysis would ""inform but not delay"" the timeline.

Another is to ""prioritize results."" For a long time, dating apps like Tinder focused on expanding their paid tiers. Rascoff, though, wrote that revenue was an output of audience growth; thus, product should be focused on improving ""user outcomes."" (Rascoff declined multiple requests for comment.)

Paine worked with Rascoff in her previous job at Zillow. Tinder's new ""smaller, more structured pods"" are reminiscent of what they had at Zillow, she said. The goal was to have teams ""act like mini startups within a larger organization.""

Rather than working with a pooled team of 60 engineers, Paine said, a product lead is now working with about 10 — as well as a designer, an analyst, and a researcher.

""They're all physically sitting next to each other in the office,"" she said. ""There are whiteboards, they've got their devices out, and they're riffing quickly on things.""

While going ""startup mode"" can speed things up at a large company, it isn't always what existing employees are looking for. Some business leaders can use it as an excuse to institute long hours; others to micromanage.

Asked about these challenges, Paine said that there is ""higher accountability,"" but that ""the people who are here today are here for that energy.""

Rascoff has made Tinder significantly more focused on the long-term, the leaders said.

Stephanie Danzi, Tinder's SVP of global marketing, used to plan her team's budget quarterly, or sometimes even month-to-month. The process is now more fluid, she said, something that was important with the early launch of the Double Date feature.

""I've never been able to transfer my Q4 dollars to Q2 with a launch,"" Danzi said. ""He was like, 'This is ridiculous.'""

Tinder has also trimmed its head count. Match Group declined to disclose what percentage of Tinder's staff was laid off in the companywide 13% cut, though it said that roughly 1 in 5 managers' roles were eliminated. (Another one of Rascoff's principles: ""Smaller In Size, Stronger In Commitment."")

Danzi said that Tinder experienced a ""flattening"" under Rascoff. Her team was already fairly lean, so the changes were small compared to the product team, she said.

""We did have some reduction in force, but it was not as dramatic as the reorg that you would've seen on the tech side of things,"" Danzi said.

Tinder's corporate shake-up isn't just about efficiency — it's about Gen Z. Paine said that Gen Z was Tinder's ""center of gravity."" Danzi called 18 to 24-year-olds the app's ""sweet spot.""

Long explained the company's product mission: ""If we're seeing this working for Gen Z, let's give them more of what they're asking for.""

Tinder has about 50 million monthly users, 60% of whom the company says are between 18 and 30. That would place roughly 30 million monthly Tinder users in the Gen Z age cohort. (Tinder declined to share how many Gen Z users it had.)

Some of Gen Z have cooled on Tinder — or at least its hookup app reputation. It's implicit in Danzi's remit, which she said was ""reconsideration with Gen Z women."" On his first-quarter investor call, Rascoff said that Tinder's ""infinite card stack"" model worked better 10 years ago when there was ""more of a hookup culture.""

According to analytics company Appfigures, Tinder was the No. 1 dating app between 2020 and 2024, but downloads declined 38% over the period. (So far in 2025, the Tea app has displaced Tinder's No. 1 status.) In 2020, Tinder had an estimated 11,363,000 downloads, per Appfigures; in 2024, it was 7,037,000.

Tinder has rolled out a slew of new features aimed toward Gen Z, including College Mode, face verification in an attempt to increase safety and cut down on bots, and — you guessed it — Double Date. Long said that 85% of double daters were between 18 and 29.

Paine said that Tinder's AI push is about ""giving Gen Z more confidence"" — and not about ""replacing dating."" The company has AI assistants that help users pick photos and an AI game to test their flirting skills.

Of all the dating app leaders, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd — a Tinder cofounder who settled a lawsuit against the company in 2014 — has likely been the boldest in her AI predictions. In May, Herd imagined a future in which users have AI ""dating concierges"" that date each other first.

Paine sounded skeptical of the idea. ""That, to me, feels like a bit of a dystopian future,"" she said of Herd's prediction. ""That's not how we're thinking about it at Tinder.""

Then there's the question of dating app burnout. Many young people want to be on their phones less and are tired of swiping. Whether the fatigue is hitting Tinder's bottom line remains debatable — but sentiment among many has certainly turned against dating apps.

""There is a nostalgia happening for a pre-dating app time when people think it was easy,"" Danzi said, pointing out that ""Sex and the City"" is having a resurgence. Those easy rom-com moments ""never really existed,"" she said.

Danzi also said that there was ""tech influence"" on the downturn in sentiment.

""Everybody's conditioned: When I open an app, I can press a button and get what I want,"" Danzi said, pointing to examples like Amazon and Uber. ""Dating apps do not work like that.""

When asked about dating app fatigue and how Tinder planned to combat it, Paine said that the company was focused on ""fewer likes and better matches.""

There's another one of Rascoff's product principles. It also sounds a lot like Hinge with its ""turn limits."" That app has shown stronger growth — its revenue, while smaller than Tinder's, grew 39% year-over-year in 2024 and its paying users grew 13%. Hinge also has a large cohort of Gen Z users.

Paine said that Rascoff had been working on breeding collaboration between the apps, including between Tinder and Hinge. Rascoff refers to the two apps as ""siblings,"" she said, ""and you don't want your siblings to fight.""

It's not clear whether the turnaround effort will prove successful. In the second quarter, Rascoff's first full quarter as CEO, Tinder's revenue was down 4% year over year to $461.2 million — though that was up a little over 3% from the previous quarter's $447.4 million. Paid users continued to decline, dipping 7% year over year.

Rascoff sounded bullish in his remarks.

""For the first time in a long time, Tinder's pace of product innovation is strong,"" he said.

When Nikki Ashkar and her husband Mike baked her grandmother's cinnamon buns for the first time, they didn't plan to start a million-dollar business.

Five years later, however, their small business, Mav's Top Buns, has sold over half a million cinnamon buns. Since the start of 2024, it has generated more than $1 million, according to sales report records reviewed by Business Insider.

""We went from selling cinnamon buns from a U-Haul truck to making over $1 million in about a year,"" Nikki told BI's Rachel Cohn.

Today, they bake the buns at a bakery in New Jersey. At $10 a bun, the price isn't cheap, but neither is the labor. ""You've got to know your worth,"" Nikki said.

The dough rests for 72 hours before hitting the oven. The frosting, a secret ratio of vanilla bean to cream cheese, is applied twice. ""We ice every single nook and cranny,"" Nikki said, adding, ""So that you never miss a good bite.""

Coming from a marketing background, Nikki knew that branding was as essential as the recipe itself. She didn't want to call the business ""Mike and Nikki's buns.""

Ultimately, they chose the name ""Mav's Top Buns,"" named after her firstborn son, Maverick. From the start, she positioned the business as the ""best cinnamon buns in New Jersey.""

""We truly believe that,"" Nikki said, adding, ""When you believe something so intrinsically about your product and what you bring to the table, you become that.""

Nikki said they have never paid for marketing or influencer promotions. Instead, their own social media accounts helped drive growth.

For example, Nikki began posting photos and videos on the business's Instagram account in 2020, some of which have since gone viral. One of her first viral posts racked up 80,000 likes.

""At first I was kind of offended,"" she said of the viral video's angry comments at how she was holding the bun. ""But as we grew and as we got more viral, it just became one of those things where the more viral you get, the more people are going to comment whatever they want to comment, and it's good for the algorithm, it's good for us.""

One of the account's most viral posts features standard visuals but pairs them with an edgy audio clip that includes some profanity.

Nikki said she hesitated before posting it, worried it might be too bold for a family business. However, the post felt authentic to her. ""People related to things a lot when we were just authentically ourselves.""

It's not like the Insta page is filled with edgy content, however. Other posts showcase the couple's quirky personality through delicious-looking cinnamon buns accompanied by metal music and rap, and some dancing videos.

Nikki opened the bakery while eight months pregnant, balancing a newborn, late-night bakes, and long lines of customers. Mav's Top Buns now produces up to 1,000 buns a day during peak weekends, she said.

Behind the scenes, Nikki and Mike juggle the demands of entrepreneurship and parenthood.

""I think that's what people really grabbed onto, and that's why they love to support us because they know how hard a mom and dad work,"" Nikki said.

When asked what keeps her going through burnout and sleepless nights, Nikki credited perseverance and authenticity.

""Sometimes we'd lose power and we'd roll buns by candlelight, but it was those times where it really separated the men from the boys, where if you keep going, you will succeed,"" she said.

Nikki said their three children are already mimicking the family trade, rolling Play-Doh into miniature buns at home.

The US government is still closed for business.

Since the government shutdown began on October 1, an estimated 900,000 federal workers across various agencies have been furloughed, meaning they have been placed on unpaid leave. Meanwhile, others are working without pay.

As the Trump administration threatens to permanently lay off some federal workers — an unprecedented move during shutdowns — and with thousands of federal employees on the brink of missing their paychecks this Friday, the stakes for reopening the government have been heightened.

Congress has been in a gridlock, unable to reopen the government, as Democratic representatives push against legislation that would cut subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

The budget approval process we know today was introduced in 1974, when Congress passed the Budget Act of 1974 in response to President Richard Nixon's impounding of federal funds approved by Congress during his presidency.

Since then, there have been more than a dozen shutdowns.

As of October 21, the ongoing shutdown ranks as the third-longest shutdown in US history, falling behind the 2018 shutdown during Trump's first presidency and quickly approaching the duration of the 1995 shutdown, which lasted 21 days and kept the US government from shutting down again for 16 years.

We ranked the 10 longest government shutdowns in US history using the House of Representatives' list, which counts shutdown duration from the first day of the funding gap to the last full day the government was shut down, not including the day that the legislation reopening the government was signed into law.

See how the ongoing shutdown compares to past government shutdowns.

Dates: November 13 to 19, 1995

On November 13, 1995, the government entered a five-day shutdown as congressional Republicans and the Clinton administration failed to reach an agreement on budget priorities.

The disagreements began after the House and Senate both flipped to a Republican majority during the midterm elections, when Republican politicians, including Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, campaigned on a platform of reduced government spending, as outlined in what they called a ""Contract with America.""

Having control of the House for the first time in 40 years, the Republicans passed a spending bill that cut federal funding for Medicare and gave states more power over welfare programs, such as Medicaid.

Clinton vetoed the bill, and the government shut down for five days before Congress passed a temporary funding bill to keep federal agencies working.

The budget debates later led to what became, at the time, the longest government shutdown in US history.

Dates: October 31 to November 9, and November 30 to December 9, 1977

The government shut down for eight days twice between October 31 and December 9, 1977, after a longer gap in funding at the beginning of that October. The three funding gaps accounted for a total of 28 days that year during which the federal government operated outside its appropriated budget.

The gaps in funding came as the Democrat-led House and Senate argued over whether Medicaid funds should be used to pay for abortions.

Despite the funding gap, most federal agencies continued to operate as usual, and workers were not furloughed. This was the norm before the 1981 Supreme Court decision, which ruled that federal agencies lacked the legal means to operate during periods of funding gaps.

Dates: September 30 to October 11, 1976

The first government shutdown occurred in 1976, when President Gerald Ford vetoed an appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare passed by Congress, citing the increases as ""inflationary,"" as reported by The New York Times at the time.

While Congress overrode the veto on October 1, the process resulted in a lapse in funding that lasted for 10 days.

Dates: September 30 to October 12, 1979

The debate over the use of Medicaid funds for abortions that had resulted in 28 days of lapsed funding in 1977 continued in the following years.

In 1979, the House and Senate, both held by Democratic majorities, disagreed on how Medicaid funds should be used for abortions, with the House passing a restrictive bill and the Senate looking for a more permissive approach that would allow for funding in cases of rape and incest.

Funding restarted when a compromise bill was passed, which included the Senate's approach to abortion funding and a raise in congressional salaries.

Dates: September 30 to October 13, 1977

The longest funding gap of 1977 happened on September 30, when the House and Senate failed to pass a funding bill for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare over disagreements on the use of Medicaid funding for abortions.

While both chambers were controlled by the president's party, the House advocated for funding only in cases where the mother's life was at risk, while the Senate backed a less restrictive approach, which would also provide funding in cases of rape and incest.

The disagreement led to the passage of a temporary funding bill, which expired on October 31 and was followed by two more lapses in funding.

Like other funding gaps prior to 1977, federal agencies continued working, and no federal employees were furloughed.

Dates: September 30 to October 17, 2013

After 16 years without a government shutdown, the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-held House failed to pass a funding bill due to disagreements over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

In an effort to diminish the act, the House passed two funding bills that would defund portions of the program and delay its implementation by a year; however, neither was passed by the Senate.

The showdown led to over 800,000 federal workers being furloughed during budget negotiations, while pay for active-duty military members was agreed upon by the president and Congress.

After two weeks, the House passed a funding bill without restrictions for the health law.

Dates: September 30 to October 18, 1978

The longest government shutdown of the Carter presidency started on September 30, 1978, when the president vetoed a spending bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and a series of water public works projects, which he deemed wasteful.

The veto, added to the existing congressional disagreements over Medicaid abortion funding, led to a 17-day impasse that ended once Congress removed both the aircraft carrier and water works funding from the funding bill.

Dates: December 15, 1995, to January 6, 1996

Following the shorter, five-day shutdown on November 13, 1995, the government entered another funding gap on December 15, after a temporary funding bill expired without Congress and the president agreeing on a bill to keep the government open.

The government stood at a stalemate for 21 days, with federal agencies furloughing workers during the holiday season.

The shutdown came to an end when congressional Republicans, who had lost public support in the polls, as reported by NPR, passed a balanced budget that avoided hikes in Medicare premiums and funding cuts for federal agencies.

The government did not shut down again for 16 years.

Dates: December 21, 2018, to January 25, 2019

The longest government shutdown in US history began on December 21, 2018, after House Democrats refused to approve spending bills that provided the Trump administration with $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border, which the president had insisted on.

While clean funding bills were passed through the House and the Senate, both of which were held by Republican majorities, the president refused to approve the budgets, resulting in a 34-day stalemate.

During the nearly five weeks the government was closed, airports began experiencing flight delays as air traffic controllers and TSA workers, who were working without pay, began calling out sick en masse. TSA reported that the number of employees taking sick leave had more than doubled since the beginning of the shutdown.

The shutdown ended when the president and Congress agreed on a funding bill that didn't include funding for the border wall.

Dates: October 1, 2025, to current

The government shut down on October 1, 2025, after Congress failed to agree on funding measures, with a key point of contention being healthcare subsidies.

Democrats refused to support a temporary funding bill passed by House Republicans that lacked protections against provisions from Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which they say would cut federal funding, expand Medicaid requirements, and reduce subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, citing increased healthcare premiums.

Federal funding expired on October 1 as both sides failed to reach an agreement.

After the Senate failed to advance an 11th funding bill on Monday, the likelihood of the shutdown ending soon remains slim.

As far as negotiations go, the stalemate appears to have no clear end in sight, even as furloughed federal workers and some employees working without pay experience a third week of uncertainty.

Thought Elon Musk's $1 trillion Tesla pay package would have an easy ride?

Think again.

A second influential proxy-advisory firm is urging Tesla shareholders to vote against Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion compensation deal, warning that it would hand the billionaire CEO an ""unprecedented"" payout while shrinking other investors' stakes.

Glass Lewis & Co. told clients in a paper published last Friday that the award ""warrants significant shareholder concern.""

It joined Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) in opposing the deal ahead of Tesla's November 6 annual meeting.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Glass Lewis's 90-page report, reviewed by Business Insider, calls the package ""excessively dilutive,"" estimating that, if fully exercised, it could cut existing shareholders' ownership by about 11.3%.

The firm valued the deal at $141.6 billion — far above Tesla's own $87.8 billion estimate — and said Musk could reap ""billions in compensation and a materially increased ownership stake"" even if he hits just one of the 12 performance tranches.

""The potential upfront and future dilutive impacts to shareholders, as well as extraordinary pay levels without commensurately exceptional performance through the achievement of even just a few tranches, warrant significant concern,"" Glass Lewis wrote in its analysis.

The package would grant Musk up to 423 million shares, or about 12% of Tesla's adjusted share count, if he meets a set of market-cap and 12 operational milestones — including pushing Tesla's valuation to $8.5 trillion by 2035.

The report also raised red flags about Tesla's board independence and oversight of Musk's pay.

Glass Lewis said Musk's compensation is being reviewed by a board that has long faced questions about its closeness to the CEO, citing directors with personal or professional ties to him that date back years.

The firm said that dynamic was central to a Delaware court ruling earlier this year that struck down Musk's 2018 pay package, finding that those relationships compromised the approval process.

Those concerns remain relevant now, Glass Lewis added.

Glass Lewis also questioned controls on ensuring Musk's focus remains on Tesla, given his slate of other ventures, including SpaceX, xAI, X, and Neuralink.

""The size of the award could result in the scenario where Mr. E. Musk receives billions in compensation and a materially increased ownership stake,"" the firm said, ""even if only a single tranche is earned.""

The report further argued that the early milestones ""do not appear as herculean as the size of the proposed tranches would suggest,"" implying Musk could unlock massive value without delivering the kind of outlier performance the package purports to demand.

Tesla sent a fiery X post on Monday, blasting ISS and Glass Lewis as ""misguided.""

The post said both firms have ""recommended against Tesla's proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.""

""It's a good thing our shareholders ignored those recommendations,"" Tesla wrote, ""otherwise they may have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.""

The company accused the advisors of using ""one-size-fits-all checklists"" that ""undermine shareholders' interests,"" and added their recommendations ""attempt to override the mandate our shareholders delivered to Elon and ignore the staggering financial results delivered under Elon's leadership.""

Tesla escalated its criticism in a follow-up post on Tuesday, saying ISS and Glass Lewis' models were ""incapable of accounting for the sort of extraordinary growth Tesla has experienced.""

The company argued that both firms' benchmark-based models ""cannot distinguish between innovation and risk, or between ambition and mismanagement.""

It also said ISS and Glass Lewis were ""disconnected from financial reality"" and ""incapable of tailoring their advice to investors who are focused on the achievement of extraordinary financial value.""

It urged shareholders to ""take back your vote from proxy advisors"" and ""vote in the interests of Tesla shareholders,"" arguing that ""governance should serve — and not be disconnected from — financial return.""

Cathie Wood, the founder of ARK Invest and a longtime Tesla supporter, predicted the plan would still pass ""decisively"" despite opposition from proxy firms and index funds.

She accused them of trying to sway shareholders while doing ""no fundamental research,"" calling index-based investing ""a form of socialism.""

When it's time to retire, a lot of older adults migrate south for warmer climates, cheaper housing, and lower taxes.

While southern cities like Naples and Fort Lauderdale often dominate as destinations for retirees, the Midwest has emerged as a favorable landing spot — at least, according to WalletHub.

WalletHub looked at 182 cities and ranked the best places for retirees based on four key measures: activities, affordability, healthcare, and quality of life. Each of those four categories was weighted equally, however, other relevant metrics were used inside each category and weighted differently. For example, adjusted cost of living was weighted higher than annual cost of in-home services within the affordability category.

""Rounding out the top 10 are cities that balance affordability, access to quality care, and vibrant lifestyles,"" WalletHub writer and analyst Chip Lupo told Business Insider. ""These locales all tend to offer a mix of mild weather, strong local economies, and plenty of ways for retirees to stay active and connected.""

Unsurprisingly, Florida accounted for nearly half of the top 10 for best cities, while California took up more than half of the spots for the worst cities to retire in.

""On the flip side, the bottom 10 cities face challenges that make retirement less appealing. San Bernardino, California; Stockton, California; and Rancho Cucamonga, California, rank among the lowest because of their high costs of living and weaker healthcare access,"" Lupo said.

Southern cities had a healthy showing in the top 10, but the Midwest also had a diverse selection of cities toward the top.

""Minneapolis, which ranks third, stands out for its strong healthcare system, active senior community, and welcoming job market for older adults,"" Lupo said.

When an AI wearable's ad campaign sparked backlash in New York City, Heineken said: Hold my beer.

Friend, the company behind an AI companion you wear around your neck, spent over $1 million to plaster the city's subway system with 11,000 car cards, 1,000 platform posters, and 130 urban panels on September 25. New Yorkers quickly defaced the ads with graffiti like ""surveillance tool"" and ""AI is not your friend.""

Within two weeks, Heineken joined the fray, launching an ad campaign of its own. Friend's signature pendant was replaced with a bottle opener with a similar shape, paired with a witty log line: ""The best way to make a friend is over a beer.""

The campaign is ""tongue-in-cheek"" but reinforces Heineken's belief that ""a refreshing social life matters more than we realize,"" wrote Guilherme de Marchi Retz, Heineken USA's marketing VP, in an email to Business Insider.

""In a culture defined by constant scrolling, it's both timely and intentionally ironic, because we know the best social experiences happen offline,"" he wrote.

Friend's founder, the 22-year-old Avi Schiffmann, has seemed to revel in the attention. Schiffmann called the backlash to Friend's ad campaign ""entertaining"" and even attended an anti-Friend protest.

In an email to Business Insider, Schiffmann wrote that Friend had nothing to do with the Heineken ads.

""I think they're pretty cool & I bought a rack of Heineken to enjoy the night I saw that ad go viral,"" Schiffmann wrote.

Heineken declined to disclose exactly how many impressions the campaign has received. ""Social media engagements and conversations around this campaign have been above the average for similar topical brand activities,"" Retz wrote.

The social media response from many has been gleeful. Six Point Ventures cofounder Trace Cohen posted on X that it was ""next level trolling."" EssenceMediacom Global EVP Michael Miraflor wrote that it was ""Incredible speed for a giant org.""

Heineken isn't necessarily anti-AI. In his email, Retz wrote that Heineken uses the tech to ""optimize logistics"" and support ""creative teams in testing new ideas.""

Heineken previously launched a plan for ""brewing with AI,"" bringing in AI-driven products and supporting AI literacy programs. Their AI goals include operational efficiency, driving smart sales, and hyper-personalized marketing.

But that's where the buck stops. Retz wrote that Heineken saw AI ""as a tool to give our people more time to focus on what really matters: creativity, insight, and connection.""

""Technology should make our lives easier, not replace the human moments that make them meaningful,"" Retz wrote.

(Hopefully) good morning! It wasn't that way for plenty of you yesterday thanks to AWS' outage. From rogue Alexa devices to issues ordering ahead at Starbucks, here's everything that went wrong. One group had a particularly rough one: Wordle users.

In today's big story, Netflix reports earnings this afternoon as the king of streaming tries to retain its crown amid increased competition.

What's on deck:

Markets: Beyond Meat's share price has beefed up. We spoke to a catalyst for its incredible rally.

Tech: Inside the fight over AI usage at a video game giant.

Business: Tinder's bid on keeping you from swiping left on … Tinder.

But first, let's binge.

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.

Are you still watching?

Netflix's somewhat annoying prompt — Yes, I'm still here, melting into my couch enjoying ""Love is Blind."" — is a good jumping off point for the streaming giant's earnings report this afternoon.

Unlike its rivals, Netflix isn't as worried about subscriber growth. (It doesn't even share those numbers anymore; perks of being the big dog.) Instead, Netflix is more focused on what it's doing with the hundreds of millions of subscribers it has collected over the years.

In the not-so-distant future that'll include video podcasts. Netflix recently announced a partnership with Spotify to stream its podcasts.

The deal hit all the highlights of a classic Netflix agreement. There's a level of exclusivity, as Spotify will remove its video podcasts from YouTube, which in many ways represents Netflix's biggest competition.

There's an ad component, as the podcasts' host-read ads will remain in the show. It's unclear if Netflix will include its own ads, but it shows the company is leaning into advertisers.

Video podcasts also represent more live content. Certain shows, like the sports-centric ""The Bill Simmons Podcast,"" have an element of timeliness. That's clearly a priority for Netflix with its big push covering live events like WWE and the NFL that are also a draw for advertisers.

In the meantime, the landscape for streamers has dramatically changed.

Netflix is still the undisputed leader, but a flurry of recent deals and news among its competitors has shown there's still pressure from below.

ESPN: The Worldwide Leader in Sports' big push into streaming is off to a hot start. The full version of ESPN generated 1.2 million subscribers in the US in its first month. That's exceeding analysts estimates, which were that ESPN would nab 1.5 million to 2 millions subscribers by year's end.

Disney+/Hulu: There's good news and bad news. The bad news: Both streamers saw more than double their average cancellations last month. (Jimmy Kimmel, is that you?)

The good news: Another bump in pricing, which starts today, adds more padding to the margins. And Disney's streaming economics are set to get even better when it launches a unified streaming app for Disney+ and Hulu next year.

Paramount: No media company is trying to execute a more dramatic u-turn. The arrival of David Ellison, son of billionaire Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, has taken Paramount from the bottom of the streaming totem poll to one on the rise. It's also entered the live sports fray in a big way by buying the UFC rights.

Prime Video: Amazon MGM Studios, the content machine behind Prime Video, took a big step toward taking on Netflix last month when it hired one of its former executives. Peter Friedlander spent more than a decade at Netflix and is credited with bringing it hits like ""Stranger Things"" and ""Bridgerton."" Now he's tasked with boosting a streamer that captured 3.9% of US TV watch time in August, up 26% year-over-year.

Apple TV: Ok, it's not groundbreaking, but dropping the ""+"" from its name had some brand experts excited. (To be fair, naming these platforms has always been a mess.) It's also dipping its toe further into live sports, acquiring the US rights to F1 races.

Roaring Vegan. Beyond Meat, which makes plant-based meat alternatives, has become the meme stock du jour thanks in large part of Dimitri Semenikhin. BI spoke to the retail investor about his big bet on the one-time penny stock that he says he's bought 4% of.

A new highly risky investment has entered the villa. Asset management firm Volatility Shares is pitching regulators on 27 levered ETFs, including some that are 5x-levered products. The idea is amplify market moves, but it comes with incredible risk. More than half of the leveraged ETFs that launched have closed, and 17% have lost over 98% of their value, Morningstar says.

Mom-and-pop traders have taken a bath on one of the hottest corporate trends. Companies announcing plans to amass bitcoin on their balance sheets to boost their share prices was initially a boon. But a new research report estimates retail traders lost $17 billion betting on these bitcoin treasury companies as some of their share prices have collapsed.

The AI divide roiling Electronic Arts. At the gamemaker, management's enthusiasm for AI is at odds with employees' concerns that it creates more work for them and could replace them. The result is a fundamental lack of trust.

Sora might have a ""pervert"" problem on its hands. OpenAI's video generator allows strangers to make cameos with your face if you allow it. Though nudity and sexual content is banned, fetish content is all over the app, BI's Katie Notopoulos found.

A tech-forward solution to work-visa chaos. Microsoft alumna Priyanka Kulkarni knows firsthand how tricky navigating the US immigration system can be. Now her startup is using AI to help change how companies handle work visas, and it just raised $5 million in a round led by Maverick Ventures.

Inside Tinder's battle for relevance. The dating app is experiencing a cultural reset under CEO Spencer Rascoff, who took over in 2024. Three Tinder leaders told BI how the app is betting on Gen Z and moving faster than before.

Have you tried the next big chicken chain? Raising Cane's is a cult favorite in some parts of the US, but it has limited stores in the Pacific Northwest or East Coast — for now. Joe Ciolli, author of BI's First Trade, breaks down what you need to know about Cane's and why he thinks it'll keep going up.

A rare win for student-loan borrowers. The Department of Education agreed to process more student-loan forgiveness claims and continue relief for borrowers on income-driven repayment plans. It means some borrowers won't be taxed on relief next year.

Warner Bros. Discovery, the conglomerate that owns HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. studio, has officially hung a ""for sale"" sign on itself.

But wait a minute. Didn't Paramount owners Larry and David Ellison already offer to buy WBD? So wasn't it already for sale?

Yes, they did. And yes, it was.

So the right way to view WBD's announcement Tuesday morning, where it said it would conduct ""a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value"" is primarily a formality: WBD has rejected Paramount's bid to buy the company at a reported $20 a share, and wants to see if it can find other bidders to drive up the price. Bankers and lawyers are standing by, and WBD's team would love to give potential bidders a tour of the property.

That's it. That's (mostly) the whole thing.

Next question: Are there any other bidders?

WBD says there are. But note the wording: The company mentioned ""unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.""

Which, if you break it down, means: ""We have at least one offer for the entire company, and at least another offer for the really valuable part of the company — our studio and streaming business.""

That's an important distinction. Here's why: Prior to Paramount bidding for the entire company, WBD planned on splitting itself into two companies. One company would be made up of assets lots of people might want to own — its studio and streaming businesses. The other would be way, way less attractive — its collection of cable TV networks.

So splitting them up, the logic goes, would increase WBD's total value — because investors or acquirers who just wanted the ""good"" part of WBD's business could get that, without being weighed down by its cable TV business. (Comcast is doing a similar split.)

Big Tech companies like Apple, for instance, have been interested in buying HBO in the past, but wanted no part of buying cable TV networks when that industry appears to be in terminal decline.

And some people believe Paramount offered to buy all of WBD not because it really wanted all of WBD's business — but because doing so was cleaner and faster than getting in a bidding war with the likes of Apple for the business it actually wants.

But now WBD is saying that it's willing to consider exactly that kind of transaction: Instead of splitting itself into two companies, it will just sell off the part of the company people really want. Which is, more or less, what Rupert Murdoch did in 2017, when he sold much of his Fox empire to Disney — an example people around WBD are happy to float right now.

And if that's really happening, then the WBD sale story gets much more interesting. Prior to Tuesday, it was hard to imagine anyone interested in competing with the Ellisons — partly because Larry Ellison is the second-richest man in the world, partly because Larry Ellison's closeness with Donald Trump makes a deal more likely to pass regulators, and partly because no one else wanted everything the Ellisons were offering to buy.

But if WBD is really willing to sell its prime real estate, things get more interesting. Apple would almost certainly take a look at Warner Bros. and HBO. So would Comcast. And even Netflix — though co-CEO Greg Peters was pretty dismissive of big M&A earlier this month — might reconsider.

The space race is on — but this time it will be between American rocket companies.

Sean Duffy, the acting NASA administrator, said in a Monday interview on ""Fox & Friends"" that Elon Musk's SpaceX is ""behind schedule"" on the Artemis III project, the mission that plans to land NASA astronauts back on the moon.

SpaceX, which Duffy said was an ""amazing company"" that does ""remarkable things,"" dominates the space rocket industry and has become one of the most valuable private companies in the world, alongside OpenAI. Meanwhile, a crop of other rocket companies from Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to Rocket Lab seeks to gain ground.

""I'm in the process of opening that contract up. I think we'll see companies like Blue get involved, and maybe others,"" Duffy said, referencing Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin. ""We're going to have a space race in regard to American companies competing to see who can actually get us back to the moon first.""

SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Musk, however, responded to Duffy's comments in an X post on Monday evening.

He said another company wouldn't reach the moon faster than SpaceX, as his firm ""is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry.""

""Moreover, Starship will end up doing the whole Moon mission,"" he added. ""Mark my words.""

NASA hopes to complete the moon mission between one and a half to two years from now, before the end of President Donald Trump's term, Duffy said. He added that the president is focused on beating China back to the moon, and thinks the competition will help ensure NASA meets that goal. Other companies currently supporting the overall Artemis mission include Blue Origin, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin.

A little COMPETITION doesn't hurt and it spurs INNOVATION! 💡American companies are going to be able to compete to see which one can get us back to the Moon first. 🇺🇸We going to beat China there and we are going to do it under @POTUS! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/PbZ8gbLSL8

""A little COMPETITION doesn't hurt and it spurs INNOVATION!"" Duffy wrote in a post on X on Monday.

""We going to beat China there and we are going to do it under @POTUS!"" he added.

We need to talk about something uncomfortable when it comes to Sora 2 — OpenAI's new video-making app that I've truly enjoyed using.

Looking at some of the videos people have made — starring me — a little red light went off in my mind: This looks like fetish content.

Here's what happened: A few days into playing around with Sora, I noticed an unsettling video someone had made of me. I've allowed anyone to make ""cameos"" using my face. (You don't have to do this: You can choose settings that make your likeness private, or open to just your friends — but I figured, why not? And left my likeness open to everyone, just like Sam Altman.)

I found a stranger had made a video where I appeared pregnant. A quick look at the user's profile, and I saw that this person's entire Sora profile was made up of this genre — video after video of women with big, pregnant bellies. I recognized immediately what this was: fetish content.

Like I said, I'd been having a lot of fun on Sora, letting friends and even strangers make silly videos with my face. But the idea that someone was making a video that had some potential sexual gratification element made me feel fairly icked out.

Over the next week or so, I noticed a few more videos that I immediately recognized from years of poking around the underbelly of the internet as niche fetishes: belly inflation videos where my stomach inflated massively, Violet Beaugregard-style, or giantess videos where I and two other women towered over a cityscape (and another where we were miniature). Some of these accounts make these kinds of videos with purely AI-generated women, not cameos of real people — I found a bunch of accounts like this dedicated to making vore, foot worship, crushing, and other niche, non-nude fetishes.

At first, it was just one or two videos. But it picked up steam. In the last week or so, 10 out of the 25 most popular cameos using my face are various fetishes, including one where I'm a centaur-woman pregnant with octoplets. It's not just me, either. I've seen this kind of content made with cameos of other women: female creators, another woman tech reporter, and a female employee of a prominent venture-capital firm.

As a journalist who has covered internet culture for a long time, I've seen enough hand-drawn images of Sonic the Hedgehog showing feet and pregnant Barack Obama over the years not to be shocked or to yuck someone's yum. I've also experienced enough online harassment that I have a thick skin about this stuff. But there is something different and unsettling here: It's people being able to use my face (easily) to create content for potential sexual gratification without my consent. And if I, an internet-poisoned person, feel weird about this, I imagine a normal person really would hate it.

OpenAI is clearly still working out the kinks (no pun intended) with its AI video app Sora 2. Launched only this month, it's still invite-only but has topped the App Store charts. The obvious initial concerns were around misinformation and potentially copyright-infringing content. The first few days of Sora were rife with non-sanctioned versions of Pokémon, ""Family Guy"" or Nintendo characters.

OpenAI didn't respond to my multiple requests for comment for this story.

Sora doesn't allow you to make videos with the likenesses of living celebrities, although it does allow for dead celebrities. This led to a massive wave of videos starring Bob Ross, Stephen Hawking, and Martin Luther King, Jr. After complaints from the King family, OpenAI announced it was ""pausing"" use of the likeness of Dr. King.

This is part of an overall pattern of how OpenAI has approached the concept of copyright and intellectual property: asking forgiveness, not permission.

Whether that pattern extends to how non-nude, quasi-sexual content is being made on Sora will be another question.

Apart from the pregnancy and inflation fetishes, there was some other troubling content I saw. A popular female porn star is on Sora, and I saw a handful of videos of young men who looked to be under 18 making videos of themselves or their friends with her. One video was of her and another boy lying in bed together (fully clothed). He appeared to be maybe 11 years old.

I came across other gray-area videos, like an adult man who had made about 20 videos with variations of a prompt asking for a preteen girl in a grass skirt, dancing.

OpenAI has announced new parental controls for teen accounts, which would potentially limit how adults and teens could interact on something like Sora. It's unclear what its rules around something like this are — is it OK for teenage accounts to interact with porn stars on Sora? Can adults create cameos of kids? I'm not sure!

There are really two separate issues at hand: Should users be allowed to make fetish content of any woman who is stupid enough (like me) to allow anyone to make cameos of her? And how do you stop people from making fetish content of purely AI-generated characters that aren't cameos of real people? Does OpenAI want to stop that? Maybe OpenAI thinks it's fine for people to make belly-flation or foot-fetish videos as long as they're not of a real person.

For now, I keep going back to a thought I had early on while scrolling Sora: There's hardly any women on here, and it's no wonder why. Women innately understand the risk of letting anyone make videos with their faces — the likelihood of something being creepy is extremely high. These fetish videos are kind of goofy — I have to admit I even cracked up a little at the centaur one — but overall, it's an icky and somewhat menacing feeling seeing a lot of them.

Although this genre of content has always existed online, it's never been so easy to make it using a real person's face. OpenAI has anticipated the most obvious content violations with nudity or overtly sexual content, but it might not have anticipated the wave of niche fetish videos now flooding the app.

This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Davy Sanh, 39, a former manager at Grab who left his corporate career to launch Pop Padel, a padel club in Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I started my career with KPMG in Paris, spending five years as an auditor. I'm originally from France and moved to Singapore in 2014.

In total, I spent about 15 years in corporate across three different companies. Toward the end, in 2024, I was earning a six-figure salary as a manager at Grab.

I was good at my job, but not excellent. I saw my peers hopping on the right train, and they would move faster.

I felt, where can I be better than just good?

I left corporate about a year ago to start Pop Padel.

Padel is known for being one of the fastest-growing sports in the world. It's new, easy to adopt, social, and the barrier to entry is a lot lower than, for example, tennis. Games are also shorter, which appeals more to the way our new generation is consuming sport.

Seeing how much the sport has been growing in other countries in the world — in Europe and in the Middle East — there was no reason it wouldn't pick up in Asia.

I did consider though, was I the right person for this?

My background in tennis and expertise in the area gave me an edge. It was a risk worth taking because I also embrace the sport myself.

I have been a racket sports player my whole life, so I know the behavioral pattern of the players, what they like when they step into a club.

My friends and family saw my genuine passion and desire to grow the sport.

They were like, how can you spend so much time in tennis, not just playing, but observing, memorizing all the scores, watching every single game, following all the results as soon as you wake up — and not monetize it?

There was a big round of fundraising we had to do. Most of the time, people did not take part.

I've had to overcome not getting disheartened and taking it personally when people choose not to journey with me.

We had to put together a very strong pitch with strong and sensible numbers. That's where my background as an auditor and an accountant with KPMG helped.

My selling point was my expertise and knowledge in the racket sports world and my ability to connect worldwide with early movers and shakers of the industry. I was able to grow a large community of players here very quickly. There was a movement that I created, and they saw how genuine I was in doing this.

Some of the investors were even part of this group of players themselves. They saw the hard work, and they took a leap of faith and invested.

If you do your research right and you show passion and dedication, people will follow you.

We secured a seven-figure investment from Apricot Capital, a Singapore-based private investment firm, and opened our first outlet outside of Singapore in Malaysia in September.

Padel is popular among high-net-worth individuals. People say padel is the new golf in terms of the potential for networking.

Because the space is smaller, when you book a game of two hours, it's essentially four people playing together. It's a prime time that you get with the person that you potentially want to socialize or network with.

High-net-worth individuals like to look for opportunities to network. But they tell me that they are fed up with the traditional way of networking — dining, going for F&B events. Those are always a bit stiff, and they have to care about how they dress and look.

In padel, it's raw, bold, and authentic. We sweat like crazy, and we don't look great on the court. We are mostly beginners at this point — it levels everyone out.

When you're an entrepreneur, you wake up, you get on your laptop. Before I go to bed, I bring my laptop into the bed and I continue working.

When it's a project that you hold so close to your heart, you can't just spend like one or two hours not thinking about it.

I try to find time to play and join the games. For our patrons, it's also good for them to see me. I like to spend time with them, get to know them better.

It's fulfilling because we are talking about sport, making people healthier and happier.

It's also fulfilling to see that whatever you've conceptualized — in terms of coaching, lessons, program, and social tournament — the feedback is great.

People come out of the court with a smile.

When I was in the corporate world, my ambition was standard: looking forward to my next promotion. But it's self-centered and egocentric.

With this project, the ambition has grown a lot wider. I do have the ambition to grow the Pop Padel brand, but I'm realizing how much this sport can empower people and make a positive impact.

Coca-Cola's foray into coffee is losing its buzz. Now, the drink giant is rethinking its approach, its CEO said.

Seven years ago, Coke paid about $5.1 billion for Costa Coffee, a UK-based chain of coffee shops. While Coca-Cola didn't have a lot of experience operating cafés, the deal gave the company a foothold in the coffee industry, which it viewed as a key growth area.

Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said on the company's earnings call on Tuesday that ""the investment hypothesis didn't work out as we expected."" He said the company hoped to see ""much more growth"" outside the retail stores that make up its core business.

Coca-Cola makes most of its money selling drink concentrates and other ingredients to partner companies that manufacture and sell the beverages that customers buy in restaurants and stores.

Still, Quincey said coffee is a ""super attractive category"" that's large and profitable for Coca-Cola. It has invested in Costa's UK stores and expanded the use of automated coffee machines that use the Costa name, he said.

The business ""just didn't create a multiplier so far that we are looking for,"" Quincey said.

Coca-Cola is ""reflecting"" on what its coffee business should look like going forward, he said.

In August, Reuters reported that Coca-Cola was working with an investment bank to explore a sale of Costa. Quincey did not address a potential sale of Costa on Tuesday's call.

Coke's stock was up about 4% on Tuesday after the company reported that net sales grew 5% to $12.46 billion in the third quarter.

Besides Costa, Coca-Cola has also experimented with a version of its eponymous drink mixed with coffee.

A United Airlines jet whose windscreen was broken while flying at 36,000 feet may have struck a high-altitude weather balloon.

Investigators are looking into how the jet, which was operating United Flight 1093 from Denver to Los Angeles last Thursday, sustained damage to its windshield in midair.

37 minutes after takeoff, near the Utah city of Moab, the Boeing 737 Max began unexpectedly descending, per data from Flightradar24.

After another 10 minutes, it abruptly turned north and diverted to Salt Lake City.

In an X post on Sunday, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating ""a cracked windscreen on a Boeing 737-8 during cruise flight.""

It added that the NTSB is gathering radar, weather, and flight recorder data. The windscreen is being sent to the agency's labs.

One potential explanation for the damage came from John Dean, CEO of WindBorne, which operates weather balloons.

In a Monday evening X post, he said he believed Flight 1093 was hit by a WindBorne balloon, and that the firm is working with the NTSB.

Dean added that the firm shares all live balloon positions with regulators, and he found images of the damage ""extremely concerning.""

United confirmed to Business Insider that the plane's windshield had been damaged, adding that the ""plane landed safely in Salt Lake City to address damage to its multilayered windshield.""

Plane windscreens are designed with several layers so that they can still function safely in case any individual layer is damaged.

xJonNYC, an aviation enthusiast who runs popular accounts on X and Bluesky, was first to report details of the damage.

Photo NOT confirmed Hearing there were scorch-marks, so space-debris or meteorite. pic.twitter.com/ird6QKEZv8

He shared photos that appeared to show the broken windshield, glass in the cockpit, and the captain's bloodied forearm.

The plane also appeared to have scorch marks, suggesting that it could have been damaged by space debris or a small meteorite.

Business Insider has not independently verified the images shared on X.

In its statement to Business Insider, United added that passengers on the original plane were put on a new plane, noting that its ""maintenance team is working to return the aircraft to service.""

The second Boeing 737 Max landed in Los Angeles at 1:12 p.m. PT, about five and a half hours behind schedule.

Meanwhile, the original plane flew to Chicago Rockford Airport on Sunday. A maintenance facility there has previously said it performs work on United's 737s.

The momentum in Beyond Meat stock continued on Tuesday, and the trader who's been making the case for the faux meat company says the rally could have a lot more gas in the tank.

Shares of the company soared 146% to $3.62 on Tuesday, eclipsing Monday's 128% gain. The fresh rise comes as the plant-based meat maker was added to a popular meme stock ETF, while the company also announced an expanded distribution agreement with Walmart.

To be sure, the stock is still down year-to-date, but the recent rally has ignited a burst of enthusiasm from the retail cohort, at the center of which is a trader named Dimitri Semenikhin.

He told Business Insider this week that he's the Redditor and YouTuber known as Capybara Stocks. He's been detailing his bullish outlook for the stock, posting on Reddit last week that he had bought about one twentieth of the shares outstanding and following that up with a video titled ""Why I've purchased 4% of Beyond Meat stock.""

Prior to this week's gains, Semenikhin said that he saw the stock popping to $2 to $3 a share. Now that it's trading firmly in the middle of that range, he said on Tuesday that the stock could keep going given the latest burst of momentum.

Reached by text message, the Dubai-based trader and real estate developer said Beyond Meat shares could hit $6 apiece, another 104% gain from Tuesday's high of $2.93.

He admitted that he didn't expect his posts to garner the attention that they have, saying that he simply believed investors were misinterpreting its upside potential due to misconceptions regarding recent events.

The core of his original thesis, detailed in his seven-minute YouTube video, is the exchange of convertible notes that Beyond Meat recently completed with bondholders. ""It is critical to understand this event if you are to consider the stock, as it is what has triggered this opportunity and volatility,"" an AI-generated newscaster tells viewers in the video.

Some key points from Semenikhin's post:

""If there are three things you need to remember about my investment thesis on Beyond Meat, they are: a fundamentally misunderstood conversion event, a technical setup leading to a potential short squeeze, and a strong balance sheet and book value post-converison."" Semenikhin said.

The technical fundamentals aren't the only reason Semenikhin is bullish, though. He highlighted its distribution expansion with Walmart, which also came with an announcement of offerings containing more protein and fewer GMOs, as a positive catalyst.

""For the first time in a long time for Beyond Meat, there's a road to profitability and growth that's being written.""

In this article

DraftKings is acquiring predictions platform Railbird as it prepares to launch a mobile platform in the coming months to be called DraftKings Predictions.

Railbird is licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to offer an event contracts exchange. DraftKings targeted the company for its team and proprietary technology. 

""We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business,"" DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC. ""We believe that Railbird's team and platform—combined with DraftKings' scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.""

Predictions markets allow customers to trade on the outcomes of various events in the worlds of finance, culture and entertainment, which will allow DraftKings to expand beyond its sports betting business. The markets on election outcomes and sports are the most controversial.  

Dozens of states, their gaming regulators and tribes are suing or taking other actions to try to prohibit companies from offering trades based on sporting events, because they see it as unlicensed gambling.  

Nevada is among the states warning that companies risk losing their gambling licenses if they offer sports in their prediction markets.

If DraftKings offers sports events contracts, it's likely to focus only on states that don't offer licensed sports betting, like California and Texas, to avoid running afoul of the states where it offers sports betting.  Additionally, technology exists to prevent those sports trades from being available on tribal lands.  

DraftKings also may offer more advanced ""know your customer"" guardrails, a term commonly used to reference identity verification, given its experience in the regulated gambling market.

In this article

A day ahead of Tesla's quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.

On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.

Tesla's board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company's annual meeting next month.

On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package ""outrageous,"" in part because Musk's ""political activities have damaged Tesla's brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla."" The site says the plan doesn't require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.

The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.

""Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,"" the site says. ""That's our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.""

Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People's Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.

Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk's previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.

Following those firms' suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, ""ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla's proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced."" The company added that shareholders who sold would ""have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.""

The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.

Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.

Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, ""I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control."" The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.

Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI's ChatGPT.

By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he ""vociferously opposes this pay package"" and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.

""Most of the time we've held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it's grown over time, and that's why we haven't chosen to dump it,"" Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he's preferred to ""hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.""

Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.

He said he views Tesla's board he as ""insufficiently independent,"" and that it's allowed Musk to be an ""absentee CEO."" The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.

The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it's still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.

Musk has ""been an inconsistent CEO at best,"" Lander said, ""and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.""

Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

In this article

OpenAI on Tuesday announced ChatGPT Atlas, a new artificial intelligence-powered web browser.

The company said Atlas looks and feels similar to existing browsers, but is built around OpenAI's generative chatbot ChatGPT. That means users will be able to access ChatGPT to create summaries, ask questions and complete tasks as they navigate across any page on the web.

""We think that AI represents a rare once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during a livestream on Tuesday.

The launch of Atlas puts OpenAI in direct competition with rivals like Google and Perplexity AI, which are jostling to attract users and win market share with their own browser offerings.

Perplexity rolled out its Comet browser for free earlier this month, and Google embedded a Gemini model within its Chrome browser in September.

Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, closed down 2% following OpenAI's announcement. 

Atlas users will see an ""Ask ChatGPT"" button on the top right corner of every web page, and clicking it will open up the chatbot in a companion sidebar.

Since ChatGPT will follow users across the web with Atlas, there is no need to copy and paste between tabs, Adam Fry, the product lead for Atlas at OpenAI, said during the livestream.

The browser is also equipped with memory, which will help it understand users and become more personalized over time, he said. If users forget where they saw a piece of information, for instance, they could use the homepage to type in a prompt like ""search web history for a doc about Atlas core design.""

Atlas also has an agent mode, which means that ChatGPT can take actions for users and complete tasks like booking reservations, flights, shopping or editing a document.

""It's got all your stuff, it's clicking around for you, you can watch it,"" Altman said. ""You don't have to, but it's really — it's using the internet for you.""

ChatGPT Atlas is available to macOS users worldwide, though agent mode is only available to Plus and Pro users. OpenAI said experiences for Windows, iOS and Android are coming soon.

""There's a lot more to add. This is still early days for this project,"" Altman said.

In this article

Shares of Netflix fell around 7% in extended trading Tuesday after the company posted a third-quarter earnings miss, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities for the weaker-than-estimated results.

The streamer said the specific expense, stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, was not previously in its forecast. The company decided to charge the impact to its third quarter after it became reasonably likely that Netflix would lose a legal challenge over whether it would be assessed the tax, executives said. 

""It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming,"" Chief Financial Officer Spence Neumann said on the company's earnings call. ""Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast, and we don't expect this matter to have a have a material impact on our results going."" 

Revenue for Netflix's third quarter rose 17%, in line with analyst expectations, boosted by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. For the fourth quarter, Netflix expects revenue to rise 17% year over year as those trends continue.

Here's how the company did in the period ended September 30, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Netflix reported third-quarter net income of $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $2.36 billion, or $5.40, in the same quarter a year prior.

For the full-year, Netflix is projecting $45.1 billion in revenue, a 16% jump from the year prior and in line with previous expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 16%.

The company did alter its operating margin forecast for the year, citing the Brazilian tax matter, and now expects that metric to be 29% instead of the prior projection of 30%. 

Still, Netflix said it posted its best ad sales quarter ever during the period, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting that the company is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.

""Netflix had its best ad sales quarter to date, but still did not provide a figure for how large the ad business is,"" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer, in a statement. ""This gives the impression that the sustained revenue growth achieved this quarter, and forecasted for next quarter, will predominantly continue to come from subscription fees.""

Netflix raised its prices in January, including the cost of its ad-supported tier.

The streamer's fourth-quarter slate of content contains a number of alluring titles, from the fifth and final season of ""Strangers Things"" and new seasons of ""The Diplomat"" and ""Nobody Wants This"" to Guillermo del Toro's ""Frankenstein"" and Rian Johnson's ""Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives out Mystery.""

Netflix is also still riding the coattails of ""KPop Demon Hunters,"" which was released on the platform back in June. The animated film has become Netflix's most-watched film with more than 325 million views on the platform.

Netflix announced Tuesday it's expanding the animated film's consumer reach with a dual product partnership with leading toy companies Hasbro and Mattel. ""KPop Demon Hunters"" dolls, plush, roleplay items and themed games will be available at retail in spring 2026. 

The company also noted that it is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. ""KPop Demon Hunters"" is returning to theaters once again during the Halloween holiday weekend.

In this article

HBO Max is the latest streaming services to raise its prices.

The streaming giant, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Tuesday that it is raising prices across all plans. HBO Max's Basic with ads plan is increasing $1 a month to $10.99, the Standard plan is going up $1.50 to $18.49, and Premium is increasing $2 to $22.99. HBO Max last raised prices in June 2024.

The price hikes are effective immediately for new subscriptions. Existing monthly subscribers will be notified 30 days in advance of their plan renewing, with the new prices starting on their next billing date on or after November 20, the company said. 

The updates come as the streaming market becomes increasingly saturated with options — and as other major apps hike their prices. Disney raised the price of its Disney+ plans and bundles last month, Apple hiked the price of Apple TV by 30% in August and Netflix raised its prices early this year.

WBD CEO David Zaslav indicated in September that price increases were on the way along with a stricter crackdown on sharing passwords.

""The fact that this is quality, and that's true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality, we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,"" Zaslav said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference last month. ""We think we're way underpriced.""

As of June 30, WBD said it had 125.7 million paying subscribers to all of its streaming services. That stat includes HBO Max as well as other legacy linear subscribers to HBO, who have access to the streaming service.

HBO Max's news comes as its parent company, WBD, undergoes changes of its own. The company announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. A streaming and studios company would include its movie properties and HBO Max, while a global networks business would include linear channels like CNN and TNT Sports. 

At the same time, WBD is fielding takeout interest from companies including Paramount Skydance and said Tuesday it's open to a sale.

Republican Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska on Tuesday warned President Donald Trump that his proposal for the U.S. to buy Argentina's beef will hurt American cattle ranchers and fail to lower prices.

""Bottom line: if the goal is addressing beef prices at the grocery store, this isn't the way,"" Fischer wrote in an X post.

Trump floated the idea over the weekend as a way to bring down beef costs, which have soared in the U.S. this year.

The tentative plan would involve further U.S. investment in Argentina, the South American nation whose teetering economy has recently been buoyed by a $20 billion currency swap deal with the Trump administration.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that the U.S. is considering providing Argentina another $20 billion in financing. Argentina President Javier Milei is a close ally of Trump.

Fischer wrote Tuesday morning that she has reached out to the Trump administration to express ""deep concerns"" about the possible Argentine beef buy.

""I've also been sounding the alarm on the bleak state of our ag economy and the negative impacts facing Nebraska's ag industry — the economic driver of our state,"" Fischer wrote.

""Right now, government intervention in the beef market will hurt our cattle ranchers. The U.S. has safe, reliable beef, and it is the one bright spot in our struggling ag economy,"" the senator wrote.

""Nebraska's ranchers cannot afford to have the rug pulled out from under them when they're just getting ahead or simply breaking even,"" she wrote.

""I strongly encourage the Trump administration to focus on trade deals that benefit our ag producers — not imports that will do more harm than good.""

Trump told reporters on Air Force One Sunday that his administration is ""thinking about doing"" the beef deal with Argentina.

""We would buy some beef from Argentina,"" Trump said. ""If we do that, that will bring our beef prices down.""

Asked to respond to U.S. farmers who feel that that deal would benefit Argentina over themselves, Trump was dismissive.

""Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don't know anything about it,"" he said.

""If I can help them survive in a free world — I happen to like the president of Argentina. I think he's trying to do the best he can. But don't make it sound like they're doing great. They are dying,"" Trump said.

The president's comments quickly raised alarms with U.S. cattle ranchers.

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said in a statement Monday that its farmers and ranchers ""are concerned that rewarding Argentina with this expanded access to the U.S. market harms American cattlemen and women, while also interfering with the free market.""

""This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,"" NCBA CEO Colin Woodall said in the same press release.

The Trump administration's financial assistance for Buenos Aires had already drawn the ire of American soybean producers, who are reeling from the loss of China as a top customer due to the ongoing trade war with the U.S.

China has started buying soybeans from Argentina, which reportedly suspended export taxes last month — a move that coincided with Trump's pledge to help Milei.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, asked Tuesday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" about buying Argentine beef, noted that Trump ""has mentioned it a couple of times.""

""I think you'll be hearing more about exactly what that looks like,"" she said.

Rollins said the beef industry in the U.S. has become massively consolidated in recent years, which has resulted in thousands of farms closing.

""The prices are high. The president is very focused on his promise of keeping grocery prices down, but he's also very focused, and you'll hear more from us perhaps in the next day or two, on what we're are going to do to incentivize"" people to become ranchers, Rollins said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a statement to CNBC, did not directly address Fischer's concerns about the Argentina proposal.

""While prices for other proteins such as eggs, pork and chicken have declined in recent months, beef prices remain elevated. This is due to the perfect storm of sustained increase in consumer demand for beef coupled with a prolonged decrease in the supply of live cattle,"" a USDA spokesperson said.

""Building back the herd will take time but Secretary Rollins is committed to reduce risk for cattle producers, deliver robust disaster relief to cattle country, and support new and beginning ranchers across the country,"" the spokesperson said.

In this article

Beyond Meat has regained a bit of its meme mojo status, surging more than 146% on Tuesday in its best day ever.

The food company known for its plant-based meat alternatives is having an incredible week, with shares surging more than 127% Monday after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME).

It continued that rally on Tuesday, when Beyond Meat announced a deal with Walmart to expand distribution to more stores across the U.S.

It appears the ETF addition has unleashed a short squeeze with investors who bet against the stock forced to cover their position. More than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short, per FactSet.

It's a remarkable turnaround for a stock that tumbled more than 67% just last week, after the company announced it has finalized a debt deal. The stock is currently trading around $2 per share, after ending last week at just 65 cents.

Indeed, the stock has been under pressure for many years, posting losing returns over each of the last five years. After surging past $230 per share following its IPO in 2019, it has since become a penny stock.

Yet this week's rally harkens back to when Beyond Meat enjoyed meme stock status among retail traders, who crowded into the stock based more on sentiment than on corporate fundamentals after coordinating on online message boards.

In 2021, Bank of America called Beyond Meat a Reddit stock to watch. It ended that same year down more than 47%.

The return of Beyond Meat could also be the latest sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names in spite of elevated valuations, and possibly a signal of a market top.

Roundhill actually shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest, but revived it earlier this month as retail traders dive back into this relentless bull market.

SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy after he told media outlets this week that the billionaire's space company is falling behind U.S. plans to return to the moon.

""The person responsible for America's space program can't have a 2 digit IQ,"" Musk wrote in a Tuesday post on X.

In response to other user posts, Musk referred to the Transportation secretary as ""*Sean Dummy"" and said he is ""trying to kill NASA!"" Musk later posted a poll asking users ""Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America's space program?"" Musk appeared to be referring to Duffy's background as a competitive speed climber.

On Monday, Duffy told CNBC that SpaceX was ""behind"" schedule on building its lunar landing system for the space agency's Artemis III mission and that he would consider other contracts with competitors such as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.

SpaceX and Blue Origin will have until Oct. 29 to offer ways to speed up the project, a NASA official told CNBC. The agency will also ask the industry to suggest ways to ""increase the cadence"" of Moon missions.

President Donald Trump selected Duffy to become the acting NASA administrator in July. The position had been vacant since the start of Trump's presidency. Trump had previously nominated Musk ally Jared Isaacman, but he pulled the nomination earlier this year, saying he was a ""blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.""

CNBC reported earlier this month that Trump has held talks with Isaacman to reconsider the role.

NASA is racing against China and others to get humans back to the moon for the first time since 1972. The space agency launched the Artemis project under Trump's first administration with the goal of creating a ""long-term presence"" on the moon for science and tech discovery.

SpaceX won a $2.9 billion contract to build the technology in 2021. Other contractors such as Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are participating in various stages of the program.

But the project has been fraught with setbacks.

NASA launched its first Artemis mission in November 2022. Last December, the agency delayed its planned Artemis missions. NASA's first Artemis launch with astronauts is now slated for April 2026, with a third mission to land two astronauts on the moon planned for 2027.

Now, the space agency is also grappling with the aftershocks from an ongoing government shutdown that threatens to stall any plans to reopen contracts. NASA made exceptions for employees and contractors working on Artemis missions to keep working during the shutdown, CNBC previously reported.

When Musk worked at the helm of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, NASA faced sweeping, anti-DEI-related reductions in force, and implemented deferred resignation programs that have slashed the space agency's workforce.

Around 4,000 NASA employees accepted the deferred resignation program offers since Trump took office for his second term, which reduced the staff of the space agency by nearly one-fifth.

Lauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, said the surge in enthusiasm around artificial intelligence has all the markings of a bubble.

""We are absolutely in an AI bubble now. It is going to burst,"" she said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Tuesday to David Faber. ""I don't know when, I don't know the order of magnitude. A lot of people are going to lose money.""

Her remarks come as enthusiasm for AI continues to drive markets higher, with investors betting the technology will transform industries and lift corporate earnings. Taylor Wolfe said investors are underestimating the risks tied to the surge in AI-related spending by major technology companies.

""There are trillions of dollars that are being earmarked to be spent relative to hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow generated by the Mag 7,"" she said, referring to the group of large-cap tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500. ""They're going to have to borrow to invest in all this CapEx, and we have yet to see the returns on investment.""

Her remarks come at a time when analysis shows the S&P 500 has become pretty much an AI index.

Taylor Wolfe believes the mismatch between capital expenditures and profit potential makes current valuations difficult to justify.

""Show me the trillions of dollars of profits that are going to be generated in the next five years,"" she said. ""And you just can't. The math doesn't work.""

She said the current environment is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when investors chased anything associated with the internet regardless of valuation or business model. During the dotcom era, the right thing to do wasn't short the bubble companies; it was to look where no one else was looking, she said.

""You'd have been better off owning a railroad in 2000 than buying Cisco at 35 times earnings, Taylor Wolfe said. ""So at Impactive, what we're doing today is looking for our railroads.""

At the 13D Monitor's Active-Passive Investor Summit Tuesday, Taylor Wolfe presented her new idea Advanced Drainage Systems, which she called the undisputed leader in plastic stormwater and residential septic systems. She said the company is AI proof.

In this article

Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg must testify at the first trial for a lawsuit alleging adverse effects of social media on younger users, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Monday.

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Instagram's Adam Mosseri will also need to testify at trial, which is slated to begin January, Judge Carolyn Kuhl ruled. The ruling followed a hearing on Monday where lawyers argued against the CEOs taking the witness stand.

""The testimony of a CEO is uniquely relevant, as that officer's knowledge of harms, and failure to take available steps to avoid such harms could establish negligence or ratification of negligent conduct,"" she wrote.

Kuhl ruled that their testimonies would be ""unique,"" given the allegations that social media companies failed to warn users of features created to ""be addictive"" and ""drive compulsive"" behaviors in minors.

Law360 was first to report the judge's order.

Meta declined to comment. CNBC has reached out to Snap for comment.

The pending trial is one of many alleging that social media technology companies have deliberately created platforms and features that cause harm to younger users and damage their mental health.

Earlier this month, New York City filed a lawsuit against several companies, arguing that they created addictive platforms that contribute to mental health issues among children. Last January, CEOs, including Zuckerberg, testified at a Senate hearing on ways to protect children from the harms of social media.

Meta motioned to stop Zuckerberg and Mosseri from testifying at the trial and argued for plaintiffs to use previous trial testimony. The company said making both CEOs attend more in-person trials would interfere with business and ""set a precedent"" to appear at other related trials.

Snap argued that ordering Spiegel to testify would be an ""abuse of discretion.""

Kirkland & Ellis, the law firm representing Snap, said the decision by the court does ""not bear at all on the validity"" of the claims in a statement to CNBC.

""While we believed that the previous hours of deposition testimony and numerous other executives who may testify was sufficient, we look forward to the opportunity to explain why Plaintiffs' allegations against Snapchat are wrong factually and as a matter of law,"" they wrote.

Bitcoin BTC$110,411.69 is catching a bid on Tuesday as the record rally in precious metals reverses in a big way.

Gold saw a 5% decline to $4,130, its biggest daily drawdown in years. Silver also tumbled nearly 8%. The metals had surged over the past few months fueled by central banks moving into monetary easing mode, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and signs of liquidity and credit stress in the financial system. Frustratingly to bitcoin bulls, though, those catalysts had provided little boost to the world's largest crypto, which — with a couple of brief exceptions — has remained stuck in a tight range for months.

With the metals for at least this moment having fallen out of favor, however, money is flowing into bitcoin, which has rebounded to $112,700 after having dropped below $108,000 just hours ago. Ether ETH$3,940.57 also erased its overnight decline, bouncing back above $4,000.

Quinn Thomson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, said last week that BTC is poised to catch up to gold's rally. Charlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree, also argued that bitcoin's time to rally will come when gold rolls over to consolidate.

Crypto-related stocks haven't really gotten the news, with most in the red on Tuesday, particularly the bitcoin miners, many of which are now trading more as AI infrastructure plays.

IREN (IREN), Hut 8 (HUT) and Bitfarms (BITF) are lower by 3%-4%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is down 1.2% and Coinbase (COIN) is lower by 0.5%. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is managing a 1.7% gain.

Bitcoin and Ethereum rose on Tuesday as gold's price headed toward its biggest daily drop in over a decade, indicating renewed appetite for risk-taking among investors.

Bitcoin was recently trading around $112,000, a 1% increase over the past day, according to CoinGecko. The largest crypto by market capitalization climbed as high as $114,000 earlier in the day. Ethereum, the second largest crypto by market value, was trading at about $4,000, a 0.7% gain over the same period of time. Ethereum traded as high as $4,100 earlier Tuesday.

Tuesday's crypto rise came as gold fell 5.5% to $4,118 per ounce, according to Trading Economics. After the precious metal surged to a record of $4,382 per ounce on Monday, that represented its biggest daily drop since April 2013.

Despite his recent tariff threats, U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he thinks China is open to “a really fair and really great trade deal,” per Bloomberg. On Tuesday, the outlet reported that Trump is still eager to meet with China's Xi Jinping.

Plummeting gold prices reflect easing geopolitical tensions, according to Jake Ostrovskis, head of OTC trading at market maker Wintermute. He told Decrypt it's plausible that Tuesday's move also stems from fast money unwinding overextended long positions.

“Bitcoin seems to be capitalizing on this shift, with mercenary capital finding relative value,” he told Decrypt. “One day doesn't make a trend, but it's an interesting narrative to keep an eye on.”

Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at market maker GSR, told Decrypt that crypto prices were likely buoyed by strong earning results on Wall Street. General Motors, for example, raised guidance on reduced tariff exposure for the automaker.

“We're off to a strong start for earnings season,” he said.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the latest inflation figures on Friday. Economists expect the Consumer Price index to show a 3.1% increase in the 12 months through September, indicating that inflation is increasing.

Still, Guzman said recent remarks from Federal Reserve officials suggest the central bank is focused on preserving the labor market's health, and as a result, is likely to cut interest rates.

“As long as [CPI] comes in within expectations, it should be a huge market mover.” he said, noting that risk assets like stocks and crypto tend to benefit from cheaper borrowing costs. “If it is significantly higher than expectations, I do think that'll be pretty bearish.”

Guzman added that narratives around the debasement of the U.S. dollar have fueled interest in gold, to the extent that the trade appeared “pretty crowded.” Tuesday's drop in gold prices looked more like a technical correction than anything else, he added.

The sentiment was echoed by David Hernandez, a crypto investment strategist at 21Shares, an issuer of crypto-focused exchange-traded products. The split between Bitcoin and gold reflects investors repositioning on hopes of dovish Fed policy.

“The divergence signals a tactical rotation, not a structural regime change: capital moving from an overbought safe haven into higher-risk assets with more upside,” he said. “Easing U.S.-China tensions briefly reduced the urgency for safe-haven exposure.” 

Some influential voices on Crypto Twitter were eager to suggest that the precious metal's price had peaked on Tuesday, including Zion Thomas, who is better known online at Ansem. “Finally,” Thomas said on X, in reference to a chart showing Bitcoin up and gold down.

Despite saying that Bitcoin's value would eventually surpass gold's $28.69 trillion market cap on Monday, Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao indicated that the precious metal will likely serve as an alternative store of value for years to come.

“Gold won't go to zero,” he said on X. “But Bitcoin is better.”

Oops, something went wrong

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on Tuesday, confirmed the purchase of $25 million UpOnly NFT from well-known crypto trader Cobie.

“The rumors are true, we bought the NFT,” Armstrong wrote to his 1.6 million followers on X. “UpOnlyTV is coming back.”

Per on-chain data, Coinbase paid $25 million in USDC to Cobie for the NFT, pushing him back into the host's chair, aiming to resurrect the podcast.

UpOnly NFT originated from the podcast show “UpOnly” hosted by Cobie, along with Ledger. The show invites top traders, project founders, fund managers, to discuss crypto trends.

However, the program stalled roughly three years ago, following the FTX collapse in 2022 and the subsequent crypto winter.

In May 2025, Cobie created a challenge that if someone burns the NFT, the program would return for another season.

“OK I am no longer the decision maker on if UpOnly returns,” Cobie wrote in May. “The power is now stored within this NFT that I just minted. When the NFT is burned, the podcast will restart. Until then, please leave me alone.”

The offer however limited sponsorship rights or editorial control. Given the high dollar-amount set on the NFT, Cobie said at the time, “You couldn't set a dollar amount on OpenSea so I just kept adding 0s till the number seemed too big for anyone to buy even as a joke.”

On Tuesday, not only did Coinbase purchase UpOnly's NFT, but it apparently overpaid the asking price of the non-fungible token.

Soon after the Coinbase's purchase, Jordan Fish, aka Cobie, conveyed his disbelief quite concisely.

According to the NFT fine print, the holder of the token “can compel Cobie and Ledger Status into performing, like monkeys, 8 episodes of UpOnlyTV.”

“We are allowed to call you idiots for buying it, or ignore you completely with zero mentions of your existence during our 8-episode season,” the NFT description read.

In a separate post on X, Cobie joked, “Im too old to have a crypto podcast imma be out here looking like Gary V.”

“It has been 3 years since up only ended. I was in my 20s when it started, now I have grey hair. We will rename it Unc Only and I will spend $25m on cosmetic surgery. See ya soon.”

Coinbase's purchase comes at the same time as it suffered intense technical difficulties linked to an outage with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum NFT holders were impacted by recent AWS outages, with the blockchain unable to load tokenized data. This has raised questions about the role of increasing centralization in modern crypto. 

To be blunt, it's hard to claim that someone ""owns"" an NFT if third-party technical difficulties can block access. This issue may encourage a shift to other blockchains or a further decline in the NFT sector.

Yesterday's AWS outage wrought havoc on the entire internet, disrupting digital infrastructure worldwide. The ongoing issues also highlighted concerns in the crypto industry, as Coinbase's main functions had persistent outages.

Another concerning development, however, was that AWS took NFTs on Ethereum offline.

Thanks to its crucial role in DeFi infrastructure, Ethereum has long been the unquestionable home of NFT projects. Apparently, however, this product sector isn't quite so decentralized.

This AWS outage has revealed that isolated third-party technical difficulties can cause major setbacks for some of the crypto economy's biggest pillars.

Some community members have suggested that Ordinals, a Bitcoin-based NFT system, could take over some of Ethereum's share in this market. Even that, however, might be a wrong assumption.

Demand for NFTs is falling across the board, and some of the sector's biggest recent developments involve publicity stunts and international crime.

The ""sales pitch"" of NFTs is that a user can employ blockchain technology to have real ownership of digital property, encoding art and other IP on a decentralized system.

If this premise is flawed, it might encourage a further decline in demand. How can you ""own"" an Ethereum NFT if external factors could totally disable your access?

https://bsky.app/profile/junlper.beer/post/3m3pepajo622l

Moreover, security experts fear that more AWS outages will continue in the coming days. If Ethereum NFTs keep going offline like this, it seems like a poor omen for the entire sector.

We should keep an eye on the situation and determine if Ordinals takes over their market share or if the market simply shrinks altogether.

Key Takeaways:

Coinbase has made one of the most unexpected and headline-grabbing moves of 2025, spending a staggering $25 million to acquire the UpOnly NFT, a digital token tied to the dormant but legendary crypto podcast hosted by Jordan “Cobie” Fish and Brian “Ledger” Krogsgard.

The purchase isn't just a publicity stunt, it's a calculated push to merge blockchain ownership with digital media revival, breathing life into a show that once defined the 2021 bull run's cultural moment.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed the acquisition in a short but viral post on X:

“The rumors are true; we bought the NFT. @UpOnlyTV is coming back.”

According to on-chain data, Coinbase paid $25 million in USDC directly to Cobie's wallet. The transaction triggered immediate buzz across the crypto community not just because of the price tag, but because it forces Cobie and Ledger back into production.

The NFT contract expressly requires the duo to produce eight new podcast episodes, all while granting them permission to “ignore or insult” the NFT holder as a funny little aside. It's a perfect mix of crypto humor, contractual irony and blockchain enforcement, a signature plays that only this industry could come up with.



Cobie himself appeared both amused and alarmed. Shortly after the transaction, he posted on X:

“Ah man wtf.” “I'm too old to have a crypto podcast, imma be out here looking like Gary V.”

Introduced in the giddy highs of the 2021 bull run, UpOnly became a sort of cultural touchstone for crypto insiders, lauded for its unvarnished interviews with some of the top traders, builders and meme legends. The show was previously underwritten by FTX, until the exchange imploded in late 2022 and pulled the podcast off air indefinitely.

Its final episode dropped shortly after FTX's implosion, in what many viewed as the “golden era” for crypto content. And from that moment Cobie would tell people time and time again how the show wasn't his anymore to bring back, how the decision was locked in an NFT.

In May 2025, Cobie minted the UpOnly NFT as a tongue-in-cheek experiment, tweeting:

“The power is now stored within this NFT. When it's burned, the podcast will restart. Until then, please leave me alone.”

No one expected the token, initially listed with an absurd string of zeros to actually sell. But Coinbase just turned the joke into a $25 million marketing statement.

Coinbase's acquisition reveals a deeper, more strategic play: NFTs as programmable media rights. Unlike traditional contracts, the UpOnly NFT automatically enforces creative obligations through ownership, meaning the buyer doesn't need lawyers to activate production, it's written into code.

This model may redefine how content rights, royalties, and creator collaborations are handled in the digital age. Analysts say Coinbase's move could pave the way for NFT-backed entertainment, where shows, music, or games can be directly tied to on-chain conditions.

“This isn't just about nostalgia,” said crypto analyst Tom Dunleavy. “Coinbase is experimenting with a new form of decentralized media where blockchain is the business model, not just the topic.”

The timing couldn't be better. As NFT markets are starting to recover from a brutal 2023–24 slump, corporate actors such as Coinbase find new forms of how they may capitalize on digital collectibles outside art speculation.

Not only did the purchase breathe new life into UpOnly, but it also sent reverberations through the market. One memecoin, UPONLY, soared more than 7,800% in a single day following the announcement, underscoring traders' obsession with this deal.

BlockDAG news updates in October show that its presale numbers are strong. Yet, uncertainty around the BlockDAG launch date has further increased controversy around the project.

As a result, investors are rotating into DeepSnitch AI's crypto analytics platform, which aims to help retail traders to better compete with whales. The project has already raised nearly $450k in the early phases of its presale. Read on to see why investors say DeepSnitch could become the next crypto to explode.



BlackRock has officially launched its iShares Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange, marking a major step for crypto accessibility in the United Kingdom. The debut follows the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) recent decision to relax restrictions on crypto-linked investment products.



The new ETP allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) without directly purchasing or storing the asset. Priced from around $11 per unit, the product tracks Bitcoin's market performance while operating within a regulated framework, making it suitable for traditional investment portfolios and brokerage accounts.

BlackRock's entry into the UK market strengthens its dominance in crypto investment products. Data from SoSoValue shows that the firm's U.S.-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF already holds more than $85 billion in assets, highlighting growing institutional interest in digital assets.

The launch comes just weeks after the FCA ended its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). The regulator now permits trading of these instruments on FCA-approved exchanges, citing increased maturity and transparency in the crypto sector.

According to FCA executive director David Geale, the evolving market and improved understanding of crypto products made the policy shift possible.

While the FCA remains cautious by maintaining its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors the regulator has also expressed interest in exploring fund tokenization as part of its broader financial innovation strategy.

DeepSnitch AI's (DSNT) ICO token sales have surpassed $446,000, drawing the attention of both crypto veterans and first-time investors eager to catch the next big AI wave.

Unlike typical presales that rely on hype, DeepSnitch is built on a working foundation of blockchain intelligence and it's already showing why analysts believe it could be one of 2025's most explosive projects.

At its core, DeepSnitch operates through five powerful AI engines that continuously analyze the crypto sector. These engines detect unusual wallet activity, trace liquidity transfers, and flag suspicious contract deployments before the public notices.

By converting vast on-chain data into simple signals, DeepSnitch lets everyday traders anticipate moves that institutional players usually dominate.

Its SnitchFeed AI dashboard, which is set to go live soon, will offer easy-to-read insights, highlighting moments of whale accumulation, potential dumps, and high-probability reversals. It's a bridge between raw blockchain data and actionable strategy, offering traders a new level of situational awareness.

Security, often the Achilles' heel of early-stage crypto, is another strength. DeepSnitch's contracts have passed double audits by Coinsult and SolidProof, establishing trust at a time when investors are increasingly cautious. Combine that with staking rewards for loyal holders, and you have a presale that balances innovation with reliability.

With the AI technology market expected to grow by 25x, DeepSnitch is shaping up to become the next crypto to explode. Now trading at $0.01953, DSNT's low price is a great entry point that could lead to 500x gains over the next few months.



 

BlockDag presale updates continue to dominate internet searches in the crypto ICO sector. Many investors eagerly seek to know what's going on with the BlockDAG ecosystem. The project first shot into the limelight in March 2024 after unveiling a novel blockchain consensus protocol.

BlockDAG leverages the Directed Acrylic Graph system which aims to make transaction processing faster than what traditional networks offer. The DAG system is also supposed to bring increased scalability, a factor that many crypto ecosystems have struggled with.

After raising over $428 million from ICO token sales, the BlockDAG price prediction for 2026 is overwhelmingly strong. Yet, with no news on the official BlockDAG launch date, investors are eagerly turning their attention to other yet-to-launch crypto ecosystems like DeepSnitch AI.

Remittix is a new face in the crypto sector, one that aims to bring smooth business transactions thanks to simplified cross border payment systems. For a long time, such payments have been hampered by delays, currency conversion fees, and payments to third party players.

Thankfully, all that is set to change with the upcoming launch of Remittix. This new ecosystem allows crypto users to make payments in over thirty different fiat currencies by simply using their wallets.

Remittix's technology is particularly useful for cross border business transactions, making it a favorite among ecommerce firms. Already, many have rushed to secure a spot in its ecosystem, leading to over $27 million raised from token sales. Investors say Remittix could be one of the leading cross border settlement blockchain networks, competing with giants like XRP.

With Bitcoin on the verge of $108k, investors are anticipating another bull run in coming weeks. DeepSnitch AI's Stage Two presale continues to welcome new investors looking to capitalize on the recent price dip.

With over $446,000 already raised, DSNT is fast becoming the go-to pick presale for traders searching for undervalued tokens with explosive potential. Additionally, the project has gotten 500x projections, a factor that is now pulling away investors from BlockDAG news sites to DSNT's ICO.

DeepSnitch's earliest supporters are now up by 29% with more growth to come before the project goes live. Secure your DSNT tokens now directly from the official presale site while prices remain low.



BlockDAG news updates show strong network growth, indicating that BDAG might a a strong buy.

Investors expect AI crypto to surge in 2025.

DeepSnitch AI is poised to grow by 500x over the next few months.

TORONTO, Ontario and NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ/TSX: BITF), a North American energy and digital infrastructure company (“Bitfarms” or the “Company”), today announced that it has closed its offering of US$588 million aggregate principal amount of 1.375% convertible senior notes due 2031 (the “Convertible Notes”), which includes the exercise in full of the $88 million option granted to the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes.

“I am happy to announce our tremendous success as a first-time issuer in the convertible bond market,” said Ben Gagnon, CEO. “We were able to upsize the deal while improving on pricing, preserving upside and minimizing potential economic dilution through a 125% capped call, and introduce many high-quality institutional partners into our cap table. The funds raised through these Convertible Notes have strengthened our balance sheet with cash, Bitcoin, and remaining funds available to draw under the Macquarie project facility to over US$1 billion. We now have the financial firepower and flexibility to move forward at full speed with our HPC/AI infrastructure developments in North America. I would like to thank everyone who participated in the deal – we look forward to working together as we execute on our exciting infrastructure pipeline.”

October 21, 2025 By MKE Community Journal Leave a Comment 

By Stacy M. Brown
Black Press USA Senior National Correspondent

The Trump administration's economic experiment, rooted in chaos, crony capitalism, and unchecked digital surveillance, is pushing America toward a dangerous new frontier. It is a crypto-driven, cashless society that threatens to erase financial freedom for millions, particularly Black Americans and the working poor.

As the economy contracts and inflation rises, President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff regime has already sent shockwaves through every sector. According to Fortune, Trump's reckless tariff decisions have wiped nearly seven trillion dollars in market value, decimated small business confidence, and driven consumer prices to levels not seen in decades. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii warned that Trump is ruining the economy on purpose, pointing to middle-class families now paying an average of five thousand dollars more each year for basic goods such as cars, homes, groceries, and clothing. While Americans struggle with higher prices and shrinking savings, the Trump White House has quietly advanced a sweeping new financial system that merges state power, private crypto interests, and invasive data collection. In early 2025, Trump authorized a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, incorporating the volatile cryptocurrency into official United States financial infrastructure. The Conversation reported that this hybrid model privatizes the issuance of money while keeping control of reserves under the executive branch. It undermines the Federal Reserve's independence and centralizes power in the Oval Office. Trump described bitcoin as freedom money, but in practice, it represents state-aligned crypto dominance and an economy where wealth and access depend on government loyalty.

Behind the scenes, Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, once run by Elon Musk, came under scrutiny for uploading massive federal databases containing the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans, including Social Security data, to unsecured cloud servers. A whistleblower revealed that the team requested its activities not be logged and even deleted records of access, behavior that cybersecurity experts compared to criminal hacking operations. Sensitive information tied to union members, workers' rights cases, and corporate secrets may have been exposed, with traces of suspicious activity linking back to Russian IP addresses. By the spring of 2025, Musk left DOGE and the government under a cloud of suspicion after a public spat with Trump. He has gone mostly silent since his departure, but multiple people believe he took large volumes of data with him. The full extent of what was removed or copied remains unclear, leaving major concerns about the safety of sensitive personal and governmental information.

At the same time, Trump's allies have opened new financial avenues for the wealthy through Erebor Bank, a cryptocurrency-focused institution backed by conservative megadonors and approved with unusual speed by Trump's Treasury Department. Its mission is to serve ultra-high-net-worth individuals and tech firms, signaling a parallel financial system that privileges the rich while ordinary citizens are pushed into algorithmic surveillance economies. These developments align with global moves toward digital ID systems such as the United Kingdom's One Login and digital wallets, which The Telegraph described as a real nightmare that centralizes personal data and is riddled with security flaws. In the United States, REAL ID enforcement now allows the federal government to link biometric data to digital identification across states. Officials claim it enhances security, yet many Black Americans have long viewed REAL ID with suspicion. Without it, citizens cannot board domestic flights, enter federal buildings, or access certain public facilities. Critics warn that REAL ID creates another layer of exclusion and control, particularly for those who already face bureaucratic and systemic barriers.

An expanded picture of what is happening around the world makes this moment appear even more calculated than coincidental. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's digital ID programhas been exposed as a security disaster that relied on unsecured workstations in foreign countries, leaving millions of British citizens vulnerable to data theft and foreign manipulation. In the United States, whistleblower Charles Borges revealed that the DOGE team copied and uploaded the Social Security Administration's database containing hundreds of millions of Americans' personal records to unmonitored cloud servers. He resigned after filing complaints, claiming he was harassed and isolated by the administration. Meanwhile, cybersecurity analysts detected data activity linked to Russia at the same time DOGE engineers were transferring files. When taken together, these events suggest a global pattern of governments and private actors concentrating power by controlling not only digital money but also personal identity and access to daily life. Globally, other nations have already begun shifting toward cashless societies. Sweden and Norway have reduced physical currency use to historic lows, and while the move is framed as progress, even their governments are now warning about the vulnerability of fully digital economies to war, cyberattacks, and authoritarian abuse. The convergence of Trump's crypto policies, REAL ID enforcement, the global cashless push, and Musk's suspected data exfiltration raises the specter of a coordinated effort to centralize control over citizens' finances and personal freedoms. It suggests that the line between economic policy, surveillance, and political domination is disappearing.

As the physical dollar fades, major institutions warn of who will be left behind. Brookings predicted years ago that cash will soon be obsolete, with digital currencies becoming the new norm. While central banks promote benefits like efficiency and transparency, they also introduce total traceability, enabling governments or corporations to freeze, restrict, or program how citizens spend money. J.P. Morgan and Loughborough University both note that a cashless system risks excluding the poor, the elderly, and the unbanked, groups disproportionately represented by Black and minority Americans. Digital payments must be designed with inclusion and convenience at their core, said Loughborough economist Markos Zachariadis, warning that without oversight, we risk leaving vulnerable groups excluded. In the United States, those same groups are already being priced out of basic participation in the economy as Trump's tariffs, inflation, and anti-worker policies strip away safety nets like Medicaid and food assistance.

For Black America, the stakes are especially high. The march toward a cashless economy threatens to replicate the structural inequalities of the old banking system under the guise of innovation. Access to digital money will depend on data verification, credit history, and digital ID compliance, areas where Black Americans have historically faced discrimination and surveillance. With tech billionaires like Musk controlling the digital rails, privacy and autonomy may soon become luxuries reserved for the elite. As Global Finance observed, nations like Sweden are reassessing their nearly cashless economies after realizing that wars, natural disasters, and crises reveal vulnerabilities in fully digital systems. In America, those vulnerabilities may soon look like total control, where the same administration that tanked the economy gains the power to decide how and where citizens can spend what little they have left. In the end, Trump's version of economic freedom is not about liberty. It is about ownership of currency, of data, and of people. If this cashless, crypto-fueled dystopia becomes reality, Black America and the poor will once again be first in line to pay the price.

Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech.

The Federal Reserve is hosting the Payments Innovation Conference today, marking a shift in the central bank's engagement with crypto and digital assets. The October 21 event brings together leading figures from both traditional finance and the crypto industry, including Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov, Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Circle President Heath Tarbert, and Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson. Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller will deliver both opening and closing remarks.

The conference agenda signals the Fed's growing recognition of digital assets' role in the future of payments, featuring dedicated panels on bridging traditional finance with decentralized ecosystems, stablecoin business models and use cases, AI-driven payment innovation, and the tokenization of financial products. Major crypto infrastructure providers like Chainlink and Fireblocks will sit alongside traditional banking executives from Lead Bank and Fifth Third Bank, while stablecoin issuers Paxos and Circle discuss the future of digital dollar adoption. The event represents a significant departure from the Fed's historically cautious stance on crypto, coming at a time when institutional adoption is accelerating and spot crypto ETFs continue gaining regulatory approval.

This conference arrives at a pivotal moment for the payments industry, as traditional financial institutions increasingly embrace blockchain technology and tokenized assets. With stablecoins now processing billions in daily transaction volume, major asset managers launching tokenized Treasury products, and AI transforming fraud detection and payment processing, today's discussions could shape regulatory approaches and innovation strategies for years to come. Markets will be watching closely for any signals about the Fed's evolving perspective on digital assets, stablecoin regulation, and the future role of blockchain technology in the U.S. financial system.

Bitcoin BTC$110,480.72 is catching a bid on Tuesday as the record rally in precious metals reverses in a big way.

Gold saw a 5% decline to $4,130, its biggest daily drawdown in years. Silver also tumbled nearly 8%. The metals had surged over the past few months fueled by central banks moving into monetary easing mode, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and signs of liquidity and credit stress in the financial system. Frustratingly to bitcoin bulls, though, those catalysts had provided little boost to the world's largest crypto, which — with a couple of brief exceptions — has remained stuck in a tight range for months.

With the metals for at least this moment having fallen out of favor, however, money is flowing into bitcoin, which has rebounded to $112,700 after having dropped below $108,000 just hours ago. Ether ETH$3,940.57 also erased its overnight decline, bouncing back above $4,000.

Quinn Thomson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, said last week that BTC is poised to catch up to gold's rally. Charlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree, also argued that bitcoin's time to rally will come when gold rolls over to consolidate.

Crypto-related stocks haven't really gotten the news, with most in the red on Tuesday, particularly the bitcoin miners, many of which are now trading more as AI infrastructure plays.

IREN (IREN), Hut 8 (HUT) and Bitfarms (BITF) are lower by 3%-4%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) is down 1.2% and Coinbase (COIN) is lower by 0.5%. Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) is managing a 1.7% gain.

Bitcoin was trading below $108,000 at 9:20 a.m. UTC as $320 million in liquidations and spot crypto ETF outflows hit a market down 3.2%.

BTC was trading at $107,779 during the European morning, 2.8% lower in the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. Ether ETH$3,940.57 and solana SOL$190.73 have both fallen more than 3.5%, while numerous other altcoins nursed losses in excess of 4%.

The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which offers a weighted measure of the digital asset market, is about 3.5% lower. 

CoinGlass data shows 122,919 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, totaling $320.32 million, including a single $2.98 million ETH-USDT order on Binance. 

Flows started the week softer: U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs saw a $40.4 million net outflow Monday, Oct. 20, including $100.7 million from BlackRock's IBIT, according to Farside Investors.  

Sentiment sat in “Fear” at 34 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. 

Bloomberg reported gold at $4,270 an ounce, a drop of 1.97% today.

Glassnode said open interest (OI) fell about 30%, flushing excess leverage and that funding is near neutral, leaving the market less vulnerable to another liquidation cascade. 

OI is the number of outstanding futures and perpetual contracts; when it drops sharply, it usually means leverage has been closed out. Funding is the fee longs or shorts pay to keep perpetual positions open; when it moves toward neutral, it signals neither side is paying a premium, so positioning is more balanced. 

In practice, less leverage and near-neutral funding can reduce the odds of another forced-selling cascade, even if price action stays choppy.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe said on X that bitcoin's monthly chart is moving sideways — no clear peak or bottom — before a bigger move higher. In plain terms, he sees this phase as a pause long enough to shake out excess leverage while price holds a broad range, with the next strong advance more likely once that base-building is done.

 Echo, a crowdfunding platform whose first fundraising project was Ethena, has been acquired by Coinbase after operating for less than two years. 

Major US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has acquired Echo, a platform that allows communities to raise capital targeting early-stage projects and startups.

Coinbase struck a $375 million deal to acquire Echo, a crowdfunding platform founded by crypto trader Jordan Fish, known in the community as Cobie, the company announced on Tuesday.

The acquisition came the day after Coinbase sent $25 million in USDC (USDC) to Cobie's wallet to acquire and burn a non-fungible token (NFT) and revive his UpOnly podcast.

“I certainly didn't think Echo would be sold to Coinbase, but here we are: Today Coinbase bought Echo for about $375 million,” Cobie wrote on X.

The acquisition came less than two years after Cobie launched Echo in beta in April 2024 with a mission to enable communities to invest together in private funding rounds.

In the eight months since launching, the platform has raised at least $51 million in funding, with 131 deals closed, including Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol behind one of the fastest-growing yield-bearing stablecoins on the market, USDe (USDE).

According to Cobie, Ethena was the first project to fundraise using Echo, highlighting the platform's sharp focus on early-stage investing.

In May, Echo introduced Sonar, a software product allowing founders to self-host public token sales on their own terms and preferred blockchains such as Hyperliquid, Base, Solana or Cardano.

Following Coinbase's acquisition, Echo will remain a “standalone platform under its current brand for now,” Cobie said in an X post on Tuesday, adding that the Sonar product will be integrated into Coinbase.

The integration will “likely” introduce new ways for founders to access investors, who will have new investment opportunities on Coinbase, he added.

“Integrating Echo's tools will help us enable more direct community participation, joining projects with capital, entirely onchain,” Coinbase said, adding:

The acquisition of Echo by Coinbase marks a growing trend toward community fundraising, reminiscent of initial coin offerings (ICOs), which boomed in 2017.

According to a Thursday report by Tiger Research, public sales have been increasingly re-emerging in new forms, with launchpads like Legion, Buidlpad, Sonar and Kaito leading the trend.

“The ICO boom peaked in 2017 but rapidly contracted as it lost credibility due to fraud and opaque information,” Tiger Research said, adding that the market subsequently shifted to private sales.

“However, public sales are recently resurging in new forms,” it said, referring to public launchpads like Sonar.

“Short-term hype around public launchpads may cool down. However, public launchpads are expected to persist due to structural demand. They serve as a tool for projects to secure early users and liquidity,” the report concluded.

While it remains to be seen how the renewed trend of public token sales will unfold, some high-profile figures linked to the Trump administration had called for an ICO revival earlier this year.

“We want to make ICOs great again,” Zak Folkman, co-founder of the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial, said in February.

Retinal Implant Allows People with Blindness to Read Again in Small Trial

An electronic retinal implant has improved vision in people with age-related macular degeneration—but it isn't a full restoration, and it didn't improve participants' quality of life

By Liam Drew & Nature magazine 

An electrical device implanted under the retina helps to restore some visual acuity to people with age-related macular degeneration.

Science Corporation

Scientists have used an eye implant to improve the vision of dozens of people left functionally blind by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The implant, which measures 2 millimetres by 2 millimetres, and is just 30 micrometres thick, is surgically inserted beneath the retina to replace the light-sensitive cells that have been lost to the disease.

The clinical trial, which is described today in The New England Journal of Medicine, involved 38 people with advanced AMD whose retinas had degenerated severely. One year after device implantation, 80% of participants had gained a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision.

“Where this dead retina was a complete blind spot, vision was restored,” says trial leader Frank Holz, an ophthalmologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. “Patients could read letters, they could read words, and they could function in their daily life.”

Despite some minor events related to implantation surgery, the trial's safety-monitoring board viewed the device's benefits as outweighing its risks. In June, the device's owners — the San Francisco-based neurotechnology company Science Corporation — applied for certification that would allow the device to be sold on the European market.

“I think this is an exciting and significant study, which has been well-designed and analysed. It gives hope for providing vision in patients for whom this was more ‘science-fiction' than reality,” says Francesca Cordeiro, an ophthalmologist at Imperial College London.

AMD is the commonest form of incurable blindness in older people. There are two main types, wet and dry AMD. The current work studied people with dry AMD, the advanced form of which affects around 5 million people globally. In dry AMD, the central retina's light-sensitive cells die over a period of years, leaving affected individuals with intact peripheral vision but without their high-acuity central vision. “They can't recognize faces, they can't read, they can't drive a car, they can't watch television,” says Holz.

The light-sensitive cells that die (rods and cones) convert light into electrochemical signals that are conveyed to other types of retinal neurons, which then send messages to the brain's visual-processing regions. Because retinal neurons survive AMD, scientists reasoned that a light-sensitive implant that electrically stimulates the retina according to the pattern of photons striking it could reinstate a sense of vision.

The implant, termed PRIMA — for photovoltaic retina implant microarray — was originally developed by the Paris-based company Pixium Vision, and was acquired by Science Corporation last year. It is wireless, unlike previous retinal devices. And, being photovoltaic, the photons that activate it also provide the energy source for generating its electrical output.

It is used in combination with glasses that contain a camera that captures images and converts them into patterns of infrared light that they transmit to the retinal implant.

The system, which allows users to zoom in and out on target objects, and adjust contrast and brightness, does, Holz says, take months of intensive training to use optimally.

In the current study, 38 individuals were treated at 17 clinical sites across 5 European countries, and 32 of the participants were tested a year after implantation. Twenty-six of them had a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision — which, on average, amounted to being able to see two lines further down a standard eye test chart of letters. Overall, most participants' vision came close to the resolution achievable with PRIMA.

By the study's end, most recipients were using PRIMA at home to read letters, words and numbers. Of the 32, 22 said that their user satisfaction was medium to high.

However, a questionnaire about users' daily quality of life revealed no significant overall improvements. A retinal-degeneration researcher working on treatments for vision loss who wished to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation, spoke to Nature and raised concerns that intensive visual training and the motivation of having received an exciting medical device might have led to improved test results. They said that the results would have been more robust if gains had been demonstrated relative to a randomised placebo group that had received the glasses and training protocols but no implant.

Holz, too, acknowledges that the current system has limitations, and says he expects future implants to be more effective. “With this first major breakthrough, it's a starting point for further improvement,” he says.

Another concern is the current maximal acuity achievable with the current device. The PRIMA system has only 381 pixels, each 100 micrometres square. And Holz concedes that users' reading is “not fast, fluid reading”. The vision provided is also black and white not colour.

Holz says Daniel Palinker, a physicist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who originally designed the device, has ideas about how to one day achieve colour vision. A next-generation device that is larger than PRIMA and filled with smaller pixels should enable better visual acuity, “It's the beginning of a journey,” Holz says.

Although the device has been tested in people with AMD, it could also help to restore sight in people affected by other conditions in which photoreceptor cells die but other retinal neurons remain functional, such as retinitis pigmentosa.

Retinal implants are not the only approach being developed for this problem. Other investigators are exploring the use of stem-cell therapies to regenerate photoreceptors; optogenetic therapies, in which light-sensitive proteins are introduced into the remaining retinal cells; and even implants that are inserted into the brain's visual cortex.

“It's a huge dynamic space, and there are lots of approaches now,” says Holz. “Which will pan out in the end, nobody knows.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","This Faraway Star Looks Weird. It May Be Because There's a Black Hole Inside It.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/deep-space/a69074272/black-hole-star/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

It's possible that these objects might be the primordial beginnings of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of most galaxies.

Here is what you will learn when you read this story:

Almost from the moment NASA's James Webb Space Telescope saw first light, it spotted mysterious little red dots, or LRDs, glowing in the distance. They were thought to be extremely ancient and unusually mature galaxies that raised questions about galaxy formation.

A new, alternate theory is even weirder. 

Seeking answers that were less vague, the international team of researchers who analyzed the first dataset that had been released by Webb in 2022 recently analyzed them again and came up with an alternative hypothesis for whatever these objects are. They look like stars. They also seem to act like stars, except not quite, because stars run on nuclear fusion while LRDs appear to be powered by something else. That something else is possibly a supermassive black hole for a core. 

The research team focused on one particular red dot more monstrous than the rest. Spectral analysis suggests that it is one enormous and cold (at least for a constantly burning ball of gas) star. Now named the Cliff, this particular red dot about 11.9 billion light-years away has an atmosphere too thick for just any star. Because its supposed black hole within is so ravenous, it pulls matter in from all directions and at super fast speeds, digesting it so it is converted into energy and blazes with red light.

“Determining whether the [spectral energy distributions] of LRDs are dominated by stars or [active galactic nuclei] is a major challenge, even with high-quality rest-optical spectroscopy and photometry ranging from X-ray to radio wavelengths,” the researchers said in a study recently published in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 

While the Cliff and other LRDs like it are exceptionally huge stars that only appear tiny because they are so distant, and most stars in the universe are actually cold low-mass stars, their light often drowned out by scorching massive stars with a much higher luminosity. Spectra from the red dots revealed none of them had nearly that much heat. Our Sun is somewhere between what is considered a hot and cold star. Cold starlight is usually either on the redder end of the visible spectrum or in the near-infrared, whose wavelengths are too long for the naked eye to pick up. 

What is unusual about these red dots possibly being supermassive black holes in disguise is that gases swirling around in supermassive black hole accretion disks are much hotter and brighter. Event Horizon Telescope images of the M83 black hole and our own Sagittarius A* are proof. Their light ranges from shades of orange and yellow on the edges that brighten to white hot on the inside. The other obvious difference is that that the impenetrably black space in the middle, the singularity from which no light can escape, is not visible in the red dots.

The researchers are still confounded by the Cliff and other LRDs. They suggest that a void might not be visible because of dense and turbulent gas clouds that shroud the accretion disk and mirror an actual stellar atmosphere. It could even be that, even though accretion disks are typically thought to feed black holes, something else could be giving the monster its strength, because, as they also said in the study, “any powerful ionizing source inside the dense gaseous envelope could produce [the spectra observed].”

“The Cliff cannot originate from a massive, evolved stellar population with an extremely high stellar density,” they concluded. “Crucially, this is the first LRD for which such a strong conclusion can be drawn solely by analyzing the [spectral energy distribution].”

Many questions still remain, one of which is whether the red dots we are seeing from the dawn of the universe may be the early stages of supermassive black holes that are found in the nucleus of almost every galaxy. Maybe the song “Black Hole Sun” was onto something.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Eating ultra-processed foods may rewire the brain and drive overeating","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092824.htm","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 02:24:59 GMT","

An international team of scientists has analyzed brain scans from around 30,000 participants and found striking connections between the frequent consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and measurable differences in brain structure. These differences could be part of a feedback loop that promotes overeating and food addiction.

""Our findings suggest that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with differences in the brain. These associations could be linked to behavioral patterns such as overeating, though causal relationships cannot be confirmed by our study. The observed associations are not solely explained by inflammation or obesity; ingredients and additives typical to UPFs, such as emulsifiers may also play a role, although this requires further longitudinal or experimental evidence,"" explains the study's shared first author, Arsène Kanyamibwa from the University of Helsinki.

Processed vs. Ultra-Processed: Understanding the Difference 

Not all processed foods are harmful. Many processed items, especially those based on plants, are beneficial parts of a balanced diet. However, ultra-processed foods -- those containing industrial additives and chemically altered ingredients -- raise significant health concerns.

""In particular, processed foods of plant origin, such as frozen vegetables, can be recommended. Another good example of the benefits of processing is the pasteurization of milk. In contrast, foods high in chemically modified ingredients and additives, such as processed meat products, are problematic.""

Implications for Diet and Public Health 

Kanyamibwa highlights how emerging research like this can influence both personal food choices and public health policy.

""Given the growing body of evidence, reducing ultra-processed food intake and strengthening regulatory standards in food manufacturing may be crucial steps toward ensuring better public health outcomes,"" Kanyamibwa asserts.

The investigation drew on data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database including middle-aged participants from across the United Kingdom. The research was carried out through a collaboration between the University of Helsinki and McGill University's Montréal Neurological Institute, combining expertise in nutrition, neuroscience, and imaging analysis to explore how modern diets may be influencing the human brain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found hidden life thriving beneath the Arctic ice","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251020092826.htm","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 06:38:29 GMT","

The rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is often seen as an environmental catastrophe. Yet researchers have found that the same melting process could help sustain life in unexpected ways. As the ice retreats, it creates conditions that encourage the growth of algae, the foundation of the Arctic's marine food web.

Algae form the base of most ocean ecosystems, but they depend on nitrogen to grow -- and nitrogen is scarce in Arctic waters. Now, an international team led by the University of Copenhagen has discovered that more nitrogen may become available than scientists once believed. This shift could reshape the future of marine life in the region and influence how much carbon the ocean can absorb.

A Hidden Source of Nitrogen Beneath the Ice

The study is the first to confirm that nitrogen fixation -- a process in which certain bacteria transform nitrogen gas (N2) dissolved in seawater into ammonium -- occurs beneath Arctic sea ice, even in its most remote and central areas. Ammonium not only helps these bacteria thrive but also nourishes algae and, by extension, the creatures that depend on them.

""Until now, it was believed that nitrogen fixation could not take place under the sea ice because it was assumed that the living conditions for the organisms that perform nitrogen fixation were too poor. We were wrong,"" says Lisa W. von Friesen, lead author of the study and former PhD student at the Department of Biology.

Less Ice, More Life

Unlike most other oceans where cyanobacteria dominate nitrogen fixation, the Arctic Ocean relies on an entirely different group of bacteria known as non-cyanobacteria. The researchers found the highest nitrogen fixation rates along the ice edge -- where melting is most intense. While these bacteria can operate beneath the ice, they flourish along the melting boundary. As climate change accelerates ice retreat, this expanding melt zone could allow more nitrogen to enter the ecosystem.

""In other words, the amount of available nitrogen in the Arctic Ocean has likely been underestimated, both today and for future projections. This could mean that the potential for algae production has also been underestimated as climate change continues to reduce the sea ice cover,"" says von Friesen.

""Because algae are the primary food source for small animals such as planktonic crustaceans, which in turn are eaten by small fish, more algae can end up affecting the entire food chain,"" she adds.

Could This Help the Planet Absorb More CO2?

This new nitrogen source could also influence how much carbon dioxide the Arctic Ocean takes in. More algae mean more photosynthesis, which enables the ocean to capture greater amounts of CO2.

""For the climate and the environment, this is likely good news. If algae production increases, the Arctic Ocean will absorb more CO2 because more CO2 will be bound in algae biomass. But biological systems are very complex, so it is hard to make firm predictions, because other mechanisms may pull in the opposite direction,"" explains Lasse Riemann, professor at the Department of Biology and senior author of the study.

The researchers emphasize that nitrogen fixation should now be considered in models predicting the Arctic's future. ""We do not yet know whether the net effect will be beneficial for the climate. But it is clear that we should include an important process such as nitrogen fixation in the equation when we try to predict what will happen to the Arctic Ocean in the coming decades as sea ice declines,"" adds Riemann.

How Nitrogen Fixation Works

In the Arctic, non-cyanobacteria perform nitrogen fixation. These microorganisms consume dissolved organic matter -- often released by algae -- and in turn, produce fixed nitrogen that promotes further algal growth. This exchange creates a small but vital nutrient loop beneath the ice.

Algae play a double role in the ecosystem: they are both the starting point of the marine food chain and natural absorbers of CO2. As they grow, they pull carbon dioxide from the air, which can later sink to the ocean floor as part of their biomass.

Behind the Discovery

The study, published in Communications Earth & Environment, involved scientists from the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), Linnaeus University (Sweden), Alfred Wegener Institute (Germany), Aix Marseille University (France), National Oceanography Centre (United Kingdom), Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (Germany), Stockholm University (Sweden), and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (Sweden).

Their findings are based on two major research expeditions aboard the icebreakers IB Oden and RV Polarstern. Samples and measurements were collected at 13 sites across the central Arctic Ocean, including regions off northeast Greenland and north of Svalbard.

Targeted epigenetic engineering of gene expression in cell therapies would allow programming of desirable phenotypes without many of the challenges and safety risks associated with double-strand break-based genetic editing approaches. Here, we develop an all-RNA platform for efficient, durable and multiplexed epigenetic programming in primary human T cells, stably turning endogenous genes off or on using CRISPRoff and CRISPRon epigenetic editors. We achieve epigenetic programming of diverse targeted genomic elements without the need for sustained expression of CRISPR systems. CRISPRoff-mediated gene silencing is maintained through numerous cell divisions, T cell stimulations and in vivo adoptive transfer, avoiding cytotoxicity or chromosomal abnormalities inherent to multiplexed Cas9-mediated genome editing. Lastly, we successfully combined genetic and epigenetic engineering using orthogonal CRISPR Cas12a–dCas9 systems for targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) knock-in and CRISPRoff silencing of therapeutically relevant genes to improve preclinical CAR-T cell-mediated in vivo tumor control and survival.

Engineered T cells, containing transgenic T cell receptors (TCRs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or other synthetic antigen receptors, are an emerging modality to treat cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases1,2,3,4. Although autologous CAR-T cells have been transformative for treating aggressive hematological malignancies, substantial advances are needed to achieve similar success in treating solid tumors and generating allogeneic cell therapies. Solid tumors demonstrate a number of challenges including immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, physical barriers and T cell exhaustion that limit the responses of current therapies5,6,7. Allogeneic CAR-T cells must additionally overcome T cell rejection by the host immune system and toxicities such as graft-versus-host disease8. A number of studies have nominated genes that, in principle, can be manipulated to overcome these challenges; however, enacting these strategies in cell products remains a major challenge and will require clinically relevant, robust, nontoxic and multiplexed approaches9,10,11.

CRISPR-based genome editing has become a predominant approach for engineering therapeutic T cell products. CRISPR–Cas9 can facilitate gene inactivation by introducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) or stimulate precise genome editing through homology-directed repair (HDR)12. Base editing and prime editing can generate efficient point mutations or small insertions and deletions without introducing DSBs13,14. However, each of these approaches results in permanent changes to the genome and potential unintended chromosomal abnormalities induced by on-target or off-target genome editing15,16,17.

An alternative strategy for modulating gene function is through programmable control of endogenous gene expression. We and others have shown that repurposed CRISPR proteins can perturb gene expression in T cells without the formation of DSBs or any permanent change to the genetic code18,19,20. Unfortunately, transcriptional editing approaches such as CRISPRi, CRISPRa and Cas13d require sustained expression of the CRISPR proteins to maintain control of gene expression, which largely precludes their use in therapeutic applications in T cell therapies because of immune recognition of the bacterial Cas proteins and rejection of the transplanted cells21,22,23.

Recent work from our group and others has shown that heritable gene silencing can be achieved through transient expression of epigenetic effectors targeted to specific genomic loci24,25,26,27. In particular, we showed that CRISPRoff, an epigenetic editor protein composed of dCas9 fused to DNMT3A, DNMT3L and ZNF10 KRAB protein domains, can write an epigenetic silencing program that is persistent for over 450 cell divisions in HEK293T cells27 when delivered as plasmid DNA. We also showed that CRISPRoff gene silencing could be reversed by CRISPRon, an epigenetic editor consisting of dCas9 fused to a TET1 catalytic domain that enables targeted erasure of DNA methylation. Importantly, epigenetic editors such as CRISPRoff and CRISPRon do not require DNA damage for their mechanisms of action, thereby eliminating the reliance on specific DNA repair outcomes and the genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and chromosomal abnormalities associated with these pathways. CRISPRoff and CRISPRon epigenome editing (epi-editing) is, thus, in principle, highly multiplexable, making complex therapeutic gene programming efforts possible for a vast array of therapeutic applications. However, this requires efficient and durable epigenetic editing in therapeutically relevant cell types such as primary human T cells.

Here, we develop an optimized, clinically compatible RNA-based epigenetic engineering platform for turning genes on and off in primary human T cells. We show that our T cell epi-editing platform is potent and durable and can be multiplexed, suggesting that this is a versatile approach for broad use in therapeutic applications. CRISPRoff gene silencing is highly specific to the intended targets, is effective in a wide range of therapeutically relevant genes and eliminates the cytotoxicity and chromosomal translocations observed with multiplexed Cas9 gene editing. Additionally, CRISPRon achieves targeted DNA demethylation of an endogenous enhancer, resulting in stable induction of FOXP3, a therapeutically relevant gene in human primary T cells. Lastly, we successfully couple targeted epigenome engineering with targeted CAR knock-in (KI) at the TRAC locus to generate epi-edited TRAC CAR-T cells with enhanced functionality ex vivo and in vivo in a preclinical model of adoptive cell therapy.

To determine whether CRISPRoff can stably silence gene expression in human primary T cells, we designed a panel of seven mRNAs encoding the previously reported Streptococcus pyogenes-based CRISPRoff-V2.3 effector27. We compared the effects of three mRNA cap modifications (Cap1, ARCA and m7g), base modifications (1-Me ps-UTP) and two codon optimization algorithms27,28 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The CD151 cell surface protein was selected for initial optimizations given the presence of a known CpG island (CGI) at its promoter and prior validation with CRISPRoff in HEK293T cells27. Each mRNA that incorporated base modifications had more CD151 knockdown (KD) than our unoptimized mRNA, which had no 1-Me ps-UTP substitution (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We also compared codon optimization algorithms (Supplementary Fig. 1c) and mRNA cap structures (Supplementary Fig. 1d). All CRISPRoff mRNA variants demonstrated efficient CD151 KD at high mRNA concentrations, with complete silencing in 85–99% of cells and no observed cellular toxicity (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1e). However, dose titration showed significant differences across designs in mRNA potency for gene silencing. CRISPRoff 7 mRNA, which includes ‘design 1' for codon optimization, the Cap1 mRNA cap and 1-Me ps-UTP substitution, was the most potent design across mRNA concentrations, especially at low mRNA doses. We, therefore, proceeded with CRISPRoff 7 mRNA (referred to as CRISPRoff hereafter) for all subsequent experiments. We then compared CRISPRoff, CRISPRi and Cas9 mRNA activity at four different Lonza 4D nucleofector pulse codes and at four different time points (0, 2, 5 and 12 days after activation) (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Multiple pulse codes performed well for CRISPRoff KD across time points, highlighting the flexibility of this mRNA electroporation approach. We decided to use DS137 for subsequent experiments in part because it has been used previously for mRNA electroporation into T cells29. CRISPRoff was sufficiently efficient that we did not need to use any drug selection or cell sorting to select for CRISPRoff-positive cells.

a, Comparison of KD efficiency of CD151 across seven CRISPRoff mRNA designs over a series of mRNA doses. CD151 expression was assessed using flow cytometry 5 days after electroporation. We modeled CD151 positivity as a function of dose and mRNA variant and then computed a P value for the difference between CRISPRoff 7 and the rest of the mRNA variants using the standard error (Methods). P values were then adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. CRISPRoff 7 was the most potent CRISPRoff mRNA variant as assessed by the degree of CD151 silencing across CRISPRoff doses (n = 2 donors; CRISPRoff 1, ***P = 0.00022; CRISPRoff 2, **P = 0.011; CRISPRoff 3, **P = 0.0096; CRISPRoff 4, **P = 0.001; CRISPRoff 5, **P = 0.0044; CRISPRoff 6, *P = 0.04). b, Comparison of Cas9 (black), CRISPRi (red) or CRISPRoff (blue) mRNA KO or KD activity on CD151, CD55 and CD81 loci over a time course of 28 days after electroporation. Black arrows along the x axis indicate restimulations with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 soluble antibodies (day 9, day 18 and day 27 after electroporation) (n = 4 donors except on day 10, where n = 2 donors; mean ± s.d.). c, Representative flow cytometry histogram plots of CD151 KD (or KO) by CRISPRoff, CRISPRi or Cas9 on day 5 and day 28 after electroporation. d,e, Transcriptomic assessment by RNA-seq of CRISPRoff activity and specificity upon silencing of CD55 (d) or CD81 (e) relative to NTC.

Cells were electroporated with CRISPRoff mRNA and an sgRNA targeting FAS or an NTC and then harvested at 7 days after electroporation for RNA extraction. The yellow dot indicates the target gene, which is significantly downregulated, and gray dots have no significance (empirical Bayes moderated statistics with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR control, adjusted P < 0.05; FAS adjusted P = 3.35 × 10−20; n = 4 donors).

We next examined whether CRISPRoff could initiate and maintain programmable gene silencing in primary human T cells at multiple endogenous gene targets over many cell divisions. We designed experiments to compare CRISPRoff, Cas9 and CRISPRi activity across time when delivered as mRNA to primary human T cells. We selected CD151, CD55 and CD81 for targeting as all three of these target genes contain known CGIs and are not essential for cell proliferation or survival of T cells in vitro30. We previously showed that CRISPRoff and CRISPRi have equivalent design and targeting rules for optimal single guide RNA (sgRNA) activity27. Hereafter, throughout this study, for all CRISPRoff and CRISPRi experiments, we used the top predicted 1–6 sgRNAs31 without prior validation in T cells. For both CRISPRoff and CRISPRi experiments, we coelectroporated a pool of three sgRNAs targeting within a 250-bp region immediately downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of each gene or a nontargeting control sgRNA (NTC) along with CRISPRoff or CRISPRi mRNA. For Cas9 experiments, we electroporated one sgRNA predicted for optimal knockout (KO) activity or an NTC along with Cas9 mRNA32,33. Cell surface levels of each targeted gene's protein product were monitored by flow cytometry over a time course of 28 days. As expected, CRISPRi targeting led to transient gene silencing that was progressively lost over time, notably upon T cell restimulation using anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 soluble antibodies on day 9 (Fig. 1b). In contrast, CRISPRoff programmed durable gene silencing that was comparable to Cas9 KO for at least 28 days after electroporation with absence of cell surface expression in over 93% of cells for each gene target (Fig. 1b,c). Notably, CRISPRoff silencing persisted through three anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 soluble antibody restimulations over a 28-day time course, demonstrating that CRISPRoff gene silencing memory is stably propagated across approximately 30–80 cell divisions in vitro (Methods). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) confirmed that CRISPRoff gene silencing was highly specific, with robust repression of the CD55 or CD81 target gene and no other differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 28 days after electroporation (Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) further confirmed the specificity of DNA methylation deposited at the target locus by CRISPRoff; the highest differentially methylated region (DMR) between targeting samples and NTC samples occurred at the CD55 TSS (Fig. 1f,g).

We then tested the ability to silence therapeutically relevant genes with CGIs that are known to modulate T cell signaling or adoptive T cell function including FAS (ref. 34), PTPN2 (ref. 35), RC3H1 (Roquin 1)36, SUV39H1 (ref. 37), MED12 (ref. 38) and RASA2 (ref. 39). For FAS, PTPN2, RC3H1 and SUV39H1, we electroporated CRISPRoff mRNA along with the top six predicted sgRNAs for each gene in an arrayed format alongside an NTC and then maintained cells in vitro for up to 27 days after electroporation, with restimulation using anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 soluble antibodies every 9–10 days. We also targeted each gene for KO using Cas9 as described above. Cell pellets were collected for RNA or DNA extraction and bulk RNA-seq (on day 7 after electroporation), indel analysis (on day 7 after electroporation) or qPCR (on day 27 after electroporation) was performed to measure target gene silencing or KO. We found that, for each gene, at least one and generally multiple sgRNAs could potently and durably mediate CRISPRoff silencing of target gene expression (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Cas9 gene KO was also efficient (Supplementary Fig. 2b). RNA-seq analysis enabled us to profile the biological consequences of silencing or KO of FAS, MED12, PTPN2, RC3H1, SUV39H1 and RASA2 and examine the specificity of CRISPRoff gene silencing (Fig. 1I and Supplementary Fig. 2c–n). FAS and RC3H1 were the sole genes decreased upon CRISPRoff targeting of FAS and RC3H1, respectively. The only genes that decreased upon SUV39H1 targeting were SUV39H1 and LINC02446; LINC02446 reduction is almost certainly a biological secondary effect of SUV39H1 ablation because it was also decreased by SUV39H1 KO with Cas9 and an independent sgRNA. PTPN2 targeting also had relatively specific effects on the transcriptome with a modest number of additional downregulated genes, which could be either off-target effects or secondary effects of target KD. RASA2 KD or MED12 KD (targeted with a pool of three sgRNAs) had broader effects on the transcriptome. For MED12, to further examine CRISPRoff specificity and to determine whether observed DEGs besides the target gene were secondary transcriptional effects or potential off-targets of CRISPRoff, we compared CRISPRoff RNA-seq results to Cas9 KO RNA-seq results (Supplementary Fig. 2n). Many DEGs were shared between MED12 KD and KO and recapitulate known biology. For example, top downregulated DEGs include KLF2, CCR7 and IL7R, which are all expected biological secondary effects of MED12 loss on the basis of past observations from our group and others38,40 (Supplementary Fig. 2l–n). To further investigate CRISPRoff specificity, we analyzed gene expression changes for neighboring genes within a 100-kb window around each target gene (to look for on-target, off-gene effects). We also examined gene expression changes for predicted off-target sgRNA-binding sites (https://www.idtdna.com/site/order/designtool/index/CRISPR_SEQUENCE) within ±1 kb of a gene's TSS, according to previously established rules for CRISPRoff activity and specificity27. Only one gene across 151 putative off-target sites for all genes targeted showed evidence of potential CRISPRoff off-target activity (Supplementary Fig. 3a–f). Specifically, in RASA2-KD samples, we observed decreased expression of LARP1B. However, further work would be necessary to determine whether LARP1B is a true off-target or an indirect effect associated with RASA2 KD. In summary, CRISPRoff gene silencing proved programmable, efficient, specific and durable at many endogenous genes in primary human T cells.

In addition to its activity at CGIs, CRISPRoff was previously shown in HEK293T cells to allow durable silencing (in a DNA methylation-dependent manner) of genes lacking a CGI27. To explore whether this biology extends to primary T cells, we attempted to use CRISPRoff for durable silencing of five genes lacking CGIs: CD5, LAG3, PDCD1, ENTPD1 (CD39) and PTPRC (CD45). Each of these genes encodes a cell surface protein that is important for sensing external stimuli41, signaling42,43,44 and function45,46 in T cells. We first electroporated CRISPRoff mRNA and an individual sgRNA or a pool of three sgRNAs targeting the TSS of CD5, LAG3, PDCD1 or CD39 or a single NTC sgRNA. As a control, we also electroporated Cas9 mRNA and one KO sgRNA targeting each of these genes or an NTC sgRNA. We then measured cell surface levels of each target protein at time points up to 35 days after electroporation. For each time point, cells were restimulated using anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 soluble antibodies and cell surface expression was measured 24 h later using flow cytometry. For the non-CGI genes targeted, we observed stable, partially stable or unstable silencing over the course of ~30 days. For CD5 and LAG3, CRISPRoff silencing was comparable to or even more efficient than Cas9 KO. At 30 days after electroporation, the CRISPRoff pooled sgRNA conditions for CD5 and LAG3 remained up to 99.5% and 99.1% silenced, respectively (Fig. 2a–d). While we observed some differences between the efficiency of PD1 silencing using CRISPRoff between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, PD1 remained stably silenced out to 30 days after electroporation in most cells across of a bulk population (78.15% PD1-KD cells versus ~90% PD1-KO cells) (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Fig. 4). CD39 exhibited partially stable silencing, with a fraction of cells regaining CD39 expression with time, although most cells (53%) remained CD39− negative compared to the NTC on day 35 (Fig. 2g,h). We then evaluated CRISPRoff or CRISPRi mRNA with a single sgRNA targeting the CD45 TSS or an NTC sgRNA in comparison to Cas9 mRNA with a single sgRNA targeting protein coding exon 2 or an NTC sgRNA. Initially, CRISPRoff, CRISPRi and Cas9 all showed efficient ablation of CD45 (~99% for KD and ~85% for KO); however, by 7 days after electroporation, both CRISPRoff and CRISPRi effects diminished until reaching the levels of the NTC by 24 days after electroporation (Fig. 2i,j). Taken together, we observed a range of how effectively and durably non-CGI genes can be silenced and found that some genes with particularly low levels of CpG dinucleotides around the TSS remain challenging to stably silence (Fig. 2k). Further work is needed to elucidate rules for governing stable silencing at non-CGI genes in primary human T cells. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that expression from CGI and non-CGI genes can be stably silenced in primary human T cells through transient delivery of CRISPRoff.

Epi-editing can modulate gene expression without inducing DSBs, in contrast to Cas9 nuclease targeting. This feature could offer important advantages in the context of multiplexed gene targeting approaches, as genome editing with nuclease-active Cas9 can result in translocations or chromosomal loss, which both have potential to be detrimental to cell proliferation, cell survival and perhaps the safety of therapeutic cell products9,47,48,49. To explore this approach, we simultaneously targeted sets of three, four or five nonessential genes with CRISPRoff or nuclease-active Cas9. Targeting multiple genes with nuclease-active Cas9 resulted in substantial cellular toxicity in human T cells, which may be attributed to the multiple DSBs generated by this approach (Fig. 3a). In contrast, targeting three, four or five genes for silencing with CRISPRoff resulted in minimal to no observable cellular toxicity compared to electroporation alone at either a high or low dose of mRNA (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). CRISPRoff multiplexed epi-editing averaged across four donors was efficient and durable out to 30 days after electroporation with combined silencing of three, four and five target genes at 93.5%, 82.4% and 65.8%, respectively (Fig. 3b,c,e). For some of these multiplexed gene combinations, silencing was marginally improved by increasing the dose CRISPRoff mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5c–f). For these multiplexing experiments, we confirmed efficient CRISPRoff gene silencing for each gene individually with greater than 95% KD when targeting one sgRNA to the TSS (Supplementary Fig. 5g). We also achieved efficient, multiplexed gene silencing of three potentially therapeutically relevant genes (FAS, RC3H1 and SUV39H1), knocking down each target transcript by ~80% (Fig. 3d).We anticipate that durable multiplexing silencing could be further improved by empirically testing individual sgRNAs targeting genes of interest at lower doses to identify sgRNAs with optimized potency for use in multiplexed combinations.

Epi-editing would be further enabled by technology to stably activate target chromatin sites, in addition to the silencing capability demonstrated above. We previously developed CRISPRon, a deactivated Cas9 enzyme fused to the TET1 DNA demethylase catalytic domain, to remove DNA methylation from a targeted locus and induce gene expression27. However, this prior work with CRISPRon was performed in immortalized cell lines and only demonstrated reactivation of genes through demethylation of TSSs that were previously silenced by CRISPRoff. Here, we set out to extend the capabilities in three important ways: (1) enable use in primary cells; (2) demonstrate activation of a genomic element that is naturally DNA methylated and epigenetically silenced; and (3) extend the use of epi-editing from TSSs to an enhancer element. We generated three variants of CRISPRon mRNA (TETv3, TETv4 and TETv5), which differed in the linker length used between TET1 and dCas9, with the cap structure and base modifications we optimized for CRISPRoff (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6a). To test whether CRISPRon could modulate clinically relevant gene expression in primary human T cells, we turned toward the FOXP3 (forkhead box P3) locus. FOXP3 is a transcription factor necessary for establishing immune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs are essential for immune homeostasis through establishing tolerance against self-antigens, limiting inflammation and aiding in tissue repair. Tregs are usually defined by high and sustained FOXP3 expression, whereas conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs) only transiently express FOXP3 upon activation. The difference in FOXP3 expression between cell types can be partly attributed to an intronic enhancer that harbors the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR), which is completely demethylated in Tregs but remains highly methylated in Tconvs50 (Fig. 4b). We hypothesized that targeting the TSDR in Tconvs with CRISPRon could remove endogenous repressive DNA methylation at this regulatory element, resulting in constitutive FOXP3 expression51. We isolated CD4 + CD25low Tconvs from two to four human donors and stimulated cells with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 soluble antibodies. At 2 days after stimulation, we electroporated CRISPRon-TETv3 and five individual sgRNAs targeting the TSDR, FOXP3 TSS or AAVS1 safe harbor locus as a control (Supplementary Fig. 6b). We then measured FOXP3 expression at 9 days after initial stimulation, at which point Tconvs have entered a resting state and, thus, should express low amounts of FOXP3. Only sgRNAs targeting the TSDR increased FOXP3 expression, while targeting the TSS did not increase FOXP3 relative to control sgRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 6b). At 48 h after restimulation, when control Tconvs transiently express FOXP3, cells treated with CRISPRon-TETv3 targeting the TSDR expressed higher levels of FOXP3 than AAVS1-targeted control cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c). We then took the top three performing guides targeting the TSDR from this initial experiment (guide 1, guide 3 and guide 4) and tested them either as individual sgRNAs or as pools of two or three sgRNAs with each CRISPRon mRNA variant. We observed that targeting CRISPRon to the FOXP3 TSDR resulted in an increased fraction of FOXP3+ cells across multiple donors, CRISPRon designs and sgRNA number relative to the CRISPRon AAVS1 controls (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 6d).

Each triangle (donor 1) or circle (donor 2) represents an individual CpG.

We maintained the TSDR targeting conditions and AAVS1 control cells in culture to assess the stability and persistence of FOXP3 expression over time, restimulating cells with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 soluble antibodies every 9–11 days. On day 28 after initial stimulation, Tconvs were collected for flow cytometry and we observed that FOXP3 expression was stably upregulated in a population of cells over weeks in vitro (Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Fig. 6e). Targeted bisulfite sequencing confirmed reduced methylation at the TSDR in TSDR-targeted cells even though the bulk bisulfite sequencing was performed on a heterogeneous population of cells, as we did not sort for FOXP3+ expression before bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 4g). As expected, methylation at the FOXP3 TSS did not change when targeting the TSDR (Fig. 4g) nor did it change at other Treg associated genes (IL2RA and IKZF2) (Supplementary Fig. 6f,g). Our optimized CRISPRon results contrast with a previous effort to demethylate the TSDR locus in a targeted manner in Tconvs, which showed rapid remethylation of the locus at late time points in culture, even when FOXP3− negative clones were isolated51. Here, without sorting or clonal isolation, we were able to achieve a significantly increased fraction of FOXP3+ cells across donors after 28 days in culture with CRISPRon targeting the TSDR, as compared to the AAVS1 sgRNA control. These results establish CRISPRon as a powerful tool to control expression of an important endogenous gene expression through enhancer targeting with potential to be applied toward next-generation cell therapies.

Having established a robust toolbox for epigenome engineering in primary T cells, we applied it to enhance immune cell therapy function in a preclinical model of cancer. We aimed to use CRISPRoff to enhance CAR-T cell function by simultaneous targeted genomic integration of a CAR (or other antigen receptor) transgene along with targeted epigenetic silencing using CRISPRoff. Targeted insertion of a CAR to the endogenous TCRα constant (TRAC) locus using CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing can enhance T cell potency by placing CAR expression under the regulated and dynamic control of the endogenous TCRα promoter, limiting exhaustion and dysfunction52. This approach offers potential functional, safety and cost benefits over current lentiviral and gammaretroviral transduction methods. Our rationale for combining this approach with CRISPRoff is based on the clinical observation that introduction of a CAR alone is insufficient to achieve durable responses or cures for most cancers. Our group and many others have identified additional genes that can be disrupted to further enhance CAR-T cell function in challenging tumor microenvironments, which we reasoned would be appropriate targets for epi-editing38,53,54,55. In particular, we discovered that RASA2 ablation promotes T cell function across a variety of immunosuppressive conditions, improving antigen sensitivity and durable effector function39.

We reasoned that combining TRAC CAR KI with CRISPRoff-mediated silencing of additional targets could boost CAR-T cell function while avoiding translocations and other genotoxic events seen with prior multiplexed KO approaches56. We first explored an orthogonal Cas approach using Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a (AsCas12a) ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for targeted CAR KI in combination with stable epigenetic silencing of RASA2 using the S. pyogenes dCas9-based CRISPRoff system57,58. AsCas12a was precomplexed with a TRAC CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and coelectroporated with CRISPRoff mRNA and 1–3 sgRNAs targeting RASA2. Following electroporation, cells were transduced with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) HDR template (HDRT) containing a CD19-specific 28z CAR transgene flanked by TRAC locus homology arms, which serves as the HDR donor for KI (Fig. 5a). The addition of CRISPRoff mRNA and sgRNAs targeting RASA2 did not reduce CAR KI efficiency or yield (Fig. 5b). Likewise, CRISPRoff exhibited robust RASA2 silencing activity, similar in cells with or without integration of a CAR (Fig. 5c,d). In addition, we tested a fully nonviral approach for CAR KI using Cas9-target-site-modified single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) templates that were previously adapted for good manufacturing practice (GMP)59. We observed that using the same species of Cas9 and dCas9 for KI and KD resulted in translocations between TRAC and RASA2 and less efficient CAR KI, presumably because of sgRNA swapping that led to Cas9-mediated DSBs at both loci (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b)60. To address guide swapping, we tested truncated sgRNAs (16-bp protospacer) for CRISPRoff targeting RASA2 with the goal of retaining dCas9 binding and transcriptional control while eliminating Cas9 nuclease activity61. Truncated sgRNAs ameliorated RASA2:TRAC translocations (Supplementary Fig. 7a), retained efficient CAR KI (Supplementary Fig. 7b) and maintained silencing activity, albeit to a lesser extent than did full-length sgRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 7c–e). Taken together, we developed multiple approaches that could be made GMP-compatible that combine targeted CRISPR KI and programmable epigenome engineering.

We then tested the durability and functional effect of RASA2 silencing by CRISPRoff in CAR-T cells through an in vitro repetitive stimulation assay with RASA2 KD using a pool of three full-length sgRNAs or NTC. Experiments were performed with AsCas12a-based KI using an AAV HDRT given the more stable epigenome engineering observed with the full-length CRISPRoff sgRNAs. Most control CAR+ cells displayed an immunophenotype consistent with a T memory stem cell population at 7 days after electroporation on the basis of CD45RA and CD62L expression, although RASA2-KD cells shifted slightly to a more T effector-like population, consistent with previous reports39 (Fig. 5e,f). RASA2-silenced CAR-T cells were cocultured with CD19-expressing tumor cells at multiple effector-to-target (E:T) ratios repeatedly every 48 h (Fig. 5g and Methods). Consistent with previous reports, this repetitive stimulation assay caused control-edited CAR-T cells (treated with CRISPRoff and an NTC sgRNA) to decline progressively in their ability to control cancer cells by the last stimulation (Fig. 5h). RASA2-silenced CAR-T cells continued to kill target cells efficiently after five rounds of stimulation (Fig. 5h), consistent with the reported behavior of RASA2-KO CAR-T cells39. RASA2 remained stably silenced in RASA2-targeted CAR-T cells isolated after the last stimulation, confirmed by western blot (Fig. 5i). Nonviral Cas9-based KI cells that had RASA2 silenced with a pool of three truncated sgRNAs also performed better than control-edited cells in a repetitive stimulation assay (Supplementary Fig. 7f).

We next examined the stability of CRISPRoff-induced silencing in CAR-T cells when transferred in vivo. As RASA2 silencing confers CAR-T cells with an in vivo fitness advantage over control-edited CAR-T cells, we instead chose to target CD151, which has no known role in T cell fitness in vivo. First, A375 melanoma cells engineered to express CD19 were engrafted in the flanks of NSG mice. Epi-edited T cells were engineered as previously described with an AsCas12a RNP precomplexed with a TRAC crRNA for CD19-CAR KI and CRISPRoff mRNA coelectroporated with a pool of three sgRNAs targeting the CD151 TSS or an NTC (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Epi-edited or control-edited CAR-T cells were cultured in vitro for 1 week after electroporation and then transferred in vivo through tail-vein injection 1 week after A375 engraftment. At 14 days after CAR-T cell transfer, tumors and spleens were isolated from mice and CAR-T cell CD151 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. Compared to NTC CAR-T cells, CD151 targeted CAR-T cells obtained from the tumor and spleen retained highly efficient CD151 KD, suggesting that CRISPRoff silencing is stable upon transfer in vivo and tumor-antigen recognition (Supplementary Fig. 8b–d).

Lastly, we tested the functional efficacy of RASA2-silenced CAR-T cells in vivo. As described above, we generated RASA2-silenced TRAC CAR-T using AsCas12a KI with an AAV template and CRISPRoff with a pool of three full-length sgRNAs targeting RASA2 or a single NTC sgRNA (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). NSG mice were injected intravenously with Nalm6 leukemia cells and, 4 days later, injected with RASA2-silenced TRAC CD19-28z CAR-T cells, control TRAC CD19-28z CAR-T cells (treated with CRISPRoff and a single NTC sgRNA) or TRAC-KO T cells through the tail vein (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Tumor burden was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) for ~40 days. We found that RASA2-silenced CAR-T cells had a significant advantage over NTC CAR-T cells at controlling tumor burden in vivo in cohorts of mice treated with cells from multiple human donors (Fig. 5j and Supplementary Fig. 9d). Mice treated with RASA2-silenced TRAC CAR-T cells also had significantly extended survival relative NTC TRAC CAR-T cells (Fig. 5k,l). Taken together, these data suggest that epi-edited CAR-T cells can maintain stable target gene silencing even through multiple rounds of successful antigen-positive cancer cell killing, enabling functional enhancement of CAR-T cells through silencing of ‘checkpoint' genes without the need for multiplexed gene cleavage.

We established an all-RNA CRISPR-based epigenetic editing platform for multiplexed primary human T cell programming. Previous work with CRISPRoff and related systems have demonstrated robust and stable epigenetic silencing in cell lines such as HEK293T cells24,26,27,62. While important for initial optimization, these cell lines demonstrate a variety of abnormalities such as endogenously low levels of the TET enzymes that reverse DNA methylation from CpG dinucleotides63. We now show that, in primary human T cells, which express high levels of TET2 and TET3 enzymes64, silencing of endogenous genes with and without a CGI is stable following only transient expression of CRISPRoff62. This approach is highly specific to the target loci and durable through multiple T cell activations, numerous cell divisions and transfer in vivo. It is also compatible with massive multiplexing, eliminating the cytotoxicity and genotoxicities observed with genome engineering using nuclease-active Cas9 or base-editing approaches65. Critically, because CRISPRon and CRISPRoff need to be delivered only transiently to exert stable effects, they circumvent the immunogenicity of constitutive Cas protein required for altering expression at the RNA level through CRISPRa, CRISPRi or RNA-targeting Cas species21,22,23.

Transient delivery of CRISPRoff is critical to prevent host rejection of the ultimate cellular products. Here, we optimized mRNA delivery for CRISPRoff by combining cap structure, codon optimization and base modifications to substantially increase mRNA potency. This system enables complete silencing of five concurrent targets in this study and we expect this number could be greatly expanded. Our approach is compatible with current electroporation-based manufacturing processes and the required GMP reagents and equipment. We expect that, for any CRISPR technology, there exists the risk of off-targets and this risk should be carefully evaluated for each unique sgRNA and gene target in any clinical program.

Additionally, we developed an all-RNA platform for CRISPRon that can remove endogenous methylation from the TSDR of FOXP3. While prior studies with CRISPRon in HEK293T cells have reactivated genes that were previously silenced by CRISPRoff, here, we targeted a critical endogenously methylated noncoding region to establish stable de novo expression of FOXP3 in a CD4+ Tconv cell population over time. These data contrast with a previous attempt to deliver plasmid encoding dCas9 fused to TET1 and an sgRNA targeting the TSDR to primary human T cells, which resulted in rapid remethylation of the TSDR over time, even when FOXP3-expressing clones were isolated51. In this study, we only demonstrated CRISPRon activity at one enhancer; however, future efforts may focus on establishing the generalizability of this tool across diverse genomic elements. We anticipate that multiplexing with both CRISPRon and CRISPRoff will provide a foundation for systematic reprogramming of chromatin architecture in primary human cells.

Lastly, we demonstrated durable silencing for a variety of clinically relevant T cell genes and developed two strategies compatible with clinical translation that combine CRISPRoff silencing of RASA2 with targeted TRAC locus CAR KI, using either truncated sgRNAs or orthogonal Cas species to circumvent the issue of guide swapping. There are many alternative therapeutic targets and a remaining question is how generalizable CRISPRoff-mediated gene silencing will be across different genomic loci with varying amounts of CpG dinucleotides. We show robust and durable silencing at promoter regions both with and without well-defined CGIs. However, silencing at two of the five non-CGI genes exhibited reduced stability. In addition, regulation of gene expression can be complex and driven by multiple regulatory elements in a cell-state-specific manner. Additional studies are needed to establish rules for stable silencing or activation across diverse genomic loci and cell states, as well as the requirements for CpG content and genomic context. We anticipate that large-scale functional genomics screens across promoters, enhancers and other regulatory regions will be enabled by this platform and could shed light on the rules governing stable versus metastable gene silencing. These studies can also provide important information for mapping and dissecting the functions of noncoding elements in the genome, which can lead to novel therapeutic strategies as with the context-specific enhancer targeted in therapies for sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration66. We expect that leveraging CRISPRoff and CRISPRon will offer insights into gene regulation, epigenetic landscapes and the intricacies of cellular differentiation. Moreover, leveraging these technologies in primary human cells paves the way for the next wave of advanced cellular products with finely tuned control of the epigenetic state to improve the potency, durability and safety of engineered cellular therapies.

Human peripheral blood Leukopaks enriched for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from deidentified healthy donors were purchased from StemCell Technologies (200-0092). CD3+ T cells were isolated using the EasySep Human T cell isolation kit (100-069) per the manufacturer-provided instructions. After isolation, T cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per ml and activated with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Life Technologies, 40203D). T cells were maintained in culture at a density of 1 × 106 cells per ml throughout and cultured in complete X-VIVO-15 (cX-VIVO), consisting of X-VIVO 15 (Lonza Bioscience, 04-418Q) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (R&D systems, lot M19187), 5 ng mL−1 IL-7 and 5 ng mL−1 IL-15, unless otherwise indicated. CD4+CD25low Tconvs were isolated from washed PBMCs using the EasySep Human CD4+CD127lowCD25+ Treg isolation kit (StemCell Technologies, 18063) according to manufacturer's protocol. Tconvs were activated using Immunocult CD2/CD3/CD28 T cell activation reagent (StemCell Technologies, 10990) at 12.5 μl ml−1. Tconvs were maintained in culture in cX-VIVO supplemented with 300 IU per ml of IL-2 and passaged every 2–3 days.

Seven CRISPRoff mRNA products with varying cap structure (m7G, Cap1 and ARCA) and codon optimization sequences were purchased from Aldevron and stored at −80 °C. The CRISPRoff 143533B (CRISPRoff v7) mRNA design was used for in vitro transcription (IVT) to make mRNA in house using Cap1 (TriLink Biotechnologies #N-7113-5). For IVT reactions, plasmids containing the CRISPRoff-V2.3 codon-optimized sequence, CRISPRon-TETv3, CRISPRon-TETv4 or CRISPRon-TETv5 were cloned into a mutated T7 promoter plasmid as previously described67,68. IVT templates were produced by PCR amplification of CRISPRoff-V2.3 or CRISPRon variants with the forward primer correcting the T7 mutation and reverse primer appending a poly(A) tail, such that the final template contained the wild-type T7 promoter, 5′ untranslated region (UTR) including Kozak sequence, codon-optimized CRISPRoff-V2.3 coding sequence or CRISPRon variants, 3′ UTR and 145-bp poly(A) tail. The PCR product was purified using solid-phase reversible immobilization bead selection and stored at −20 °C until use. IVT reactions were performed with the HiScribe T7 high-yield RNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, E2040S) under full substitution of pseudo-UTP and in presence of 4 mM CleanCap AG (which encodes Cap1) (TriLink Biotechnologies, N-7113-5) with the addition of RNAse Inhibitor (New England Biolabs, M0314L) and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (New England Biolabs, M2403L). Transcribed mRNA was purified with lithium chloride and eluted in water. After quantification by NanoDrop spectrophotometer and normalization to 1 μg μl−1, mRNA product was assessed on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation system and subsequently stored at −80 °C. CleanCap Cas9 mRNA was purchased from TriLink (L-7606).

For experiments using Cas9, CRISPRi or CRISPRoff mRNA, fresh CD3+ T cells were activated with a 1:1 bead-to-cell ratio with anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Life Technologies, 40203D) in the presence of 5 ng μl−1 IL-7 and 5 ng μl−1 IL-15 at 1 × 106 cells per ml. After 2 days of stimulation, T cells were magnetically debeaded, washed with PBS and resuspended in TheraPEAK P3 buffer with supplement (Lonza, G4LP3-126000) at 0.75 × 106 cells in 20 μl. Cas9, CRISPRi and CRISPRoff mRNA were added to 20 μl of cells at an equimolar ratio (1, 1.07 or 1.6 μg, respectively) with 2 μg of chemically modified sgRNA (Synthego) and cells were electroporated on a Lonza 4D Nucleofector using pulse code DS137. Immediately after electroporation, 80 μl of prewarmed cX-VIVO was added to each electroporation well and cells were incubated for 30 min in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C followed by the distribution of each electroporation reaction into three wells of a 96-well round-bottom plate. Each well was brought to 200 μl with cX-VIVO. Cells were maintained and expanded by the addition of cX-VIVO every 2 or 3 days and restimulated with ImmunoCult Human CD2/CD3/CD28 T cell activation reagent (StemCell Technologies, 10990) every 9–10 days at 6.25 μl ml−1. All sgRNA sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

To evaluate CRISPRoff mRNA designs, we electroporated seven CRISPRoff mRNA designs across a range of doses along with an sgRNA targeting CD151. We then compared the CRISPRoff activity data across constructs using ordinary least square regression. We modeled CD151 expression as a function of dose and mRNA variant and then computed a P value for the difference between mRNA variants across all doses using the standard error. CRISPRoff 7 was the most potent CRISPRoff mRNA variant as assessed by the degree of CD151 silencing across CRISPRoff doses.

For experiments using CRISPRon mRNA, CD4+CD25low (Tconv) cells were isolated from PBMCs and activated using Immunocult CD2/CD3/CD28 T cell activation reagent (StemCell Technologies, 10990) at 12.5 μl ml−1. Then, 2 days after activation, Tconvs were electroporated with 1.6 μg of CRISPRon mRNA and 2 μg of chemically modified sgRNA (Synthego) with pulse code DS137 as described above. After electroporation, Tconv cells were maintained and expanded in cX-VIVO supplemented with 300 U per ml

For all experiments with flow cytometry as a readout looking at cell surface markers, 0.5 × 105–1 × 105 cells per condition were transferred to a round-bottom 96-well plate, centrifuged, washed once with 200 μl of cell staining buffer and stained with antibodies (1:50 dilution) for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark (antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 1). Samples were measured using an Attune NXT cytometer with a 96-well autosampler (Invitrogen) and analyzed using FlowJo version 10.9.0 unless otherwise stated. For experiments measuring PD1, LAG3 and CD39 surface expression over time, cells were stimulated with ImmunoCult Human CD2/CD3/CD28 T cell activation reagent (StemCell Technologies, 10990) at 6.25 μl ml−1 24 h before flow cytometry readout. To obtain comparable live-cell counts between conditions, events were recorded using a fixed volume for all samples. To determine the number of cell divisions in in vitro experiments over time, we plated 0.16 × 106 cells into 96-well round-bottom wells following electroporation. We then counted cells on an Attune NXT Cytometer every 48 h or at each passage time.

For intracellular flow cytometry staining, 0.5 × 105–1 × 105 cells per condition were transferred to a 96-well V-bottom plate, centrifuged and washed once with 200 μl of staining buffer. Cells were resuspended in 30 μl of staining buffer containing Ghost Dye red 780 (Tonbo, 13-0865-T500) and antibodies targeting surface proteins of interest and stained for 20 min at 4 °C in the dark. After staining, cells were washed once with 170 μl of staining buffer and then resuspended in 50 µl of 1× FOXP3 Fix/Perm buffer (BioLegend, 421403) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. After fixation, cells were permeabilized in 200 µl of 1× FOXP3 Perm buffer for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After permeabilization, cells were spun down and washed once with 1× FOXP3 Perm buffer and then resuspended in 30 µl of 1× FOXP3 Perm buffer containing antibodies targeting intracellular proteins and stained in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Following intracellular staining, cells were washed once with the addition of 170 µl of staining buffer and centrifuged at 300g for 5 min; the supernatant was removed. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of staining buffer and then measured using the Attune NXT Cytometer with a 96-well autosampler.

Human primary T cells were harvested 27 days after electroporation (CD55 and CD81) or 7 days after electroporation (FAS, PTPN2, RC3H1, SUV39H1 and MED12). A total of 1 × 106 cells were harvested per condition and RNA was isolated using a Quick-RNA MicroPrep Kit (Zymo, R1050). Isolated RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Invitrogen, AM2239) and concentrated using an RNA clean and concentrate kit (Zymo, NC0622892). Library preparation was carried out using the QuantSeq FWD V2 with UDI Set A1 kit and UMI module (Lexogen, 191.96). Final libraries were assessed using a 4200 TapeStation (Agilent), quantified using the Qubit ds HS assay kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced as single-end 50-bp reads on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina) or NextSeq 500 (Illumina).

RNA-seq data were aligned and counts were generated using the RNA-seq pipeline of nf-core (version 3.18)69. Raw sequencing reads were quantified using Salmon and summarized to gene-level counts using tximport. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using the limma-voom framework, with donor variation included as a covariate in the statistical model. Gene expression was normalized using the trimmed mean of M values method and lowly expressed genes were filtered before analysis. DEGs were identified by comparing treated samples to NTCs, with significance criteria set at an adjusted P value < 0.05 (empirical Bayes moderated statistics with Benjamini–Hochberg correction) and absolute log2 fold change > 1. Results were visualized using volcano plots displaying log2 fold change versus −log10(adjusted P value), with genes colored on the basis of significance thresholds or target gene.

The MED12-KO RNA-seq data shown in Supplementary Fig. 2n were from previously generated data in the A.M. lab40 and are representative of CD4+ cells collected 8 days after activation with ImmunoCult Human CD2/CD3/CD28 T cell activation reagent (StemCell Technologies, 10990). Genotyping measured by NGS showed ~80% editing at MED12. The RNA-seq reads were analyzed as previously described and genes with a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value < 0.05 were considered significant. We correlated our MED12 CRISPRoff KD (76.5% KD) with this dataset to better match the degree of gene disruption as our MED12 Cas9 KO data only had ~55% indel-editing efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2b) and we observed fewer DEGs than expected.

Off-target predictions were generated through the Integrated DNA Technology (IDT) CRISPR–Cas9 guide RNA checker (https://www.idtdna.com/site/order/designtool/index/CRISPR_SEQUENCE) for both Cas9 KO and CRISPRoff KD sgRNAs. For CRISPRoff sgRNAs, predicted off-target loci were filtered for sites that fell within ±1 kb of a gene promoter. We also performed ‘on-target, off-gene' analyses by assessing effects on proximal genes that fell within a 100-kb window around the intended target. Only predicted off-target or proximal genes that had an absolute KD log fold change > 1 and adjusted P value < 0.05 were considered potential true off-target genes.

We generated WGBS libraries for 12 samples, corresponding to EE (empty electroporation), NTC and targeting for CD55 across two donors, each done in technical replicate. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and 250 ng of DNA was diluted to 2.27 ng μl−1 in 110 μl with 2 μl of 0.5% lambda DNA spike-in and sheared using a Covaris E220 evolution with intensifier for 50 s to an average length of ~500 bp. Sonicated DNA was recovered using the MinElute reaction cleanup kit (Qiagen), bisulfite conversion was performed using the EZ DNA methylation-Gold kit (Zymogen) and the resulting ssDNA was quantified on the Qubit ssDNA assay kit (Invitrogen). Library preparation was performed using the xGen methylation-sequencing DNA library preparation kit (IDT, 10009860) and xGen Normalase UDI primers plate 1 (IDT, 10009796). The prepared libraries were quantified on a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent) and Qubit double-stranded DNA HS assay kit (Invitrogen). Libraries were sequenced using paired-end 150-bp reads on a NovaSeqX with a 10% PhiX spike-in to diversify the sample pools.

Raw WGBS-seq FASTQ files were processed using the nf-methylseq:2.6.0 pipeline69 with the default parameters along with the ‘--three_prime_clip_R1 10' and ‘--three_prime_clip_r2 10' options. Differential CpG DNA methylation analysis was performed using the methylKit R package70. CpG methylation data from Bismark coverage files was imported. To search for differentially methylated tiles, the ‘tileMethylCounts' function was used with options ‘win.size = 1000' and ‘step.size = 100'. DMRs were scored by the percentage methylation difference and q values were calculated using the ‘calculateDiffMeth' function with ‘overdispersion = MN' and ‘adjust = BH' options using the replicates as a covariate in fitting the model. Results were visualized as Manhattan plots to display −log10-transformed P values associated with individual methylation tiling windows. Statistically significant DMRs with FDR < 0.05 (Benjamini–Hochberg) were colored on the basis of their methylation status. To visualize the methylation status at individual loci in Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), the base-level methylation status was extracted from BedGraph files from the nf-methylseq pipeline. Then, results were converted into an IGV-friendly format and data were displayed as bar charts, in which methylated regions were considered as a methylation percentage of 50–100% shown in the range of 0.5 to 1 in red and unmethylated regions were considered as a methylation percentage of 0–50% shown in the range of −1 to −0.5 in blue.

PBAT-seq files at the FOXP3 locus were provided50. PBAT-seq analysis was conducted as previously described50. PBAT-seq tracks were visualized using a sliding binning strategy with a bin size of 1,500 and step size of 300 in ggplot2 (version 3.5.1).

A total of 200,000 cells were collected for conditions coelectroporated with CRISPRon and Guide 3 targeting the TSDR or two AAVS1 control targets, spun down and frozen at −80 °C. Targeted bisulfite sequencing was conducted by EpigenDX at two sites across the FOXP3 locus (TSDR or TSS) and off-target sites including IL2RA and IKZF2.

Cells were lysed and reverse-transcribed as described below. Briefly, 0.1 × 105–0.2 × 105 T cells were spun down in 96-well U-bottom plates and washed once with DPBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) (StemCell Technologies, 37350). Cells pellets were either frozen on dry ice and then stored at −80 °C until further use or lysed in 50 μl of complete RNA lysis buffer (9.6 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 U per ml proteinase K, 300 U per ml DNAse 1, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.44 mM CaCl2, 10 μM DTT and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-114). Cells were incubated in RNA lysis buffer for 8 min at room temperature and then 30 μl of lysed cells were added to 3 μl of RNA stop solution in a new 96-well PCR plate (1 mM proteinase K inhibitor, 90 mM EGTA and 113 μM DTT in UltraPure water) and incubated for 3 min at room temperature to stop the lysis reaction. Then, 32 μl of RevertAid RT kit (Thermo Fisher, K1691) was aliquoted in a separate 96-well PCR plate and 8 μl of the lysis samples were added and mixed. RT was performed in a thermocycler with samples incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 60 min and 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were either immediately used for qPCR or frozen and stored at −80 °C.

A master mix was made using TaqMan Fast advanced master mix for qPCR (Thermo Fisher, 4444557) and primer probes (IDT) that targeted either the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, or a gene of interest (FAS, MED12, PTPN2, RASA2, RC3H1 or SUV39H1). The final concentration of primers was 0.5 μM and that of probes was 0.25 μM. Next, 15 μl of master mix was added to 9.6 μl of complementary DNA from the RT reaction above and qPCR was performed in 5-μl reactions with technical quadruplicates in a 384-well plate format using the QuantStudio real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher). To analyze the data, the Ct values of the technical quadruplicates were first averaged and then the ∆Ct was calculated by subtracting the GAPDH housekeeping Ct value from the averaged experimental values. The ∆∆Ct was then calculated from subtracting the ∆Ct of the NTC from the ∆Ct of the experimental samples. The fold change in gene expression was then calculated (2−∆∆Ct).

T cells were electroporated as described above. In multiplexed conditions with either CRISPRoff or Cas9 mRNA, each gene targeted received 1.6 μg of sgRNA. Cells were prepared for flow cytometry to collect live-cell counts and cell surface protein expression as described above. FCS files were analyzed using FlowJo (version 10.9.0) to create a gating scheme; cells were gated on lymphocytes, then single cells and then live cells and a positive or negative gate was drawn for each target gene. To calculate the proportion of cells with a given number of knocked down genes, the FlowJo workspace was read into R using the ‘flowCore', ‘CytoML' and ‘openCyto' packages. First, each individual cell was recorded as either positive or negative for each target gene, with negative indicating KD of a target, on the basis of thresholds set in FlowJo. These thresholds were verified through visualization with the ‘ggcyto' R package. Each cell was then annotated with the total number of genes successfully knocked down, from zero to five target genes. Lastly, the proportion of all cells for each number of knocked down genes was calculated.

For nonviral integration of a BCMA-specific CAR transgene at the TRAC locus, T cells were isolated and stimulated as described above. After 48 h of stimulation, cells were magnetically debeaded and prepared for electroporation. Briefly, to prepare the guide RNA targeting the TRAC locus, aliquots of crRNA and trans-activating crRNA (Edit-R, Dharmacon Horizon) were thawed and mixed 1:1 (v/v) and annealed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min to form an 80 μM solution. ssDNAenh was mixed into the gRNA solution at a 0.8:1 volume ratio before adding 40 μM Cas9-NLS (Berkely QB3 MacroLab) at a 1:1 (v/v) to attain a molar ratio of sgRNA-Cas9 of 2:1. Final RNP mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min, after which 50 pmol of RNP was used for each electroporation. The TRAC-targeting Cas9-RNP was mixed with a 2,923-nt ssDNA HDRt encoding the BCMA-specific CAR transgene, incubated for 10–15 min and then mixed with cells that were resuspended in 20 μl of TheraPEAK P3 buffer with supplement (Lonza, G4LP3-126000). The CRISPRoff mRNA and sgRNA targeting RASA2 or NTC (Synthego) were added on top of the cells last and then cells were electroporated using the Lonza 4D Nucleofector with pulse code EH115. For any experiments incorporating an RNP in the electroporation and mRNA, we used pulse code EH115, as this code is the most effective for RNPs (demonstrated elsewhere) while still maintaining efficiency for mRNAs. For RASA2 silencing with CRISPRoff mRNA, we codelivered either a chemically modified full-length (20 nt) sgRNA or a chemically modified truncated sgRNA (17 nt with the last base pair mismatched to effectively make a 16-nt truncated guide) (Synthego).

For integration of a CD19-specific CAR transgene at the TRAC locus using AAV6, Alt-R A.s. Cas12a (Cpf1) Ultra (IDT, 10001272) was mixed with a crRNA targeting the TRAC locus (IDT) at room temperature for 10–15 min. Cells that were resuspended in 20 μl of TheraPEAK P3 buffer with supplement (Lonza, G4LP3-126000) were mixed with TRAC-Cas12a-RNP and CRISPRoff mRNA and sgRNA targeting either RASA2 or an NTC were added on top of the cells and electroporated using pulse code EH115. At 30 min after electroporation, cells were transduced with AAV encoding the CD19-CAR as previously described52. The AAV-ITR plasmids containing the 1928z CAR transgene and TRAC-targeting homology arms for HDR was packaged into AAV6 by transfection of HEK293T cells together with pHelper and pAAV Rep-Cap plasmids using polyethylenimine. AAVs were further purified using iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation. AAVs were tittered using qPCR on DNase I (New England Biolabs)-treated, proteinase K (Qiagen)-digested samples. qPCR was performed with SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (BioRad, 1725201) on a StepOnePlus real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). AAV was added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection of 1 × 105 and cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium. Then, 1 day after electroporation, the AAV-containing medium was removed and the edited T cells were resuspended in fresh cX-VIVO and expanded using standard culturing conditions. The KI efficiency for both nonviral-mediated HDRT and AAV HDRT KI was evaluated by flow cytometry several days later.

Genomic DNA from 1 × 106–2 × 106 cells was purified using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was quantified using the NanoDrop One (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All DNA samples were digested with HindIII in 10× rCutSmart buffer (New England Biolabs) before the ddPCR. A ddPCR assay was designed to measure the occurrence of balanced translocations between TRAC and RASA2. The assays used a pair of primers targeting a balanced translocation with TRAC on the 5′ end and RASA2 on the 3′ end and a fluorescent FAM probe. A pair of primers targeting the housekeeping gene RPP30 were included as a reference using a fluorescent HEX probe. The percentage of the translocation occurrences was calculated on the basis of the number of FAM+ droplets normalized to the HEX+ droplets.

ddPCR was performed using a QX200 ddPCR system (BioRad) following the manufacturer's protocols. The reaction mix consisted of ddPCR Supermix for probes (no dUTP; BioRad), 900 nM of each primer, 300 nM of the FAM probe, 450 nM of the HEX probe and 400 ng of purified, digested genomic DNA. A 20-µl PCR reaction was used to generate lipid droplets with an automated droplet generator (BioRad). PCR amplification was performed using the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min and 42 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s (ramp: 2.5 °C s−1) and 62 °C for 1 min (ramp: 2.5 °C s−1), followed by an enzyme deactivation at 98 °C for 5 min. Readout was performed with QX200 droplet reader (BioRad) and ddPCR droplet reader oil (BioRad). Data analysis was conducted with the QX manager software (BioRad) and thresholds were set manually to obtain the number of positive droplets for each channel.

For immunoblotting experiments, 2 × 106–3 × 106 cells were harvested, resuspended in 70 μl of Pierce radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Fisher, 89901) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Fisher Scientific, 78440) and incubated at 4 °C for 40 min. The protein concentrations were determined using the Qubit protein and protein broad-range assay kits (Invitrogen, Q33211). Then, 15 μg of protein per sample was loaded onto 4–15% Tris–glycine SDS gels (BioRad) followed by transfer to PVDF membrane (BioRad) using the Biorad Trans-Blot transfer system. After transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 30 min. Primary antibody incubations were performed for either 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C (antibodies provided in Supplementary Table 1).

For in vitro cytotoxicity assays, we generated epi-silenced CAR-T cells with either TRAC BCMA-specific CAR KI using our nonviral approach or TRAC CD19-specific CAR-T cells using AAV as described above. For coculture assays, we generated CD19+ or BCMA+ nuclear-localized RFP+ A375 melanoma target cells. At 6 days after electroporation, 300 of these target cells were seeded in 50 μl of complete RPMI per well in a 384-well plate. Complete RMPI includes RPMI (Gibco, 21870076), 10% fetal calf serum (R&D systems, lot M19187), 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES solution (Sigma, H0887) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 11-360-070). The next morning, epi-silenced TRAC CD19-specific CAR-T cells or BCMA-CAR-T cells were counted and CAR expression was assessed by flow cytometry. CAR-T cell numbers were normalized and added to the target cells according to the indicated E:T cell ratios. The final per-well volume was 100 μl. Target cell counts were measured using the Incucyte live-cell imaging system (Sartorius) with imaging at 6-h intervals based on RFP expression.

For repetitive stimulation assays, CD19-A375 or BCMA-A375 target cells were seeded in complete RPMI medium 1 day before coculture. The next day, half of the medium was replaced with cX-VIVO and CD19-CAR-T cells or BCMA-CAR-T cells were seeded on top of the target cells at a 1:1 E:T ratio. This was repeated every 48 h for up to 5–7 stimulations. For each coculture, CAR-T cells were collected, strained through a 70-μm filter and counted using an Attune NXT Cytometer (Invitrogen). CAR expression was assessed using flow cytometry before each repetitive stimulation to normalize CAR-T cell counts between conditions. Before using the CAR-T cells for any downstream assay, the T cells were collected, counted and purified using EasySep Release human CD45 positive selection kit (StemCell, 100-0105).

All mice for animal experiments were housed and used in accordance with ethical guidelines approved by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All animal experiments were performed with 8–12-week-old female NOD-scid IL2rg−/− (NSG) mice were purchased from Jax. To assess whether CRISPRoff-mediated silencing persists in CAR-T cells in vivo, we generated epi-edited Cas12a-compatible TRAC CD19-CAR-T cells in combination with CRISPRoff mRNA and a pool of three sgRNAs targeting CD151 or an NTC. Mice were injected with 1 × 106 A375 melanoma cells (engineered to express CD19) through subcutaneous injection to the right flank. Then, 1 week later, mice were randomized on the basis of width and length of the tumors and 7.5 × 105 epi-edited or control-edited CAR-T cells were injected into the tail vein. Mouse health and tumor growth were monitored over time. At 14 days after CAR-T cell injection, mice were humanely killed and tumors and spleens were isolated and prepared for flow cytometry.

We generated Cas12a-compatible TRAC CD19-CAR-T cells treated with CRISPRoff mRNA and three guides targeting RASA2 or an NTC as described previously. Mice were intravenously injected with 0.5 × 106 FFluc–GFP NALM6 cells and then, 4 days later, injected with 0.1 × 106 RASA2-epi-silenced CD19-CAR-T cells or control-edited CD19-CAR-T cells. CRISPRoff silencing activity of RASA2 in CAR-T cells was validated using western blot or RT–qPCR before injection. If RASA2 silencing was not observed in CD19-CAR-T cells before injection (because of electroporation error), we excluded those conditions from analysis. Tumor burden was monitored using BLI over time and weight was assessed as were any signs of morbidity per our UCSF IACUC protocol guidelines. For all experiments, mice were randomized on the basis of the BLI signal from day 3 after Nalm6 injection to ensure equal tumor distribution in each group before T cells were transferred.

Local intramuscular administration of synthetic plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding monoclonal antibodies (mAb) offers an alternative to recombinant protein-based mAb delivery. In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a pDNA cocktail encoding AZD5396 and AZD8076, modified versions of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing mAb cocktail tixagevimab/cilgavimab in healthy adults. Participants received up to four intramuscular doses of pDNA encoding both DNA-based mAbs (DMAbs), administered using CELLECTRA electroporation. The primary endpoints were safety and pharmacokinetics. All 44 participants received at least one dose; DMAbs were detected in 100% of evaluable participants (n = 39), with serum concentrations reaching a peak of 1.61 µg ml−1. Sustained expression was observed in all participants during the 72 weeks of follow-up. The study product was well tolerated, with no product-related serious adverse events reported. Exploratory analyses demonstrated binding to multiple SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants and neutralizing activity in a standard pseudovirus assay. No antidrug antibodies were detected across approximately 1,000 serum samples using validated tiered assays. To our knowledge, these data represent the first-in-human proof-of-concept that synthetic pDNA DMAb technology permits the durable in vivo production of a functional mAb cocktail. This study further underscores the collective importance of synthetic design, formulation and delivery to achieve biologically relevant expression of gene-encoded biologics. DMAb delivery may represent a long-acting, scalable, cold-chain-independent platform against a wide range of diseases that can be targeted with mAbs and their derivatives. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05293249

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has driven the global scientific community to advance development of new medical countermeasures. Nucleic acid technologies, including notably mRNA vaccines, had an instrumental role in mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing COVID-19 disease morbidity and mortality1,2. Despite the notable achievements in vaccine development and distribution, a substantial portion of the population remains inadequately protected because of their inability to raise sufficient levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies in response to vaccination3. This gap in immunity underscores the need for additional prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for pandemics, which may also be useful as more generalized biological tools.

Infectious disease-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as promising medical countermeasures. Recombinant mAbs have demonstrated the ability to neutralize several strains of SARS-CoV-2, thereby offering a potential pathway to both treat4,5,6,7,8, and prevent COVID-199. Two mAb products received Emergency Use Authorization for the prevention of severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalization in persons who do not respond to vaccination indication: tixagevimab/cilgavimab (authorized from 8 December 2021 to 26 January 2023) and pemivibart (authorized 22 March 2024).

Despite their immense clinical value, the delivery of mAbs as recombinant proteins poses notable delivery hurdles, in addition to manufacturing, logistical and economic challenges. In some cases, intravenous administration can restrict the feasibility of large-scale implementation across broad patient populations. Recombinant mAb delivery also requires a continuous cold chain for stability, presenting further challenges for distribution to resource-limited settings, including low-income and middle-income countries. Optimizing additional strategies to extend the in vivo biological half-life of antibodies and further improve the duration of protection remains a key objective. Innovative solutions are being pursued to improve developmental timelines, delivery and durability of antibody-based interventions. Among these, the use of nucleic-acid-based platforms, such as mRNA, DNA and vectored immune prophylaxis, present new methods for the in vivo production of mAbs. If successful, these techniques could allow a single dose to maintain continuous production of the intended products, making subsequent doses unnecessary.

While in vivo gene-based production of mAbs has generated excitement, challenges have been exposed. These include a short duration of expression for an intravenously delivered mRNA-delivered chikungunya virus mAb10 and, for studies that achieved longer expression such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectored immunoprophylaxis, a high incidence (38%, 3 of 8 participants) of antidrug antibody (ADA) induction that prevented continued expression of the mAb transgene11.

In this study, we evaluated the use of synthetic DNA-based monoclonal antibody (DMAb) technology for the in vivo production of functional antibodies. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, optimized DMAb versions of AZD5396 and AZD8076 were developed based on the parental monoclonal antibody clones COV2-2130 and COV2-2196, which form the basis of the tixagevimab/cilgavimab cocktail. Preclinical studies in multiple animal models demonstrated robust expression and protective efficacy of this DMAb approach12,13. To translate these findings to humans, we conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation trial assessing the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of this DNA-delivered antibody platform in healthy adult participants. In this article, we present full data from the 72 weeks of follow-up, including assessments of in vivo DMAb expression, binding and neutralizing activity, and immunogenicity. These findings support the potential of DNA-based delivery as a long-acting, cold-chain-independent strategy for antibody-based interventions.

This phase 1, open-label, single-center, dose-escalation trial evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of DNA-encoded mAbs (primary endpoints), with exploratory analyses of antigen binding and virus neutralization, and a post hoc assessment of ADAs; further details on trial design are provided in Methods.

Synthetic DNA plasmids encoding the light and heavy chains (HCs) of AZD5396 and AZD8076 were co-delivered intramuscularly as two separate constructs (pAZD5396 and pAZD8076) for in vivo antibody production. Delivery was facilitated using the CELLECTRA 2000 device with side-port needle to apply localized electroporation (EP) after injection, enhancing muscle uptake and expression efficiency (Fig. 1a,b). The clinical study included eight dosing cohorts with varying injection frequencies, volumes and EP parameters. A schematic overview of the study design and participant flow is shown in Fig. 2; a detailed description is provided in Methods.

a, Four synthetic DNA constructs were designed for optimal in vivo expression of the HCs and light chains (LCs) of AZD5396 and AZD8076. Designs were based on the parental mAb clones COV2-2130 (2130) and COV2-2196 (2196), the precursors of AZD7442, respectively. pAZD5396 and pAZD8076 LC and HC synthetic DNA construct cocktails were each formulated with the human recombinant hyaluronidase enzyme. b, pAZD5396 and pAZD8076 were administered separately with in vivo EP for the local expression of the transgenes in the deltoid muscle. DMAbs are expressed in the myocytes and secreted into the circulation. c, CELLECTRA EP delivery system for enhanced local transgene expression. The EP electrical field parameters and injected fluid distribution have been optimized to align to permit enhanced transgene expression in the muscle (shown as green fluorescent protein reporter gene expression in New Zealand rabbit muscle). Expressed transgenes, such as DMAbs, can be measured in the serum of the recipient. Illustrations in a and b created using BioRender.com. CMV, cytomegalovirus.

a, CONSORT-style diagram showing the number of participants screened, enrolled, dosed and included in the safety and PK analyses across all cohorts. aOne participant in cohort B received only one dose and was analyzed as part of cohort A1. b, Diagram of the study design and cohort progression. The trial followed a sequential dose-escalation strategy beginning with two single-dose cohorts: cohort A1 (0.5 mg, single dose) and cohort A2 (1.0 mg, single dose). Subsequent cohorts received multiple doses: cohort B (0.5 mg × 2 doses), cohort C (1.0 mg × 2 doses), cohort D (0.25 mg × 2 doses), cohort E (2.0 mg × 2 doses) and cohort G (0.5 mg × 4 doses; total 2.0 mg). Cohort G assessed repeated multisite injection and cohort F alternative EP parameters (0.5 mg × 2 doses). Enrollment into each cohort was sequential and contingent on safety review of the preceding group. Figure created using BioRender.com.

Eligible participants were healthy adults aged 18–60 years with a body mass index (BMI) between 20 kg m−2 and 30 kg m−2, normal laboratory and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and no notable comorbidities or immunosuppressive conditions. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in Methods and protocol. Sixty-one healthy adults were screened and 44 participants were enrolled and received at least one dose of pAZD5396 and pAZD8076 across eight dosing cohorts (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1). EP was delivered using the CELLECTRA 2000 with OpBlock 0078 for all cohorts except cohort F, which used a modified pulse setting (OpBlock 0070) (Fig. 2a). Sixteen screen failures occurred because of timing (n = 5), BMI (n = 3), COVID-19 infection (n = 2), medical exclusions (n = 4) and other factors (n = 2). One individual withdrew consent during screening. Among enrolled participants, 61% (n = 27) were male and 39% (n = 17) were female. Most identified as White (84%, n = 37), with additional representation from African American (7%, n = 3), Asian (7%, n = 3) and Middle Eastern (2%, n = 1) ancestries. Baseline demographic characteristics are summarized in Fig. 3a.

a, Demographic characteristics of the 44 participants enrolled in the study, including age, sex (self-reported), race and ethnicity. b, Frequency and severity of elicited AEs considered related to the study product or administration procedure, reported within 7 days after administration. For each participant, only the most severe grade of each event type is shown. Events are grouped according to category (for example, local, systemic) and graded according to protocol-defined criteria (mild, moderate, severe).

Five participants withdrew early from the study and were replaced per protocol. Four participants discontinued after receiving the first EP dose on day 0; one participant withdrew at week 4 for personal reasons. These withdrawals occurred in cohorts D (one on day 0 and one at week 4), E (one on day 0) and F (two on day 0). One participant in cohort B received only the day 0 dose but agreed to complete the follow-up and was included in the cohort A1 analysis. All participants who received at least one dose were included in the safety analysis. However, the five early withdrawals were excluded from the PK analyses because of insufficient follow-up data. They were replaced as per protocol. The early discontinuations were attributed to discomfort associated with the EP procedure or personal choice and were not related to adverse events (AEs) caused by the study product (Fig. 2a).

As of the prespecified data cutoff (April 2025), 478 AEs were reported among the 44 participants who received at least one dose of the study product. These included 260 related and 218 unrelated events (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). AEs were categorized into two groups: elicited events, which were systematically collected during the 7 days after each administration, and unsolicited (non-elicited) AEs, which were monitored throughout the study duration.

The most frequently reported elicited events were injection site pain (evaluated using a visual analog scale) and erythema, both of which were transient and typically resolved within minutes of administration (Extended Data Fig. 7). These local reactions are consistent with expected responses to intramuscular injection and EP.

Elicited AEs were further categorized according to severity and body system (Fig. 3b), with comprehensive listings in Supplementary Tables 2, 3, 5 and 8. Detailed characterization is provided in Supplementary Tables 2 and 4, while Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 summarize the number of participants who experienced at least one local or systemic elicited reaction within 7 or 10 days after dosing.

Across all dosing levels, no dose-dependent trend in treatment-related AEs was observed. Most local reactions, including occasional scabbing, were mild and resolved without intervention. Importantly, systemic AEs typically associated with high serum antibody levels were not observed, aligning with the gradual in vivo expression and modest peak DMAb concentrations characteristic of this DNA-based delivery platform. Three serious AEs (SAEs) were reported: two episodes of recurrent pneumothorax in a single participant, one spontaneous miscarriage and a new diagnosis of melanoma in situ that was cured with surgery. All SAEs were assessed as unrelated to study product administration (Supplementary Table 9).

Serum concentrations of DMAbs AZD5396 and AZD8076 were measured using validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassays (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Longitudinal PK data were available through week 72 for participants in all cohorts. DMAbs produced in vivo were quantifiable in 100% (39 of 39) of evaluable participants (Fig. 4a–c and Extended Data Fig. 4 (cohort F)). Notably, AZD5396 and AZD8076 were coexpressed at similar levels in individuals, supporting the feasibility of simultaneous delivery of multiple plasmids using this platform (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2).

a–c, Sera collected at the indicated time points after DMAb administration were analyzed using a qualified quantitative binding assay to determine serum concentrations (ng ml−1) in individual participants who received a single dose of 0.5 mg or 1 mg on day 0 (indicated by the arrow) (a), two doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg on days 0 and 3 (indicated by the arrows) (b) and four doses of 0.5 mg on days 0, 3, 28 and 31 (c) (indicated by the arrows). d, The mean serum concentrations of dose groups/cohorts are shown. The values shown represent the sum of serum concentrations of the two antibodies. The error bars represent the s.e.m. e, Maximum DMAb serum concentration according to group. The bars represent the mean concentrations (±s.e.m.) for each dose group; the points indicate the Cmax values for individual participants. f, AUC through week 72 according to group. The bars represent the mean concentrations (±s.e.m.) for each dose group.

The study evaluated how pDNA dose, injection frequency and EP parameters influenced systemic DMAb levels. Escalating the pDNA dose from 0.25 mg (cohort D) to 0.5 mg (cohort B) per injection resulted in an 80% increase in average peak serum concentrations (Cmax), from 229 to 413 ng ml−1 (Extended Data Table 1). However, further increasing the dose to 2.0 mg (cohort E) did not raise the average Cmax, suggesting saturation at the injection site with current parameters. This trend was supported by the area under the curve (AUC) analysis, which showed comparable serum exposure across cohorts B, C and E, despite increasing doses (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Extended Data Table 2).

To evaluate injection frequency, an identical pDNA formulation (0.5 mg per injection) was administered across one-dose (cohort A1), two-dose (cohort B) and four-dose (cohort G) regimens (Fig. 2). Escalating from one to four injections yielded corresponding increases in average Cmax values, that is, 256 (range 14–379), 413 (range 186–622) and 1,030 (range 646–1,611) ng ml−1 (Fig. 4d,e), respectively, reflecting a more than 3.25-fold enhancement in peak DMAb levels (Extended Data Table 2). AUC analyses mirrored these results (Extended Data Fig. 3), supporting a dose-sparing strategy through multisite administration.

Finally, the impact of the EP pulse pattern was assessed by comparing cohort F, which received a truncated delay (0.2 s between pulses; OpBlock 0070), with cohort B, which used standard 1-s spacing (OpBlock 0078). Despite using the same plasmid dose and formulation, cohort F achieved similar average peak concentrations (287.9 ng ml−1; range 138–452), although with greater interparticipant variability (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 4) and worse tolerability, with two participants withdrawing from the study after day 0, which required replacement.

Across all evaluable cohorts, serum DMAb levels increased steadily, peaking around weeks 6–8 after administration. Expression remained stable and durable in all participants for 72 weeks of follow-up.

The functional activity of DMAbs expressed in vivo was assessed through binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domains (RBDs) and pseudovirus neutralization assays. All participants had preexisting anti-Spike antibodies because of prior infection or vaccination (Extended Data Table 3), necessitating use of an anti-YTE-specific antibody to detect AZD5396 and AZD8076 in the serum (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Using this anti-YTE capture, DMAbs were evaluated for RBD binding against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including ancestral (Wuhan), Delta, Omicron BA.2 and Omicron BA.4/BA.5.

Binding was detected in all 39 participants tested and was sustained through the final available time points, including up to week 72 for participants in cohorts A1–D and up to week 52 for those in cohorts E and F, and up to week 42 for cohort G (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). Binding levels correlated well with measured serum concentrations from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays (Supplementary Fig. 2b), supporting the long-term stability and biological activity of the DMAbs produced in vivo.

a–c, Anti-AZD5396 (left) and anti-AZD8076 (right) ADA measurements are shown for individual participants in the single-dose cohorts (A1/A2) (a), the two-dose cohorts (B–E) (b) and the four-dose cohort (G) (c). The dotted lines represent the assay minimum titer/limit of detection (LOD) of 40 and 80 for the anti-AZD5396 and anti-AZD8076 assays, respectively. aADA levels were only tested up to week 24, not 72 like in other cohorts.

Neutralization activity was tested using a pseudovirus assay targeting ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Spike. To isolate DMAb-specific activity, AZD5396 and AZD8076 were purified from serum using anti-YTE Dynabeads and quantified using both anti-YTE and anti-idiotype enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Neutralizing activity was detected in all 37 participants tested in cohorts A–G, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values comparable to those of the parental recombinant antibodies (Fig. 6 and Extended Data Fig. 6). Participants 6302-0014 and 6302-0039 could not be evaluated because of insufficient antibody levels for purification.

a–c, A DMAb-specific RBD binding assay (left) was developed, in which an anti-YTE antibody was used to capture DMAbs from participant sera followed by probing with biotinylated ancestral Spike RBDs. Graphs are plotted as the AUC × 1,000 for individual participants in each cohort; group means are shown in dark blue. To evaluate antiviral activity, DMAbs were purified from individual participant sera collected either before (day 0) or after (pooled from weeks 12–52) administration using anti-YTE-coated Dynabeads. Purified samples were run in the pseudovirus neutralization assay (right) either unconcentrated or concentrated to be in the range of the assay. The graphs depict the percentage (%) neutralization of individual samples at day 0 (black lines) and after DMAb delivery (colors) when tested at the indicated dilution. Group means are shown in dark blue. RBD binding activity (left) and pseudovirus neutralization (right) are shown for the single-dose cohorts (A1/A2) (a), the two-dose cohorts (B–E) (b) and the four-dose cohort (G) (c). d, Average IC50 (ng ml−1) of purified DMAbs from the indicated cohorts, calculated as the group geometric mean + 95% confidence interval (CI).

Together, these results demonstrate that DMAbs expressed in vivo retained high-affinity binding and neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants over time.

To evaluate potential host immune responses against DMAbs expressed in vivo, we used a validated ECL three-tiered ADA assay designed to detect antibodies targeting the Fab region of AZD1061 and AZD8895, and the parental mAbs of AZD5396 and AZD8076, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Approximately 1,000 serum samples were analyzed from participants who completed dosing.

No confirmed ADAs were detected in any participant. Four individuals (nos. 34, 36, 43 and 58) exhibited positive signals in the tier 1 screening assay for anti-AZD8895 or anti-AZD5396, including one (participant no. 34) with additional screening positivity for both targets. However, all samples tested negative in the tier 2 confirmatory assay and were considered false positives (Fig. 5).

These findings support the immunological tolerability of synthetic DNA-encoded DMAbs, even with multidose and multisite administration. Notably, previous studies of antibody gene delivery using viral vectors demonstrated host immune responses and ADA development that compromised antibody expression14,15,16. In contrast, the absence of ADA detection in this study suggests that the DNA platform may offer a more favorable immunological profile.

This study demonstrates the in vivo production of functional mAbs in humans using synthetic DNA delivered via EP. The optimized DNA constructs were formulated to support efficient coexpression of HCs and LCs, with adaptive delivery techniques enabling sustained in vivo expression. Formulation with human recombinant hyaluronidase facilitated diffusion through the extracellular matrix, while side-port needles and the CELLECTRA adaptive EP platform enabled precise, localized delivery. These delivery strategies, developed and validated in animal models, were designed to minimize inflammation and maximize intracellular DNA uptake and expression12,17,18.

In this phase 1 trial, we evaluated the safety, efficiency and durability of DMAb expression across eight dose-escalating cohorts. Participants received between one and four doses of plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding AZD5396 and AZD8076. Of the 39 participants who completed the trial, 38 exhibited detectable coexpression of both antibodies throughout the duration of 72 weeks of follow-up, while one expressed only a single mAb. Correct assembly of the antibodies requires nuclear localization, transcription, translation and posttranslational folding and processing through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Across 324 plasmid deliveries, successful antibody expression was confirmed in 322 cases, reflecting highly efficient in vivo protein assembly.

DMAb levels were durable and biologically relevant, ranging from hundreds of nanograms per milliliter to over 1 µg ml−1 in some individuals. Dose escalation revealed a saturation threshold; increasing pDNA from 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg notably raised expression, but increasing to 2.0 mg did not yield proportional gains. Interestingly, delivering the same total dose across four injection sites resulted in substantially greater expression than delivering it at one site, which is consistent with findings from AAV studies showing spatial limitations to delivery19.

The DMAbs maintained high-affinity binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants, including the Delta and Omicron sublineages, and demonstrated neutralizing activity in all 37 evaluable participants. This confirms that the antibodies were not only present but also functionally active. Importantly, no ADAs were detected in any of the 39 participants, including those who received multiple doses. This distinguishes the DMAb platform from traditional protein-based mAbs, which are associated with ADA development in 1–10% of cases for fully human products and up to 60% for chimeric or murine antibodies20.

Recent clinical studies demonstrated the potential of alternative gene delivery platforms for mAb expression. A phase 1 trial of mRNA-1944, which encodes a chikungunya virus-neutralizing antibody, showed dose-dependent expression after intravenous infusion at doses of 0.1, 0.3 or 0.6 mg kg−1. The antibody exhibited a half-life of approximately 69 days, with sustained expression lasting up to 16 weeks at the higher dose levels; however, transient increases in inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, complement and IP-10, were observed shortly after dosing and resolved within 48 h. Participants in the 0.6 mg kg−1 group received corticosteroids to mitigate these inflammatory responses10.

In parallel, two clinical trials evaluated AAV vectors for in vivo delivery of HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). In a 2019 study, an AAV1 vector encoding the anti-HIV bNAb PG9 was administered intramuscularly in dose-escalation cohorts. PG9 activity was detected in serum and muscle biopsies in some participants; however, immunogenicity limited the response, with ADA to PG9 and anti-AAV1 immune responses noted, particularly at higher doses21. A more recent trial assessed an AAV8 vector encoding the anti-HIV bNAb VRC07. Participants with elevated baseline anti-AAV8 antibody titers were excluded from enrollment. Expression levels of VRC07 exceeded 0.1 µg ml−1 in most participants and persisted for up to 150 weeks in one individual. Nonetheless, ADA against VRC07 was observed in three of eight participants, alongside the induction of anti-AAV8 antibodies in most individuals and rare but detectable anti-vector T cell responses11,14,15,16.

Our study has several limitations. This analysis was conducted in a demographically homogeneous cohort at a single center. Larger, more diverse studies are needed to evaluate the generalizability of these findings and to assess platform performance across varied genetic backgrounds, delivery parameters and clinical settings.

While the levels of mAbs achieved with DMAb administration were below those typically attained immediately after recombinant protein infusion, they remained within the therapeutic ranges reported for multiple biological indications. The observed concentrations persisted for 72 weeks after a single or repeated DNA administration. These findings are promising for long-acting prophylaxis and merit further optimization. Additional formulation development, dose scheduling and EP refinements may increase expression levels and support clinical efficacy.

Importantly, the DMAb levels observed in this study are comparable to those reported for other effective biologics. For example, human anti-chikungunya virus, respiratory syncytial virus and Zika-virus-neutralizing mAbs22,23 demonstrate functional potency in the low ng ml−1 range. Similarly, approved bispecific antibodies such as Columvi (Ctrough ≈ 590 ng ml−1)24 and Blincyto (Css ≈ 228–537 pg ml−1)25, which are approved treatments for B cell lymphomas, and Kimmtrak (Css ≈ 13 ng ml−1) for treatment of uveal melanoma26, are active at similar levels. Moreover, protein therapeutics like incretins (for example, GLP-1 analogs) exert biological effects at single-digit ng ml−1 concentrations27. These precedents support the clinical relevance of the DMAb concentrations achieved in this trial.

Despite its limitations, this study marks a notable advance in antibody gene delivery. We demonstrate that DNA-encoded mAbs can be reliably expressed in vivo with high fidelity, sustained levels and minimal immunogenicity. The consistency of in vivo expression from multivalent plasmid formulations, delivered intramuscularly using optimized EP, suggests robust uptake and transcription within postmitotic muscle fibers, which are long lived and capable of maintaining episomal DNA without dilution through cell division. This biological context, combined with the method's high take-up rate and codelivery efficiency, may explain the extended antibody expression observed.

This study demonstrates a transformative approach for delivering epigenetic elements without the intention of genetic modification, resulting in long-lived therapeutic potential and circumventing multiple major limitations that have constrained previous strategies. The platform's simplicity, scalability, cold chain independence and potential for cost-effective deployment offer major advantages for global access and equitable distribution. Future studies to expand delivery formats, optimize immune potency and validate protective efficacy in broader populations are warranted. These findings lay the groundwork for a versatile, synthetic, nonviral gene therapy strategy with applications in infectious disease, chronic conditions and beyond.

Synthetic DMAb technology was used to enable in vivo production of mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2. Optimized DMAb constructs were developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, encoding AZD5396 and AZD8076, which are based on the parental mAb clones COV2-2130 and COV2-2196, respectively—the precursors of AZD7442. Preclinical studies in mice, hamsters and nonhuman primates demonstrated robust in vivo expression and protective efficacy of this DMAb cocktail12,13.

Each DMAb was encoded by two synthetic plasmids (pAZD5396 and pAZD8076), encoding the HCs and LCs, respectively. The Fc regions of both antibodies were engineered with the YTE (M252Y/S254T/T256E) mutation to extend the in vivo half-life. Plasmids were administered intramuscularly and delivered using the CELLECTRA 2000 with side-port needle in vivo EP technology17,18. The EP system was configured to optimize electric field distribution at the injection site, thereby enhancing plasmid uptake and transgene expression in muscle tissue.

Participants were recruited through the University of Pennsylvania Clinical Trials Unit using IRB-approved advertisements, outreach to prior research volunteers and investigator referrals. As enrollment was voluntary, potential self-selection bias is acknowledged; however, this is unlikely to affect the internal validity of the study given its primary objectives of assessing safety and pharmacokinetics in healthy adults.

Initially designed as a five-cohort dose-escalation study, the protocol underwent multiple amendments in response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and IRB feedback, as well as emerging clinical and procedural data. The protocol was also temporarily amended to allow use of the ProFusion therapeutic needle after concerns about the original needle, which were subsequently resolved. Cohort D was revised to receive a reduced dose without methylprednisolone. As the study progressed, three additional cohorts (E, F and G) were added, expanding the total number to eight. Additional follow-up time points and flexibility in PK/ADA sampling were introduced to improve PK modeling. Based on the tolerability data, EP parameters were changed from OpBlock 0070 to OpBlock 0078 for all cohorts except cohort F.

Participants received intramuscular injections of synthetic DNA plasmids formulated with HYLENEX Recombinant to enhance tissue permeability and improve the efficiency of in vivo transfection, in line with earlier reports17,18. The study followed a single ascending dose design using a modified 3 + 3 schema across eight cohorts (A1–G), with plasmid doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 2 mg and injection volumes from 0.25 to 1 ml. HYLENEX doses ranged from 34 to 135 units, adjusted in proportion to the plasmid dose and volume. Some cohorts received a single injection on day 0, while others followed a more intensive schedule with additional doses on days 3, 28 and 31 (see Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 1 for cohort-specific details).

Sixty-one healthy adults were screened; of these, 44 participants received at least one dose of the investigational DNA plasmids pAZD5396 or pAZD8076. Sixteen individuals did not meet the eligibility criteria because of timing constraints (n = 5), BMI ineligibility (n = 3), active COVID-19 infection (n = 2), other medical exclusions (n = 4) or personal or external reasons (n = 2). One participant withdrew consent before completing screening (Fig. 2, top). Study oversight was provided by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

Sequential enrollment began with cohort A1, where the first participant in each new cohort was dosed and monitored for 14 days before dosing the remaining participants. This waiting period was waived for cohorts D, F and G, where doses were comparable to or lower than those previously tested. Because of the higher dose administered in cohort E, despite lower expression levels observed in earlier cohorts compared to protein-based mAbs, the 14-day observation period was reinstated. In all cohorts, subsequent participants were dosed 3 days apart. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in the first three participants of a cohort, the DSMB conducted an ad hoc review to determine whether to proceed. If deemed unsafe, the remaining participants would have not been enrolled, although the next cohort would not open until 28 days of safety monitoring had been completed. Any dose level with more than one DLT among six participants would have been considered not tolerated. No DLT was observed in the trial.

Each participant underwent a comprehensive baseline evaluation upon consent, including demographic and medical history, concomitant medication review and assessment of eligibility. EP was performed using the CELLECTRA 2000 device. All cohorts were treated using the OpBlock 0078 parameter set, except for cohort F, which used OpBlock 0070. Dosing strategy, plasmid formulation, HYLENEX concentration and the EP settings for each cohort are summarized in Fig. 2.

Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the investigational product (n = 44). Participants were monitored for AEs using the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials28, with laboratory abnormalities evaluated based on site-specific reference ranges. Until the reporting cutoff date, AEs have been documented, including the severity of all related and unrelated AEs (systemic and local) by body system, descriptions of those AEs, elicited local reactions for the first 7 and 10 days after dosing, and the number of individuals who experienced at least one elicited local or systemic reaction in the first 7 days after dosing.

Clinical safety evaluations included vital signs, physical examinations, 12-lead ECG, complete blood counts with differential, serum chemistries, HbA1c, coagulation parameters, serologies, creatine phosphokinase, urinalysis, pregnancy testing (when applicable), PK sampling, ADA assessments and a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b).

The primary safety evaluation focused on the occurrence, nature, timing, duration, intensity and relatedness of both injection site and systemic AEs elicited within 7 days of each administration. Events were categorized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. SAEs were collected throughout the study and characterized according to onset, outcome and relatedness to the investigational product. Injection site pain was assessed using a visual analog scale immediately, and at 5 and 10 min after injection/EP, after each dose.

Injection sites (deltoid or quadriceps) varied according to participant preference. Local and systemic elicited AEs were actively monitored for 7 days after each dose. Laboratory safety and PK assessments were conducted at screening, day 0 and day 7, and weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 52 and 72 after injection. Additional labs were obtained on days 3 and 10 in the two-dose cohorts, and on days 28 and 31 in the four-dose cohorts. All anti-AZD5396 (clone M5B4.2E9) and anti-AZD8076 (clone M16H5.1) AEs, including injection site reactions, were monitored through week 72.

If a predefined safety stopping criterion was met, the study would be paused for review by the DSMB and study team. This did not occur. All safety data were summarized descriptively, with particular attention to potential dose-related trends.

The following antibodies were used in binding ELISAs, pseudovirus neutralization assays and PK/ADA assays.

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (polyclonal) (1:8,000 dilution, cat. no. 2049-05, Southern Biotech).

HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000 dilution, cat. no. N100, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Anti-YTE monoclonal antibody (clone 23F7.1) used at 1–2 µg ml−1.

Anti-idiotype mABs anti-AZD5396 (clone M5B4.2E9) and anti-AZD8076 (clone M16H5), used at 1 µg ml−1.

Anti-YTE mAb (clone 23F7.1), anti-idiotype clone M5B4-2E9 and anti-idiotype clone M16H5.1 were provided by AstraZeneca and have been described previously13. All primary reagents were confirmed using ELISAs. The anti-YTE mAb demonstrated specific binding to YTE-containing AZD5396 and AZD8076 but not to control human IgG serum. Anti-idiotype clone M5B4-2E9 binds specifically to AZD5396; clone M16H5.1 binds specifically to AZD8076. For all ELISAs, recombinantly purified anti-AZD5396 and anti-AZD8076 antibodies were used as standards to confirm reagent specificity.

All antibodies were validated either by the manufacturer, in prior peer-reviewed publications, or in-house during assay development. Full validation details and supporting references are provided in Reporting Summary.

AZD5396 and AZD8076 were measured using separate ECL bridging immunoassays. For quantitation of AZD5396, 50 µl each of biotinylated anti-idiotypic antibody and SULFO-TAG (ruthenium)-labeled anti-YTE antibody (each at 1 µg ml−1) were mixed in a 96-well polypropylene plate with 50 µl of study serum samples pre-diluted 1:5 in MSD Diluent 100 (Meso Scale Discovery). Plates were incubated on a shaker at 600 rpm for 1 h. In parallel, MSD Streptavidin Gold plates were blocked with 200 µl per well of StartingBlock blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for at least 30 min, then washed three times with PBS-Tween 20. Then, 100 µl of the reaction mix was transferred to the streptavidin plate and incubated for 30 min at 600 rpm. After three washes with PBS-Tween 20, 150 µl of 2× MSD Read Buffer T was added, and the plate was read on an MSD Sector S600 Imager. AZD5396 concentrations were interpolated from a standard curve using recombinant AZD1061 protein (range 1.23–300 ng ml−1 in 20% pooled normal human serum).

The assay for AZD8076 followed the same procedure, except that biotinylated anti-YTE and SULFO-TAG-labeled anti-idiotypic antibodies for AZD8076 were used at 0.25 µg ml−1 each. The standard curve used recombinant AZD8895, which is identical in amino acid sequence to AZD8076 except for the YTE substitutions also present in AZD1061.

Study serum samples were assessed for the presence of ADAs using a validated three-tiered ECL assay (screening, confirmation and titer), previously validated by PPD for tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab (AZD1061), as described in ref. 29. AZD5396 and AZD8076 share identical Fab sequences with their parental mAbs AZD1061 and AZD8895, respectively. Unlike the Fc-silenced versions used in the original AZD7442 product, the DMAbs in this study retained their Fc effector function, bringing the expressed antibodies structurally and functionally closer to native human IgG1. Therefore, the validated ADA assay, which targets the Fab region, is appropriate for detecting immune responses against the expressed DMAbs. The Fc regions also include YTE mutations to extend the half-life, which have not been associated with notable ADA induction in prior clinical studies. For samples with signals below the cutoff points in screening or confirmatory assays, ADA titers were reported as less than 40 for AZD5396 and less than 80 for AZD8076, reflecting the minimum required serum dilution for the respective assays.

Preexisting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at study entry (day 0) were evaluated using an ELISA; 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 µg ml−1 SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins from ancestral (cat. no. 40592-V08H, Sino Biological), BA.4/5 (cat. no. 40592-V08H130, Sino Biological) and JN.1 (cat. no. 40592-V08H155, Sino Biological) strains. The following day, plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20, blocked with Blocker Casein in PBS (cat. no. 37528, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 90 min at room temperature, then incubated for 1 h with participant sera serially diluted fourfold in blocking buffer. After washing, HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:8,000 dilution) was added for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were developed with 1-step Turbo TMB (cat. no. 34022, Thermo Fisher Scientific), stopped with 2N H2SO4 and read at 450/570 nm using a BioTek Synergy Neo2 plate reader (Agilent Technologies). Endpoint titers were determined using the method by Frey et al.30 and analyzed using Excel and Prism v.10.2.1 (GraphPad Software).

Because all participants had preexisting anti-Spike RBD antibodies, a modified capture ELISA was performed to detect DMAbs produced in vivo; 96-well flat-bottom half-area plates (Corning) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 2 µg ml−1 anti-YTE mAb (clone 23F7.1). Plates were washed with PBS-Tween 20 and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk + 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sera were diluted 1:4 and serially in twofold steps in 1% newborn calf serum with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, and incubated on the coated plates for 2 h at room temperature. Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins representing wild-type (cat. no. 793906, BioLegend), Delta, BA.2 (cat. no. SPD-C82Eq, ACRO Biosystems) and BA.4/BA.5 (cat. no. SPD-C82EW, ACRO Biosystems) variants were used for detection. After incubation, plates were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000, cat. no. N100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) developed with Ultra TMB (cat. no. 34028, Thermo Fisher Scientific), quenched with 2N H2SO4 and read at 450/570 nm on a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader. Data were exported to Excel, analyzed using Prism v.10 and reported as AUC over time.

HEK 293T cells transformed with SV40 large T antigen (CRL-3216, ATCC) were used for producing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudovirus. Cells were maintained according to the supplier's recommendations in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All experiments involving cell lines were conducted under approved institutional biosafety protocols.

Pseudoviruses bearing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) were produced by cotransfecting HEK 293T cells with a 1:1 ratio of pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- plasmid (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and various Spike-expressing plasmids (GenScript) using GeneJammer (Agilent Technologies). After 48 h, the viral supernatants were collected and supplemented with FCS to a final concentration of 12%.

huCHOAce2 cells (cat. no. VCeL-Wyb019, Creative Biolabs) were plated at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates in D10 medium (DMEM + 10% FCS + penicillin-streptomycin), then incubated overnight. The next day, heat-inactivated serum or purified DMAb samples were serially diluted and incubated with pseudovirus for 90 min at room temperature before transfer to huCHOAce2 cells. Plates were incubated for 72 h, then lysed using britelite plus (cat. no. 6066769, Revvity); luminescence was read using a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader. Neutralization curves were fitted using Prism v.10 (nonlinear regression with Hill slope <0). Minimal infective dose (ID50) values were calculated as the reciprocal dilution yielding 50% neutralization. IC50 values were derived by dividing the serum DMAb titer by the ID50.

DMAbs were purified from serum using anti-YTE-coated Dynabeads (MyOne Tosylactivated, cat. no. 65501, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Day 0 or pooled week 24–52 sera were diluted 1:4 in PBS and incubated with anti-YTE Dynabeads overnight at 37 °C. Bead complexes were washed and eluted using Pierce IgG Elution Buffer (cat. no. 21004, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two elution fractions were collected. For cohorts A1, A2 and D, samples were concentrated using Amicon 30 kDa MWCO (Merck) filters. DMAb concentration was confirmed using ELISA with anti-YTE capture and secondary anti-idiotype mAbs (M54-2E9 for AZD5396, M16H5.1 for AZD8076). Plates were coated overnight with 1 µg ml−1 anti-YTE or 5 µg ml−1 anti-idiotype mAbs, washed, developed using the same protocol as RBD ELISAs and read on a BioTek Synergy Neo2 reader. Data were analyzed in Gen5 and graphed using Prism v.10.2.1.

This phase 1 study was not powered for hypothesis testing. Cohort sizes were determined based on prespecified DLT monitoring parameters, consistent with FDA guidance for first-in-human clinical trials. Participants were enrolled in cohorts of n = 3, 5 or 6 depending on dose level, with a target DLT threshold of 30% used to guide cohort expansion or modification.

In addition, smaller sample sizes in the extension phase of the study (cohorts E–G) were primarily determined by the available resources. The goal was to maximize the scientific information obtained, particularly regarding the impact of multisite administration and EP parameters, within the constraints of limited funding and manufacturing capacity. These exploratory cohorts were designed to generate informative PK and safety data to guide future development, rather than to formally test predefined hypotheses.

Statistical analyses were performed using descriptive methods. AEs were tabulated according to dose level, system organ class and preferred term, with frequencies, percentages and exact 90% Clopper–Pearson CIs calculated. Laboratory values, vital signs and other continuous measures were summarized using the mean, s.d., median and range, while PK endpoints, including detection rates and time to a 50% decline from peak concentration, were estimated with corresponding CIs. Disposition, including enrollment, dose administration, study completion and discontinuations, was also described. Interim analyses were conducted in response to emerging safety events; missing data were managed using participant replacement per investigator discretion. No formal power analysis was performed because the study focused on estimation rather than hypothesis testing. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA v.16 (StataCorp). Prism v.10.0 was used for data analysis and graph generation.

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 cause widespread dysregulation of mRNA splicing. Two recent studies have now revealed that loss of TDP-43 also affects mRNA 3′ end cleavage and polyadenylation, further influencing mRNA metabolism and protein expression.

OpenAI announced on Tuesday it's rolling out a new internet browser called Atlas that integrates directly with ChatGPT. Atlas includes features like a sidebar window people can use to ask ChatGPT questions about the web pages they visit. There's also an AI agent that can click around and complete tasks on a user's behalf.

“We think that AI represents a rare, once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during a livestream announcing Atlas. “Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then.”

Atlas debuts as Silicon Valley races to use generative AI to reshape how people experience the internet. Google has also announced a plethora of AI features for its popular Chrome browser, including a “sparkle” button that launches its Gemini chatbot. Chrome remains the most used browser worldwide.

OpenAI says the Atlas browser will be available starting today for ChatGPT users globally on macOS. Windows and mobile options are currently in the works. Atlas is free to use, though its agent features are reserved for subscribers to OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus or ChatGPT Pro plans.

OpenAI highlighted how Atlas can help users research vacations and other activities.

“We've made some major upgrades to search on ChatGPT when accessed via Atlas,” Ryan O'Rouke, OpenAI's lead designer for the browser, said during the livestream. If a user asks for movie reviews in the Atlas search bar, a chatbot-style answer will pop up first, rather than the more traditional collection of blue links users might expect when searching the web via Google.

Now, in addition to that result, users can switch to other tabs to see a collection of website links, images, videos, or news related to their queries. It's a bit of an inversion of the Google Chrome experience. Rather than the search result being a collection of links with AI features added on top of that, the AI chatbot is central in Atlas, with the list of website links or image results as secondary.

Another feature OpenAI highlighted in the livestream is Atlas' ability to collect “browser memories.” The capability is optional, and is an iteration of ChatGPT's existing memory tool that stores details about users based on their past interactions with the chatbot. The browser can recall what you searched for in the past and use that data when suggesting topics of interest and actions to take, like automating an online routine it detects or returning back to a website you previously visited that could be helpful for a current project.

In Atlas, users can highlight whatever they are writing and request assistance from ChatGPT.

Atlas has an optional memory feature that can recall what users searched for in the past.

Tech giants and smaller startups have been experimenting with baking AI into web browsers for the past several years. Microsoft was one of the first movers when it threw its AI tool, called Bing at the time, into its Edge browser as a sidebar. Since then, browser-focused companies like Opera and Brave have also continued to tinker with different AI integrations. Another notable entry in the AI browser wars is Perplexity's Comet, which launched this year and is also free to use.

While this is OpenAI's first foray into a stand-alone browser, it's not the first time the company has attempted to blend generative AI and web surfing. Earlier this year, OpenAI debuted an agent tool inside ChatGPT that is designed to be sent off to complete tasks for the user, like comparing multiple products and deciding which could be worth buying based on the person's preferences and lifestyle. When WIRED experimented with letting the bot click around on the web, attempt to complete research, and even play chess, the results were slow and sometimes inaccurate.

You may have heard about an upcoming fantasy MacBook Pro with a thinner chassis, an OLED display, and even a touchscreen. That may very well come some day, but today's not that day.

Instead, the latest MacBook Pro is very much the same we've had for the past four years, except with a new M5 chip inside. That's not a bad thing, given how this thing performs. All the unchanged elements still rank it among the best laptops you can buy, just don't expect anything too Earth-shattering in this otherwise modest upgrade.

In a year when performance is the only generational change, it was very smart for Apple to release the M5 MacBook Pro ahead of the other MacBooks. Rather than time it with the M5 Pro and M5 Max, the M5 MacBook Pro is coming out alongside the M5 iPad Pro and M5 Vision Pro. That means as of now, there's no M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro or M5 Max chips, or 16-inch MacBook Pro. These are probably not too far off, but the introduction of the M5 will tempt some people to buy this MacBook Pro instead one that is better suited for their needs.

Don't forget: historically, there's only around a two percent difference in performance between the Air and the Pro. Apple wants to talk up the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 as a powerful performer, and it is. But it's the display, port selection, and portability that distinguishes this MacBook Pro from the MacBook Air, none of which has changed in this generation.

With that disclaimer out of the way, I want to unabashedly say: The M5 is pretty amazing. It's built on the same 3-nanometer TSMC process as the M4 and M3, now in its third generation, and it continues the steady march of performance increases in place since the birth of Apple Silicon.

Benchmarks are just benchmarks, but as a laptop reviewer, I sat up in my chair when I saw the M5 hit 200 in single-core performance on Cinebench 2024. It's a first for any chip, and it's an area where Apple remains in a different league compared to the competition. Single-core performance is useful for bursty, frequency-sensitive tasks like opening applications, responsiveness in complex tasks, and in software like games. But 200 is just an abstract number. In context, it's an 11 percent increase over the M4, which is less of a generational increase than the M3 was over the M2. It's actually the smallest generational improvement to single-core performance since the M2 over the M1.

On the multi-core front, you're still getting a 10-core CPU, which matches the configuration of the M4 on the 14-inch MacBook Pro. So, if you want more multi-core performance, you'll need to wait for the M5 Pro or M5 Max. But for now, the M5 is seeing around a 17 percent improvement in multi-core performance too—and again, that's without increasing the core count. This is all good stuff, but I'm not sure that the average person will really notice the benefit in day-to-day performance.

You may notice the increase in fan noise though, which is one of the main differences between the M4 and the M4 Pro/Max, which use two fans instead of one. The M5 MacBook Pro remains great at not using the fan unless totally necessary, but when it does kick on, it's quite loud. I'm assuming it's around the same as the M4 MacBook Pro, but I didn't have it side by side to compare. The positive of that is the internal temperatures. I've seen CPU temperatures in MacBooks happily peak at 105 degrees Celsius when under full load. But I never measured anything over 89 degrees Celsius on this laptop, which is a great sign.

Storage performance is also an area of improvement Apple has highlighted, now using the latest PCIe Gen 5 standard to result in twice the SSD read and write speeds. Again, you have to compare apples to apples here, because the M4 Pro and Max models already had faster read/write speeds over the base M4. With average read speeds of around 6,500 MB/s and write speeds of 6,728 MB/s, the storage performance on the M5 is now actually slightly faster than the M4 Pro. You can now configure this to 4 terabytes, up from 2 terabytes on the previous M4 and M4 Pro models.

While the M5 happily keeps the CPU performance gains humming along, its larger strides are in graphics and AI. Regardless of what you think about the implementation of Apple Intelligence, there plenty of other things you can do with local AI processing, whether that's run on-device LLMs through apps like Draw Things or Misty Studio, both of which can leverage the AI hardware inside the M5 MacBook Pro. There are two primary changes to the M5 in terms of AI performance. One is the faster Neural Engine, which handles AI tasks that require speed or that run in the background, such as Apple Intelligence. According to my runs of Geekbench AI, the Neural Engine in the M5 is an average of 29 percent faster than the M4, and 40 percent faster than the M3.

The GPU cores also now include Neural Accelerators, a feature first seen in the A19 chip in the iPhone 17 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The idea here is to speed up heavier, one-time AI workloads, especially in apps that already rely heavily on GPU performance, such as in video editing software. This is not unlike the Tensor Cores you find in Nvidia graphics cores. The effect this has on speeding up workloads is tricky to quantify and make definitive claims around, but I did notice that the M5 outperforms the MacBook Pro M3 by 5 percent when I ran Geekbench AI on the GPU, despite the fact that the M3 Max is a more powerful GPU overall.

Speaking of the GPU, that's the other major area where the M5 shines. The GPU core count hasn't changed (you still get 10 cores), but Apple claims the M5 is 1.6 times faster than the M4 nonetheless. In my own testing, I found it to be close to on par with the same jump the M3 had over the M2, which was the first major overhaul of the graphics architecture in the base Apple Silicon lineup. Well, the M5 does it again. It's now nearly a match with the M3 Pro and is only three percent behind the M1 Ultra, as found in the original Mac Studio. That means the M3 Max, M4 Pro—and especially the M4 Max—are still much more powerful chips in terms of graphics. It's quite an achievement that the M5—which will inevitably show up in a $999 MacBook Air—is as powerful as the $2,000 M3 Pro MacBook Pro when it launched.

To put the GPU to the test, I had to try out Cyberpunk 2077, which came out earlier this year on Mac. You can, to my surprise, play the game at 1920 x 1200 without upscaling and get decent frame rates at the Medium or Low graphics settings. Averaging 39 frames per second on Medium or 51 fps on Low is decent, but in case you're wondering, there's still a massive gap between this and a discrete GPU—even a low-tier one. I recently tested the RTX 5050 in the Acer Nitro V 16, and it netted 53 percent faster frame rates in Cyberpunk 2077 in the same resolution. Admittedly, that's a much thicker laptop, but my point is that the base M5 does not make the MacBook Pro a true gaming machine. The M5 Pro and Max, however, may end up being a very different story, as the M4 Pro and M4 Max were already truly impressive on the GPU front.

I also tried out both Apple's own MetalFX and AMD's FSR 3.0 upscaling, which can boost the frame rates up to 70 fps on the Balanced setting, but I still found that I preferred the crisper native experience. You won't be using the new third-gen ray tracing engine much, at least not without over-relying on upscaling. But while I was at it, I also spun up Lies of P and Resident Evil: Village, and saw similar results. You might have to reduce settings, but you can play these games natively now at playable frame rates, which is a big step forward.

The other big takeaway is the fan noise. Although it's louder than other MacBooks as mentioned earlier, it's downright quiet compared to a proper gaming laptop. The fact that you can play a game as heavy as Cyberpunk 2077 at all without it sounding like a jet engine is notable on its own. The same is true for the surface temperatures of the keyboard and palm rests. Despite long sessions of benchmarking and gaming, the surfaces stayed relatively cool throughout, which makes for a much more pleasant gaming experience.

There's nothing new to say about the MacBook Pro's design or display, which despite having remained stagnant, are still among the best on the market. I do think the MacBook Pro is a bit thick for the type of laptop it is, but at 0.61 inches, it's still fairly portable. The chassis has been around since 2021 when the M1 MacBook Pro was released, so it feels old at this point. I'm perhaps most weary of the notch in the screen, which I've always disliked but feels more and more outdated with each passing year.

When it comes to the screen, I'm as excited about Apple's transition to OLED as much everyone else. It's been a year and a half since Apple released the tandem OLED iPad Pro, with its incredible brightness for HDR, and here we are, still with a four-year old display on these high-end MacBooks. However, I refuse to complain about a display this sharp, fast, colorful, accurate, and bright. With a resolution of 3024 x 1964 on the 14.2-inch screen, it has a pixel density of 254 pixels per inch, which is sharper than anything except 4K screens, which aren't particularly common on 14-inch laptops.

It does not feel like Apple is falling behind by continuing to use this screen, but with the glut of bright OLED laptops out there, you can't say that Apple has the de factor best laptop display. I do still love the nano-texture screen, though, which blocks reflections and glare without making the screen look washed out in a way no other solution does.

Another thing I'm glad that hasn't changed are the speakers and webcam. The six-speaker audio system is bassy, full, loud, and crystal clear. The only better speakers you'll find on a laptop are the ones on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The 1080p, 12-megapixel webcam isn't as much of a dead ringer as the speakers, but is still one of the better laptop webcams out there.

In terms of ports, it's all the same, meaning you still get three USB-C Thunderbolt ports, HDMI 2.1, a full-sized SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe 3 charger. Thunderbolt 5 was introduced last year, but it remains an exclusive feature of the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Slightly disappointing to see wireless connectivity not get upgraded, leaving Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 off the table, especially since many of the best routers you can buy this year have Wi-Fi 7 for faster speeds.

Those lack of features or other upgrades is notable. You certainly won't hate yourself for buying this machine, but as long as you can buy a similarly-specced M4 Pro MacBook Pro for the same price, the lack of anything else new in the M5 MacBook Pro makes it a harder sell. This is even the first time battery life has remained stagnant from the previous generation, with Apple still claiming 24 hours. From my own testing, the M5 MacBook Pro is aligned with the other MacBook Pros, giving me well over a full day of battery life with my work. The MacBook Pro still holds the crown, even if Intel and Qualcomm are far more serviceable competitors now than they used to be.

If you really need the extra performance for work, you're better off buying the M4 Pro/Max MacBook Pro or waiting it out for the M5 Pro/Max. On the other side of the spectrum, the current M4 MacBook Air is all the laptop most people will ever need. Unless you plan on gaming, I wouldn't even recommend needing to wait until the M5 MacBook Air comes out in the spring, especially if this M5 MacBook Pro is a sign of things to come.

For that reason, the M5 MacBook Pro is probably not the MacBook most people should buy. But that's a casualty of Apple's marketing strategy than this laptop or the M5 itself. I was really impressed by the GPU and AI performance improvements this time around, and the M5 is going to really flex in both the MacBook Air (for its incredible value) and the M4 Pro/Max (for its enhanced performance). This is for the dabblers and hobbyists, which I don't mean in pejorative sense. If you want to do some video editing, photography, or gaming on the side, and could really benefit from the enriched multimedia experience that the better screen, ports, and speakers provide, the M5 MacBook Pro is your go-to machine.

It can handle your work or school during the day, and whatever project you want to throw at it on weekends. On top of that, the display and speakers mean it's also a killer media machine for when you want to throw on a movie or play a game. These are the kinds of in-between, “prosumer” devices Apple has always staked its claim on, which is why this laptop has remained in the lineup, despite the feeling of redundancy it gives me next to the 15-inch MacBook Air. For the right person, though, the M5 MacBook Pro will really please you. As for me, I'm holding out for that OLED MacBook Pro.

Human semen not only accumulates genetic mutations with age; as the percentage of sperm carrying potentially serious mutations increases, so does the risk of developing diseases in offspring.

This is according to a new study by researchers at the Sanger Institute and King's College London. The team sequenced semen samples from individuals between the ages of 24 and 75, using very high-precision technologies, and found that the male germ line (the line of cells that produce sperm) is subject to a combination of mutation and positive selection.

The scientists used a duplex sequencing technique called NanoSeq, which can detect rare mutations with a very low margin of error. This allowed them to analyze 81 sperm samples from 57 donors. The results showed that a man's sperm adds an average of 1.67 new mutations every year.

But the most striking aspect of the study is not limited to the mere accumulation of mutations with age. The authors discovered that the male germ line is subject to positive selection. That is, certain mutations offer an advantage to cells that produce sperm and expand. They identified that many of these mutations are in genes related to developmental disorders or a predisposition to childhood cancer.

""We expected to find evidence that selection influences mutations in sperm,"" said Matthew Neville, coauthor of the study published this month in the journal Nature. ""What surprised us was how much the number of sperm carrying mutations associated with serious diseases increases.""

The researchers estimated that about 3 to 5 percent of sperm from middle-aged and older men carry some potentially pathogenic mutation in the exome (the coding part of the genome). That represents a higher risk than previous estimates. In more concrete numbers, the estimated fraction for men in their thirties was close to 2 percent, while it reached about 4.5 percent for men in their seventies.

From the evolutionary and clinical perspective, the implications are significant. Evolutionarily, it shows that the male germ line is not simply a ""machine"" that accumulates errors: There is a dynamic process of mutation and selection that can modify the genetic “quality” of the sperm with the age of the father.

On the clinical side, however, it raises questions about reproductive planning, genetic counseling, and the additional risks associated with an older father. The authors argue that although the percentages remain modest, the the accumulation is not only linear but also has a selection component that favors mutations with the potential to spread.

""It is often assumed that, because of its low mutation rate, the germ line is well protected,"" said Raheleh Rahbari, lead author of the study. “But in reality the male germ line is a dynamic environment where natural selection can favor harmful mutations, sometimes with consequences for the next generation.”

However, the authors caution that just because a mutation is present in sperm does not guarantee that it will indeed be inherited or cause disease. Many such mutations could prevent fertilization in the first place, cause embryonic loss, or not manifest clinically.

In short, this work is a reminder that the paternal ""genetic clock"" also counts, and in a more complex way than previously considered.

“Our findings reveal a hidden genetic risk that increases with paternal age,” said Matt Hurles, director of the Sanger Institute, in a statement. “Some changes in DNA not only survive but thrive within the testes, meaning that fathers who conceive later in life may unknowingly have a higher risk of passing on a harmful mutation to their children.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Melania Trump Used as ‘Window-Dressing' in Elaborate Memecoin Fraud, Legal Filing Claims","https://www.wired.com/story/melania-trump-used-as-window-dressing-in-elaborate-memecoin-fraud-legal-filing-claims/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 19:30:00 GMT","

A cryptocurrency promoted in January by US first lady Melania Trump was part of a sophisticated fraud that “leveraged celebrity association and ‘borrowed fame' to sell legitimacy to unsuspecting investors,” a new legal filing has alleged.

In April, crypto investors brought a federal class action lawsuit against Benjamin Chow, cofounder of crypto exchange Meteora, and Hayden Davis, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Kelsier Labs, among other defendants, accusing them of a multimillion-dollar fraud involving a single memecoin, $M3M3.

Later, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, expanding the allegations to include racketeering activity. They claimed the pair had colluded to rig the market for $LIBRA, a coin promoted by Javier Milei, president of Argentina, which collapsed in value shortly after launch.

On Tuesday, the plaintiffs sought the court's permission to file yet another amended complaint, based on alleged information provided by an anonymous whistleblower. With Chow acting as the “commander,” the pair launched, pumped, and dumped at least 15 crypto coins, the proposed second amended complaint alleges, including $MELANIA. The scheme allegedly inflicted millions of dollars in losses on unwitting investors.

Trump, who is not a named defendant in the lawsuit, was used as “window dressing for a crime engineered by Meteora and Kelsier,” the proposed second amended complaint alleges. The filing further states that the plaintiffs do not allege that Trump or Milei “operated the scheme.”

“This case could clarify basic expectations for token launches and disclosures in the US. We understand many across the crypto industry and regulatory community are following closely,” says Max Burwick, senior managing partner at Burwick Law, the law firm representing the plaintiffs.

The White House, Chow, and Davis did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

By the time Chow and Davis launched $MELANIA in January, they had refined a “repeatable six-step ‘playbook' for pump-and-dump fraud,” the investors claim.

According to the proposed second amended complaint, Meteora controls the technical infrastructure, while Kelsier supplies the necessary capital and orchestrates the promotional campaign, leaning heavily on credibility borrowed from public figures or brands. Together, the filing alleges, they effectively control a network of “sniper” crypto wallets that snatch up large quantities of the coins at artificially discounted prices, then dump them on the market as regular investors pile in.

“Going to try to tell all my buddies early,” Davis told an acquaintance prior to the $MELANIA launch, in a private exchange that features in redacted form as an exhibit in the lawsuit. “I'm about to launch the biggest token ever lol.” (It's unclear whether Davis was allegedly referring to $MELANIA or $LIBRA.)

Before launch, Davis prepared a carefully coordinated marketing campaign for $MELANIA, recruiting a network of paid crypto influencers to synchronously flood social media platforms with promotional messaging, the proposed second amended complaint alleges. The filing claims the influencers pitched the coin as “fair launch” and “community-led.”

In the hours after public trading began, as hype set in and investors rushed to purchase $MELANIA, the price of the coin increased twelve-fold. The coin had a paper value of $1.6 billion at its height. It has since lost 95 percent of its peak value.

“Investors reasonably interpreted the use of Melania Trump's name and likeness as evidence of legitimacy and due diligence—trusting that no one of her stature would knowingly associate with a fraudulent venture,” the proposed second amended complaint claims.

But prior to launch, wallets controlled by Meteora and Kelsier had allegedly accumulated almost a third of the entire $MELANIA supply. “Insiders had already cornered the market before a single public buyer could act,” the proposed filing claims.

As the $MELANIA price climbed, the insider wallets began to sell, earning millions of dollars within hours of launch, according to the proposed second amended complaint. The large sales caused the price to collapse, inflicting steep losses on the regular people who had bought in.

Though the complaint does not allege any wrongdoing on the part of Trump, her family has been criticized heavily for its many and various forays into the crypto industry, which critics have cast as a glaring conflict of interest. The Financial Times recently estimated that the Trump family had earned more than $1 billion from its crypto pursuits in the period since Donald Trump was reelected as US president.

“The misuse of Melania Trump's name magnified the harm,” the proposed second amended complaint alleges. “It corrupted public trust and injected an element of political and cultural credibility into what was, in reality, a standard pump-and-dump.”

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total 2025 compensation rose nearly 22% from $79.1 million to almost $96.5 million, due mostly to the company's booming share price boosting the value of his stock awards.

The numbers were disclosed Tuesday afternoon in the company's annual proxy statement, along with details on Microsoft board changes, shareholder proposals raising concerns about AI risks, and a request from the board for shareholders to approve a new stock plan.

Microsoft's board nominated Walmart CFO John David Rainey as a new board member, to replace Carlos Rodriguez, current chair of the compensation committee, who is not seeking re-election.

The company's 2025 fiscal year ended June 30. In evaluating Nadella's performance, the board cited his work leading the expansion of the company's AI infrastructure, Microsoft Copilot adoption and new security initiatives. 

Much of Nadella's total compensation — about $84.2 million — is based on the performance of the company's stock, which has risen more than 23% in the past year, at one point pushing Microsoft's total market value briefly past $4 trillion. 

His cash incentive bonus was $9.56 million, up from the $5.2 million paid in 2024, after he requested a reduction. The proxy statement said the increase reflected strong financial results (117% of target) and a high operational assessment (151.67% of target).

For the first time, security was used as one measuring stick for Microsoft executive compensation, part of an effort by the company to appease regulators and lawmakers after a series of high-profile breaches. In its review, the board focused on Nadella's role in attempting to address these issues through the implementation of its Secure Future Initiative. 

In addition, Microsoft's board is asking shareholders to approve a 2026 Stock Plan to replace the expiring 2017 plan, requesting authorization for up to 226 million new shares that it says is needed to continue granting equity awards for attracting and retaining talent.

Nadella recently appointed veteran executive Judson Althoff as CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, a move designed to free Nadella to focus more intensely on long-term AI strategy and technology.

Microsoft's annual meeting, held virtually, is slated for 8:30 a.m. Dec. 5.

A new Seattle startup is betting that artificial intelligence can take marketing off the plate of small business owners.

Omada.ai, founded earlier this year by longtime tech entrepreneur Pete Christothoulou, officially launched Tuesday with what it describes as an “AI marketing team” designed to handle the day-to-day digital marketing tasks for small and midsize business owners.

Backed by Crosslink Capital, HubSpot Ventures, and Seattle-based firm Ascend, the startup says its platform can plan, create, and optimize marketing campaigns automatically for less than $9 per day.

Instead of developing a single marketing “copilot” or dashboard, Omada's approach is a set of coordinated AI agents — a marketing assistant, social media manager, designer, video producer, and more — that collaborate like a virtual team. Users interact through a simple chat interface, and the system handles tasks such as posting content, running ads, responding to customers, and tracking performance.

“Their agent-based architecture delivers a truly autonomous and proactive system that gives small business owners the access to capabilities and marketing expertise they've never had access to before,” Adam Coccari, managing director at HubSpot Ventures, said in a statement.

Omada's pitch is that it acts less like another app and more like a full-service team — a “do-it-for-me” model rather than “do-it-yourself.” Its agents are built on proprietary infrastructure that coordinates specialized AI models for language, vision, and audio tasks. The company says the system learns each business's tone and goals over time, continuously optimizing campaigns.

Omada enters an increasingly competitive space. A growing number of startups use generative AI to help businesses create content and automate tasks — including Seattle-area companies Gradial, Adora, and Forum3. Larger companies such as HubSpot, Canva, and Adobe have also embedded AI marketing tools into their small business offerings.

Christothoulou co-founded Omada with Siva Muthukumarasamy, a longtime engineering leader who was CTO at Peel Technologies, as well as Andrew Miller, a veteran marketing exec who worked at Xembly as head of user acquisition.

Omada marks Christothoulou's latest foray into applying automation and data intelligence to the marketing world. He previously co-founded and ran Marchex, a Seattle-based advertising analytics company that went public in 2004 and helped pioneer digital call tracking for marketers.

Christothoulou served as CEO at Marchex until 2016 and later launched Xembly, a Seattle startup that developed an “AI chief of staff” to automate productivity tasks. The company shut down its consumer service last year.

Data resiliance company Veeam wants to give its customers more control and security over their data in the age of AI.

The Kirkland, Washington-based company announced on Tuesday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Securiti AI, a company that gives enterprises a command center for all of their data. The $1.725 billion deal is a mix of cash and stock and is expected to close the first week of December, as first reported by Bloomberg.

Securiti was founded in 2019 by Rehan Jalil. The company raised more than $156 million in venture capital from investors, including Mayfield, General Catalyst, and Cisco Investments, among others.

Upon the close of the transaction, the Insight Partners-owned Veeam will offer Securiti's data command center product alongside its existing offerings. Jalil will join Veeam as the president of security and AI.

“We've entered a new era for data. It's no longer about just protecting data from cyber threats and unforeseen disasters; it's also about identifying all your data, ensuring it's governed and trusted to power AI transparently,” Anand Eswaran, Veeam CEO, said in a company press release.

Veeam closed a $2 billion secondary sale in December 2024 that valued the company at $15 billion. At the time, Eswaran said that one of the company's plans for 2025 was to find acquisition targets that were complementary to the company's data resilience business.

This acquisition news comes amid a year of consolidation in the data industry as data companies are getting bought to help companies improve their data stack to help their clients adopt AI.

In May, Databricks acquired Neon for $1 billion. Salesforce acquired legacy cloud data management platform Informatica a few weeks later for $8 billion.

While these transactions have become less frequent now than they were in the first half of the year, they seem likely to continue. In June, Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst who now runs SanjMo, a data trend advisory firm, told TechCrunch that there would be a lot of consolidation this year.

He said that customers have long been tired of having to use a laundry list of different data companies to build their data infrastructure stack. The fact that enterprises want to adopt AI has made this data fragmentation more apparent.

Mohan added that any good data startup that's not getting acquired in this environment is likely just too expensive.

Codi, an Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup founded by Christelle Rohaut and Dave Schuman, is launching what it hails as the first AI-powered platform to fully automate office management.  

Codi was founded in 2018, in a pre-pandemic world, with a mission to help companies find flexible office spaces. It was more of a marketplace, as TechCrunch previously reported, that matched companies to buildings that offered flexible office arrangements. Codi then assisted with the move-in processes.

Rohaut, the company's CEO, said she and her team back then used to manually manage office spaces and vendors for their clients, but the recent advancements in AI have allowed them to essentially automate themselves. 

“The previous model of Codi, you had to get the space with Codi. Now, whatever office you lease, you can use this to automate your office logistics,” she said of her new AI SaaS product.

The startup released its beta version of the new AI office management product in May and officially launched it on Tuesday. The company last raised a $16 million Series A in 2022 led by a16z, and has raised $23 million to date.

The technology comes as return-to-office continues to take hold throughout corporate America. “Office management remains very manual and broken,” Rohaut, the company's CEO, told TechCrunch. She added that it can cost companies at least $80,000 a year just in administrative costs to run an office.  

The role of an office manager has also changed throughout the years. In this post-pandemic world, as companies moved toward remote and hybrid work, the formal job of office manager has often been left unfilled. When companies do have an office manager, they are often spending more time on planning events rather than the logistics of the office, she said. 

Rohaut said she and the team trained the Codi AI on all the expertise and data they've accumulated over the past few years. The vendors a company uses are put into the AI system, and then the AI coordinates for office needs such as pantry restocking and cleaning. The company said it took only five weeks for it to reach $100,000 in ARR after it released its beta.  

“This new platform is estimated to save hundreds of hours a year in admin tasks,” she said. Codi takes a management fee per month, like a subscription, which is “a fraction of the cost of an office manager or part-time office manager or even a fractional EA,” Rohaut continued.  

Rohaut said “a good portion” of their clients, from whom they managed office spaces, are transitioning to using the AI platform. Just in the beta, the new Codi product has already signed 40 new companies, like TaskRabbit and Northbeam, Rohaut said.  

Rohaut sees Codi's competitors as being legacy management companies and workplace experience platforms, like Envoy. She said, unlike legacy management companies, Codi replaces the need for staff members to review, hire, and coordinate with each vendor because the execution is autonomous and the platform integrates a curated network of serviced providers, Rohaut said.

Also, compared to workplace platforms, Codi helps coordinate the handling of physical operations in an office, she continued. 

“Codi is building the future where offices can run themselves, just like cars can drive themselves,” she continued. “We want to entirely remove the logistical burden of managing physical spaces and free human talent to focus on the workplace culture and growth.” 

This piece was updated to reflect the proper spelling of Rohaut‘s name.

OpenAI announced Tuesday the launch of its AI-powered browser, ChatGPT Atlas, a major step in the company's quest to unseat Google as the main way people find information online.

The company says Atlas will first roll out on macOS, with support for Windows, iOS, and Android coming soon. OpenAI says the product will be available to all free users at launch.

Browsers have quickly become the AI industry's next battleground. While Google Chrome has long dominated the space, there's a sense that AI chatbots and agents are fundamentally changing how people get work done online. A handful of startups have tried to capture this by launching AI-powered browsers of their own, such as Perplexity's Comet and The Browser Company's Dia. Google and Microsoft have also tried to update Chrome and Edge, respectively, with AI-powered features to make their legacy products stand out.

OpenAI's Engineering Lead for Atlas, Ben Goodger, said in a livestream Tuesday that ChatGPT is core to the company's first browser. Users in ChatGPT Atlas can chat with their search results, much like in Perplexity or in Google's AI Mode.

The killer feature for other AI-powered browsers has been the built-in chatbot that sits in a side panel and automatically has context for whatever's on your screen. It may sound minor, but many users spend all day copying and pasting text or dragging files and links into ChatGPT, just to provide context. The sidecar feature removes that friction and makes for a smoother user experience.

OpenAI's Product Lead, Adam Fry, said during the livestream that ChatGPT Atlas will have the sidecar feature, too. Further, ChatGPT Atlas has “browser history,” meaning that ChatGPT can now log the websites you visit and what you do on them, and use that information to make its answers more personalized.

AI-powered browsers also commonly feature an AI agent that aims to automate web-based tasks on behalf of users. In TechCrunch's testing, we've found the early versions of web-browsing AI agents leave something to be desired. While Perplexity's Comet and OpenAI's ChatGPT agent work well for simple tasks, they struggle to reliably automate the more cumbersome problems users might want to offload to an AI system.

Sure enough, OpenAI's browser has a web-browsing agent too. By using “agent mode,” users can ask ChatGPT to complete small tasks in the browser on their behalf. The company says agent mode is only available to ChatGPT users on the Plus, Pro, and Business tier at launch.

In an interview at OpenAI's DevDay conference, Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley told TechCrunch that he's inspired by the way browsers have redefined what an operating system can look like. Turley noted that browsers have revolutionized the way people get work done online, and he thinks ChatGPT is a similar phenomenon.

Whether OpenAI's browser can put a dent in Google Chrome, which has more than 3 billion users around the globe, remains to be seen. AI browsers are quite buzzy in Silicon Valley today, but their impact in the broader world is limited.

Google announced on Tuesday that Google Fi, its telecommunications service, is getting several new updates, including AI noise filters and RCS web messaging.

The tech giant says calls will now use AI-enhanced audio to reduce background noise and improve voice clarity, even when speaking to someone on a landline or older device. The company says the update should allow for “more natural-sounding conversations.” 

While the feature will be turned on automatically, users will have the option to turn it off. AI-enhanced audio is rolling out next month.

As for the RCS web messaging, Google is updating its “Messages for web” integration with a new interface that includes full RCS support for sharing hi-res photos and videos in message threads. The update will roll out in December.

Additionally, Google Fi is expanding the availability of its Wi-Fi Auto Connect+ feature, which puts users on premium Wi-Fi so their connection is more reliable in crowded places like airports or malls.

“We're expanding availability of this feature to millions of locations, including supported major airports like LAX, ORD, and JFK, and participating shopping malls and stores,” wrote Jane Harnett, Senior Product Manager, Google Fi Wireless, in the blog post. “It works automatically, and it's available at no extra cost. Plus, we're the only major carrier to automatically secure your online activity with an encrypted connection when you're on premium Wi-Fi.”

The company says users will know they're connected via Wi-Fi Auto Connect+ when they see the W+ icon in their status bar.

Google also announced that the Google Fi app is introducing personalized AI-powered summaries that explain charges, monthly changes, and how plan adjustments could affect future costs.

As part of Tuesday's announcement, Google Fi is launching a limited-time promotion for new Google Fi subscribers that offers 50% off for 15 months when they bring a phone and join the service's “Unlimited Essentials” or “Unlimited Plan.”

Some startups pride themselves on having prestigious financial backers — but just as important is having prestigious customers.

It's one of the main points of pride for Serval, an enterprise AI company that announced a $47 million Series A round on Tuesday. The round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with participation from heavy-hitting venture firms like First Round, General Catalyst, and Box Group. But even more impressive than the funders is the company's list of clients, which include major AI players like Perplexity, Mercor, and Together AI.

In broad strokes, Serval is using agentic AI models to automate IT service management, but the company has a unique approach that takes advantage of agentic AI's powers while avoiding many of its pitfalls. One agent is used to code internal automations for everyday tasks, like authorizing software or provisioning a device. The founders see it as a kind of vibe-coding tool, overseen by an IT manager, but doing most of the work on its own. A separate help desk agent responds to user requests by calling those tools on command, following rules established by the tool.

Serval CEO Jake Stauch says the key was to make the process of building a tool as simple as possible. 

“We don't want them to feel the marginal cost of building these automations,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “We want to make it easier to automate something forever than do it manually once.”

Splitting the task into two agents — one to build tools and one to use them — also gives managers a way to keep an eye on permissions. When an automation is created, the manager will set rules for when it can be used, which provides an extra line of defense against overeager help desk agents.

Enterprise clients are keenly aware of the risks of a rogue AI system, which is part of why Serval decided against a single all-purpose Help Desk Agent. 

“You don't want someone to go into Slack and say, ‘Hey, I want to delete all the data at the company,' and the very helpful AI agent responds, ‘Great, I'll delete all the data,” Stauch told TechCrunch. “Instead it will say, ‘Hey, I don't have a tool for deleting all the data the company. But I do have a tool for resetting your password or doing one of these other tasks.'”

Because the tools themselves are deterministic, they can include extremely complex permissions, like only allowing certain actions after a certain multi-factor authentication process or within a certain time frame. And any time those rules need to be changed, there's an AI agent at the ready to dive into the codebase and change it.

It's a new approach to the very common problem of how to oversee agentic AI systems. “You want to have full visibility and control into what that AI agent is doing,” says Stauch. “And you do that by using Serval to build those tools and customize the permissions and approvals behind them.”

YouTube revealed on Tuesday that its likeness-detection technology has officially rolled out to eligible creators in the YouTube Partner Program, following a pilot phase. The technology allows creators to request the removal of AI-generated content that uses their likeness.

This is the first wave of the rollout, a YouTube spokesperson informed TechCrunch, adding that eligible creators received emails this morning.

YouTube's detection technology identifies and manages AI-generated content featuring the likeness of creators, such as their face and voice. 

The technology is designed to prevent people from having their likeness misused, whether for endorsing products and services they have not agreed to support or for spreading misinformation. There have been plenty of examples of AI likeness misuse in recent years, such as the company Elecrow using an AI clone of YouTuber Jeff Geerling's voice to promote its products.

On its Creator Insider channel, the company provided instructions on how creators can use the technology. To begin the onboarding process, creators need to go to the “Likeness” tab, consent to data processing, and use their smartphone to scan a QR code displayed on the screen, which will direct them to a web page for identity verification. This process requires a photo ID and a brief selfie video.

Once YouTube grants access to use the tool, creators can view all detected videos and submit a removal request according to YouTube's privacy guidelines, or they can make a copyright request. There is also an option to archive the video.

Creators can opt out of using the technology at any time, and YouTube will stop scanning for videos 24 hours after they do so.

Likeness-detection technology has been in pilot mode since earlier this year. YouTube first announced last year that it had partnered with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to help celebrities, athletes, and creators identify content on the platform that uses their AI-generated likeness.

In April, YouTube expressed its backing for the legislation referred to as the NO FAKES Act, which seeks to address the issue of AI-generated replicas that imitate a person's image or voice to deceive others and generate harmful content.

I've had good luck with indirection tables used during lookup inside of the kernels consuming/producing the kvcache data - it's essentially user-mode remapping like they do here: you can publish a buffer offset table and threads are uniform, have coalesced reads to the table, and cache the offsets no problem. You have the same memory locality issues as VM (contiguous virtual but potentially random physical) but are not limited to device page sizes and since you can update while work is in-flight you can be much more aggressive about reuse and offload (enqueue DMA to cold storage to evict from VRAM, enqueue DMA to copy from cold memory into reused VRAM, enqueue offset table update, enqueue work using them, repeat - all without host synchronization). You can also defrag in-flight if you do want to try to restore the physical locality. It's nothing crazy and fairly normal in CPU land (or even classic virtual texturing), but in ML GPU land I could write a big paper on it and call it SuperDuperFancyAttention4 and publish press releases...

The nation's second-largest employer is reportedly hoping robots will take your job—or, what could have potentially been your job, at least. 

After years of hiring thousands of warehouse employees and delivery drivers to build a roughly 1.2 million U.S. workforce, second only to Walmart, Amazon is reportedly shifting gears.

The New York Times reported today, citing interviews and internal documents, that Amazon's automation team expects that by 2027, the company could avoid hiring more than 160,000 U.S. workers it would normally need. If true, that would save the company about 30 cents on every item it packs and delivers.

On top of that, executives also told Amazon's board last year that robotic automation could potentially keep the company's U.S. headcount steady even as sales are expected to double by 2033. According to the Times, that could mean Amazon won't need to hire more than 600,000 new workers.

Overall, Amazon's robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75 percent of the company's operations, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.

The report comes as anxiety continues to grow about the impact automation and AI could have on jobs. The Times points out that Amazon is a major influence in the e-commerce space and wherever it goes, other players like Walmart and UPS, the first and third largest U.S. employers, are likely to follow.

The company is also reportedly preparing for potential fallout from its plans. According to documents viewed by The New York Times, Amazon has considered working on its image by taking part in community events such as parades and toy drives. It also contemplated avoiding terms like automation and AI, and instead using phrases like “advanced technology” and “cobot.”

Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, told Gizmodo in an emailed statement that the leaked documents paint an incomplete picture of the company's plans, given that thousands of documents circulate throughout the company at any given time, each with varying degrees of accuracy.

“In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines – now or moving forward,” Nantel wrote.

She noted that the company plans to hire 250,000 people for the upcoming holiday season.

Amazon also told The New York Times that it's not asking employees to avoid certain terms, and that its involvement in community events is not tied to its automation plans.

Additionally, Amazon's head of worldwide operations, Udit Madan, told the Times that the company has a track record of reinvesting savings from automation into new roles, pointing to its recent effort to open more delivery hubs in rural areas.

Still, some level of automation is already taking place in Amazon facilities, and it's likely to spread. Amazon already has a million robots working around the globe, according to the Times.

For example, Amazon opened its most advanced warehouse in Shreveport, Louisiana, last year as a template for future robotic fulfillment centers. The New York Times reported that documents show Amazon uses about a thousand robots in the facility, allowing it to employ roughly 25% fewer workers than it would have without automation.

Amazon plans to copy the Shreveport design in about 40 facilities by the end of 2027, starting with a facility that opened in Virginia Beach this April. When the facility was announced in 2023, Governor Glenn Youngkin said that the robotics fulfillment center and delivery station would bring about 1,000 full-time jobs to the area.

iOS 26 might be out in full, but that doesn't mean we're off the Liquid Glass roller coaster quite yet. In case you haven't been paying close attention, people have had some strong thoughts about Apple's redesign in iOS 26, dubbed Liquid Ass—I mean—Liquid Glass. Those thoughts haven't exactly all been positive. As fun and interesting as Liquid Glass can be at times, it's also often illegible and annoying with its lack of contrast and emphasis on “glassmorphic” design.

Apple has shown a decent amount of conviction in sticking with its choice, despite its very vocal detractors. So far, it's stopped short of letting you toggle the whole thing off… a level of conviction that's lasted until *checks watch* pretty much right now. In the latest iOS 26.1 beta 4 for developers, Apple seems to be toying with the idea of letting you turn off Liquid Glass completely with a “tinted” mode. Here's a side-by-side of what Apple is testing:

Notification Center with Liquid Glass Clear vs Tinted in iOS 26.1 Beta 4. pic.twitter.com/9rO1JbO5LW

— Beta Profiles (@BetaProfiles) October 20, 2025



This isn't the first time Apple has tinkered with the glassiness of iOS 26. In prior betas leading up to the release of iOS 26, Apple scaled back on transparent elements in software, seemingly in response to criticism over accessibility. However drastic those adjustments were, they pale in comparison to the new tinted mode, which looks an awful lot like iOS 18. Whether this is a win or not is dependent on your taste, but if there's one obvious loser here, it's Apple.

With Liquid Glass, Apple was clearly driving toward a uniform look across all of its platforms, bringing iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS together under a unified number (26) and a fresh, cohesive look that says, “This is a new Apple that tries things.” But the thing about trying things is that sometimes those things work, and sometimes they really, really don't. If this latest beta is any indication, Apple is learning that the hard way.

Let me be clear: this is still a beta, so anything could happen between now and the release of iOS 26.1. That means you can't go celebrating or decrying the death of Liquid Glass officially yet. That being said, the fact that Apple is even toying with the idea says a lot. On a personal level, I'm conflicted. I've been using iOS 26 for a couple of weeks now, and while there are certain elements that I find entertaining (subtle animations on the lock screen and yes, even some of the bounciness), it does feel like a drag when menus get lost in the text on a web page or when you discover that Safari tabs have been inexplicably hidden behind another tap.

I can't say what was happening behind the scenes, but there are aspects of iOS 26 (glassy ones and non-glassy ones) that feel half-baked and rushed, which isn't what most have come to expect from Apple. Frankly, more than anything, I find that lack of polish a bummer. I want to live in a world where Apple actually tries things successfully, not one where it whiffs hard enough to backtrack on what was supposed to be the dawning of a new era. The good news is, Apple has plenty of road ahead to keep trying new things—that'll depend on what lesson it takes from the Liquid Glass experiment, though, and so far, the lesson seems to be, “Oh God, can we start over?”

Yesterday morning, France's Minister of Culture Rachida Dati posted an announcement on social media that could have been straight out of a heist movie—“A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum.”

The minister confirmed that there were no injuries and that investigations are underway. While you'd think that the world's most visited museum would have better security 100 years after the death of Vincenzo Peruggia, the infamous Mona Lisa thief, the thieves are currently still on the loose along with “eight objects of inestimable heritage value,” according to a statement by the Ministry of Culture. Here's what they are.

A diadem (a crown-like ornament), a necklace, and a single earring from a sapphire jewelry set belonging to Queen Hortense and then Queen Marie-Amélie. The set dates to the first third of the 19th century. The diadem includes 24 sapphires and 1,083 diamonds; the necklace includes eight sapphires and 631 diamonds; the earring includes two sapphires and 59 diamonds.

Hortense was Napoleon Bonaparte's adoptive daughter and his wife Josephine's natural daughter. She was briefly queen of Holland starting in 1806. Marie Amélie of Naples married Louis Philippe, the future king of France, in 1809.

Next in the list of stolen objects are an emerald necklace and a pair of emerald earrings, both of which also seem to be a part of the same set that Napoleon gifted Empress Marie-Louise in 1810. The necklace features 32 emeralds and 1,138 diamonds, while the earrings comprise six emeralds and a total of 108 diamonds. Marie-Louise was Napoleon's second wife and the great-niece of Queen Marie Antoinette.

The thieves also got away with two brooches dating to 1855 and a diadem dating to 1853, all belonging to Empress Eugénie. The “reliquary” brooch includes 94 diamonds, the bow-shaped brooch includes 2,438 diamonds and 196 rose-cut diamonds, and the diadem includes 212 pearls, 1,998 diamonds, and 992 rose-cut diamonds.

According to the statement, they left behind Empress Eugénie's crown (1855), which includes 1,354 diamonds, 1,136 rose-cut diamonds, and 56 emeralds. Eugénie was the wife of Napoleon III, the French Emperor.

Four hooded criminals arrived via scooters (the motorcycle-like ones) and accessed the Apollo Gallery on the second floor with a personnel platform, as reported by Le Parisien. Commonly known as man baskets, personnel platforms are specialized lifts for workers. The thieves broke through the glass with the help of an angle grinder, and then two men entered the museum.

Per the statement, the thieves triggered security alarms and took off, leaving behind their equipment and failing in an attempt to set fire to their vehicle. Empress Eugénie's crown was found outside and damaged, according to the French paper.

Unsurprisingly, the Louvre remained closed Sunday and Monday.

I'm writing this review with an M5-powered Vision Pro on my head and my MacBook Pro on my lap. The MacBook's screen is projected in front of me in an ultrawide format large enough that it swallows the entirety of the living room area inside of Gizmodo's office. It's a magnificent, novel sight for all of about 30 minutes. I can feel the headset bearing down on my face. The refreshed Vision Pro's new Dual Knit band keeps some of the weight on my forehead, but I know I will need a break. Apple's mixed reality headset is better than it was almost two years ago, and largely because of a better battery, peripheral support, and many, many software updates. And it's still an expensive—and occasionally awkward—work in progress that may never truly reach Apple's full ambitions.

The number of people who have never typed on a keyboard, never used a smartphone, and never used a laptop is dwindling. There are still so many people who have never tried any variety of VR (virtual reality), AR (augmented reality), or XR (extended reality) headset. Even fewer have put their eyes behind Apple's $3,500 Vision Pro since it hit the scene back in February 2024. And that makes sense. Heavy headsets strapped to your noggin seem like the worst way to interact with our interconnected environment. Headsets will remain a peripheral built for the niche; made for those who enjoy odd tech and unique experiences. Still, the new Vision Pro with M5 chip is simply the most powerful, and most perfunctory, headset around.

Apple Vision Pro (M5)

No, you don't need a $3,500 headset. However, if you're looking for unique VR experiences, the new Vision Pro with M5 is the top contender.

Pros

Cons

You have to hand it to Apple. Any other company—Google, for instance—would have cut its losses unceremoniously by now. Hell, with Android XR and Samsung's promised new ultra-expensive headset, there's still time. Meta is still leading the pack in price for performance with the $500 Quest 3 and $300 Quest 3S, but it seems the Mark Zuckerberg-led company has also decided AR smart glasses are a better investment than any kind of computer for your face.

The update to Vision Pro feels, in many ways, like a consolation prize for those who stuck it out through all the launch hype, then the subsequent backlash, and finally the doldrums of the intervening months—when many regular consumers had nearly forgotten Apple's first “spatial computer” even existed. To its credit, Apple has not abandoned Vision Pro. It has continued to update the headset with new “spatial” or “immersive” content. The problem is the number of apps built from the ground up for visionOS has slowed. I hope there will be an uptick in support with this new hardware update, but I'm not holding my breath. Now with support for third-party peripherals, there could be entire unexplored use cases. Paying for fake pickup pickleball shouldn't be the main reason anybody will go out and drop $3,500 for the minimum 256GB of storage for a perfunctory, though still promising, spatial—no, let's call it ”facial”—computer.

The first upgrade you'll notice from the M2 version is the new M5 model includes an option for a “Dual Knit” band. It comes with an extra strap that reaches across the top of your head. You still tighten it with a single knob, just like the previous single-band strap. With the new band, the headset's weight rests more on the top of the head, toward the forehead. This takes some of the weight off your brow compared to the old strap system. It also makes you look like a true “dork,” as Gizmodo's Senior Editor of Consumer Tech Raymond Wong was ready to lay at my feet as soon as he saw me wearing it.

I had previously relied on a third-party accessory by Annapro—an attachable band that helps distribute the weight toward my forehead. This strap also resulted in a worse seal around my eyes. There's no perfect way to alleviate the pressure of such a thick and heavy headset made to rest over your eyes. Even if you can stomach the discomfort, you'll inevitably need to take the headset off to cure any lingering eyestrain. You know what? That's fine. It's good to have a reason to take yourself away from the computer and touch grass, or else just get away from every screen constantly demanding your attention. Just remember to take the external battery out of your pocket when you get up, or else your $3,500 headset will go skittering across the ground.

This Vision Pro with M5 chip is still best enjoyed with passive content—whether that's short spatial movies and documentaries available on the Apple TV app or 3D movies on the Disney+ app you're keen to watch alone. Of course, me being me, I tried using the device for gaming. The twin 4K micro-OLED displays on the Vision Pro with M5 now support up to 120Hz refresh rates, compared to the M2 model, which could only refresh up to 100Hz. That means if you're planning to use the Portal app for Xbox Game Pass or GeForce Now for game streaming, you can expect to see these games running smoother than before. As for games you can play natively in 2D—not in VR with depth—on Vision Pro, that's expanding as well. Currently, Apple is promoting several titles including Sniper Elite 4 that are actually natively compatible with Vision Pro. Control, which is coming to several Apple products including iPad and Mac, will also run on the Vision Pro with M5 chip. The six-year-old game includes some ray tracing effects for better lighting, which Apple promises will be enabled once it's available in 2026.

The new Vision Pro is still a strange device with odd, incongruous components that don't make it any better. The EyeSight function, displayed on the low-quality external LCD screen, still requires any onlookers to peer very closely if they want to catch a hint of your irises. And the battery attachment will still turn off the device as soon as it's disconnected, without any extra grace period.

And yes, the battery pack is still attached to your headset by a long braided cable—one that tends to get as tangled as a yo-yo string after slipping the pack in and out of your pocket. It's big enough it will need to supplant whatever you usually have stuffed in your pants—whether that's your wallet or phone. This, combined with the weight, which is actually 150 grams heavier than before, still makes the device a better option for a sedentary lifestyle. However, Apple seemingly wants to get users moving with the new accessories.

The Vision Pro with M5 chip is Apple at its most humble. Apple is normally so obsessed with going it alone. It has even started making its own 5G modems for the iPhone 17 series and iPad Pros with M5 just to break away from Qualcomm. There are times when Apple admits it's lacking in some products, like that time it partnered with Corsair to sell a gaming keyboard in Apple stores. Apple, knowing it can't make its own VR controllers, hooked up with Sony and made the PlayStation VR 2 controllers compatible with Vision Pro. The headset can now also connect with the Logitech Muse, a stylus you can use in some select VR apps when pretending to paint on a virtual canvas.

While I don't have access to the Muse, I was able to connect the PSVR 2 controllers to the new Vision Pro. It's apparent this is still a very new function, and very few apps support the controllers. Currently, you can play titles like Ping Pong Club and co-op monster home defense game Spatial Rifts. Apple also promoted the upcoming Pickle Pro game as compatible. No, sorry to say, but Pickle Pro is not the killer app the Vision Pro was waiting for.

You can also use the triggers on the PSVR 2 controllers to act as the pinch gesture for moving around windows. They may also act as a traditional gamepad when playing your adventures on a 2D screen (even though that feels far more awkward when the four face buttons are split between each controller). At least the controllers feel ergonomic and comfortable. That counts for something if you're praying more apps support these controllers in the future. Apple will be selling the controllers at a premium price for $250. That's nearly half the cost of Sony's existing $400 VR gaming headset, which come bundled with them.

These are the capabilities that Meta has had for years with its Quest series. The Quest 3S, with its Touch Plus controllers and surprisingly accurate hand-tracking software, can occasionally offer a similar experience to Vision Pro at a fraction of the price. Apple originally didn't intend for the Vision Pro to seem like a toy. This is a serious device made for serious people. You're supposed to slip that external battery into your pocket and ignore the growing pressure on the bridge of your nose as you pry apart a 3D model of an airplane engine or type out your morning emails. At least, we can now imagine a future where we can play in our expensive headsets as much as we pretend to work in them.

I already know from my time with the new iPad Pro with M5 that the chip is many times better than the M2 chip on Apple's previous tablet. The problem is there's no good way to benchmark on Apple's spatial computer, so anything I can relay is merely anecdotal, based on the fact I have already extensively used the original Vision Pro. Otherwise, the headset is still using the R1 chip designed to process all the spatial information coming from the 12 separate cameras, five sensors, and six microphones. The two processors combined create the virtual environment users see. The only question is, does a more-modern chip improve things?

The M5 chip includes several major upgrades over Apple's previous silicon from 2022. The graphics and CPU performance can be upwards of 30% better in my tests on other systems. The M5 chip also includes new neural units built into every GPU core, according to Apple. All that translates to some functions running faster than they did on the first-gen Vision Pro. It now takes less time to create a spatial Persona avatar or turn a 2D image into a pseudo-3D “spatial” photo. I can indeed confirm both processes take less time, though it's not as if you were twiddling your thumb for minutes waiting for a spatial photo on the previous headset.

The other promise of the Vision Pro's new chip is it will boost the number of pixels you can see on screen. If the Vision Pro looks sharper than before, I couldn't tell with my naked eyes. The Vision Pro with M2 already appeared plenty sharp. I could read text on my mirrored MacBook screen with ease before. If I can see the high-quality images on Vision Pro with a little more clarity, it's just gravy to the spatial computer's existing capabilities.

The Vision Pro with M5 feels as if it operates smoother, but whether or not that's some trick of expectations or reality, it's hard to say. However, the M5 chip along with the 120Hz refresh rate is certainly a big benefit over the previous version. Sure, your movies will still be playing at the cinema-quality 24 fps, but any games you wish to play or stream will naturally look smoother thanks to the higher refresh rate.

There is still nothing quite like the Vision Pro (at least not until Samsung reveals its own competing device late on Oct. 21). The headset uses several internal and external cameras to track your hands and eyes. With the headset on, you'll be able to select apps and click on objects with a simple pinch gesture. You can have your hands in your lap or off to the side, and the headset will still pick up on these gestures. After recent updates, it's now easier than it was at launch to access your app drawer—just by looking at your palm. You can also look at the back of your hand to see the time and access other functions, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or setting up a guest user.

At launch, it was very annoying to get non-owners into the headset, but Apple's put a lot of work into fixing that. Now, all you need to do is select the options for a guest user and enable it through your iPhone or iPad. The person then has to go through the eye-tracking setup, but afterwards you can use the Vision Pro app on an iPhone or iPad to see whatever they see, helping you guide them through the odd sensation of seeing screens sprouting up like weeds before their eyes.

Apple is still going on about spatial Personas, the 3D avatars that take your place during FaceTime calls. It's based on a scan of your face you complete during setup, which involves making faces as you stare into the Vision Pro's external display. My first spatial Persona on the original Vision Pro looked like a bad cartoon version of my mug—in fact it didn't look like me at all. After several updates, the new spatial Personas indeed appear more “human,” though they will still linger on the uncomfortable side of the uncanny valley. My spatial Persona looked ruddier and dirtier than I typically do in real life—as if it captured me after I escaped prison through a tunnel I dug that morning.

The best way to describe the Apple Vision Pro after all the latest updates, including the switch to visionOS 26, is “near-seamless.” Once you're in it, and you start to understand the controls, it can be as close to a singles-only (yes, couples are banned) cinema as you can get for the cost of what would otherwise be a high-end modern TV. However, even with visionOS 26, I did experience a few instances where the old and new headset would randomly crash. I would see the Apple logo swim into vision, then have to reopen all my apps with no hint of why that happened—not even a crash report.

Once you know what you're doing, everything feels intuitive and efficient as you pinch an app and throw it to the side, out of the way. But as soon as you want to use it like a Mac, you'll find the lack of physical controls to be a bother. When initially setting up the headset, my eyes were not aligned with the camera's sensors. Trying to bring up my Apple account info was hell, as I had to look above the individual keys on the virtual keyboard to type a correct letter.

Inevitably, you'll hit the wall that all Vision Pro users do. You'll run through the default apps; you'll watch all the special “Immersive” content specific to Vision Pro on Apple TV; then download a few apps, try them out, and forget they exist. You may try out a few games, and even some emulators, but you'll find yourself picking up the Vision Pro less and less. Unless you're using the headset as your dedicated TV, you may find you have few reasons to return. I'm hoping that with the extra peripherals, the developer community comes back to Vision Pro. I wonder what it would take to have a full remote desktop app. If I could somehow connect to PC VR so I could play Half-Life: Alyx with the PSVR 2 controllers, it would be the peak way to experience that game until Valve (hopefully) comes out with its own wireless headset.

The best feature is still the Vision Pro's ability to mirror a Mac screen. You can set your virtual screen to the regular square box, a wide screen, or a room-filling ultrawide setting. Or combine your Mac screen with your other apps, such as Apple TV or Apple Music in one corner and Slack in the other. I feel like I can mix my pleasure and play better than if I were stuck with a two- or three-monitor desktop setup. It also means getting the most out of Vision Pro requires you to be fully within the warm and often sticky embrace of Apple's ecosystem.

visionOS 26 doesn't look much—or really any—different than the previous visionOS 2.2. That makes sense, because Apple designed the controversial Liquid Glass look based on what the spatial team had already devised for the headset. However, you will still feel a bit a put out by the lack of true customization you expect from any computer, spatial or not.

The other big improvement to the new Vision Pro with M5 is a slight increase in battery life. The previous M2 version could barely hope to hit 2.5 hours before it needed to be plugged in. The M5 model promises around three hours of battery life. That may not seem significant, but it's actually on the higher end of what you can expect from all high-end VR headsets.

I once tried to watch Ridley Scott's overly long Napoleon movie while on a flight with the original Vision Pro. I couldn't actually finish the movie before the headset keeled over, dead. The new Vision Pro with M5 can get me through all these too-lengthy films and a little more. I managed to squeak out around 3 hours and 15 minutes of battery life running multiple app windows and mirroring my Mac screen at the same time.

But will I want to be using the Vision Pro with M5 for too long, especially in company? Every time a colleague or friend comes around, they have to remark on the headset. I look like I'm plugged in, dead to the world, they say. I jibe back, “Yes, I'm one with the Matrix. You may as well throw my body into the woodchipper.” I can see them, but they can still only catch a hint of my eyes through those awkward EyeSight front-facing lenses. The front screen is partially why this big expensive headset is so heavy, requiring Apple to remake its headband.

Apple reportedly scrapped a potentially lighter and less expensive headset in development in favor of new AR smart glasses to compete against the Meta Ray-Ban Display. That means, for now, the Vision Pro is all we've got for Apple's spatial adventures. I dearly hope Apple keeps making content for this headset. Because despite my misgivings, I think this is still the most unique VR experience you can have, still, even two years after launch. Maybe Android XR will offer something distinct, but I wonder too if Google and Samsung will remain as dedicated to their mixed reality headset over time. Apple, for all its faults, doesn't give up so easily, and it shows with the Vision Pro with M5.

KB5070773 fixes a WinRE bug introduced by October's cumulative update.

Microsoft has issued a patch for Windows 11 after an update released on October 14 quietly broke the Windows Recovery Environment on some systems. The new update, KB5070773, restores USB keyboard and mouse input inside WinRE for Windows 11 versions 24H2 and 25H2, reversing a bug that left the recovery interface completely unusable on affected machines.

The issue, confirmed by Microsoft over the weekend, stemmed from cumulative update KB5066835. After installing it, users found that USB peripherals worked normally inside Windows proper but stopped responding inside the recovery environment. This is a pretty major failure, given that WinRE is the main route to Startup Repair, Reset this PC, and other tools needed when a machine won't boot.

If you can still log into Windows, the fix is simple: just grab KB5070773 via Windows Update and reboot. Microsoft says the fix is also baked into future rollups, so anyone who missed the emergency patch will still get the correction eventually.

But for anyone stuck in a recovery loop or trying to service a dead system, you might be stuck. Without USB input in WinRE, you're effectively locked out of your own recovery tools. Microsoft advises these users to utilize touchscreen or PS/2 ports where available, or use a USB recovery drive. OEMs and enterprises can use the Preboot Execution Environment in Configuration Manager.

Microsoft hasn't explained how the bug made it through testing, but this is the second major WinRE issue in as many months. Back in August, security updates to Windows 10 and 11 broke the Reset this PC feature entirely. That bug was also handled via emergency releases, and the quick turnaround this time suggests Microsoft didn't want to take any chances with November's Patch Tuesday still weeks away.

While Microsoft is marking the issue resolved, this latest episode highlights just how brittle the company's update cadence has become. WinRE is supposed to be the safety net when things go wrong, but with back-to-back failures knocking out recovery features, it's not a good look.

KB5070773 is live now for Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2. If your system can still reach the desktop, install it before you need it.

Apple is back with another hardware refresh of the 14-inch MacBook Pro, this time with its new M5 system-on-a-chip. The M5 provides a healthy boost in CPU performance over the M4 found in last year's base 14-inch MacBook Pro and a significant uplift in SSD performance.

Our review unit came equipped with a 1TB SSD and 32GB of RAM, but those are both pricey upgrade options for what is the entry point into the MacBook Pro family. With an as-tested price of $2,349, it's an expensive purchase for a MacBook without a “Pro” or “Max” in its CPU name.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That seems to be Apple's mantra regarding the current design of the MacBook Pro. Apple has been using this same chassis for multiple generations, save for some changes to the available colors (like Space Black replacing Space Gray).

The aluminum chassis is still attractive. Our review unit came cloaked in Space Black, which is a fingerprint magnet. The chassis is solid, with none of the flex that you'll find in systems that use plastic or a combination of plastic and aluminum. The one niggle that I have with the design is the cutout in the keyboard deck that allows your finger to slide in and lift the lid. The corners on either side of the cutout are sharp and can poke your fingers/hand if you're not careful.

With that said, you get quite a few ports on this laptop, including three Thunderbolt 4 ports, a full-size SDXC, HDMI 2.1, 3.5 mm audio jack and a MagSafe 3 connector. I've always been a fan of MagSafe and was happy to see it return when the current chassis design debuted back with the M1 Pro and Max chips.

Many people complain about the notch at the top-center of the display, which houses the Center Stage camera. It's somewhat of an eyesore, but I've become used to it over time. The way it's positioned, it sits in the space that is usually occupied by the Menu bar for apps, so I don't feel like I'm being robbed of any additional screen real estate. Do I wish that Apple found a better way to integrate the webcam? Yes. Does the current iteration really encroach on the daily usability of the laptop for me? No.

The other item of note with our MacBook Pro review unit is that it has the nano-texture display option, which costs an additional $150. The screen coating reduces glare and helps to minimize reflections, which can be beneficial outdoors, or in indoor areas with bright light sources.

Our review unit is equipped with Apple's newly released M5 processor, which is also found (for now) in the iPad Pro and Vision Pro. When used in the MacBook Pro, the M5 features 10 CPU cores (4 performance cores, 6 efficiency cores),10 GPU cores, and a 16-core NPU.

The new MacBook Pro had no trouble outdistancing the other assembled competition — 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4), Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition (Core Ultra 7 258V), Dell 16 Premium (Core Ultra 7 255H) — in every performance benchmark.

Apple consistently delivers anywhere from 10- to 20-percent improvements over the prior generation when it comes to CPU performance, and the M5 is no exception. Using the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark, our system achieved a single-core score of 4,288, roughly a 10% boost over the preceding MacBook Pro with the M4 chip. The multi-core score saw an uplifting to 17,926 versus 15,114 on the M4 (just over an 18% uplift).

However, the CPU isn't the only area that Apple decided to address when it comes to hardware upgrades. When Apple announced the M5 MacBook Pro, it boasted a 2x improvement in SSD speeds over the previous generation. In our file transfer test, which copies 25GB of data, we saw 1,917.35 MBps compared to 1,167.29 MBps for the M4 MacBook Pro (also with a 1TB SSD). It wasn't quite a 2x improvement, but is still a remarkable year-over-year leap.

We also saw a significant improvement in our Handbrake test, where we transcode a 4K video file to 1080p. Last year's 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) completed the job in four minutes and 57 seconds. However, the new M5-equipped model finished nearly a minute and a half quicker, taking just three minutes and 31 seconds.

We use Cinebench 2024 to stress test laptops, and the benchmark estimates a single-core clock of 4.6 GHz and a multi-core clock of 3.5 GHz. During our 10-run test, the system started at 1,042 and then settled in the 1,100 to 1,128 range for the duration.

The M5 includes a 10-core GPU, which provides up a 4x improvement in peak GPU compute compared to the M4 thanks to the inclusion of a dedicated Neural Accelerator baked into each core. Overall graphicps performance is said to increase by up to 30 percent over the GPU in the M4.

In the real world, we saw 57 frames per second (FPS) at 1200p and 28 FPS at native resolution in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. For comparison last year's M4-equipped system recorded 36 FPS and 18 FPS, respectively. In addition, our review unit managed 44 fps at 1200p and 31 fps at native resolution in Cyberpunk 2077 using the “For this Mac” setting.

Apple's MacBook Pro family uses an IPS display with Mini LED backlighting. This is a noticeable upgrade from the entry-level MacBook Air, with its more traditional LED-backlit IPS display. The “Liquid Retina” display has a 3,024 x 1,964 resolution and a “ProMotion” refresh rate that maxes out at 120 Hz.

Although this Mini LED can't quite touch the black level performance of competing OLED panels, it still a great looking display. The nano-texture display option, as configured on our review unit, is a great addition. My personal laptop is an older 14-inch MacBook Pro (M3) with the glossy screen finish. It's incredible to see the two side by side to highlight the difference in reflection reduction.

 




I'm not a musical kind of guy by any means, but I went to the theater last year with my wife and thoroughly enjoyed Wicked. Naturally, I'm excited to see the sequel, so I watched the final trailer for Wicked: For Good. Pinks and green are prominent in the trailer and looked wonderful on the display, and the Mini LED panel performed well in the more dimly-lit scenes featuring the Wicked Witch and her flying monkeys.

Among the assembled group, our 14-inch MacBook Pro proved to be the brightest, as measured by our light meter. It pegged 558 nits, just barely edging out last year's model (556.6 nits). This performance placed it well ahead of the Yoga 9i's OLED panel (421 nits) and the Dell 16 Premium (367 nits).

Color performance was virtually unchanged compared to M4 MacBook Pro, which shows that Apple is likely using the same panels year-over-year. We measured 81.7 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 115.4 percent of the sRGB color space. However, the Yoga 9i had more saturated colors, thanks to its OLED panel.

One of the great things about Apple being conservative with redesigns for the MacBook Pro is that the excellent keyboard remains intact. Among laptop keyboards, Apple and Lenovo remain my far and away favorites, and the scissor switches on the MacBook Pro are a delight to use. They're clicky with just enough travel to satisfy my fingers, and are far superior to problematic butterfly switches that Apple thankfully banished.

 




Apple employs single-zone white LED backlighting, which turns on automatically in low-light conditions. If you want to manually control the keyboard backlighting, you can do so by navigating to System Settings --> Keyboard.

Using the keyhero.com test, I leisurely strolled to 91 words per minute with 95 percent accuracy, which was in the same ballpark as my performance last year with the 16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro).

Another feature that I like on MacBooks is the large haptic trackpad, which simulates a physical “click.” The benefit of this design over traditional top-hinged trackpads that you find in Windows laptops is that the surface will register a click no matter where you press. The glass surface also is smooth to the touch, allowing my finger to easily glide when navigating through macOS Tahoe.

The sound system on our review unit hasn't changed compared to last year, which is a good thing. The six-speaker setup is one of the best you'll find on any laptop regardless of price, and includes support for Dolby Digital, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus and Apple Spatial Audio.

It's not often that I can comment on noticeable bass effects in a laptop sound system, but the is most definitely the case with the 14-inch MacBook Pro. I played Rainey Haynes' “I'm Old Enough to Rock and Roll,” which is a jamming track from one of my favorite 80's movies: Iron Eagle. The steady drum line, synths and Tina Turner-esque vocals soar on the sound system. Even with the volume dialed up to near max levels, I could barely discern distortion.

Upgradeability and MacBooks don't go together. While you can remove four pentalobe screws at the bottom of the chassis to remove the cover, it won't do you any good when it comes other upgrading system components. The M5 SoC is a system-on-a-chip design with our review unit's 32GB included on-die. The 1TB SSD is soldered onto the motherboard, so you're out of luck there as well.

 




In other words, you'll want to ensure that you have select enough RAM and storage that you'll need for the life of the machine at the time of purchase. Unfortunately, the upgrades are pricey (far more than you would expect in the Windows PC realm), with an upgrade from 16GB to 32GB of RAM costing $400 and boosting the SSD from the base 512GB to 1TB ringing in at $200.

Battery life has consistently been a strong point for the MacBook Pro in the Apple Silicon era, and the M5 continues that tradition.

Our 14-inch MacBook Pro unit is equipped with a 72.4 Whr battery, enough to deliver 18 hours and 14 minutes of runtime using our battery test, which involves browsing the web, running OpenGL tests, and streaming video at 150 nits of brightness. However, this result was 20 minutes less than last year's MacBook Pro with the M4.

 




Despite the 20-minute shortfall compared to last year, the result easily bested the Dell 16 Premium by 2.5x (7:15) despite its larger 99 WHr battery. The Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition was also no match, with a runtime of 12 hours and 47 minutes.

We measured skin temperatures during our Cinebench 2024 stress test on the 14-inch MacBook Pro. As soon as the test began, the system fans spun into high gear to keep the system temperatures in check.

 




The hottest point measured was near the left exhaust vent at 108 degrees Fahrenheit, while we saw 104 F between the G and H keys. The touchpad was much cooler at 82.8 F. The system overall felt warm, but it was tolerable to sit on my lap while wearing shorts.

During the Cinebench 2024 stress test, we measured temperatures using the TG Pro app. The overall system temperature, which takes an average of several components (i.e., power supply, battery, SSD, logic board, etc.) was 73 degrees Celsius (163 degrees Fahrenheit). The M5 itself registered 87 degrees C (188 F).

Like last year's mode, the new M5 uses a 12MP Center Stage camera. Image quality looked impeccable, with good detail in my face (wrinkles, grey hairs in my beard, and everything else), and excellent color representation. I used the camera while sitting on a couch with a brightly lit window behind me, and the picture still looked great without blowing out details or causing halo effects.

The Center Stage feature keeps your face centered in the frame during calls, should you move around in your seat. It's a neat feature, but I prefer to leave the feature off — sometimes I just want to briefly duck out of frame to sneeze, and not everybody on a call needs to see that.

The big change with macOS 26 Tahoe is the addition of the “Liquid Glass” makeover, a design language that it shares with iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. This an overabundant use of translucent menus and icons, which reflect displayed content in real time. Liquid Glass has been controversial since it was first announced at WWDC, and Apple tweaked the effect during the beta period to appease the naysayers. Now that Liquid Glass is in its final form, I'm mostly OK with how it looks, mainly because its reach in macOS Tahoe isn't as broad as it is in iOS or iPadOS.

Besides the fresh coat of paint for the UI, macOS Tahoe brings features like Live Translation for the Messages app and FaceTime, Live Activities for Mac, a refresh Phone app, Call Screening, more intelligent search Spotlight, and a universal clipboard (with history).

Apple Intelligence was a prominent new feature Apple announced last year for macOS Sequoia, but most of the headlining features involving Siri never materialized. Apple took a lot of flak for overpromising and underdelivering, and expect the previously announced Siri features to debut sometime next year. With that said, Apple stayed relatively mum about Apple Intelligence updates for macOS Tahoe.

With that said, macOS continues to be a well-rounded operating system with a slew of Apple-provided apps out of the box. One of my favorites is iPhone Mirroring, which allows you full access to your iPhone's screen from your macOS Tahoe desktop. It especially comes in handy when I need to perform two-factor authentication verification with my phone, and my phone is in another room or I'm too lazy to dig it out of my pocket.

Apple offers three preconfigured options for the M5 MacBook Pro, all of which feature the M5 chip with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU. The base system features 16GB of unified memory and a 512GB SSD for $1,599. The middle tier includes a 1TB SSD for an additional $200 ($1,799). The top configuration gives you 24GB of unified memory and a 1TB SSD for $1,999.

However, Apple also offers built-to-order configuration that allow you to further tweak the system to your specific needs. Our review unit came with 32GB of unified memory, a 1TB SSD, and the nano-texture display option, which brought the as-tested price to $2,349. That's quite pricey for an entry-level MacBook Pro with Apple's base-level chip.

If you want an M5 MacBook Pro with all the trimmings, opting for 32GB of RAM, a 4TB SSD, the nano-texture display option and the 96W USB-C power adapter balloons the price to $3,369.

Apple's MacBook Pro comes with a one-year warranty. You can opt for Apple's extended warranty, Apple Care Plus, which costs $99.99/year or $9.99/month. The coverage adds unlimited repairs covering accidents, 24/7 priority tech support, and battery replacement.

Not only did Apple increase CPU performance for the 14-inch MacBook Pro this year with the brawny new M5, but it also delivered a healthy uplift in SSD performance. Despite the performance increases, battery life remains within the margin of error with last year's model at over 18 hours.

The performance is wrapped in a high-quality chassis with plenty of ports for pro users, although the Space Black finish remains susceptible to fingerprints. Our usual complaints about Apple laptops remain, including the high price of SSD and memory upgrades.

I'll add one more: the lack of Wi-Fi 7. I find it odd that a laptop starting at $1,599 doesn't include Wi-Fi 7 as standard equipment, and this is made even more puzzling considering that Apple's excellent N1 Wi-Fi chip is available already in the iPhone 17/Air/Pro and the new iPad Pro (M5). Both the Dell and Lenovo assembled here include Wi-Fi 7. While we reviewed the Dell 16 Premium and used it as a competitor here, the Dell 14 Premium, which aligns more closely with the 14-inch MacBook Pro in terms of size, includes Wi-Fi 7 standard in its base $1,249 configuration.

Speaking of the Dell 14 Premium, it is a worthy alternative to the 14-inch MacBook Pro. You can spec one out with a Core Ultra 7 255H, 32GB LPDDR5X, a 1TB SSD and a 14.5-inch 3.2K touch OLED for $1,949, undercutting Apple's offering, as-tested, by $400.

If you already have a 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 chip, I would recommend you sit this one out. However, if you're coming from a much older M1 or M2 version, the performance gains are hard to ignore.

With that said, at its base price of $1,599 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is a strong productivity workhorse. But once pricing starts cresting the $2,000 mark with hardware upgrades, the value proposition starts to wane.

 October 21, 2025  

US endoscopists frequently stray from established best practices when removing colon polyps smaller than 1 cm, with fewer than 60% of procedures using the recommended cold snare technique, an analysis of more than 1.8 million colonoscopies found. 

“We expected to find some variations in polypectomy technique, but the results were surprising; overall, cold snare usage was much lower than expected, given that this is the recommended method for removing most small polyps,” Seth Crockett, MD, MPH, professor of medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, told Medscape Medical News. 

The study was published in the October issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Using Gastroenterology Quality Improvement Consortium Registry data, Crockett and colleagues analyzed more than 1.8 million colonoscopies performed by 4601 endoscopists between 2019 and 2022 across 702 sites. All colonoscopies involved removal of polyps < 1 cm; lesions of this size are commonly found in screening colonoscopies, and detection is crucial to early cancer prevention.

The researchers found striking variation in polypectomy technique. Guideline-based cold snare polypectomy (CSP) was used in only 58% of cases (and as a single device in only 51%), whereas cold forceps polypectomy (CFP) accounted for 35% and hot snare polypectomy (HSP) for 11%. 

The fact that CSP was used in fewer than 60% of cases represents “an important quality gap,” the authors wrote, adding that the fact that more than 10% of colonoscopies used HSP suggests that “some patients harboring low-risk lesions may be exposed to excess risk related to these practice variations.” 

And while recommendations around the use of CFP are more nuanced (based largely on forceps type and polyp size), the “high frequency of CFP also suggests nonadherence to best practices,” they noted. 

Polypectomy technique varied by polyp type. CFP was more common in cases where only hyperplastic polyps were removed compared with cases with tubular adenomas (45% vs 30%, respectively). CSP use was highest in cases where only sessile serrated lesions were removed (66%) compared with cases with only tubular adenomas (61%) or hyperplastic polyps (37%). 

There was also considerable variation by provider specialty.

Gastroenterologists (compared with non-GI specialists) used HSP less (4% vs 8%) and CSP more (40% vs 34%). Colonoscopies performed with GI fellows were more likely to use CFP (31% vs 21%) and less likely to use HSP (1% vs 5%) compared with colonoscopies without fellows.

“It was somewhat reassuring that colonoscopies performed by gastroenterologists were more likely to adhere to guideline recommendations, which suggests that dedicated endoscopy training is likely an important factor driving high-quality colonoscopy,” Crockett told Medscape Medical News. 

“Unexpectedly,” polypectomy technique also differed dramatically by geographic region, he said. CFP was used more than twice as often in the Northeast (31%) as in the Midwest (14%), whereas CSP was used more frequently in the Midwest (52%) than in the Northeast (32%).

“We suspect that much of the variation is related to differences in training, preferences, habits, and evolution of colonoscopy practice over time,” Crockett said. “More research is needed on the underlying drivers of this variation, and how differences in polypectomy technique impact both the safety and efficacy of colonoscopy to prevent colorectal cancer,” he said.

“As a specialty, we need to continue to work on disseminating guideline recommendations regarding colonoscopy quality, monitoring adherence to evidence-based practices, and working to address gaps in quality where they exist,” he added. 

David Johnson, MD, professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Eastern Virginia Medical School and Old Dominion University in Norfolk, called the results “concerning, surprising, and disappointing” and not consistent with the most current quality recommendations that advocate cold snare for most polyps less than 1 cm in size. 

“Cold snare polypectomy has been shown not only to be more effective but also takes less time to perform, relative to cold biopsy,” said Johnson, who wasn't involved in the study. 

Johnson told Medscape Medical News, “Inadequate lesion resection and variation in resection quality are major issues for colonoscopy quality. Those who perform colonoscopies need to be up-to-date with evidence-based quality standards — as well as held accountable if [there is] discordant practice — if we are to optimize the cancer prevention benefits of quality colonoscopy.”

Limitations of the current analysis include lack of extensive patient information and inability to further stratify polyps < 1 cm by size. 

The study had no commercial funding. Crockett had no disclosures. Johnson disclosed serving as a director, officer, partner, employee, advisor, consultant, or trustee for ISOThrive.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Gender-affirming hormone therapy rewrites body proteins to match gender identity","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251021/Gender-affirming-hormone-therapy-rewrites-body-proteins-to-match-gender-identity.aspx","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 04:46:00 GMT","

Melbourne researchers have discovered gender-affirming hormone therapy can alter body proteins to match a person's gender identity, potentially affecting susceptibility to certain health conditions.

The research, led by Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) and the University of Melbourne, found that sex-specific blood proteins in transgender women shifted significantly after six months of gender-affirming hormone therapy, resembling those of cisgender women.

MCRI Associate Professor Boris Novakovic said remarkably the therapy reduced protein biomarkers related to male reproduction and fertility and increased those that drive body fat, breast development, immune function and good heart health.

Published in Nature Medicine, the study involved 40 adult trans women recruited from the Austin Hospital who had more than 5,000 blood proteins examined. Participants were given one of two forms of common feminising hormone therapies with the results checked before and six months of treatment. The research team also compared the protein changes to those seen in cisgender women by using samples from 55,000 people stored in a UK biobank.

It found gender-affirming hormone therapy changed seven of the 10 key proteins that are normally different between males and females, proving that sex hormones strongly influence blood biomarkers to help better align with a person's gender identity. The changes reflected those seen in women undergoing hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms.

Associate Professor Novakovic said the findings showed changes to sex hormones induced by gender-affirming hormone therapy could have a big influence on reshaping key blood biomarkers that were linked to certain health conditions.

""For transgender women we found gender affirming hormone therapy alters the levels of many protein biomarkers that reflect what happens clinically,"" he said.

This may go onto impact the risk of allergic and autoimmune diseases, which tend to affect more females, but decrease the risk of heart disease, more commonly seen in males. This highlights that human biology is malleable and that even in adulthood, our bodies respond to sex hormone changes.""

Boris Novakovic, Associate Professor, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute

Associate Professor Novakovic said the findings stressed the need for more nuanced approaches to long-term health monitoring for those undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy.

Additionally, healthcare providers should consider the similarities to cisgender women's health risks and the unique aspects of trans women's health, he said.

University of Melbourne Professor Ada Cheung said, ""Studying proteins could help with the development of personalised treatment approaches by monitoring the effectiveness of gender affirming hormone therapy in trans women and help us with early detection of potential side-effects on heart health or immune function.

""We need to improve the way gender-affirming hormone therapy is managed. This study gives us a glimpse into how personalised treatment may work as technology advances.""

The HCS-3DX platform performs automated analysis of three-dimensional cell cultures, known as spheroids. Using AI-based image processing and sample selection, the system enables large-scale, high-precision screening of cellular models within a fraction of the usual time.

""Our goal was to create a unified platform that integrates the strengths of existing technologies and can be easily implemented in research and industry"" said Ákos Diósdi, first author of the study.

According to Dr. Péter Horváth, director of the Institute of Biochemistry at the HUN-REN Biological Research Centre, Szeged and senior author of the paper:

""One of the main bottlenecks in personalized medicine has been the limited throughput of cell-based assays. The HCS-3DX system removes this limitation, allowing for fast, large-scale, and highly accurate analysis.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study clarifies the complex interaction between gut bacteria and common gastrointestinal disorder","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251021/Study-clarifies-the-complex-interaction-between-gut-bacteria-and-common-gastrointestinal-disorder.aspx","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:11:00 GMT","

Research from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, clarifies the complex interaction between gut bacteria and IBS. Experiments demonstrate that gut bacteria can produce the important substance serotonin. The finding may lead to new future treatments.

IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, is a common gastrointestinal disorder, more common, in women, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea. The cause of the disease is not clear, but the intestinal environment including the gut microbiota and serotonin appear to be important factors.

Serotonin is best known as a neurotransmitter in the brain, but over 90 percent of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, where it controls bowel movements via the enteric nervous system, sometimes called the ""gut-brain"".

Previous research has shown that the bacteria in the gut, the gut microbiota, affects how much serotonin is produced by the host, but until now it has been unclear whether gut bacteria themselves can form biologically active serotonin.

In the current study, published in the journal Cell Reports, the researchers have identified two bacteria that together can produce serotonin: Limosilactobacillus mucosae and Ligilactobacillus ruminis.

When the bacteria were introduced into germ-free mice with serotonin deficiency, the levels of serotonin in the gut increased, as did the density of nerve cells in the colon. The bacteria also normalized the intestinal transit time.

""It is incredibly fascinating how the gut bacteria can produce bioactive signaling molecules that affect health"", says Fredrik Bäckhed, Professor of molecular medicine at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, and one of the leading authors of the study.

The researchers were also able to see that people with IBS had lower levels of one of the bacteria (L. mucosae) in their stool compared to healthy individuals, and that this bacterium also has the enzyme required for serotonin production.

Our results indicate that certain intestinal bacteria can produce bioactive serotonin and thus play an important role in intestinal health and open new avenues for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS.""

Magnus Simrén, professor of medical gastroenterology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg

""Our findings indicate that intestinal bacteria can form signaling substances such as serotonin, which may be the key to understanding how the intestine and its inhabitants can affect our brain and the behavior,"" concludes Fredrik Bäckhed.

Brain connectivity patterns and environmental factors predict which older adults will successfully increase physical activity after receiving a cardiovascular diagnosis. Nagashree Thovinakere and colleagues studied 295 cognitively healthy but physically inactive older adults from the UK Biobank who received cardiovascular diagnoses during a roughly four-year period.

The authors tracked which people increased their activity level to the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels recommended by the World Health Organization, using both self-reports and accelerometer data. The authors used machine learning to identify key predictive factors for physical activity behavior change, finding that a combined model incorporating brain imaging, behavioral, and contextual features achieved the strongest predictive performance. Important predictors included access to green spaces, social support from friends and family, executive function abilities, and specific patterns of brain connectivity between networks involved in self-control and planning.

Participants who increased physical activity showed cognitive benefits, particularly in working memory and executive function. According to the authors, a multimodal brain-behavior fingerprint can help predict physical activity adherence, which could help clinicians. In addition, the importance of factors such as green space and social support can help guide policy to increase heart health at the population level. Individual motivation helps but structural and contextual factors also determine whether a person sticks with a heart-healthy exercise routine.

Concord-Carlisle High School junior Emmy O'Donnell was recently named to the U.S. Under-19 Women's National Soccer Team and U.S. Under-18 Youth National Team International Training Camp roster, according to a community announcement.

O'Donnell, 16, is the only Massachusetts player on the roster and joins several professional and collegiate players. Of the 20 players called up, 12 were born in 2008 and eight were born in 2007.

""I am beyond excited for this opportunity and the special chance I have to play with these players,"" O'Donnell said in a statement. ""Representing your country internationally is truly an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""

Emmy is a standout soccer player for Concord-Carlisle High School and plays for FC Stars Blue in Lancaster, an elite-level premier soccer program, according to the announcement. She has verbally committed to Duke University to play women's soccer.

At Concord-Carlisle, O'Donnell's coaches place her as a forward or midfielder, depending on strategy. With the FC Stars, she often plays wingback. At the international camp, she will be a defender, according to the announcement.

In her freshman year, she scored six goals and had seven assists. Last season, she scored eight goals and added three assists, earning All-State honors. She is also a two-time Dual County All-League, First Team Eastern Massachusetts All-Star, an Elite Clubs National League New England Conference Player of the Year and was named to the ECNL Girls U-16 2023-24 All America Team.

This season, Emmy is the leading scorer in the Dual County League, primarily playing as a midfielder.

""Emmy is the best player in Massachusetts,"" Concord-Carlisle High School girls soccer coach Peter Fischelis said in a statement. ""She's at a completely different level, and if you watch one game, you can easily see it. She's very skillful, she has an innate sense of where her opponents are in relation to where she is with the ball, and she's the most tenacious player I've ever seen.""

Brooklyn Football Club on Tuesday announced the appointment of former U.S. men's international Brian McBride as general manager as the club builds toward its USL Championship debut in 2026.

BROOKLYN, N.Y. — Brooklyn Football Club on Tuesday announced the appointment of former U.S. men's international Brian McBride as general manager as the club builds toward its USL Championship debut in 2026.

McBride will oversee all sporting operations for the men's and women's teams, including roster construction, technical staffing, performance analytics, and long-term player development. The women's side is in its second season competing in the Gainbridge Super League, a USL property and the top tier of women's professional soccer in the United States.

Brooklyn FC's men's team will kick off its inaugural USL Championship season in March 2026. In the months ahead, the club will unveil a head coach, technical staff, and initial player signings, alongside new community initiatives and sponsor partnerships.

“Brooklyn is a place that moves with intent. The world knows the energy and determination this borough brings, and that's the foundation we'll build this team on,” McBride said in a statement. “We're not just putting players on the pitch. We're building a club that represents Brooklyn and everything it stands for: diversity, drive, and fierce competition. I'm honored to be part of it.”

McBride earned 95 caps for the U.S. men's national team and scored 30 goals across friendlies, qualifiers, and tournaments. He also appeared in three World Cups (1998, 2002, 2006), scoring in multiple editions. After his playing career, he served as USMNT general manager from 2020-23.

He played in Major League Soccer and the English Premier League, where he became a Fulham FC standout and two-time club player of the year. In 2009, Fulham named a bar inside Craven Cottage in his honor. He was the first draft pick of the Columbus Crew, helping lead the club to a U.S. Open Cup title in 2002, and later captained the Chicago Fire. In 2014, he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

“This is a major moment for the club and the borough,” Brooklyn Football Club president David Barry said in a statement. “Brian brings a rare blend of experience, leadership, and vision; from his elite playing career to his experience with the next generation of American soccer stars. He understands what it means to build something that reflects this community, hardwork and determination. Our women's team has already set the tone, and now we're bringing that same energy to the men's side. Brooklyn FC is all in.”

Brooklyn FC is planning a community event at Industry City on Oct. 29, where supporters will have a first chance to meet McBride and hear more about the men's team. The event is being developed in partnership with the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, Brooklyn Made, and Fort Hamilton Distillery, with participation from local youth soccer clubs.

MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - The United States Men's National Soccer Team is heating up! For the first time since Coach Mauricio Pochettino's initial hire, the team is trending in the right direction. Three straight solid performances; wins against Australia, Japan and a tie against Ecuador. 

That's the good news. The bad news is we only have two international camps, four games left, until June. Which barring injury, will be the final World Cup roster. So time is running out and decisions need to be made. That's why it's critical to get the player pool right for the upcoming games in November. 

HERE ARE THE FIVE PLAYERS WE NEED TO SEE NEXT MONTH:

1 - NOAHKAI BANKS, CENTER BACK, FC AUGSBURG, 6'4”, AGE 18

2 - GEORGE CAMPBELL, CENTER BACK, WEST BROM, 6'2”, AGE 24

Yes, things are trending positively for the USMNT… with one big exception… center back. Chris Richards is a starter lock. Tim Ream is a roster lock. That leaves 3, or 4 spots up for grabs. Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Tristan Blackmon and Walker Zimmerman have all seen minutes this year, but none of them have played well enough to lock in a spot. Noahkai Banks and George Campbell deserve a shot.

At only 18, Banks is a massive talent. Standing 6'4”, his physical presence is immense. He backs that up with poise and skill. The question is, will he have enough experience come Summer ‘26? His club playing time is trending in the right direction. Banks has started his last two Bundesliga games, scored once, and plays in a back 3 (like the U.S.). It's now or never to integrate Banks into this World Cup cycle.

Campbell got a shot in January camp. Clearly, he did NOT impress, because he hasn't received a call since. However, unlike our other CB options, his situation has changed dramatically since then. In July, Campbell transferred from the MLS to the English Championship. Since then, he's had ten straight starts, all of which he played the full 90 minutes. Additionally, he ranks near the top of the EFL in several positional categories. It's time to give him another look. To be honest, I don't think he will get the call, but I sure hope he does. He's at least earned a look.

3 - THE DEST/ROBINSON COMBO:

SERGIÑO DEST, FULL BACK/WING BACK, PSV, 5′7″, AGE 24

JEDI ROBINSON, FULL BACK/WING BACK, FULHAM, 6′0″, AGE 28

I'm cheating by naming two players as one, but it's really about seeing this combo together. Coach Poch's new formation with two wing backs, should put Robinson and Dest centerstage. Come November Camp, the two will have not been together on the field for 27 games and nearly 20 months! Furthermore, they've NEVER been on the field at the same time under Poch. Dest is playing again, but Jedi's knee injury remains a concern. Hoping he gets healthy, the boys come back, and we can see them cook... TOGETHER!

4 - RICARDO PEPI, STRIKER, PSV, 6'1”, AGE 22

Ricardo Pepi should have been at the World Cup in 2022... he wasn't. Ricardo Pepi should be at the World Cup in 2026... will he? If Pepi is healthy, he's roster lock. Problem is, he hasn't been. Also, we have seen Poch choose favorites. If Pepi doesn't get back in camp soon, he may not have a chance to win Poch over. We need him too, because Pepi can be a game changing scorer. The good news is Pepi returned to the pitch on Saturday. Barring any setbacks, he will be available and should get the call for November.

5 - GIO REYNA, MIDFIELDER/ATTACKER, 6'0”, AGE 22

The Wunderkind! Gio Reyna! Umm... where did he go? In 2023, a 20-year-old Gio absolutely caught fire. 7 goals and 4 assists in limited minutes for Borussia Dortmund, and 4 goals and 2 assists with the USMNT, including a ‘Man of the Match' performance in the Nations League Final victory against Canada. But also, he broke his leg in that game. Since then - injuries, loans, perceived attitude issues, who knows - it's been one thing after another. So who is Gio? A potential superstar who is about to bounce back? Or a talent who's career was derailed by attitude and injuries? Malik Tillman and Christian Pulisic may both miss November camp with injuries of their own, spots will be open, so the time is now for Poch to find out. Will the real Gio Reyna please stand up?

THREE NOTABLE NAMES: JOE SCALLY, YUNUS MUSAH, JOHNNY CARDOSO

I know some USMNT die hards may come after me for not mentioning some, or all of the above three players. Here's why they didn't make my ‘five':

Joe Scally is not as valuable as he once was for the USMNT given the new formation. Could they still try him at RWB or RCB? Absolutely! Does he have the credentials? Yes. But it sure seems like he is in Poch's dog house. If we actually see him in November... great. If not, I think the writing is on the wall that he is out for the remainder of this World Cup project.

Yunus Musah also seems to be in the dog house, and it's self-inflicted. When you are the greatest American player perhaps ever... Christian Pulisic... and you take a summer off and come back to absolutely cook, that's one thing. But for a player like Musah in a fight for a roster spot, taking the summer off sends the wrong message. Plus, his time with his new club Atalanta has been a disaster so far. He saw zero minutes this past weekend. Musah may also be out of this World Cup project.

Johnny Cardoso is playing with an elite squad in Atletico Madrid, but he has certainly not looked elite with the USMNT. He's actually looked quite poor. Combine that with injury concerns and it's not looking great for Johnny come November.

Mic'd Up: The outspoken analyst lauded Pochettino's approach, but says international game has been a 'rude awakening' for U.S. coach

The USMNT that took the field at the 1994 World Cup has an immaculate pedigree. They were the originals of U.S. soccer, the first group of guys that truly captured the nation's eye - no doubt helped by the fact that they represented their country well on home soil.

It's been 31 years since that tournament, and the group has dispersed a little. Some are in coaching. Some are in the media. And then there's Alexi Lalas, still at the center of the American soccer discussion.

And as the USMNT approach another home World Cup, he wonders if they can capture the similar ""magic"" that his team found. 

""Going to a men's World Cup is nothing new for us,"" Lalas told GOAL. ""We've gone to tons of them, doing well in the group, winning the group. So what we're looking for is things that we haven't seen before, and magic moments.""

And that's possible, he says. Lalas is an outspoken figure on his State of the Union podcast and FOX Sports coverage. His takes on the USMNT routinely go viral - and often add fuel to the fire. And when it comes to Mauricio Pochettino, the no-longer-new manager tasked with taking the U.S. to World Cup glory, Lalas isn't yet sold.

""I think he's gotten a rude awakening, but a necessary one,"" he says. ""And he's had to kind of play catch up as to both how it functions, just in general the international game as a manager, but also in particular this group.""

And the USMNT players? They absolutely needed a wake up call, Lalas argues. And Pochettino has delivered.

""He is not your friend. He is your coach and or manager, whatever you want to call it,"" Lalas says. ""And his job, and why he's being paid $6 million, is to have you be in the best possible place to give this team the most chance of success. And sometimes that means a kick in the a*s, and not always followed up with a pat on the back.""

Lalas discussed Pochettino, Chris Richards and the USMNT's prospects for the 2026 World Cup in Mic'd Up, a recurring feature in which GOAL taps into the perspective of analysts, announcers and other pundits on the state of soccer in the U.S. and abroad.

The front-runner to be the next Mayor of New York, wants to tackle inflated prices.

Tickets for next summer's FIFA World Cup have only recently went on sale but already there are real question marks over how the process is being handled. 

The cheapest of the seats began at $60, while the most expensive tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium were set at $6,730. However those figures were just the starting price, with ‘variable pricing' models introduced to adjust the prices as demand increased. 

Needless to say, after the first round of ticket draws the prices have started to surge with ticket resellers buying up blocks of tickets at lower prices, allowing them to sell for a profit once the fixtures have been confirmed later in the year. 

FIFA's presale for World Cup 2026 tickets has revealed just how expensive the tournament could be for supporters - and we're calling on the FA to lobby FIFA for fairer prices #FIFAWorldCup #WC2026 pic.twitter.com/YsOLX5tuDF

FIFA's use of dynamic pricing has been widely criticized, with NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani among those who have had their say on the matter. 

Mamdani told The Athletic: “These kinds of policies from FIFA are ones that threaten to price out the very people that make this game so special. In our fight for making the most expensive city in America affordable, it's a fight that is not limited just to housing, childcare and public transit. It also extends to the moments that give New Yorkers such joy, which will be the World Cup next year.”

He continued: “I've spoken to a number of New Yorkers who tried to buy tickets, and it wasn't only an issue of just how unaffordable the tickets were, but also just the mess of that system. There's a desperate need for more clarity and for more of a commitment that this be a tournament for people who already call the city home.”

So far, however, there has been no indication that FIFA are likely to make any significant changes. Heimo Schirgi, FIFA's World Cup 2026 chief operating officer, advised supporters to buy their tickets as soon as possible, to avoid getting stung by the price increases. 

“I think the message is ‘Get your tickets early,' especially if you know where you will be because you live in that city or you're a fan of the three hosting nations, and then you know already when and where they will play,” Schirgi said. “So that's the message: ‘Get your tickets early,' because anything could happen.”

GOAL US unpacks the main storylines from the international break and World Cup qualifying in The Euro XI

Goodbye, international break. Welcome back to the real soccer. The slate of games after international competition are always a little odd: slower, tactically clunkier. It seems as if everyone is still trying to find their feet. 

The result, so often, is a sense of drama and jeopardy. And if you subscribe to that theory, then this was an excellent weekend of evidence. Liverpool lost to Man United at home (which is a weird sentence). Ange Postecoglou got sacked after 39 days (a predictable sentence). And Como are the best story in European football (a charming sentence).

Elsewhere, El Clasico looks pretty intense, and it's still a week away. Man City are maybe back for real this time. And La Liga, in general, is just fed up with everything.

'Set-piece FC' strike yet again as Viktor Gyokeres bags confidence-boosting brace in crushing Champions League win","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/arsenal-player-ratings-vs-atletico-madrid-gabriel-viktor-gyokeres-champions-league-win/bltcf4082dc58129793","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 20:56:42 GMT","

Arsenal thumped Atletico Madrid 4-0 in a hugely impressive Champions League outing on Tuesday, as Gabriel Magalhaes scored and assisted while Viktor Gyokeres netted a confidence-boosting brace. Three of the Gunners' four goals came directly from set-pieces, as Mikel Arteta's side became the second English side to beat Atletico in Europe this season, after Liverpool. 

Arsenal had an opening within the first five minutes, as Eberechi Eze took aim from outside the area, and his shot took a looping deflection before crashing against the crossbar. Midway through the half, meanwhile, David Raya made a terrible mistake, as he attempted to shepherd the ball out of play, only to lose possession, and after Atletico took their throw-in quickly, Julian Alvarez could only shoot narrowly wide of the far post. 

After the half-hour mark, Arsenal thought they had the lead, as Martin Zubimendi won the ball high and fed Bukayo Saka; his shot was tapped in by Gabriel Martinelli, but VAR correctly ruled the Brazil international offside. 

After the resumption in the second half, Atletico also hit the bar, as Alvarez shot from the edge of the box and sent Raya scrambling, only for the Spaniard to be saved by the woodwork. But it was Arsenal who took the lead, four minutes before the hour, with Gabriel heading home a fine free-kick delivery from Declan Rice. 

Martinelli added a second just after the 60-minute mark, as he ran onto a fine Myles Lewis-Skelly through ball and found the bottom corner, before Viktor Gyokeres all but ended the game as a contest with a scrappy finish from the edge of the six-yard box. 

Gyokeres added his second, and Arsenal's fourth, on 70 minutes, after another exceptional Rice delivery found Gabriel at the back post, marking the end of a whirlwind 13-minute period in which the north London side marked themselves out as genuine European contenders this season.

Back in the winner's circle for the first time since her title run in Montreal, Victoria Mboko reminded everyone of the tantalizing talent she brings to the court, defeating Bianca Andreescu 6-3, 6-3 in 1 hour and 15 minutes to set up a second-round battle with Eva Lys.

Victoria Mboko arrived in Montreal as a rising talent and left as a WTA 1000 champion at 18.

Tokyo: Scores | Draw | Order of play

Following her title run, Mboko faced a natural adjustment period on tour. She lost four consecutive first-round matches in the months that followed, a stretch that came against strong opposition. Now back on home soil, she has steadied her form and returned to winning ways.

Back in April, Mboko notched two wins at the Billie Jean King Cup on the same court where she faced fellow Canadian Bianca Andreescu in the first round of the Toray Pan Pacific Open on Tuesday. She picked up right where she left off, defeating Andreescu 6-3, 6-3 in just 1 hour and 15 minutes -- her first win since Montreal.

“Playing here kind of made me think back to April,” Mboko said after the match. “I had a really great week and had a lot of fun playing on this court. When I was walking back out (today), I had the same feeling. It brought me some nostalgia, and I felt really happy to be here. To play on center court is always really nice.”

Shaking off the hangover: Mboko isn't the first -- and won't be the last -- player to experience a post-breakthrough slump. Although the irony of her enduring a tennis hangover just weeks before she was legally able to experience a real one isn't lost here.

Still, few expected such a long wait for her next win.

Several factors contributed to her recent struggles. A lingering wrist injury from Montreal slowed her in the weeks that followed, and tough draws didn't help. During that stretch, she faced two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova and world No. 10 Ekaterina Alexandrova.

If any of that weighed on her mind Tuesday, it didn't show. Mboko raced to a 3-0 lead and never looked back, claiming the first set in just 35 minutes. She then broke early in the second for a 3-2 advantage before serving out the match.

Clean tennis, clear mind: The key to getting back in the win column? Clean tennis.

She landed nearly 70% of her first serves and won 77% of those points, maintaining control of the match throughout. Andreescu broke once in the first set but failed to mount any resistance on return after that.

Not only did Mboko keep the ball in the service box, but she also kept the ball in the court. She finished with more winners than unforced errors -- 20 to 18 -- and outperformed Andreescu in both categories. She never trailed in the match.

What's next: Mboko's second-round opponent in Tokyo is a surging Eva Lys, who defeated Katie Boulter 6-2, 6-1 in just over an hour in the first round.

Mboko holds bragging rights from their only previous meeting, a 6-4, 6-4 win at Roland Garros earlier this year.

A win for Lys would mark her third time reaching the quarterfinals this season and second time in a row following her run in Beijing where she lost to Coco Gauff. For Mboko, a victory would mean just her second WTA-level quarterfinal.

Michael Zheng always knew he wanted to further his education, even after reaching the 2022 Wimbledon boys' singles final as an unseeded junior. There was no bluffing for the poker enthusiast.“I felt like I just wasn't ready,” he tells TENNIS.com when reflecting on his decision not to turn pro at 18 and instead pursue an NCAA pathway at Columbia University.Just over three years later, his gut has all but paid off.

🖥️📲 Stream Zheng's bid to win the Sioux Falls Challenger live on the Tennis Channel app!Coming into mid-October, Zheng is riding a 15-match win streak on the ATP Challenger Tour. Having captured his maiden title at Chicago in August, the 21-year-old picked up two more hard-court crowns in Columbus and Tiburon after winning a round of qualifying at the US Open.“I feel like my serve has gotten a lot better, so I'm getting a few more free points. I think just a little bit of everything has been kind of clicking and just playing with confidence. It's been working,” he says. “Every week is a little bit different. I think that was something I struggled with before the last couple of years, but I've been doing a better job with that.”Howard “Howie” Endelman, head coach of Columbia's men's tennis program, attributes Zheng's progression to making the most of the overall college experience.“I just think that he's really embraced the opportunity to be a college tennis player and to work on his game. At the same time, he's also furthering his academic career, and meeting new people, and kind of using tennis as a vehicle to create opportunities in all parts of his life,” believes Endelman.“He's always been really tough from the ground, with terrific defense and excellent hands. I think tennis-wise, his serve has improved tremendously. His forehand has become a terrific weapon. His backhand has gotten better. He's coming forward.”

Endelman first became aware of Zheng's potential when, as a young high schooler, he faced Columbia's Shawn Hadavi at an open tournament in New York City. While Hadavi walked off the court with the win, he informed Endelman that “this guy's going to be really good, really good,” planting the seed to monitor with extra interest.Zheng is a first-generation American, the son of immigrants from the Hubei area of China that eventually landed on building IT careers. Born in Chesapeake, Va., Zheng was sent to the family's homeland to live with his father's sister before returning to Montville, N.J. when he was two. By six, Zheng was on a tennis court with dad Joe and older sister Amy—and the rest is history for the kid soon making regular commutes to train at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, home of the US Open.“My dad was the one driving me around and kind of laid the ground rules if you want to be the best you can be. He had faith in me that I could be a really good player and I trusted that,” recalls Zheng. “I worked with that belief of having your family behind you. It wasn't that hard.“Both my parents, I know they had a much tougher life than me for sure.”As Endelman learned more about Zheng's backstory, it only captivated him more. When it came time for the five-star recruit to select a program, what Endleman and Columbia could offer won out over Stanford.

Columbia has been one of the best decisions I've made. Howie and all the coaching staff that I've worked with there, the strength staff, the athletic department, they've been super supportive. I've had so much time to develop and it's one of the reasons why I think I've been on this run so far. Michael Zheng

In his freshman campaign, Zheng nabbed Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors in a breakout season that earned him a trip to the NCAA championships. The following year, he built on that success by making a run to the NCAA singles final. As a junior, he entered the history books as Columbia's first NCAA singles champion of the modern era, ending a program drought dating back to 1906.“He has an even keeled personality. Even when things go wrong, which they always do in tennis and in life, he always kind of takes it in stride,” Endelman says of Zheng. “He has a really, really nice way about him. I actually love his sense of humor. He has a way of busting my chops a little bit, and the other guys on the team. I just like how he's got kind of a quiet confidence and composure, and how respectful he is to everyone.”The trajectory seems even more impressive when considering the push and pull of being on court and in the classroom at an Ivy League school. Yet for Zheng, the challenge of the workload and finding time management solutions served as the impetus to continually scale new heights.“I think an underrated aspect is academics. People think it's super hard, but I think it actually makes you better, I think, when you have to kind of balance everything together at the same time,” he says. “It's when you're traveling for these events, you have so much downtime, so something to take your mind off the tennis, I think, just helps you perform better on court.”

A psychology major on track to graduate next spring, Zheng enjoys playing poker in his spare time. “I think it's a fun game, just training the mental side,” he says.The exercise has seemingly rubbed off. Beginning 2025 outside of the ATP's Top 750, the rising senior finds himself ranked No. 181 as the No. 7 seed at this week's $160,000 MarketBeat Open in Sioux Falls, S.D, which is part of the USTA's Australian Open Wild Card Challenge series. It's a position that will allow him to test the waters in Grand Slam qualifying for the first time outside of the U.S. at the beginning of next year, and should he maintain his run of form on the Challenger scene over the next month, a Melbourne main-draw wild card awaits as possible icing on the cake.“I would say I was surprised, for sure, that it happened so fast. I knew the level was there, but at the same time, I feel like at these events, all the players are so good,” he says of the competition.“I think one of the biggest takeaways is just the physicality. A lot of people don't really see the week in, week out grind. A lot of these players are doing three, four, five, six weeks in a row on the road. You have to be there physically and mentally.”

it just kind of hit me what it had taken for Michael's parents, May and Joe, to come to the US from a small village in mainland China and create this incredible family. Howard Endelman

By this point, nothing Zheng accomplishes surprises Endelman. Emotions trickle into his voice when thinking about sharing this chapter together, one where Zheng's historic NCAA title came weeks after Endelman lost his father. The value of remembering one's roots is clear to the college coach, who won't limit Zheng's potential ceiling when the time comes to fly the nest for good.“The sacrifices that this family had to make to give Michael the chance to even have the opportunity to compete at this level, it's just astounding. They're just very special, kind, compassionate, unselfish, and caring people,” he states.“Then to his credit, Michael's just quietly gone out and does his work every day. He doesn't make a big scene. He won the NCAAs. He's a three-time All-American already and also was an academic All-American this past year. And he won the Rafael Osuna National Sportsmanship Award. I don't think that triple crown has ever happened. So he's just a really impressive young man, and he's made all of us at Columbia University incredibly proud.”When asked to sum up a personal scouting report, Zheng responds, “I don't try to overplay too much, but when chances come, I take them.”As one might say in those key moments, he's all in.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

The United States Grand Prix was jam-packed with more than just racing. From drivers playing dress up and exploring new talents to special edition helmets and stars in the paddock – we won't be forgetting this weekend in a hurry.

Austin never disappoints. With cowboy hats, star-studded guests and a paddock full of Texan flair, the 2025 United States Grand Prix weekend was as lively off the track as it was on it during this bumper Sprint weekend.

From drivers embracing their inner cowboys to Hollywood A-listers and record-breaking athletes lighting up the paddock, here are some of the standout moments you might have missed at the Circuit of The Americas – yeehaw!

Each year when Formula 1 heads to COTA, you can always count on the grid to get into the spirit. Again, this year the drivers went all in – cowboy hats, BBQ, dirt bikes and all the frills. When F1's resident cowboy, Daniel Ricciardo, left the grid, some wondered who would carry the Texan torch in the paddock and keep the magic alive. But it turns out plenty of the current crop have happily stepped into the boots.

With an allergy previously keeping him away, Lewis Hamilton was able to swap his horsepower for the real thing, trying out horse riding for the very first time (and mind you – he looked impressively at home in the saddle).

Championship leader Oscar Piastri kept it relaxed and made sure to sample some proper Texas barbecue, the Aussie suggesting that he “could get used to Austin”, while Lando Norris took a more on-brand high-energy approach, jumping in a Hoonitruck and hopping on dirt bikes for some pre-weekend fun.

By Thursday, the paddock was already starting to look like a rodeo, with some of the drivers even heading out to local boot stores to complete their cowboy transformations. Liam Lawson proudly showed off his new cowboy gear entering the paddock, as did Pierre Gasly – both nailing the Western look like they'd been locals all along!

However, there was one member of the paddock who took to the Austin vibe like a duck to water... little Leo Leclerc stole the show yet again!

Yuki Tsunoda had a little company for his pre-race weekend warm-up as he dropped into a nearby F45 gym to join – and at times lead – a workout class. Vibes were high, smiles all round, and being a motivator is clearly another addition to Tsunoda's growing list of talents.

Let's just hope it wasn't an early-morning session – after all, Tsunoda's previously admitted that early morning workouts can ruin his day! Clearly, though, this one worked a treat, as the Red Bull driver went on to score points in both the Sprint and the Grand Prix.

Everything's bigger in Texas, including the COTA guest list. The United States Grand Prix once again brought out a glittering mix of stars from music, film and sport.

Actors Glen Powell and Matthew McConaughey returned to their home state and spent much of the weekend trackside mixing it with the drivers and teams, while Chase Crawford spent his time with Red Bull, and Adele had a blast in the Mercedes garage.

They weren't the only famous faces either, as plenty of athletes swarmed into the paddock – Olympic swimmer and record holder Leon Marchand, World Champion decathlete Leo Neugebauer, and track and field power couple Tara Davis-Woodhall and Hunter Woodhall were all spotted soaking up the atmosphere and presenting the podium sitters with their trophies after the Sprint.

Country music had its moment too, as it took centre stage over the course of the weekend. Drake Milligan kicked off the inaugural Grid Gigs with a performance of his hits, and rising star Shaboozey had the honour of waving the chequered flag as the drivers concluded their race. Meanwhile, Warren Zeiders and Kane Brown were spotted enjoying the weekend, wandering round the paddock and in and out of garages.

When it comes to one-off helmet design, the US Grand Prix always inspires something special – and this weekend continued the trend. Plenty of teams unveiled one-off liveries and race suits to mark the occasion, but some drivers – especially the McLaren duo – two-stepped even further.

Norris went for a playful twist on a beloved American sport, showing off a bright and bold football jersey-themed design that quickly became a fan favourite. Piastri kept things cool with a circuit board-inspired lid, nodding to both McLaren's tech sponsors and Austin's 'Silicon Hills' hub.

And for Haas, their home race called for something special, as Ollie Bearman ran with a bold, stars-and-stripes design that made him easy to spot for the plenty of home-team fans as he held onto a fantastic points position.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

Racing Bulls endured one of it's more difficult weekends of the 2025 Formula 1 season at the Circuit of The Americas, with neither Liam Lawson nor Isack Hadjar scoring.

Liam Lawson was left frustrated after narrowly missing out on points to Fernando Alonso at the United States Grand Prix – and reckons one particular moment may have cost him his chance of scoring.

Lawson has scored points on just one occasion across the last five weekends, and came agonisingly close to adding to his tally on Sunday.

Battling with Alonso throughout, he was also forced to pay close attention to the second Aston Martin of Lance Stroll, who recovered from 19th place, after a five-place grid penalty, to finish 12th. Lawson finished just one place ahead of Stroll in 11th.

“The start was not amazing,” reflected the Racing Bulls driver. “I just got boxed at Turn 1 and lost a place, which in the end is probably what has cost us a point. But overall, we weren't really quick enough, to be honest.

“It's very hard to overtake, and Aston had us basically one in front and one behind today; they basically had control of us, which was frustrating. I just couldn't overtake Fernando, and was having to defend from behind, so a frustrating race.”

Asked if it was a weekend of missed opportunities, Lawson added: “I think we had points available all weekend that we've missed out on, so it's pretty frustrating.”

It was a similar story for Isack Hadjar. After a crash in Qualifying saw him start from the back of the pack, the Frenchman started with hard tyres fitted, in a bid to gain positions should an early accident occur, as it had in the Sprint. But it didn't come together and Hadjar eventually finished in 16th, with the highlight of his race being a battle with Pierre Gasly in the final stages.

“This weekend, I haven't shown real pace, and my confidence in the car is not great, so we were not very competitive,” he said afterwards.

“Obviously, the strategy was betting on a long first stint and hoping for a Safety Car, but it was a very clean race, apparently. Just a very boring race. At least I had fun with Pierre at the end.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

Fernando Alonso may have scored a point at the United States Grand Prix, but he was left wanting answers after the weekend saw another gradual decline in pace from Aston Martin.

Fernando Alonso joked about his relief that the United States Grand Prix weekend lasted only three days, after Aston Martin slid gradually down the order across each day of running.

Alonso was fourth quickest in first practice, and then sixth in Sprint Qualifying. He was unable to show his pace in the Saturday Sprint after involved in a collision at the first corner, and was then 10th in Qualifying for the Grand Prix itself – which is also where he finished on race day.

“In Qualifying, we were stronger for sure than in race pace,” the Spaniard said after the Grand Prix. “It has happened a few times already this year that on Friday we are very fast, on Saturday we half fast, and then on Sunday, we are struggling more. It's good that it is only three days, the weekend. If not, on Monday we would be even worse!

“We need to understand why and we need to build the momentum in the last five races step-by-step and arrive in a strong position for Sunday.”

He added: “It was good to score one point, obviously, but I don't know... we didn't have the pace. We were slow in the race. We held the position, and even with two DNFs in front of us with the Williams and the Mercedes [Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli], we still only finished 10th, starting 10th.

“We need to find a little pace for Mexico.""

Neither Aston Martin driver saw the chequered flag in the weekend's Sprint, with Alonso involved in the opening lap mayhem that also saw both McLaren drivers retire, while Lance Stroll crashed into Esteban Ocon while attempting a bold overtaking move at Turn 1 late in the race. For that transgression, the Canadian was handed a five-place grid penalty and started the Grand Prix from 19th.

Of his more successful Sunday outing, in which he made up a host of places to finish 12th – Stroll said: “It was a fun race, attacking all race, and some good overtakes, so that was fun. We were close to getting points. We did the best we could, and it was going to be tricky from where we were starting.

“We made our way through and picked up some positions. The car was feeling good today, so we'll see what we can do in Mexico.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

""I think we had the necessary pace in the car to finish on the podium,"" insisted Wolff.

Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff has called on the team to deliver a better result next weekend in Mexico after what he called a ""disappointing"" showing in the US Grand Prix in Austin.

Kimi Antonelli and George Russell both scored in Saturday's Sprint, but in Sunday's Grand Prix, things unravelled for Mercedes at an early stage. Russell started fourth but got squeezed by both Oscar Piastri and Lewis Hamilton at the start, and dropped behind those two.

From there he tried to close back up, but did not have the pace to challenge and had to settle for sixth at the flag. Antonelli meanwhile finished 13th after being tipped into a spin early in the race.

“The push that we are having back home at Brixworth and Brackley is enormous, and that's why it is disappointing that we are not able to monetise on the good car at the moment,” explained Wolff after the race.

“Not every race can be a classic and that was the case today. There were small pace differences between the top cars today and that, along with the challenge of managing surface tyre temperatures when following closely, made overtaking almost impossible.

“Unfortunately for us, George lost two positions at Turn 1 and dropped to P6. Kimi was spun around early in the race meanwhile, so we were always playing catch up. I think we had the necessary pace in the car to finish on the podium but once you are behind, there was no chance to pass.”

Antonelli's race was compromised when he was tagged into a spin by Carlos Sainz, who tried to send one up the inside of Turn 1 and wound up locking up and running into the Mercedes ahead.

“[It was a] tricky start, obviously Kimi was taken out by Sainz and the race afterwards wasn't good so yeah it is a shame,” added Wolff about the teenager's afternoon.

Antonelli had looked in the mix for much of the weekend, but once he had had his trip through the gravel, he dropped to last and was unable to make his way back to the points. As such, Mercedes saw their lead over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship cut to just seven points.

“We've got another race next week in Mexico and we will be looking to perform more like we did in Singapore than we have here in Austin. Both Ferrari and Red Bull have regained ground on us in the Constructors' today, so it's important we put in a stronger performance in Mexico City,” Wolff concluded.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

Mark Hughes and illustrator Giorgio Piola explain how Red Bull have been able to come back fighting with their RB21 at recent Grands Prix.

Max Verstappen's United States Grand Prix victory was his third in four weekends. In the five races since the summer break he has not finished outside the top two, and his championship hopes – which looked to be all over – suddenly have new life. So how have Red Bull done it?

The RB21 has come alive in the second half of the season, with a series of updates based around a new front wing and new underfloor.

The front wing, with its generous flap area, is believed to have been made more aero-elastic than the previous one while still respecting the revised static load test limits in place since the Spanish Grand Prix in May.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

A number of junior, test and reserve drivers will be stepping up to participate in Free Practice 1 at the Mexico City Grand Prix.

A total of eight rookie drivers will be in action during Friday's first practice session at the Mexico City Grand Prix, with McLaren, Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull, Williams, Haas, Alpine and Aston Martin all making line-up changes for FP1.

Under F1's regulations, every full-time driver is required to make way for a rookie – viewed as someone who has started no more than two Grands Prix – in two practice sessions across the 2025 season, an increase on the one mandated last year.

The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez has previously been a popular choice for these outings, with five rookies participating in the opening practice hour at last year's event – including one who will make their return this time around...

McLaren reserve driver Pato O'Ward will again get behind the wheel at his home event for the second year running.

The Mexican – who finished the 2025 NTT INDYCAR SERIES as runner-up for Arrow McLaren at the end of the summer – was confirmed to drive one of the squad's MCL39 machines at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez back in May.

As well as gaining valuable track time during the weekend, 26-year-old O'Ward will provide set-up feedback and support for full-time drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Replacing George Russell at Mercedes during FP1 will be Fred Vesti, with the squad's test and reserve driver set to make his fourth practice appearance for the Silver Arrows.

Vesti previously made his F1 weekend debut in Mexico back in 2023, before another outing followed later that year in Abu Dhabi. While Kimi Antonelli fulfilled the team's rookie running in 2024, Vesti returned to action this season for FP1 in Bahrain.

Alongside his simulator duties for Mercedes, the 23-year-old Dane has been competing in the IMSA Sportscar series this year and recently claimed back-to-back victories in the category.

Over at Ferrari, Antonio Fuoco will be making his maiden practice outing in Mexico City. The Italian is set to replace Lewis Hamilton as he gets behind the wheel of the SF-25.

As well as acting as a development driver for the team, 29-year-old Fuoco races in the World Endurance Championship for Ferrari AF Corse and was previously part of the team to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2024.

Fuoco has taken part in F1 testing sessions for the Scuderia in the past, including an appearance at last year's end-of-season test in Abu Dhabi.

F2 racer Arvid Lindblad will participate in his second FP1 session for Red Bull at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, having previously driven the RB21 during the British Grand Prix weekend in July.

While he replaced Yuki Tsunoda on that occasion, the British driver will step in for Max Verstappen this time around.

With two rounds remaining in the 2025 Formula 2 campaign, 18-year-old Lindblad currently sits in seventh place of the Drivers' Championship, with three podiums – including two wins – to his name so far.

Carlos Sainz is set to hand his Williams FW47 over to Luke Browning for the first practice session of the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend.

This will be 23-year-old Browning's third FP1 outing, the Briton having previously gotten behind the wheel in Bahrain earlier this year as well as at the 2024 season finale in Abu Dhabi.

Like Lindblad, Browning – a member of the Williams Racing Driver Academy – is currently racing in Formula 2, where he holds P3 in the Drivers' standings.

Aston Martin Young Driver Jak Crawford will be in action for the team during Free Practice 1, marking the 20-year-old's debut F1 weekend appearance.

Crawford is set to drive Lance Stroll's AMR25 for the session and arrives into the event with plenty of mileage for the squad under his belt, having logged more than 2,000km of testing in the AMR22, AMR23 and AMR24 cars.

The American racer has clinched four wins so far during the 2025 Formula 2 campaign, putting him in second place of the Drivers' Championship.

At Haas, Ollie Bearman is sitting out FP1 while reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa makes his fourth practice outing of the season.

After starting the season as part of the Alpine stable – during which time he participated in first practice for the Enstone-based outfit at Suzuka – Hirakawa joined Haas in April, with the Japanese racer going on to make FP1 appearances for the American squad in Bahrain and Barcelona.

It will not be 31-year-old Hirakawa's final showing of the campaign, either, as he will also be in action during the opening practice hour at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

And finally, Paul Aron will be driving the Alpine A525 in first practice in Mexico.

The Estonian, who was third in the F2 championship last year, will take Pierre Gasly's car for the session.

It will be 21-year-old Aron's fourth FP1 appearance of the year, after he drove for Sauber at Silverstone and the Hungaroring, and in Monza for Alpine.

This weekend's outing could be crucial for Aron who, according to team boss Flavio Briatore, is in contention to take the second race seat alongside Gasly for next year.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Max outmuscles the McLarens in Austin

Iconic Mika Hakkinen onboards 

Nico Hulkenberg scored his first points since Silverstone on race day at the Circuit of The Americas.

Nico Hulkenberg conceded that Sauber's strong show of pace at the United States Grand Prix was “unexpected”.

Hulkenberg was the surprise story in Sprint Qualifying, as he positioned his Sauber in fourth place. But he was unable to translate this into points, after a collision with Oscar Piastri at Turn 1.

While Qualifying for the Grand Prix yielded a more familiar result, the German climbed to eighth place on Sunday, returning the shine to his weekend.

“It was a tough day on Saturday, kind of a low blow with that Turn 1 incident,” said Hulkenberg. “That was disappointing. So we were determined to bounce back in the race.”

Reflecting on two places gained through contact between Carlos Sainz and Kimi Antonelli, he added: “Obviously, we had a bit of help from Carlos to get a little bit more than 10th, but we had good race pace.

“I think it was a clean race, clean execution, so I'm happy after all.”

Asked how much personal encouragement he takes from an overall strong weekend, he said: “I think it's always case-by-case, weekend-by-weekend case.

""It was a little bit unexpected to be so competitive here, so, to be honest, I'm not quite sure what to expect in Mexico. It's a very different track, very different challenges there, so I don't know.

“I don't want to make any predictions. I'll just let myself surprise myself with how it feels on Friday when we roll out.”

In the sister Sauber, Gabriel Bortoleto finished in 18th place after early contact with Alex Albon at the first corner on Lap 1.

“I was fighting with the car ahead and he touched my rear axle and he spun, so I don't really know what happened there,” said the Brazilian.

“The race was quite boring,"" he added: “When you are starting at the back, it's difficult to make your way up, especially when you are a bit stuck behind other cars and it's quite difficult to overtake. There's a lot of high speed sections here, and when you get to the straight line, you've already cooked your tyres.

“Unless you have a very big advantage – that I didn't have today – it's quite difficult to overtake.”

The actor claimed that Lucasfilm initially ""loved the idea"" for the Steven Soderbergh-directed sequel, which would have taken place after 2019's 'The Rise of Skywalker.'


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Adam Driver has revealed that Disney shot down a Star Wars sequel centered on Ben Solo, despite Lucasfilm being on board.


	The Oscar-nominated actor, who played the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa and the grandson of Anakin Skywalker (aka Darth Vader), and later turned into the villain Kylo Ren, recently detailed the sequel idea during an interview with The Associated Press.




	“I always was interested in doing another Star Wars,” Driver said. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. Kathleen [Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm] had reached out. I always said: With a great director and a great story, I'd be there in a second. I loved that character and loved playing him.”

	The Megalopolis actor said he eventually took his idea to filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, adding that the film would have taken place after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker. (Driver also starred in 2015's The Force Awakens and 2017's The Last Jedi.)


	After Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt outlined a story concept, they tapped Scott Z. Burns to write a script, which Driver described as “one of the coolest (expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.”


	The House of Gucci star continued, “We presented the script to Lucasfilm. They loved the idea. They totally understood our angle and why we were doing it.”


	While everything seemed to be moving full steam ahead at that point, there were a few more people Driver needed on board for the film, which was tentatively titled The Hunt for Ben Solo, to fully come to life. However, things didn't go to plan once they presented it to Disney execs.

	











	“We took it to Bob Iger and Alan Bergman and they said no. They didn't see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that,” Driver recalled. His character Kylo Ren has a redemption arc across the trilogy and ultimately dies at the end of The Rise of Skywalker.


	He added that though the sequel idea “was really cool,” he noted, “It is no more, so I can finally talk about it.”


	Soderbergh also wrote in a statement to The Associated Press, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I'm just sorry the fans won't get to see it.”


The Hollywood Reporter reached out to Lucasfilm, but they declined to comment.

The Kansas City Chiefs star has joined Jana Partners in pushing for an overhaul of the theme park giant.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Kansas City Chiefs star (and Taylor Swift's fiancé) Travis Kelce is getting into the activist investing business.


	The NFL athlete, podcast host and burgeoning actor joined the activist investment firm Jana Partners in a bid to seek an overhaul of Six Flags, the theme park company that owns Knott's Berry Farm, Cedar Point and Six Flags amusement parks across the country.




	Jana disclosed that it now holds approximately 9 percent of Six Flags shares, alongside Kelce, former Gap CEO Glenn Murphy and tech executive and former J.D. Power CEO Dave Habiger. The firm says it plans “to engage with the company's board of directors and management regarding opportunities to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience.”

	“I am a lifelong Six Flags fan and grew up going to these parks with my family and friends,” said Travis Kelce in a statement. “The chance to help make Six Flags special for the next generation is one I couldn't pass up.”

	Kelce grew up in Ohio, not far from Cedar Point.


	“We look forward to working with the Six Flags board and management to unlock shareholder value for the benefit of all stakeholders,” added Jana managing partner Scott Ostfeld.


	The current iteration of Six Flags was created last year in an $8 billion merger between Six Flags and Cedar Fair, creating a theme park behemoth that spans the country.

	











	Kelce may seem like an unusual choice for an activist campaign, but generating attention in today's investing environment is half the battle, and the star might be able to get shareholders to buy in and perhaps Six Flags executives or board members. Kelce could also become a public face of the effort.

The petitioner's reasoning includes an effort to make the halftime show ""family-friendly"" and keep  politics out of the event.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	A week after Texas native Kar Shell posted a Change.org petition calling for Lone Star legend George Strait to replace Bad Bunny as the halftime performer at February's Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. the effort had more than 54,000 signatures at press time.


	“George Strait, known as the ‘King of Country,' embodies the heart and soul of American music,” reads the petition, which notes that the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the most-watched music events on TV every year. “The 2026 Super Bowl offers a unique opportunity to pay tribute to American music's rich heritage by featuring George Strait in its halftime show. His performances are known for their authenticity and raw emotion, qualities that are crucial as we aim to unite fans from coast to coast,” it continues. 

	











	Of course, Strait, 73, is not booked to play the game, which is why the petitioner asked the NFL and the show's talent team — Jay-Z's Roc Nation — to honor “American music heritage” by replacing the Puerto Rican native with Strait, who, it says, “embodies unity, tradition, and the timeless American music that truly deserves the 2026 Super Bowl spotlight.”


	In a clarifying message from Shell, the petitioner says the effort is aimed at keeping the Super Bowl “family-friendly,” arguing that after recent performances it says “crossed the line” with imagery or themes not appropriate for children, the show should return to being a “unifying event centered on talent, energy and good music — not shock value or adult themes.”

	











	It also says it wants to “keep politics out of the halftime show,” arguing that the game is meant to bring people “across all backgrounds and beliefs” together while avoiding messages that alienates fans for their “views, culture or language.” It cites Benito's joke during a recent Saturday Night Live hosting stint warning viewers to brush up on their Spanish because his set will be entirely in his native Spanish, adding that 78% of Americans speak only English and that music should “bridge differences — not highlight them.” 


	The final clarification is an argument that country music has been underrepresented on the halftime stage, swiping aside claims that Strait is “too old,” “boring” or wouldn't want the gig while suggesting other potential replacements such as Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Dierks Bentley, Kenny Chensey or Dolly Parton. 


	While 54,000 signatures is decent for a change petition, by comparison, a Sept. 24 bid to urge the UN to protect Indian Muslims has racked up more than 1.2 million signatures in less than a month, while a 2019 plea to renew the Netflix series Anne With an E for a fourth season has nearly 1.8 million.


	Though the petition appears to be a plea to keep the halftime show about the music, and not politics, a number of MAGA universe players — including Donald Trump — have weighed in with highly partisan takes on Bad Bunny's booking. Earlier this month, one of Trump's Department of Homeland Security advisers, former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, said on a conservative podcast that ICE troops will be on the ground at the game in search of people to deport as part of the administration's widespread deportation efforts.

	











	“There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally,” Lewandowski said. “Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else. We will find you and apprehend you and put you in a detention facility and deport you.” Those comments came just three days after Benito was announced as this year's performer. The booking made even more news in light of the fact that the rapper previously stated that he did not perform in the U.S. on his more recent tour over fears of  immigrations officers possibly targeting his fans.


	While Lewandowski called the Benito pick “shameful,” claiming that the wildly popular performer from the island nation that is a U.S. territory “hates America” and arguing that “we should be trying to be inclusive, not exclusive,” President Trump claimed not to know the Latin icon — dismissively referring to him as “Bad Bunny Rabbit” in an interview — and called the choice “absolutely ridiculous.” 


	In the midst of the nearly monthlong U.S. government shutdown, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson took time out earlier this month to say that tapping Bad Bunny was a “terrible decision,” slamming the rapper as someone who doesn't appeal “to a broader audience.” For context, Benito  holds records as the first Latin artist to have 100 career Billboard Hot 100 songs, as well as earning the first all-Spanish album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart (2020's El Ultimo Tour Del Mundo). He has also tied Taylor Swift for having the most No. 1s on the Billboard Global 200 of any solo artist.


	In a testament to the right's anger about the halftime show, the Charlie Kirk-founded right-wing political action group Turning Point USA announced that it plans to hold an alternate concert featuring “anything in English” it has dubbed the All American Halftime Show celebrating “faith, family and freedom”; at press time no performers had been announced. 

	











	While a number of other networks and organizations have tried to siphon off some of the Super Bowl's massive audience over the years with cheeky competing events such as the Puppy Bowl and Lingerie Bowl, a Super Smash Bros. tournament or WWE halftime wrestling matches, the Turning Point show, if it happens, would be one of the first attempts to directly counter-program the halftime show out of pique over the optics of its performer.


	Though the right appears quite spun up about the choice, Bad Bunny, who has racked up nearly 80 million Spotify listeners over his carer and was ranked as the most streamed artist on the service three years running (2020-2022), has gotten plenty of love and support from a number of fellow artists. Among those voicing loud and proud support for the pic are Jennifer Lopez, Carlos Santana and country star Shaboozey, who said he thinks it's “awesome… he's a global superstar, global icon — and an American citizen. There's no better choice.”


	Super Bowl LX will air on Feb. 8 at 6:30 p.m. and be broadcast on NBC and Telemundo and stream on Peacock and NFL+.

The track realized ""her lifelong dream of recording an original song,"" said its producer and co-writer.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



	Beloved actress Diane Keaton, who died on Oct. 11 at age 79, makes her Billboard music chart debut under her own billing this week with her holiday single, “First Christmas.” The track bows at No. 22 on the Digital Song Sales chart (dated Oct. 25).


	Upon the release of the song on Nov. 29, 2024, the Academy Award-winner wrote on her Instagram: “This morning, my heart is filled with gratitude for each and every one of you. The love you've given my debut holiday single, ‘First Christmas,' has been the most beautiful gift I could ever imagine. Your comments, your stories, and the way you've shared your own ‘First Christmas' journeys have touched me deeply. It reminds me of the peace we find in the love and memories we hold close. When we share these together, we are never alone.”

	











	“First Christmas” was written by Grammy Award winners Carole Bayer Sager and Jonas Myrin, and produced by Myrin. After Keaton's passing, Myrin wrote on Instagram: “I'm heartbroken by (Diane Keaton's) passing. To have been trusted to help bring her lifelong dream of recording an original song to life is something I'll carry with me forever.”


	In “First Christmas,” Keaton sings in its chorus, “The snow falls on my window, I wish that I could let go, it's a silent night, it's another year, the first Christmas without you here.”

	











	Before “First Christmas” brought Keaton to a Billboard music chart as a solo vocalist, she appeared on Billboard's now-defunct film charts from the 1980s through the 2000s; the lists tracked the top films being sold and rented in the United States on home video.


	Although Keaton was best known as a four-time Oscar-nominated actress on the big screen, she had her hand in some iconic music and chart moments since the late ‘60s. In 1968, she was in the original Broadway cast of the musical Hair, and performed on its cast album. Marking her first contribution to a No. 1 title, the set topped the Billboard 200 for 13 weeks in 1969. (Hair remains the most recent cast recording to lead the list.) In 1987, Keaton directed the official music video for Belinda Carlisle's Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Heaven Is a Place on Earth,” and the video for its follow-up single “I Get Weak,” which reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 in 1988. In 1996, Keaton co-starred with Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler in The First Wives Club and the trio memorably closed the film with a performance of Lesley Gore's No. 2-peaking Hot 100 hit from 1964, “You Don't Own Me.”


	In more recent years, Keaton acted in the music video for Justin Bieber's “Ghost” in 2021, a single that reached No. 5 on the Hot 100 that year. In 2023, Keaton went viral on social media when she filmed herself dancing to Miley Cyrus' Hot 100 No. 1 that year, “Flowers,” and later called Cyrus her “favorite artist” of 2023.

Mariah Carey will be honored as the 2026 MusiCares Person of the Year at the organization's annual fundraiser. The event will be held on Friday, Jan. 30 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, two days before the 68th annual Grammy Awards at the adjacent Crypto.com Arena.


	Carey will become the youngest person of the year honoree since Sting received the honor in 2004. She will become the youngest woman to receive the honor since Gloria Estefan, who was just 36 when she received the honor in 1994.

	











	“We are honored to recognize Mariah Carey as this year's MusiCares Person of the Year, a true creative force and once-in-a-generation talent,” Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy and MusiCares, said in a statement. “Her artistry and her voice have helped shape the sound of our times. We look forward to celebrating her remarkable career on this very special night.”


	This will be MusiCares' 35th benefit gala. (The event wasn't held in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.) The gala has raised millions of dollars to support MusiCares' programs, including health and wellness services, addiction recovery, preventive care, disaster relief, and emergency support for music professionals.


	The first Person of the Year gala (honoring David Crosby) was held in 1991, two days before the 33rd annual Grammy Awards ceremony at which Carey won her first two Grammys – best new artist and best pop vocal performance, female for breakthrough smash, “Vision of Love.”

	











	Carey joins a distinguished list of MusiCares honorees. The last five recipients of the award are Aerosmith, Joni Mitchell, Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, Jon Bon Jovi and Grateful Dead.


	Carey's philanthropic works include providing relief for communities impacted by Hurricane Katrina and the COVID-19 pandemic. She founded Camp Mariah in partnership with the Fresh Air Fund to support underserved youth and has championed initiatives advancing health, education and social welfare.


	“Mariah Carey's influence extends far beyond her remarkable artistry,” Theresa Wolters, executive director of MusiCares, said in a statement. “She has used her platform consistently to provide tangible support to communities, whether through disaster relief, youth empowerment, or programs that help those facing barriers to opportunity. Her work exemplifies the values at the heart of MusiCares: creating systems of care that lift people up and ensure music professionals and communities can thrive. Honoring her as Person of the Year celebrates both her incredible musical legacy and her dedication to making a meaningful difference in the lives of others.”


	Carey has received multiple awards in recent years. She was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2022. In February 2024, she received a Global Impact Award from The Recording Academy's Black Music Collective. She received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 7 – and also won her first VMA in competition that night for “Type Dangerous” as best R&B. She has been nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in each of the last two years but has yet to receive that accolade.

	











	Carey has amassed 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, from “Vision of Love” in June 1990 to “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” which logged its most recent appearance at No. 1 in January 2025. That's more No. 1 hits than any other solo artist and is just one shy of the all-time record held by The Beatles. Impressively, she co-wrote 18 of those songs.


	Carey has had six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, from Mariah Carey in March 1991 to E=MC2 in May 2008. She has amassed 19 top 10 albums on that chart, including her current album, Here For It All, which debuted at No. 7 for the week of Oct. 11. Only two women have had more top 10 albums in the history of the chart (since it began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956) – Barbra Streisand (34) and Madonna (23).


	Carey has won five Grammys, including vocal performance honors in both pop and R&B. In 1991, she became just the fifth artist in Grammy history to be nominated in each of the Big Four categories – album, record and song of the year, plus best new artist.


	The MusiCares event includes a cocktail reception, dinner and a tribute concert. Tickets are for sale on the organization's website. Individual tickets range from $3,000 to $7,000. Tables for 12 range from $30,000 to $80,000.


	The event will again be produced by live event broadcast outfit Lewis & Clark, comprised of Joe Lewis and R.A. Clark. Sponsors include AEG and the Wasserman Foundation.

Lea Salama discussed the topic at Billboard Latin Music Week on Oct. 21.

	Immigration attorney Lea A. Salama DiMitri of Behar Law Group joined Billboard's senior editor of Latin, Griselda Flores, during a panel discussion at Billboard Latin Music Week 2025 on Tuesday (Oct. 21). The pair unpacked the increasingly complex realities of immigration policies and visa restrictions for international musicians, particularly the alarming trend of visa revocations among regional Mexican artists and beyond.

	The conversation, which reflected the challenges Latin artists face when navigating U.S. immigration procedures, highlighted the stringent requirements for O and P visas — non-immigrant visas specifically designed for artists, athletes, and entertainers — as well as the growing risks tied to delays and denials. Salama DiMitri, a seasoned immigration attorney, emphasized the difficulty and multilayered process of securing these visas for international performers.


	“Immigration structure is a multi-agency, multistep process. It's not for the faint of heart — it's complex, very daunting. It's not like filling out a tax return; the slightest misstep can lead to a gargantuan process being enforced,” DiMitri explained. “Enforcement is the biggest trend right now.”


	Flores, who has extensively reported on the wave of visa revocations targeting regional Mexican musicians, asked DiMitri to provide insight into musicians performing narcocorridos — songs with themes of organized crime or drug trade — and whether their lyrics might be scrutinized under U.S. national security policies. “For some, singing narcocorridos has resulted in a visa revocation, which can be seen as impeding freedom of speech or expression,” Flores noted. 

	











	DiMitri acknowledged this possibility, elaborating that multiple factors, including an artist's social media activities or perceived political affiliations, can now factor into the visa approval process. “The U.S. Department of State recently began requiring both O and P visa applicants to disclose their social media handles,” she said. “With evolving technology and AI, algorithms analyze people's online presence as part of the vetting process. These measures can be used to assess whether someone's views — or even their artistic content — pose a perceived threat to national security.”


	“For an O-1 visa specifically, applicants must prove ‘extraordinary ability,' which can be demonstrated through national and international acclaim — for instance, if an artist has won a Grammy Award or achieved a significant one-time accomplishment. But even with that level of recognition, there is a discretionary factor,” DiMitri emphasized. “Any minimal violation — whether related to criminal activity, insufficient evidence, or even incomplete itineraries — can be grounds for denial or revocation.”

	With current visa challenges in mind, DiMitri offered sobering advice to her clients. “Minimize international travel. If you leave the U.S. to visit your home country, you increase the risk of being denied re-entry, even if your visa was initially approved. The burden is on the artist to prove their extraordinary ability and ensure compliance on all levels.”


	Spanning more than 30 years, Latin Music Week is the single-most important and largest gathering of Latin artists and industry executives in the world. Latin Music Week coincides with the 2025 Billboard Latin Music Awards, set to air Thursday, Oct. 23, on Telemundo and Peacock, where Bad Bunny will be honored as Top Latin Artist of the 21st Century.

			By Dominic Patten, Ted Johnson 


EXCLUSIVE: It seems Donald Trump won't be springing Sean Combs out of prison any time soon.


After months of consideration of a pardon for his old NYC party pal, the former Apprentice host has pretty much nixed any notion of a commutation or get out of jail card for Diddy, we've learned. While nothing is ever set in stone in Trumpland besides grievance, it looks like POTUS has decided not to do Combs, who was sentenced to four-years in federal prison on October 3, any presidential favors.


	A TMZ story late Monday citing a “high-ranking White House official” claiming the president could free the Marc Agnifilo- and Teny Geragos-represented Combs in the next few days got a swift “zero truth” response from the administration. However, despite the backlash generated by that story from the Fox Corporation-owned outlet, it was actually White House fears of Trump's increasingly volatile MAGA base turning on the president over Diddy getting clemency that put the brakes on things, we hear.

					Ben Stiller Decries The ""Challenging"" Climate For Comedy Under Trump 2.0		
			








	A big concern is the reaction from the MAGA base, something that one source close to the White House predicted would be “catastrophic,” comparing it to the discontent of a number of supporters over the way the Jeffrey Epstein case was handled earlier this year.


	The caveat is the president, prone to make surprise decisions and announcements, could shift in favor of Combs' clemency. 


	“The president, not anonymous sources, is the final decider on pardons and commutations,” a White House official said in response to the TMZ report.

	











	Various figures from the much-accused Combs' inner circle have been seeking a pardon almost since the day the Bad Boy Records founder was arrested in September 2024 on sex-trafficking and RICO charges. The din got more intense as Combs' “freak-offs,” abuse, and sex tapes dominated the trial, which started in May and continued through the summer – even as the likes of Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson and the influential Megyn Kelly argued against Trump giving Combs a pardon.


	What put the case in POTUS' crosshairs — as Deadline has previously reported — was the fact that the presiding judge Arun Subramanian was a Joe Biden appointee and the lead prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was Maurene Comey, the now fired daughter of Trump foe and ex-FBI boss James Comey. An appeal from Combs himself, as revealed by Trump earlier this month, probably didn't hurt, though POTUS has more than once noted his old friend had become very critical of him in the past several years.


	“There was a lot here (in the Combs' case) to draw Trump in and appeal to his love of revenge and giving the middle finger to those he feels wronged him,” an individual close to the case says. “But, it was always going to be a long shot if he would grant the pardon or not.”  


	Representatives for Combs' defense team did not respond to Deadline's request Tuesday on the state of a Trump pardon for their client.


	In the past week or so, a renewed sense of urgency emerged for a possible Combs pardon as the deadline for a legal appeal for the once mogul loomed. On October 20, the Agnifilo and Geragos-led defense filed a notice of appeal in federal court to get the ball started overturning the 50 months behind bars, $500,000 fine and five years of supervised release the currently incarcerated Combs got for being found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.


	Perhaps ever more poignant for the Trump White House was the publication Tuesday of alleged Jeffery Epstein and Prince Andrew victim Virginia Giuffre‘s much excerpted posthumous memoir Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting For Justice book. Sources tell us worries about what the book from former Mar-a-Lago employee Giuffre would say about Trump and Epstein's friendship had ricocheted around an administration. But the bombshells in the book focused on Prince Andrew, who dropped use of his royal titles last week in response. 


	As for Sean Combs, along with the announced appeal, the “All About the Benjamins” performer is seeking to be moved to a cushier prison for his sentence. Presently in a shared cell at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center, where he has been for over a year, Combs has requested to be moved to the lower-security FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey for the remainder of his sentence.


	No decision has been made yet by Judge Arun Subramanian on whether Combs will be moved to Fort Dix or not. However, an October 8 notation on the court docket indicated where this and Combs is going.


	“The Court will recommend a facility in the geographic location of the defense's choosing, but not the specific facility, which is determined by the Bureau of Prisons,” the note says “For that reason, the Court will include the following recommendation, based on the defense's request: ‘The Court recommends that the Defendant be incarcerated as close as possible to the New York metropolitan area, and recommends that the Defendant be considered for admission to any available substance abuse program, including the Bureau of Prisons' Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP), for which he qualifies.'”

Business Editor


Netflix fell short of Wall Street analysts' earnings expectations in the third quarter and said a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities kept operating margins from meeting its guidance.


	Revenue came in on target during the June-to-September period, reaching $11.51 billion.


	Earnings per share of $5.87 on a diluted basis came in more than a dollar shy of analysts' consensus outlook for $6.97.


	In its quarterly letter to shareholders, the company said its operating margin of 28% undershot guidance of 31.5% “due to an expense related to an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities that was not in our forecast. Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q3'25 operating margin forecast. We don't expect this matter to have a material impact on future results.”

	Shares in Netflix slumped on the earnings miss in after-hours trading, falling as much as 7% before stabilizing a bit and remaining in the red. The stock had been on a tear, rising almost 40% in 2025 to date and recently trading above $1,200, close to its all-time high.

Wednesday‘s Season 2 premiere in September drove significant viewership to close out the quarter. The series racked up more than 7 billion viewing minutes during the month, according to Nielsen, more than twice the No. 2 title. 


	The Addams Family spinoff was a key part of Netflix's pitch to advertisers in the upfront, and helped deliver the best ad revenue quarter in the company's history. In the letter, the company said it remains on track to double ad revenue for the full year compared with 2024.

	











	Higher ad revenue, along with price increases and subscriber growth, drove 17% year-over-year revenue growth, the company said.


	A lengthy section of the letter outlined a strikingly optimistic outlook on the impact of AI on the company and its customers. In addition to production, the company said it uses AI and machine learning already to fine-tune its user interface, place relevant ads on shows across its subscriber footprint, localize promotional assets and improve other functions. 


	“Given our significant data assets and at-scale products and business processes, we are very well positioned to effectively leverage ongoing advances in AI,” the letter said. “We believe Generative AI presents a significant opportunity for us to deliver benefits to our members, creators, and business.”


	As Netflix and other major streamers and studios approach another negotiation with above-the-line unions, which are all on edge over AI, Netflix's letter characterized the technology as “empowering” for creators. GenAI tools can “help them achieve their visions and deliver even more impactful titles for members,” it said. “For example, in Happy Gilmore 2, filmmakers used GenAI coupled with ML and Eyeline's proprietary volumetric capture technologies to de-age characters during the opening flashback scene. And the producers of Billionaires' Bunker used various GenAI tools during pre-production, including for pre-visualization to explore wardrobe and set designs.”


	Netflix recently issued guidelines for the use of AI in production, the letter recalled.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sydney Pollack found a New Hollywood comfort zone for Robert Redford","https://www.avclub.com/together-again-robert-redford-sydney-pollack-three-days-of-the-condor-jeremiah-johnson-out-of-africa","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

With Together Again, Jesse Hassenger looks at actors and directors who have worked together on at least three films, analyzing the nature of their collaborations.

First, it was a meme signifying a vaguely masculine form of respectful agreement. (Are you picturing it yet?) Then it was a meme within a meme, the day on social media that someone expressed surprise over the identity of the bearded man nodding as a camera slowly zoomed in on him. (It is not, in fact, Zach Galifianakis.) Then, finally, it was an Academy-ready final goodbye to and from one of the most beloved actors of the past half-century of cinema. (We'll see this spring whether social media has rendered it impossible to use that footage in an actual In Memoriam reel.) But before all of that internet gunk, it was simply a shot of Robert Redford in the wilderness, nodding in approval from about halfway through Jeremiah Johnson, his second movie with Syndey Pollack, his most frequent director. 

Redford's Hollywood rise coincided with one of the most exciting shifts in 20th-century American filmmaking, as the New Hollywood movement pushed aside the lingering big-studio bloat of the 1960s. Redford reflected this in his later life's work as the founder of the Sundance Institute and its accompanying independent film festival—named for his character in 1969's Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, a major work of emerging New Hollywood artistry and a lighter buddy-comedy flipside to Midnight Cowboy, which came out the same year. During the actual 1970s and beyond, though, Redford did not celebrate this artistic revolution by working with Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, Hal Ashby, or Francis Ford Coppola (unless you count a couple of Coppola screenplay credits). He did make two more movies with George Roy Hill, director of Butch Cassidy, as well as one with the satirically minded Michael Ritchie. But for most of the '70s, while the likes of De Niro and Pacino were baring their souls and reinventing movie stardom, Redford was doing Sydney Pollack movies. In the '80s and '90s, when his on-camera appearances became scarcer in the wake of his directorial and Sundance obligations, while an even newer wave of exciting American filmmakers ascended, Pollack movies remained a priority. 

This isn't meant as a knock on Sydney Pollack, mind you. The man made Tootsie; is there a better validation of the journeyman filmmaker than making Tootsie? And, for that matter, Pollack was partially responsible for several of Redford's best, or at least most memorable film roles. Among those, Jeremiah Johnson—their first really well-known collaboration—may be the most authentically New Hollywood of the bunch. Some might understandably point to Three Days Of The Condor, the 1975 film that did much of the heavy lifting in terms of associating Redford with paranoia thrillers of the period, even though Condor and the reality-based All The President's Men are his only real entries in that subgenre. (He made more movies updating that model for later eras—Sneakers, Spy Game, The Company You Keep—than he did at the time.) Moreover, Three Days Of The Condor is great entertainment that would play similarly well in any number of decades.

Jeremiah Johnson, though, is a stranger movie by most measures. The basic story could have been a classic Western, following the title character in a journey through the 19th-century wilderness, his eventual formation of an unexpected makeshift family, and a mission for revenge when that family is harmed. But it's simultaneously not as bold an anti-Western as the previous year's McCabe And Mrs. Miller and not as straightforward as a genre piece that might have come out two decades earlier. Much of the film features Redford quietly, slowly fumbling his way through a barely explained quest for wilderness isolation. It features several old-timey theme-song-like ballads. Despite being under two hours, it features both an overture and an intermission. This was the fifth-biggest U.S. release of 1972. When I watched it as a teenager, I thought it was boring as shit. 

I was wrong, of course. The many ways that Jeremiah Johnson departs from the charm of Butch Cassidy are features, not bugs. Pollack isn't deconstructing Western myths so much as observing, with a clear eye, a man living out a lonelier version of them. The film is therefore attentive to Johnson's hardships without turning them into a visceral endurance test. At the same time, in its semi-austere way, it's also one of Pollack's more stylish movies, from stately wide shots capturing figures in vast expanses of mountain snow to some surprisingly slam-bang moments of action to that famous slow zoom. But that stuff was, at least per Pollack himself, secondary to his facility with actors, owing to starting his career as one himself; he actually met Redford when both men appeared in the film War Hunt in 1962. 

Redford's work in Jeremiah Johnson could be seen as a calculated act of withholding, as he gives a minimalist performance (at least in movie-star terms) that doesn't risk betraying such a handsome man‘s potential ill-suitedness to playing a grizzled mountain man. But Pollack brings out a key element of the Redford style, far more so than in their first film together as director and actor, the Tennessee Williams adaptation This Property Is Condemned. That film came out in 1966, well before Redford's movie-star peak—though he had already been paired once with co-star Natalie Wood in the previous year's Inside Daisy Clover. As a railway man tasked with closing a station in Depression-era Mississippi and a possible beacon of hope for local free spirit Alva (Wood), Redford's trademark keel plays as opaque, even chilly at times. It's part of the character, but the withholding only takes him so far; by the end of the movie, his character remains too inscrutable for much emotion to land. (It doesn't help that the movie's ending is mystifyingly abrupt despite the film running nearly two hours.) Embracing the low-dialogue desolation of Jeremiah Johnson, though, works wonders for Redford, who no longer seems quite so aloof despite saying even less. He makes every decision seem considered and self-determined. He brings a rare quality to the golden-boy leading man: the impression of thinking. This was not a constant feature of, say, Ryan O'Neal, and it makes Redford surprisingly believable in a variety of roles, from mountain men to CIA nerds. 

Still, Redford and Pollack were still clearly attracted to post-cowboy roles, especially as the decade approached its end. Following the more conventionally entertaining Condor and The Way We Were, Redford and Pollack made another sorta-Western with The Electric Horseman, which arguably set a template for their remaining (and less artistically successful) collaborations. The Electric Horseman specifically feels like it could be a minor-key Clint Eastwood vehicle, and also parallels another Altman anti-Western foray, the little-seen Buffalo Bill And The Indians, Or Sitting Bull's History Lesson, where Redford's old partner in crime Paul Newman plays Buffalo Bill as the star of a Wild West show. Redford's Sonny Steele, a more contemporary rodeo performer, has no such ceremony, even in fakeness; once a champion rider, he opens the movie as a drunkard doing half-assed cowboy stunts to promote a breakfast cereal. (His light-up outfit provides the film's title.) In a fit of pique over the mistreatment of a champion horse he's given at a Las Vegas show, he rides the steed straight off stage and out of the venue, embarking on a mission to set the creature free. It also features a bit of It Happened One Night when reporter Hallie Martin (Jane Fonda) winds up going along for the ride.

Redford and Fonda, in their third of four co-starring vehicles, have chemistry, and The Electric Horseman is a minor charmer. It brings Redford back to outdoorsy, quasi-environmental image-making—even if he is playing overtly washed in a way that goes further than usual for his later-period characters, who tend to be slightly diminished rather than hitting bottom—after spending many of his '70s highlights in more urban settings. It also introduces a lopsidedness to Redford romances, which Pollack came to specialize in after The Way We Were. That movie gives equal weight to the tumultuous partners Hubbell (Redford) and Katie (Barbra Streisand), and largely gives the moral upper hand to Streisand, as Katie practices ideals in politics and disappointment in her WASPy paramour, who prefers an easier, breezier lifestyle. In general, Pollack and Redford's movies seem to work best when some larger force exerts itself upon the star, whether it's nature in Jeremiah Johnson, conspiracy in Three Days Of The Condor, or bittersweet romance in The Way We Were. 

In The Electric Horseman and Out Of Africa, Pollack pairs Redford with a powerhouse actress, just as he did in The Way We Were. But that Eastwoodian sensibility, which very much carries over into the Oscar-winning Out Of Africa, has more than a hint of movie-star vanity, too. Jeremiah Johnson's rugged individuality holds hints of private anguish or compulsion, amplified by the distance with which he's sometimes observed. When he returns to the site where he's just slaughtered several members of the tribe responsible for his makeshift family's death, he lies down on the ground in sorrow, and Pollack's camera pulls away, rather than getting in close. It's a counterintuitive choice for such an actor-friendly director, and it works beautifully. Denys, Redford's Out Of Africa character, arguably lives with greater moral dubiousness. He's a quasi-respectful big-game hunter in British-controlled East Africa who eventually gets involved with aristocratic farmer Karen Dinesen (Meryl Streep), and the latter is the movie's main concern; the film scarcely seems interested in any tension between the character's love of Africa and his colonialist position, despite 70 years of hindsight. 

Out Of Africa nonetheless won Sydney Pollack a Best Director Oscar, five years after Redford won one for Ordinary People. It's notable that unlike Eastwood, Redford's earliest attempts at directing did not include himself as an actor—and when he did finally turn the camera on himself, it resulted in the soft-focus self-mythologizing nightmare of The Horse Whisperer. So maybe Pollack was actually keeping Out Of Africa in check, even if the movie now feels like an awfully long walk through Nairobi. Streep and Redford are good together, and Out Of Africa has an old-fashioned sweep that must have felt a throwback even in its original 1985 release, now 40 years ago. At the same time, that Redford deliberateness isn't mitigated by the elemental immediacy of Jeremiah Johnson, the urgency of Condor‘s plotting, or the nuanced character dynamics of The Way We Were. The movie's reputation is propped up by typically detailed work from Streep, some amazing location cinematography, and the fact that it's not Havana, the final Redford/Pollack film, released five years later.

In Havana, Redford plays a professional gambler in late-'50s Cuba whose apolitical, self-interested stance is challenged by his romantic interest in the wife (Lena Olin) of a revolutionary leader. Sound familiar, as time goes by? Havana‘s blatant modeling on Casablanca keeps it from immediately scanning as another alt-Eastwood vehicle, but it's somewhere in that vicinity—specifically in its pokiness. A movie with a semi-doomed love story, revolution in the air, and several explosions somehow feels like the characters are mostly waiting around for a card game to start, then vaguely impatient for it to end. Watch the movie, and you'll know how they feel. Havana has great atmosphere, often gorgeous cinematography that gives Pollack a chance to add some noir shades to his palette, and a punishingly slow pace that eventually resembles a trek through beautifully shot mud. On paper, it's not wildly different from Out Of Africa; for that matter, Redford's character in Havana is arguably better-suited to his age and skillset, and less self-flattering. But Lena Olin, through no fault of her own, isn't exactly Meryl Streep or Jane Fonda, and Pollack's later-period tendency to keep Redford's well-judged reticence centerstage backfires. The whole movie feels like it's thinking, and possibly stalling. 

Havana also muddles its time periods: set in the 1950s, with a plot out of the 1940s, bloated in a way that recalls those last gasps of 1960s big-studio productions, and released in 1990. Sneakers‘ bouncy caper must have felt even more refreshing in 1992 to anyone who had recently sat through this one; it's a confident merging of early-'90s tech, late-'60s history, and Redford's '70s heyday. For that matter, Pollack made at least one decent late-period thriller, too: The Interpreter, 15 years after Havana, maintains an old-fashioned tension the Redford movie lacks. 

Redford, meanwhile, proceeded to star in his share of tedium, like Horse Whisperer and Indecent Proposal. That is to say his taste in romantic dramas bent toward a lacquered, soft-focus, borderline tacky sensibility. For all his appreciation of artistic independence, Redford took comfort in the old-fashioned, perhaps even more than Pollack. Today, their first film together, This Property Is Condemned, plays like a transmission from an alternate universe where Redford became a big star a decade and change earlier, when he might have made a decidedly different set of movies with different co-stars—and maybe would have been left behind by the changes of the '70s. On Pollack's side, though, the filmmaking has younger-man energy, as if it's itching to jump forward a few years when this kind of theatrical melodrama might go a little further in content or style. It's a movie that feels nothing like Havana, but they bookend the Redford/Pollack partnership by feeling unstuck in time. 

Their '70s films, on the other hand, feel perfectly timed; even Electric Horseman, which isn't as good as their other three collaborations from that decade, makes sense as a product of 1979. Jeremiah Johnson, The Way We Were, and Three Days Of The Condor aren't as galvanizing as the movies Scorsese, Coppola, or Altman were making around the same time. In retrospect, Redford excelled at making '70s versions of well-worn crowd-pleasing types: the romance, the thriller, the Western. As he grew older, he excelled at playing characters reflecting on their checkered choices. It's easy to picture several of his later self-directed vehicles, like Lions For Lambs or The Company You Keep, working better with Pollack at the helm. As is, the pair's last few movies together were more of an awkward transitional phase where they both seemed too in thrall of Redford's famous persona. But Pollack, that ultimate actor's director, preserved his favorite leading man through an unpredictable decade, making the most of what could have been a movie-star wilderness.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Former ‘Today' Host Bryant Gumbel Hospitalized","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/former-today-host-bryant-gumbel-hospitalized/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 20:10:29 GMT","

“Today” has been home to several hosts over the course of its long run on NBC. One of the most revered is Bryant Gumbel, who joined the long-running series in 1982 and left in 1997. Now, it has been reported that the beloved host was recently rushed to the hospital. 

Sources told TMZ that this happened on the night of October 20. Gumbel was picked up by an ambulance from his Manhattan apartment complex at around 9 pm. They took him to a nearby hospital, and he remains in their care.

The report also states that the first responders carried him away on a gurney. Details regarding what happened to the beloved 77-year-old “Today” host. However, TMZ has heard from a family member who stated that he's doing “okay.”

For many, being a cohost on “Today” is a dream come true. Of course, this was also the case for Gumbel for 15 years as he hosted alongside Jane Pauley, Deborah Norville, and Katie Couric. However, by 1997, he was ready for a more challenging role. 

This led him to sign with CBS the same year he exited “Today.” He hosted multiple shows while on the NBC competitor, including “Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel” and “The Early Show.” Of course, many will recall him from his time on “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel,” which started while he was on “Today” in 1995. The series lasted until 2023 on HBO. 

After “Real Sports” ended, Gumbel essentially retired, stating he was not in the market for new projects. Regarding his personal life, he has been married to Hilary Gumbel since 2002. He was previously married to June Baranco from 1973 until 2001. 

Gumbel was interviewed by CBS in 2023 and discussed his plans and retirement. Notably, the conversation was with Pauley, his longtime “Today” cohost. Regarding “Real Sports” ending, Gumbel said, “I'm OK with that. I'm at peace with it.”

Regarding his future and if he would ever take on new projects, Gumbel said, “Only a fool says ‘never.' So, I would never say never again, but I'm not actively looking for another chapter; I'm really not.”

From there, Gumbel was asked about what he would have done in his fantasy life. Specifically, Pauley asked if he would have played in a band or perhaps been a golfer. 

He stated, “No. You know what? This is going to sound very Pollyannaish: I've kind of lived my fantasy life. I really have. … And if you had told me when I was in high school in Chicago, what I would do with my life, I would've said, I'll sign up for that in a heartbeat. That's my fantasy life, and I'm okay with it.”

We wish Mr. Gumbel a speedy recovery! 

The Chi Lites Offers Our Sincere Condulances To Bryant Gumbel,
May He Have A Speedy Full Healthy Recovery!

May you have a blessed recovery and have a wonderful rest of your life great guy🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

A beloved American star has revealed that she once had flings with two of the biggest names in showbusiness. Actress, singer, and former model Cybill Shepherd, 75 — the star of movies like 1976's ‘Taxi Driver' and television shows like ‘Psych' — spilled the beans on the relationships on Friday, October 17, at the Catalina Jazz Club in Los Angeles, during An Evening with Cybill Shepherd: Music, Conversation & Stories.

The two stars in question? Actor Don Johnson and the “King of Rock and Roll” himself, Elvis Presley.

Cybill Shepherd explained that her fling with Johnson occurred in 1985, when both stars worked on the made-for-television romantic drama movie ‘The Long Hot Summer' — a remake of the 1958 Martin Ritt film of the same name starring Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Anthony Franciosa and Orson Welles.

Johnson starred in the movie as drifter Ben Quick, while Shepherd had a supporting role as Eula Varner, the daughter of business owner and key character Will Varner.

As per People, Shepherd explained that she and Johnson had no joint screentime, but they still spent time together away from the set.

She said, “Don Johnson and I did not do scenes together, but we did have a lot of fun. No, we didn't do scenes in front of the camera – we messed around behind the camera.”

Shepherd also gave away some behind-the-scenes details, revealing she had targeted a different role in the movie, but was rejected for it for a strange but flattering reason.

She explained, “They said I was too pretty for the Joanne Woodward part for the remake of The Long, Hot Summer.”

Shepherd also went into some detail about Elvis Presley, referring to the fling she enjoyed with him in the 1970s.

Just before she performed her song ‘Graceland (Revisited),' she discussed the iconic singer — the man who inspired said song — the late Presley, who died at the age of just 42 on August 16, 1977.

Following her performance of the song devoted to him, Shepherd said, “Elvis was really cool though” and referred to him as “a great guy.”

Shepherd hasn't been too active on screen in recent years. Her most recent small screen role came in the made-for-television movie ‘How to Murder Your Husband: The Nancy Brophy Story,' in which she played the eponymous Brophy. Her most recent big screen role was in 2020, when she played Nancy in the drama movie ‘Love Is Love Is Love.'

Other famous credits for the star include the television shows ‘The Yellow Rose,' ‘Moonlighting,' and her self-titled sitcom ‘Cybill,' and movies like 1971's coming-of-age drama ‘The Last Picture Show,' 1976's neo-noir crime comedy ‘Special Delivery,' and 1979's mystery comedy ‘The Lady Vanishes.'

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tyler Hynes is Going on Tour: Where You Can Meet the Hallmark Heartthrob","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/tyler-hynes-tour-appearances-2025-holidays/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 20:13:10 GMT","

Tyler Hynes may not be a guitar god, but the leather jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding, ruggedly handsome star of too many rom-coms to count is undeniably a rock star within the Hallmark universe. His merch sells out in hours, his movies are instant hits, there's even a documentary on his fandom in the works. Hynes' latest rock star move? He's going on tour. 

On October 20, 2025, Hynes announced via social media that, in addition to his already scheduled appearances at upcoming fan events across the U.S., he'll also make stops at holiday festivals in Indianapolis, Denver, and Tacoma, Washington. 

Unlike the average rock star, Hynes is notorious for ensuring his fans feel seen and appreciated. He's also sentimental to his core, so it's no surprise Hynes has dubbed his ever-growing list of appearances the “I'll Be Seeing You” Tour, named after the classic, heart-tugging tune of the same name (Hynes is partial to the Jimmy Durante version, FYI). Here's everything you need to know to make sure he'll be seeing you…

Hynes kicked off Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas with two dozen of his friends and colleagues — and tons of fans — in Nashville on October 15 and 16. Here's where he's heading next:

To share the news of his additional tour dates, Hynes captioned several touching videos of himself connecting with fans and wrote, “Some lovely folks have asked me to join in their holiday festivities. A chance to spend time and chat, something that seems to be enjoyed as of late. Can't think of a more lovely thing. :)” 

In the comment section, he reiterated that sentiment, writing, “I've been asked a lot lately how I feel about meeting folks, taking pictures, singing things so often. It feels…in a word…lovely 🤍🙏🏻 see you soon 💫”

While some fans expressed how thrilled they are to live within driving distance of one of Hynes' tour stops (including one who said she'll drive 13 hours), others asked for cities near them to be considered next. But many people also shared their excitement for the people in new places who will have a chance to meet their Hallmark rock star. 

“I love how you feel about meeting so many who love & appreciate you,” one fan wrote. “You are so grounded, so incredibly humble. One of a kind, Tyler. I'm proud to be an OG Hynie, even though I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you….yet! 🤍🍑✨️😘”

Another commented, “So happy you're sharing the love with people in these areas ❤️🙌👏👏🎄. You are the best ❤️❤️”

I wish he make some visits to Canada.  He has a  big fan base here and it would be so good to finally meet him.

St. Augustine, Florida is a beautiful city (oldest in the US) to have a meet and greet.

Come to Palm Springs or Dallas TX!

I hope he can come To  Florida

How come nobody ever comes to Florida specially my city Miami

I hope you come to Cincinnati.

So happy he's coming to Indy.  Only an hour drive and I am so very excited to see him in person.  Best Xmas ever!

Please consider coming to New York sometime.  I'm sure I'm not your only fan in New York.

I will be driving from Houston Texas. To pick up one friend in Ft Worth Texas, then driving to Oklahoma close to Tulsa to pick up another friend. Then driving all day to Kansas City Missouri on Thanksgiving day for the Hallmark Christmas Experience for the first weekend 28-30th of November for my Birthday Celebration to meet for the first time Tyler Hynes. This will be our first ever Hallmark anything. We are so looking forward to this time together the 3 of us friends and also meeting other Hallmark Actors as well.

Northern California next,PLEASE!

Forget comic books or video games, the untapped future of IP mining is clearly in board games. And now that Netflix has gotten into a Euro strategy game like Catan, it's a gateway drug to the streamer next making movies and shows based on Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Everdell, Azul, and Scythe, just you wait. 

Netflix announced Tuesday that it is acquiring the screen adaptation rights to Catan, the wildly popular board game franchise created by Klaus Teuber and originally released in 1995 as The Settlers of Catan. The streamer bought — or traded, likely a haul of some brick and wood or a bunch of wheat — the rights to make movies, TV series, and unscripted series all based on the board game. 

 








Related Stories ‘Selena y Los Dinos' Trailer: Netflix's Smash Hit Sundance Doc Puts the Focus Back on Selena's Groundbreaking Music Inside the ‘Task' Finale: Mark Ruffalo's Speech, That Last Shot, and Not Ending the Series After Explosive Penultimate Episode 

Part of the reason we immediately thought of Netflix for Catan compared to anyone else is that Netflix has its gaming division that we so often forget about. While it's not necessarily the reason anyone signs up for Netflix, the fact that Netflix has some free mobile apps tied to “Squid Game” or “Love Is Blind” or “Stranger Things” arguably keeps a few people around. So adding a Catan app, letting people actually play the game online with other Netflix users while they're Netflix and chilling with the show or movie, makes perfect sense in our mind. 

 










But as IndieWire understands it, Tuesday's deal doesn't also include gaming rights. So at the moment, it doesn't mean Netflix can put out its own Catan gaming app. That already exists for mobile in an official form, but it hasn't been supported or updated of late in the way that digital versions of some other popular games have. It likely also doesn't mean we'll get a “Wednesday” themed version of Catan or something like that. Maybe you can play the game in person at the Netflix House. 

That doesn't exclude Netflix from one day licensing the app and offering it to users that way. Netflix does have a number of big name mobile apps and games it doesn't own itself, like “Civilization VI” or “Hades,” to name just a couple. But not having some sort of playable Catan experience whenever a movie or series does come out could be a big missed opportunity, especially one that Netflix itself would be uniquely capable of executing. 

Because we're still admittedly skeptical what a Catan movie would actually look like. Sure there's a fictional island of settlers and knights and robbers, with trading and road building and cities and other scenarios you can possibly imagine as a backstory, but it's ultimately a game with some hexagon tiles, a whole lot of dice rolling, and friends and families turning on each other when you need to discard half of your cards or watch as your Longest Road bonus gets stolen from you. 

 










Darren Kyman from game developer asmodee, Pete Fenlon from CATAN Studio (an asmodee studio), and brothers Guido Teuber and Benjamin Teuber from the Teuber family are all attached to produce, as is Roy Lee (“Weapons”) from Vertigo Entertainment. 

Catan isn't the only board game Netflix is looking to bring to the screen. It also has an “Exploding Kittens” project (also an asmodee game) and is developing a reality competition series based on Monopoly.

Did things just get more interesting in the Warner Bros. Discovery succession race… or less interesting?

On Tuesday, WBD announced in a lengthy statement that it was reviewing purchase offers from “multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.” We knew Warner Bros. was potentially for sale and that Paramount/Skydance was seriously prepping its own offer. There were even rumors that someone like Netflix was interested in making a bid, up until Netflix's co-CEO recently shot those rumors down. 

What WBD's announcement this morning did was publicly put the “For Sale” sign up, it confirmed that Paramount isn't the only company dipping their toes in the pool, and it showed that David Zaslav and company are at least open to the idea of selling just part of the company rather than the whole thing. It's also a good way to goose the stock price by making Wall Street think there's a lot of buzzards circling.

But not really a whole bunch has changed here because the most realistic buyer — until another seriously emerges — is and remains Paramount. 

 










The reason Paramount is reportedly making an offer to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery is because it prevents it from getting in a bidding war with other potentially deep-pocketed buyers. While someone like Apple could easily absorb WBD and its tens of billions of dollars in debt, it wouldn't necessarily want to. The valuable assets for a streamer or a tech company would be the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, and HBO Max, as well as the IP and library rights to DC and Harry Potter and a whole lot of other stuff. They would be less interested in Discovery and Turner's cable channels that are for now profitable but are dwindling businesses.

Paramount, on the other hand, could still find a use for traditional cable networks like HGTV, TNT, Food Network, TCM, and more to add to its own portfolio. The same would go for the sports rights WBD controls, and it would give Paramount/Skydance a broadcast network in CBS and a major cable news network in CNN.

Consider if only Paramount was on the block for sale rather than the combination of the film studio and its cable channels. Way more buyers would've come calling than just David Ellison. When Fox sold its film studio to Disney, it retained its broadcast channel and cable networks, and it got a hefty price for doing so all the same. 

 










Warner Bros. Discovery is at least continuing its spin into two separate companies (kinda like it was when they were individually Warner Bros. and Discovery), and that at least gives Zaslav and company more options when considering offers. 

None of this is to say that Paramount is the preferable option should they be the ones to buy WBD. We still believe it would lead to another legacy studio disappearing, potentially a major streaming service being sunsetted, countless more jobs lost, and not to mention the entire political can of worms it would open. 

But if not Paramount, who else?

	Some music fans will spend their entire lives mourning the concerts they were never able to attend. Concert films have remedied this slightly, but Janelle Monáe has discovered an even better solution: time travel.


	In conversation with Lucy Dacus for Rolling Stone‘s Musicians on Musicians series, Monáe recalled her experience seeing David Bowie perform The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars live approximately a decade before she was born.

.@JanelleMonae is a certified time traveler and saw David Bowie on stage. 🛸""Yeah, I was backstage and I was like 'this is what I want to do.'"" pic.twitter.com/8UKt5bTWiy


	It all started with an inquiry about Halloween, a holiday that Monáe plans for two years in advance. It fulfills the creative pull she feels towards transformation and world-building in music. “I think when I saw David Bowie,” they said, before Dacus cut in for clarification, asking, “You saw him?”


	“I did,” Monáe confirmed. “I traveled back into the 1970s, and I saw him do Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. It was incredible.” There's more to the story, but Dacus wanted to make sure she was hearing all of this right. “You traveled back?” she asked, again.

	











	“Yeah, I was backstage,” Monáe responded. “I was like, this is what I want to do. I jetted back to the 2000s and I was like, I can have the musical, make the music, create the lyrics, and create community around transformation and being queer — not even just in sexuality, but in how we see the world.” Monáe previously named Ziggy Stardust as an influence for their 2010 debut album, The ArchAndroid.

	How did we get here again? Oh, right, Halloween. “I think that's the synergy between Halloween,” Monáe said, getting the conversation back on track. “I feel like people give themselves permission to be on my frequency.”


	Dacus understood, kind of, in a real “What the hell, sure” way.

	As Chris Brown speeds toward a February trial in the case of a housekeeper who was mauled by a security dog at his Los Angeles house five years ago, the singer is sharing his detailed description of the incident, in his own words, for the first time.


	Brown, 36, has filed portions of his April deposition in the civil court matter as part of his new request that the judge strike the housekeeper's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and punitive damages from her lawsuit. Brown's description stands in stark contrast to the housekeeper's own harrowing account of what happened. 


	In her lawsuit and related filings, housekeeper Maria Avila says she was removing trash from Brown's house on Dec. 12, 2020, when a large brown dog “viciously” attacked her, ripping chunks of flesh and even bone from her face and arm as she “screamed in terror and called out for help.” Avila alleges Brown came outside, stood over her while speaking on a cell phone, and then “fled the scene as [she] lay on the driveway in a pool of blood, bleeding to death.” (Avila says she required emergency surgery and now lives with extensive disfigurement, nerve damage, and loss of vision.)

	











	For years, Brown has been fighting the lawsuit and a related complaint from Avila's sister, Patricia, who was also at the house that day and allegedly ran outside to find her sister “covered in blood while she was screaming and crying for help.” In the excerpts of Brown's April deposition filed with the court Monday, Brown says he heard no screaming, saw no blood, at least initially, and only left the house because his manager advised him to do so once it was clear that paramedics were on their way.

	Asked how the terrifying incident unfolded, Brown said he was in his upstairs bedroom when he heard the dog, named Hades, growling outside. “Hearing the actual growl is what actually shocked me, to make me go downstairs,” he answered. Brown said once he reached the driveway, he encountered the housekeeper “face down” on the ground.

	“I didn't touch her. I bent down and I looked. I was – I was making sure she was breathing and then from there, I ran and put the dogs away and yelled and told the security guard to come over,” Brown testified under oath. Asked how he could be certain Avila was breathing, Brown said it was clear. “I could see her chest moving,” he said.


	Asked if he could remember saying anything to Avila, Brown said he didn't speak to her. “No. Because she was – she was out. It was no communication,” he testified. “I got security to make sure she was okay.”


	Brown said that after he rounded up all three of his dogs, including Hades, who was acting “nervous,” he called his manager while his security guard was allegedly on the phone with a 911 dispatcher.


	“Mr. Wilson told you to get the hell out of there, right?” Avila's lawyer asked, to which Brown responded, “yes, ma'am.” The lawyer then asked if Brown felt “bad” about leaving his house under those circumstances.


	“I'm not bad – I'm not feeling bad about leaving the house, more concerned about – about her, making sure she was okay,” he responded. Brown recalled that Avila's sister was outside by that point, and that someone, possibly the sister, brought Avila a towel. He said Avila was turned by the time he left, though he wasn't sure how she ended up in the new position.


	“I didn't see blood initially. I think I saw blood a little bit. I was kind of squeamish with blood, so like I think when – once I seen like she had – there was blood somewhere, I kind of – kind of didn't all the way look. I didn't want to – I didn't want to see the damage or whatever that happened,” he testified. Brown said he couldn't remember if the blood he saw was “bright red,” but that he recalled the color of the “brownish” dried blood on his driveway when he eventually returned.

	Brown said he was not involved in the decision by his security to remove Hades from the premises before law enforcement arrived, nor was he involved, he says, in having a security guard drive the animal up to Humboldt County, where the dog, described as a Caucasian Shepherd, was abandoned.

	











	“So if you learned that one of your security guys took the dog up to Humboldt, loaded him onto his car, tied him to a tree, and left him there, would you have fired the guard for doing that?” Avila's lawyer asked. Brown said he would have let his manager handle the situation had he known. He said the dog actually belonged to his head of security and was living on his property as a deterrent to potential stalkers or home invaders.


	In her own deposition conducted in October 2023, Avila said the dog pounced on her without warning. “It attacked me on my face, my hand, and it pierced its teeth on my foot,” she said. “I didn't see it, I simply felt it – it was something really big.”  Asked if she saw Brown take the dog away, Avila said no, though she believed it was Brown who called 911. She said from there, “I only heard the car that left.” She disputed Brown's claim that she was told not to go outside the house without permission.


	In his motion filed Monday, Brown argues that Avila failed to substantiate her claim that Brown acted with malice or engaged in any “outrageous conduct.” For that reason, her claims for emotional distress and punitive damages should be dismissed before trial, he says. Avila's lawyer, Nancy Doumanian, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Avila's lawsuit and the related negligence complaint filed by her sister have been consolidated into the same trial set for Feb. 9, 2026.


	Brown's new motion to dismiss the punitive and emotional damages claims has a hearing set for Jan. 15. Maria's husband is a co-plaintiff in her lawsuit. He claims the harm to his wife caused him “loss of consortium damages.” Brown, meanwhile, is being sued alongside his company, Black Pyramid, LLC.


	“Defendants anticipate that plaintiffs will point to defendants' post-incident conduct in support of their punitive damages claim. However, any actions defendants took after the incident are wholly irrelevant, because these actions in no way contributed to the occurrence of the incident,” Brown's lawyers wrote in his motion filed Monday.

	“Plaintiffs will likely argue that defendants' decision to drive Hades to another location and have him euthanized was an attempt to ‘conceal evidence,' and thus was oppressive, fraudulent, and malicious,” the filing continued. “To the contrary, it was an attempt to remove what had just become an unpredictable animal from a terrible situation and ensure nothing like this would happen again. The intent was not to ‘conceal' or ‘destroy' evidence but rather to prevent the risk of future harm. For these reasons, plaintiffs cannot provide any evidence to support a claim for punitive damages.”

	











	In a separate filing in June, Brown's defense said that no security footage of the incident exists. “[No video] was ever recorded due to the cameras having been broken on the date of the incident as a result of a break-in or robbery that had occurred on the property a few weeks prior,” the defense statement to the court said. “The head of security, Emil Lewis, testified to this under oath during his deposition.”

	Throughout the first decade or so of his career, Bruce Springsteen felt it was important to limit his public commentary, and simply let his music do the talking. Early manager Mike Appel had to twist his arm to speak with Time for a 1975 cover story, and Springsteen generally stayed far away from the partisan political fray, even when President Reagan tried to absorb some of his popularity by name-checking him on the 1984 campaign trail.


	But as the years ticked by, Springsteen slowly found his voice. He granted in-depth interviews to Rolling Stone and other publications, joined the campaign trail alongside John Kerry, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden, and delivered brilliant speeches at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, along with other music industry events. And over the past decade, he published a memoir, performed a one-man Broadway show, and appeared on podcasts and talk shows around the world.


	Along the way, he spilled quite a bit of wisdom and revealed much about his music, career, private life, politics, and connections with the members of the E Street Band. We culled through it all to give you this guide to the Tao of Bruce.

	“Roy Orbison's voice was unearthly. He had the ability, like all great rock & rollers, to sound like he dropped in from another planet and yet get the stuff that was right to the heart of what you were livin' in today, and it was how he opened up your vision. I carry his records with me when I go on tour today.” —1987












	“Dylan was a revolutionary, man. The way that Elvis freed your body, Bob freed your mind. And he showed us that just because the music was innately physical, it did not mean that it was anti-intellect. He broke through the limitations of what a recording artist could achieve. Without Bob, the Beatles wouldn't have made Sgt. Pepper, maybe the Beach Boys wouldn't have made Pet Sounds, the Sex Pistols wouldn't have made ‘God Save the Queen,' U2 wouldn't have done ‘Pride (In the Name of Love),' Marvin Gaye wouldn't have done ‘What's Going On,' Grandmaster Flash might not have done ‘The Message,' and the Count Five could not have done ‘Psychotic Reaction.' And there never would have been a group named the Electric Prunes, that's for sure.” —1988

	“Creedence Clearwater Revival committed the sin of being too popular when hipness was all. They played no-frills American music for the people. In the late Sixties and early Seventies, they weren't the hippest band in the world — just the best.” —1993


	“Every musician has their genesis moment. For you, it might have been the Sex Pistols or Madonna or Public Enemy. Mine was 1956, Elvis on The Ed Sullivan Show. It was the evening I realized a white man could make magic, that you did not have to be constrained by your upbringing, by the way you looked or by the social context that oppressed you. You could call it upon your own powers of imagination, and you could create a transformative self.” —2012


	“To me, the Animals were a revelation. The first records with full-blown class consciousness that I ever heard. ‘We Gotta Get Out of This Place' had that great bass riff that was just marking time. [Plays a bit of the song] That's every song I've ever written. I'm not kidding.” —2012


	“Astral Weeks was an extremely important record for me. It made me trust in beauty, it gave me a sense of the divine. The divine just seems to run through the veins of that entire album. Of course there was incredible singing and the playing of Richard Davis on the bass. It was trance music. It was repetitive. It was the same chord progression over and over again. But it showed how expansive something with very basic underpinning could be. There'd be no ‘New York City Serenade' if there hadn't been Astral Weeks.” —2016

	“In the third grade, a nun stuffed me into a garbage can under her desk because she told me that's where I belonged. I also had the distinction of being the only altar boy knocked down by a priest on the steps of the altar during Mass. The old priest got mad. My mom wanted me to learn how to serve Mass, but I didn't know what I was doin', so I was tryin' to fake it.” —1975












	“I lived half of my first 13 years in a trance or something. People thought I was weird because I always went around with this look on my face. I was always on the outside, looking in.” —1975


	“I used to live in this two-family house, and at night my father used to lock up the front door so that me and my sister used to come in 'round through the kitchen. He'd sit in the kitchen all night with all the lights out, smoke a cigarette, drink some beer — my mother'd sit in the front room watching TV…. He'd start talking to me about what I was doing in school or if l was looking for a job or something. Pretty soon we'd be arguing, screaming at each other. My mother'd be running in from the front room trying to keep us from fighting with each other. I'd end up running back outside the house running out the door telling him how it was my life, I could do what I wanted.” —1976


	“They gave me the [military] draft forms, and I checked everything. Even said I was a homo and all that. Then this guy calls me into his office, talks to me for about three minutes and tells me to go home.” —1979


	“I remember coming home after I'd been gone for three days and walking in the kitchen, and my mother and father were sitting there, and my dad said, ‘Where you been?' and I said, uh, ‘I went to take my physical.' He said, ‘What happened?' I said, ‘They didn't take me.' And he said, ‘That's good.'” —1985


	“My mother showered me with affection. The love I missed from my father she tried to double up on and, perhaps, find the love she missed from my dad. All I know is she always had my back. When I was hauled into the police station for a variety of minor infractions, she was always there to take me back home. She came to my countless baseball games, both when I stunk up the place and the one season lightning struck and I turned into a real fielding, hitting player, with my name in the papers. She got me my first electric guitar, encouraged my music and fawned over my early creative writing. She was a parent, and that's what I needed as my world was about to explode.” —2016


	“I don't know what you guys think about what happened last night, but I think it's pretty frightening. You guys are young, there's gonna be a lot of people depending on you coming up, so this is for you.” —The day after the 1980 presidential election 


	“It's a long walk from the government that's supposed to represent all the people to where we [are now. It] seems like something's happening out there where there's a lot of stuff being taken away from a lot of people that shouldn't have it taken away from them. Sometimes it's hard to remember that this place belongs to us, that this is our hometown.” —1984












	“America is a conservative country, it really is. I think that's one thing the past 10 years have shown. But I don't know if people are really organized, and I don't think there's a figure out there who's been able to embody the things that are eating away at the soul of the nation at large…. The political system has really broken down. We've abandoned a gigantic part of the population — we've just left them for dead. But we're gonna have to pay the piper someday.” —1992


	“I think the invasion in Afghanistan was handled very, very smoothly.” —Time magazine, 2002 


	“I knew after we invaded Iraq that I was going to be involved in the election. I felt they had been fundamentally dishonest and had frightened and manipulated the American people into war. And as the saying goes, ‘The first casualty of war is truth.' I felt that the Bush doctrine of pre-emption was a dangerous foreign policy. I don't think it has made America safer.” —2004 


	“If the 2004 election had been held six months later, they would have lost. People were still under the spell of 9/11 and the magic and the Swift-boating. One of the most satisfying moments of the election was Ted Koppel ripping the Swift-boaters a new asshole on Nightline about a week or so before the election, when they went to the village in Vietnam where the incident occurred and talked to the Vietnamese witnesses. It was right there, but it wasn't enough, and it was too late.” —2007 


	“I don't know about you, but I want my country back, I want my dream back, I want my America back! Now is the time to stand with Barack Obama and Joe Biden, roll up our sleeves and come up for the rising.” —2008


	“It seemed like if I was ever going to spend whatever small political capital I had, [the election of 2008] was the moment to do so. But that capital diminishes the more often you do it. While I'm not saying never, and I still like to support the president, you know, it's something I didn't do for a long time, and I don't have plans to be out there every time.” —2012 


	“President Obama ran last time as a man of hope and change. You hear a lot of talk about how things are different now. Things aren't any different — they're just realer.  It's crunch time. The president's job, our job — yours and mine — whether you're Republican, Democrat, Independent, rich, poor, Black, brown, white, gay, straight, soldier, civilian — is to keep that hope alive, to combat cynicism and apathy, and to believe in our power to change our lives and the world we live in. Let's reelect President Barack Obama to carry our standard forward towards the America that awaits us.” —2012 












	“The republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it's a tragedy for our democracy. When you start talking about elections being rigged, you‘re pushing people beyond democratic governance. And it‘s a very, very dangerous thing to do. Once you let those genies out of the bottle, they don‘t go back in so easy, if they go back in at all … I believe that there's a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization that has occurred in the United States for the past 35, 40 years and how it's deeply affected people's lives and deeply hurt people to where they want someone who says they have a solution. And Trump's thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing.” —2016


	“These are the times when we've also seen folks marching, and in the highest offices of our land who want to speak to our darkest angels, who want to call up the ugliest and the most divisive ghosts of America's past, and they want to destroy the idea of an America for all. That's their intention. That's what we've been seeing in the outrage of the broken families on the border, and in hate-filled marches on American streets, this year. Things I never thought I would see again in my lifetime. Things that I thought that were dead and gone forever, on the ash heap of history.” —2017


	“The power of the American idea has been abandoned. It's a terrible shame, and we need somebody who can bring that to life again … I think if we get Joe Biden, it's gonna go a long way towards helping us regain our status around the world. The country as the shining light of democracy has been trashed by the administration. We abandoned friends, we befriended dictators, we denied climate science … The first thing is to get the Trump administration out of office and start again.” —2020


	“[Trump's] disdain for the sanctity of our Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president ever again. He doesn't understand the meaning of this country, its history or what it means to be deeply American.” —2024


	“In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world's poorest children to sickness and death, that's happening now. In my country, they're taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They're rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just society. They're abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those who are struggling for their freedom. That's happening now. They are defunding American universities that won't bow down to their ideological demands. And they are removing residents off American streets without due process of law and deploying them to foreign detention centers and prisons. That's happening now.” —2025












	“Ya know, you can tell by looking at 'em that this isn't a bunch of guys with a whole lot in common. But somehow the music cuts right through all that. It's weird 'cause it's not really a touring band or just a recording band. And I'm a solo act, y'know.” —1978 


	“Initially, some people were surprised [when I let them go], some people were not so surprised. I'm sure some people were angry, and other people weren't angry. But as time passed, everything came around to a really nice place. I mean, I wasn't the guy writing the check every month. Suddenly, I was just Bruce, and some of the friendships started coming forward a little bit.” —1992 


	“This is going to be the best E Street Band somebody's ever seen. If you're a young kid and your brother or your dad saw us, and you come see us now, you can say, ‘I saw them when they were at their best.' I like that all my guys are out there and that they're all alive. There were struggles, the same type of troubles many other bands have, but people took care of one another, and everybody's there. I can't tell you the joy of standing next to those same people.” —2007 


	“E Street was a dance; was an idea; was a wish; was a refuge; was a home; was a destination; was a gutter dream; and finally, it was a band. We struggled together, and sometimes, we struggled with one another. We bathed in the glory, and often, the heartbreaking confusion of our rewards together. We've enjoyed health, and we've suffered illness and aging and death together. We took care of one another when trouble knocked, and we hurt one another in big and small ways.” —2014 


	“I met Julianne Phillips about halfway through the Born in the U.S.A. tour. And we got married. And it was tough. I didn't really know how to be a husband. She was a terrific person, but I just didn't know how to do it. I needed something, and I was giving it a shot. Anybody who's been through a divorce can tell you what that's about. It's difficult, hard, and painful for everybody involved.” —1992


	“Patti busted the boys' club, big time. Oh … it went like this: ‘OK, fellas. There's gonna be a woman in the band. We need someone to sing all the high parts. How complicated can it get?' Well, a nice paparazzi photo of me in my Jockey shorts on a balcony in Rome… 10 of the best years of my life.” —1999












	“Patti is my late-night sexification… My vacation from masturbation.” —2000 


	“Patti and I have been together for 20 years. ‘Kingdom of Days' is something you write after having a long, long life with somebody, where you see how much you've built together. You also see its finiteness, the passing of the day's light on your partner's face. The song is about taking the fear and terror out of those things.” —2009


	“Patti is smart, tough, but fragile. Don't forget that part. If we love those in whose company is reflected the best of us, that's the light she shines on me. 1984, one night hangin' out at the Stone Pony, and this beautiful redhead shows up and sits in with the Sunday night house band, and that is the night I fell in love with Patti's voice. She got onstage, this blaze of red, she performed a great version of the Exciters' hit song ‘Tell Him.' So the first line of the first song I ever heard Patti sing was ‘I know somethin' about love.'” —2017


	“The night I met Clarence, he got up onstage and a sound came out of his horn that seemed to rattle the glasses behind the bar, and threatened to blow out the back wall. The door literally blew off the club in a storm that night, and I knew I'd found my sax player. But there was something else, something — something happened when we stood side by side. Some energy, some unspoken story. For 15 years, Clarence has been a source of myth and light and enormous strength for me onstage. He has filled my heart so many nights, and I love it when he wraps me in those arms at the end of the night.” —1999

							By

Stacey Abrams — the two time Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia — has a new mission: defending democracy and diversity, equity, and inclusion in equal measure.


	At a moment when Donald Trump's administration has made a crusade out of stamping out DEI initiatives in government — even going so far as to repeal a Civil Rights-era order banning segregation by federal contractors — Abrams continues to make the case that diversity is our strength. America works best, in her view, when folks without structural advantages are welcomed to the table and given a fair shot to contribute. To pursue this work, Abrams founded a nonprofit called American Pride Rises, with the tagline: “We fight for opportunity for all, no exceptions.”


	Just going off headlines and news of corporate and collegiate capitulation to Trump's anti-DEI agenda, you might think that Abrams is rowing against the tides. But DEI remains stubbornly popular among Americans not in the MAGA camp. And Abrams is determined to see the political pendulum swing back into line with popular opinion.Success will hinge on victories at the ballot box — which are threatened by Trump's increasingly authoritarian mode of governance, and his marching orders for state legislatures to redraw congressional districts to his partisan benefit. Seeking to champion America as a pluralistic democracy, Abrams has also launched a new “10 Steps” campaign. The initiative sounds the alarm about 10 signs of “autocracy” in America. But it also offers everyday people 10 constructive steps for fighting back. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







Rolling Stone spoke with Abrams by phone earlier this month, shortly after Trump summoned America's diverse military brass to Quantico to call for confronting what the president calls the “enemy within.”

	











The transcript that follows has been edited for length and clarity. 


I'm looking through your 10 signs of autocracy, and It's pretty harrowing. We've already witnessed expanded executive power; attacks on the media; captured branches of government. It seems like we're up to step eight or nine out of 10 here. Clearly you see this as a dangerous moment.We've actually had all 10 steps. Look at step 10 — which is ending democracy — making certain we don't have free and fair elections. The way that manifests in autocracies is not that they don't hold elections. Venezuela has elections. It's that the elections don't mean anything, because they manufacture the outcome.


	That's what watched happen when the president and the Republicans explicitly went to Texas to rig the system, to game the number of [congressional] seats they could win. They did the same thing in Missouri. They're planning to do it in other states. We saw Georgia purging 400,000-plus voters [from the rolls] after a 115,000 vote margin in 2024. It's very important that we understand we have hit all 10 steps.

	But when you recognize it — that's when the ability to resist and to thwart authoritarianism is made real. And that's the point behind the campaign. I think for many Americans this present moment feels awkward, or it feels bad, but it doesn't feel like authoritarianism — because that's not what we've been trained to look for. It's critical that we understand that we are in it. This is not something that's coming. This is not if we do 10 more things, it happens. No, it is here. 


	But we also know the playbook for resistance. And the 10 Steps for Freedom and Power are there to remind us that we know how to stop this from taking permanent hold. We all have to do something. A critical mass of people has to believe that they are part of thwarting this authoritarian takeover. Because when you have that critical mass, it works. 


	The campaign is designed to say we don't need a single person or a single approach to win. What we need is the volume of action, the consistency of action and the engagement of every person willing to act. But we've got to meet people where they are.

What are a couple examples that would be accessible to folks who are alarmed but are unsure of how they can help?One of the 10 steps is “sharing,” which may sound very small-ball. But the reason they tried to get rid of Jimmy Kimmel, the reason they defunded PBS and NPR, the reason they wanted Karen Attiah and Matthew Dowd fired, is because they don't want us to have good information. 


	In nations where silence is the currency of the government, civil resistance relies on the ability and willingness to share effective information. There are 330 million of us, so sharing information changes things. When people actually see what the effects [of authoritarianism] are, they're willing to take action on a larger scale.

	











	So if you're in Portland, when the National Guard is deployed, you should be filming everything they do, and you should be sharing that information — because they don't want us to know what's happening.


	Another step is “mobilize.” We tend to think we have to go to a massive march. But maybe you live in a community where there are just 500 people and only 40 of them agree with you. A march may not be the thing. But you can host a conversation. You can all talk about, for example, the national park in your rural community where everyone's been laid off because of the shutdown. These families aren't eating right now because nobody there has a job. So you organize a Friday potluck where you are feeding them. That mobilization might feel small, but one of the ways you defend democracy is by showing people that we're in it together. 


What other steps would you highlight?My two favorites are “disruption” and “denial.” Authoritarian systems require obedience. Disruption means you refuse to comply, you protest. It's also handing out “Know Your Rights” cards if you live in a community where you now have the armed military [forces]. They are not the police and they don't have the authority of police. Let's make sure people know what their rights are.Then, step seven, “denial.” This is using language they're not going to like. For example: continuing to call it the Gulf of Mexico. Denial is a bridge to the conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion.How so?Authoritarians strip you of your language. They try to convince you that what you know is not true and that what you say is not valid. We have to deny authoritarians their ability to demonize our language. 


	DEI is the currency of America. Diversity, equity and inclusion are three foundational values that let us survive and thrive, despite the perfidy that we've seen in this country.


	If you look at the original list of executive orders that came out in the first 48 hours [of Trump's second term], DEI was the most prominent attack. Because they don't like pluralism. They don't like diversity. They are afraid of equity. They are terrified that inclusion has actually made us stronger. So we have to not only use the language, but we have to understand that DEI is the core of how we've made this democratic republic function, and we should be fighting for it.


Our military is America's prime marker of inclusion being our strength. But watching Trump address the generals at Quantico was jarring. The president is up there making weird references to the n-word, and talking about how the Congolese have emptied their prisons into America. The racial coding is not difficult to understand. It's alarming how much of this authoritarian project appears to be twinned with reasserting white dominance.Their anger is grounded in our success. They're mad at DEI because it worked. Pete Hegseth has railed against the success of the world's mightiest military actually achieving the intentions of a pluralistic democracy: The people fighting for America look like America. That's what he was angry about. That's what the president has reviled.


	We have to recognize that, while they are starting with DEI, they're coming for everyone. The president of the United States is very clear in using language that not only has a white supremacist positioning, but it also speaks to restoration of the notion that women should not have positions of power. They start with race, because race is the original sin of this nation. But race is not the only predicate for discrimination. 


	It is also gender. It is sexual orientation. It is the reason the secretary of defense made a disparaging comment about our transgender troops. It is the reason that they are eviscerating access to the Americans with Disabilities Act. When they slashed in half the Department of Education, what they're denying are IEPs, individual education plans for disabled children and children with learning disabilities. They are attacking anything they do not believe speaks to this perfected, very pale, version of what they think America is. We cannot allow that to go unchecked. 

	











	Unfortunately, for them, in this country, we've had 250 years of practice mounting strong resistance. We just have to be reminded of our muscle memory. That's the intention of the 10 Steps program.


	The central pillar for me is DEI because there is nothing more terrifying to the fascism and authoritarianism than diversity, equity, and inclusion, because, by its very nature, it defies what they are attempting to create.


I do worry that there's a sense of doomerism around American elections right now, that people may believe the fix is in and not show up at the ballot box. What's your view on the importance of continuing to engage in the political process, despite the setbacks that may make elections less fair?My father was arrested when he was 14 for registering black people to vote in Mississippi. He believed as a teenager that this right was so fundamental that he was willing to sacrifice his freedom for something his father was sent to fight for — but denied when he came home. 


	Exempting ourselves from the hard work of fighting for democracy is a luxury we can't afford. We may not guarantee the outcome. We can guarantee the fight.


	My broader mission is for us to remember we are not defeated, and, in fact, that we are winning. Because if they've already won, they would not be doing what they're doing. They would not be holding, you know, faux Patton-like spectacles, summoning the generals to pretend power.

	They wouldn't be issuing executive orders that are more fiction than the novels that I write. They also wouldn't be deploying the military to harass citizens. They wouldn't be standing up masked secret police. If they were already successful, they would be enjoying the fruits of their labor. Instead, they are laboring to convince us that we've already lost.

	











	We don't have to agree on everything, but we have to be aligned that democracy is worth fighting for — and that we can win.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q='unidentified+flying+objects'","Peer-reviewed studies suggest UFOs photographed in orbit prior to Space Age","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3857770/peer-reviewed-studies-suggest-ufo-photographed-in-orbit-before-space-age/","Tue, 21 Oct 2025 18:30:04 GMT","

Two newly released peer-reviewed studies suggest that unidentified flying objects may have inadvertently been telescope-photographed in Earth's orbit prior to the development of satellites and space exploration. The studies by Dr. Beatriz Villarroel and her colleagues have identified bright “transient” objects that appeared in photographs but were not present in photographs taken soon thereafter. The transient nature of these lights strongly suggests they are not stars.

Unlike many researchers who find alien UFOs in flares and balloons, Villarroel and her colleagues do not conclude that the transient objects are truly exotic UFOs. They simply offer their scientific research in the suggestion that the transient objects may be truly exotic UFOs and that more study is prudent.

The first study notes, “One plausible explanation is that they are caused by brief light emissions from artificial objects in orbit or by objects with anomalous movements in Earth's atmosphere — emissions so brief that they appear as point sources rather than streaks, despite the telescope tracking the stars. Alternatively, they could arise from solar reflections off flat, highly reflective surfaces at geosynchronous altitudes.”

The study explains, “As in the earlier case with the nine transients, the objects appeared and vanished within a single 50 minutes exposure. Their brightness (r ∼ 15–16 mag) makes contamination less likely. Notably, this particular event coincides in time with one of the most extensively documented aerial anomalies in historical records: the Washington D.C. “UFO flap” of 1952 July, which unfolded over two consecutive weekends (July 18–19 and 26–27).… [Telescope photographic] plate defects or scanning artifacts are expected to occur randomly in time; the fact that these transient alignments appear preferentially within a day of reported [unidentified aerial phenomena] events strongly disfavors instrumental or spurious origins.”

The D.C. UFO flap saw multiple radar and visual reports by military personnel of apparently fast-moving, bright objects flying in and around the capital region. Fighter jets were repeatedly deployed to intercept the objects, but could not maintain pace with them.

The study also offers compelling consideration that the highly reflective objects appeared on photographs after being reflected by sunlight. As Villarroel puts it, “We find a strong deficit of transient detections, at the ∼22σ statistical significance level, within the Earth's umbral shadow. This is consistent with the idea that sunlight is required to produce the observed flashes. If these events are sunlight reflections off orbiting objects, they should vanish in the shadow cone of the Earth — exactly what we observe. This lends substantial support to the interpretation that the transients are real astrophysical or near-Earth events, and not plate defects or optical ghosts. The disappearance of the population in Earth's shadow would not be expected for emulsion flaws or chemical irregularities. The same holds true for optical ghosts.”

Villarroel further asserts, “No matter how asymmetric or irregular the distributions of plate defects may be, they have no plausible reason to avoid the Earth's shadow. In contrast, transients associated with solar reflections would. This shadow test provides a crucial empirical lever to distinguish between physical reflections and random defects—and remains an essential part of any validation framework moving forward.”

A second study published in Nature indicated, “Findings suggest associations beyond chance between occurrence of transients and both nuclear testing and UAP reports.” The first study references these findings by noting that “the temporal correlations between the 1950s transients and both the Washington 1952 UFO events and 124 U.S., Soviet, and British nuclear weapons tests deserve serious attention. Even if individual events remain uncertain, Bruehl & Villarroel (2025) shows statistically significant correlations between subsets of the transient sample in Solano et al. (2022) and historical nuclear activity and aerial anomalies. This alone contradicts the idea that the entire sample consists of plate defects.”

As the Washington Examiner has previously reported, and Robert Hastings has extensively documented, there is compelling evidence to suggest an unknown correlation between nuclear systems and a small subset of UFOs that manifest intelligent control and technologies far beyond those of any Earth nation.

Villarroel deserves praise for her work. As with other academics, such as Harvard professor Avi Loeb and Stanford professor Garry Nolan, Villarroel may sometimes offer personal opinions unsupported by fact. Still, the central approach of these academics to this topic is that of the scientific method. This stands them in stark contrast to other prominent figures in the UFO community who leverage wildly unsubstantiated claims to make money via lucrative TV shows.

The UFO community has been frustrated by its inability to lobby for greater Congressional and government action. A good place to start in remedying this situation would be to focus attention away from entertainers and toward others, such as Villarroel, who choose the harder but more forensic approach of bold science. As here, the patient scientific approach bears fruitful dividends.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","other"

A mystified witness in North Carolina captured footage of three strange-looking UFOs floating across the sky. Their video and an account of the peculiar sighting, which occurred on October 15th in the community of Willow Spring, was shared with the National UFO Reporting Center last week. After initially spotting what they thought was a plane, the witness was confounded when they took a closer look with their phone and observed ""three separate black objects moving together across the sky.""

   14:38 EDT 21 Oct 2025, updated  16:35 EDT 21 Oct 2025    By STACY LIBERATORE, US SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDITOR  

Three Minneapolis police officers spotted a spherical Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) with six glowing rings that changed colors. 

The anonymous witnesses filed a report with Americans for Safe Aerospace, a non-profit led by former US Navy pilot and whistleblower Ryan Graves, saying they observed the object from a parking garage using binoculars.

According to the report, one officer drove toward the UAP in a squad car while the other two continued watching from the garage. 

The officers described the object as hovering at 10,000 feet, moving with both slow and hypersonic speeds, and generating lift without any sound.

Even more striking, the report described a near-proximity encounter between the UAP and a civilian helicopter. 

The observation took place in the vicinity of Minnesota's Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant, a detail that has raised eyebrows among UFO researchers, given the site's strategic significance. 

The incident occurred in February, but Graves shared the report on X on Monday. A similar sighting was recorded on July 7 in Anoka, about a mile from the witness. 

That UFO reportedly traveled along the Mississippi River at around 460mph, then abruptly slowed and silently descended behind nearby trees.

While believers view the report as yet another sign of advanced unknown technology, skeptics argue the sighting likely has a conventional explanation, perhaps one already orbiting high above Earth.

Alejandro Rojas, an advisor at Enigma Labs, which analyzes reports of UAPs, told Daily Mail that the sighting may have been NASA's International Space Station (ISS).

'The ISS has flown over the area for the last few days and was very bright. What we see in the video could be the ISS, but we will need more details to rule it out,' he said.

'The video also doesn't look like 'six interlocking rings of colored lights.' A small point of light in the distance can appear to be multiple colors when it is not, due to the atmosphere between the witness and the object. 

'This is called scintillation and is the same thing that makes stars twinkle.'

Rojas added that on both February 19 and July 7, the ISS had several bright flyovers in the area.

Americans for Safe Aerospace advocates for transparency in UAP research and collects reports from credible witnesses, including military and law enforcement personnel. 

Graves posted on X that the platform has nearly 1000 reports, noting that more are set to be released.

He is a former US Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot who became one of the first military aviators to speak publicly about routine UFO encounters during training missions off the East Coast. 

Graves first drew national attention after revealing that Navy pilots regularly encountered unidentified craft off the US East Coast between 2014 and 2015, objects that appeared to defy known flight physics. 

These objects were detected both visually and on radar, appeared to hover against strong winds, and could accelerate instantly without visible propulsion.

In one incident, a pilot nearly collided with a cube-shaped object encased in a clear sphere. 

Graves later said the encounters were so frequent they became part of pre-flight safety briefings. 

He later testified before Congress about the risks these unidentified objects pose to flight safety.

Graves said the incidents were so common that pilots began discussing them as part of pre-flight safety briefings. He emphasized that whatever these craft are, advanced foreign tech or something else, they represent a serious aviation safety concern.

A newly tracked interstellar comet, which has been dubbed 3I/ATLAS and is likely to pass the sun, Jupiter, Mars and Venus (but not Earth) this autumn, has sparked some unexpectedly Jewish reflections.

Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor of astronomy, has posited that comets and space debris might be products of extraterrestrial intelligence and has theorized that there is a 60% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS is an extraterrestrial construction. Loeb has also informed the Jewish Journal of Greater Boston that the Messiah may well be extraterrestrial in origin.

Elsewhere, Loeb has suggested that after the arrival of extraterrestrials on Earth, “old religions might die and new religions might be born,” implying the possible end of Judaism, as one of the old-time religions.

The professor has stated that he is “very proud” of Jewish tradition because “there's a lot of wisdom in it,” which might be seen as a neat understatement. But at the same time, in a blog he has declared that because the Earth is no safe haven for Jews, it might be a good idea to move to outer space, where there are no lethal proprietary struggles of the Middle East type nor any antisemitism.

In any case, given the way the solar system is developing, within 7.6 billion years the sun will swell into a red giant and vaporize the Earth, astronomers tell us. To sidestep this fate, Loeb hints that Jews might kvell for trillions, instead of mere billions, of years by relocating to a distant planet, any one of untold numbers currently uninhabited.

This notion, although meant perhaps only half-seriously, overlooks the Jewish tradition of Earth as a potentially blessed place for Jews, however long the blessing lasts. The biblical Book of Isaiah uses the term “Beulah” (from the Hebrew word for married) to refer to the land of Israel after its restoration, a symbolic state of being in a blessed covenant with God on Earth, not in outer space.

At the same time, Loeb has cautioned that extraterrestrial visitors might have malign motives and earthlings would not be able to oppose them; on the other hand, ETs might also be nicer and better than humans. Last month, Loeb claimed that, since interstellar visitors “must have survived” for billions of years, they might follow the principle of “survival of the kindest.”

Justifying his assertion that roaming extraterrestrials seeking earthly contacts might be benevolent, Loeb stated: “Lonely people do not engage in blind dates if they believe that their dating partners are likely to be serial killers,” going on to observe that such interstellar wandering lonely hearts are “motivated to seek partners if they believe that kindness is abundant on the dating scene.”

Whatever the eHarmony aspect of intergalactic dating might be, the concept of visitors from outer space who are kind to Jews and others is contradicted by Loeb's repeated claims that interstellar comets could also be espionage vehicles with menacing intent. These dire predictions have worried some readers, while annoying fellow astronomers who have called them mere distractions, implying that the time spent denying Loeb's much-publicized, highly improbable theories might be better used for further research.

Still, Loeb is far from the first to associate Yiddishkeit with extraterrestrial phenomena — the tradition goes back at least as far as the vision of a chariot-like structure with four wheels described in the Bible's Book of Ezekiel, symbolizing God's omnipresence, omniscience and mobility.

The 17th-century cult leader Abraham Miguel Cardozo saw faces in the moon, including the False Messiah Sabbatai Zevi and the mystic Isaac Luria. More recently, the Jewish psychiatrist John Mack, also affiliated with Harvard, investigated unproven claims of alien abductions, including one made by an Israeli woman who, under hypnosis, recalled a former 13th-century life as an Arab merchant famed for justice and benevolence.

These and other examples have been examined by David Halperin, an expert on Jews and UFOs, who alludes to the eminent American Jewish astronomer Carl Sagan, who was open-minded about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, but concluded that as yet, no purported discoveries had been proven scientifically.

In a recent blog post, Loeb, who has previously likened his detractors to those who dismissed Galileo, Madame Curie and the Wright Brothers, compared himself to a Jewish child prisoner in Theresienstadt concentration camp who drew idealized images of a “better world” rather than the grim reality of a Nazi jail. Loeb noted that he and others who dream “of a better world than Earth” might “guide [humanity] to the promised land” by encountering aliens.

Whatever one thinks of these comparisons, Jews have long sought and found extraterrestrial inspiration in earthly phenomena, and the wisest scientific mavens, including Sagan and others, have remained temperate, whether or not such theories turned out to be factual. May the same turn out to be the case with 3I/ATLAS.

10.21.2025

Baltimore, MD – October 21, 2025 – Comet, the free TV home for fans of science fiction, fantasy, horror and supernatural series and movies, will celebrate its 10th anniversary on October 31, 2025, with a special lineup of blockbuster and cult classic movies. In addition, the network will feature a 10-day social media countdown filled with throwback promos and clips from the network's first decade, which kicks off today.

Since its launch, Comet has featured some of the most iconic series in the genre — from the shows that launched the network, including Stargate SG-1 and The Outer Limits, and fan favorites like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Battlestar Galactica, to the network's current schedule of The X-Files, Grimm, Xena: Warrior Princess, and blockbuster movie franchises like The Terminator, Star Trek, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, and more.

In addition, Comet has made a series of strategic national distribution agreements, channel upgrades, and new multicast affiliate launches. The network has grown its household coverage by 80% since launch[1], added upgrades on the CBS O&Os and added distribution on YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, one of the first multicast networks to be included on these platforms.

Comet has also built its own annual celebration of fandom with COMET FEST, a linear, digital and in-person event which featured the original Jurassic Park trilogy for its 3rd iteration this summer. With more than 2.4 million total viewers[2] tuning in, COMET FEST once again demonstrated the power of fan-first programming to drive audience loyalty and market-leading performance. COMET FEST will return in September 2026 celebrating the sci-fi action blockbusters The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.

“Comet was built by and for fans, and that connection is what's fueled our success for the last ten years,” said Adam Ware, Senior Vice President of Growth Networks, Sinclair. “From our first broadcast we've stayed true to what audiences love most: smart, imaginative, larger-than-life storytelling. This anniversary is a celebration of our audience, our partners, and the creative worlds that continue to inspire us every day.”

Nearly half of Canadians believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon, according to a new UBC study exploring ghost sightings, alien encounters and cryptid beliefs across the country.

From ghost stories to Sasquatch sightings, belief in the paranormal is alive and well in Canada—though perhaps not as strong as you might think. 

A new national survey by UBC sociologists Dr. Tony Silva and Dr. Emily Huddart finds that nearly half of Canadians believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon. The study helps fill a decades-long gap in Canadian data on the topic. We spoke with Dr. Silva, associate professor in the department of sociology, about their findings. 

Most previous research has focused on the U.S. or Europe. Canada is one of the most secular countries in the world, but we hadn't seen a representative survey here in decades. A lot has changed in Canadian society. We wanted to know how secularization, media and cultural shifts might be shaping people's beliefs in things science can't explain. 

Ghosts and extraterrestrial visitation top the list. About one-third of Canadians agree that places can be haunted by spirits, and roughly one in five believe that aliens have visited Earth. A lot of people are also on the fence—another quarter neither agree nor disagree. That middle ground was a big finding for us: Many Canadians don't have strong convictions either way, but they're open to the idea. 

Belief in cryptids like Sasquatch or Ogopogo was less common, but still notable—around 10 per cent believe in Sasquatch, and another 20 per cent say they're unsure. 

Roughly one in four Canadians say they've had a ghost or spirit encounter—most often involving a deceased relative. People described seeing or feeling their presence, or even smelling familiar scents. Many found these experiences comforting. 

Some also reported classic ghost story moments in unfamiliar places, like hotels, and a few described cryptid sightings. One memorable account involved seeing a Sasquatch with a blanket over its shoulder near the Trans-Canada Highway. 

I actually expected belief levels to be higher. About 44 per cent of Canadians believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon—lower than the roughly 72 per cent reported in the U.S. or U.K. Still, when we include those who are neutral, most Canadians aren't firmly rejecting the paranormal. 

There were some differences, but not dramatic ones. Women were more likely to believe in ghosts and psychics. The youngest adults—ages 19 to 29—were less likely to believe than older age groups. That may reflect deeper secularization among younger Canadians, or it could shift with age. 

A lot of people assume that as societies become more secular or modern, people will believe more in science and less in what science can't explain. But it's more complicated than that. People live more secular lives, but may still hold beliefs that are classified as paranormal. 

We found that people who consider themselves somewhat or very religious—but who don't attend services regularly—were more likely to believe in the paranormal. People who attend services more often were less likely to believe in things like Sasquatch or psychics. That likely reflects how institutional religion shapes which beliefs people adopt. 

At the same time, most Canadians say they trust science. So it's not that they're rejecting science—it just seems they believe science doesn't explain everything. For many people, belief in the paranormal and science can coexist. 

We'd like to repeat the survey in a few years to see if beliefs are rising or declining. Especially with younger Canadians, it'll be interesting to track whether they remain less inclined toward paranormal belief, or if that changes with life experience. We're also continuing to analyze the personal stories people shared—they offer real insight into how people make meaning from these experiences.

Mariska Hargitay never set out to play a character like Olivia Benson, the street-smart NYPD captain with the heart of gold on “Law & Order: Special Victim Units.”

In fact, Hargitay, a former member of the famed Groundlings improv and sketch comedy troupe, had her hopes set on a being a sitcom star until a psychic told her she was destined for drama. She shared the story during the Oct. 21 episode of Amy Poehler's “Good Hang” podcast.

“How did I end up as America's sweetheart sex cop? I should have been you!"" Harigtay joked to the former “Saturday Night Live” star as both women laughed.

Early in her career, Hargitay recalled auditioning for roles on sitcoms, landing small parts on “Seinfeld” and “The Single Guy.” She also recalled repeatedly testing for a role on “Friends.” 

“I think it's Monica. I think, it was so long ago,” she said.

After her recurring role as the incompetent desk clerk Cynthia Hooper on Season 4 of “ER” wrapped, Hargitay found herself in  a development deal to star in an “Ally McBeal”-style dramedy series.

“That's what I wanted to do. I was like, I want to do drama, but it has to be funny,” she recalled. “That's what I felt like my gifts were.”

Hargitay, who lived in Los Angeles at the time, recalled how her professional plans changed shortly after she consulted a psychic on a trip to New York.

“I drove out somewhere on Long Island to this man and I went there,” the Emmy winner recalled. “He started staying all this amazing stuff to me. Stuff about my mom. Stuff about a ring. My grandmother had just died and he said there was going to be an issue with the ring, which there was.”

Hargitay said she was listening “really intently” to the psychic with a serious look on her face.

“And he said to me ... ‘You see that face you're doing right now? You see that face?'” Hargitay recalled, imitating the psychic's Southern twang. “‘You're going to be famous for that face. You're moving to New York and you're gonna be famous for that face.'”

When Hargitay protested, telling the psychic she was intent on being a “comedian” in LA, the psychic wouldn't hear it.

“He looks at me — and this is my favorite moment of my life — he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's a-- what you say. You're going to be famous for that face,'” Hargitay recalled.

Not long afterward, Hargitay landed the part of Benson on “SVU.”

“Six months later, I was walking around doing that face, going (imitating Benson interrogating a suspect), ‘Where were you Tuesday night?'” she joked.

Republican Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska on Tuesday warned President Donald Trump that his proposal for the U.S. to buy Argentina's beef will hurt American cattle ranchers and fail to lower prices.

""Bottom line: if the goal is addressing beef prices at the grocery store, this isn't the way,"" Fischer wrote in an X post.

Trump floated the idea over the weekend as a way to bring down beef costs, which have soared in the U.S. this year.

The tentative plan would involve further U.S. investment in Argentina, the South American nation whose teetering economy has recently been buoyed by a $20 billion currency swap deal with the Trump administration.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that the U.S. is considering providing Argentina another $20 billion in financing. Argentina President Javier Milei is a close ally of Trump.

Fischer wrote Tuesday morning that she has reached out to the Trump administration to express ""deep concerns"" about the possible Argentine beef buy.

""I've also been sounding the alarm on the bleak state of our ag economy and the negative impacts facing Nebraska's ag industry — the economic driver of our state,"" Fischer wrote.

""Right now, government intervention in the beef market will hurt our cattle ranchers. The U.S. has safe, reliable beef, and it is the one bright spot in our struggling ag economy,"" the senator wrote.

""Nebraska's ranchers cannot afford to have the rug pulled out from under them when they're just getting ahead or simply breaking even,"" she wrote.

""I strongly encourage the Trump administration to focus on trade deals that benefit our ag producers — not imports that will do more harm than good.""

Trump told reporters on Air Force One Sunday that his administration is ""thinking about doing"" the beef deal with Argentina.

""We would buy some beef from Argentina,"" Trump said. ""If we do that, that will bring our beef prices down.""

Asked to respond to U.S. farmers who feel that that deal would benefit Argentina over themselves, Trump was dismissive.

""Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don't know anything about it,"" he said.

""If I can help them survive in a free world — I happen to like the president of Argentina. I think he's trying to do the best he can. But don't make it sound like they're doing great. They are dying,"" Trump said.

The president's comments quickly raised alarms with U.S. cattle ranchers.

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said in a statement Monday that its farmers and ranchers ""are concerned that rewarding Argentina with this expanded access to the U.S. market harms American cattlemen and women, while also interfering with the free market.""

""This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,"" NCBA CEO Colin Woodall said in the same press release.

The Trump administration's financial assistance for Buenos Aires had already drawn the ire of American soybean producers, who are reeling from the loss of China as a top customer due to the ongoing trade war with the U.S.

China has started buying soybeans from Argentina, which reportedly suspended export taxes last month — a move that coincided with Trump's pledge to help Milei.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, asked Tuesday morning on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" about buying Argentine beef, noted that Trump ""has mentioned it a couple of times.""

""I think you'll be hearing more about exactly what that looks like,"" she said.

Rollins said the beef industry in the U.S. has become massively consolidated in recent years, which has resulted in thousands of farms closing.

""The prices are high. The president is very focused on his promise of keeping grocery prices down, but he's also very focused, and you'll hear more from us perhaps in the next day or two, on what we're are going to do to incentivize"" people to become ranchers, Rollins said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a statement to CNBC, did not directly address Fischer's concerns about the Argentina proposal.

""While prices for other proteins such as eggs, pork and chicken have declined in recent months, beef prices remain elevated. This is due to the perfect storm of sustained increase in consumer demand for beef coupled with a prolonged decrease in the supply of live cattle,"" a USDA spokesperson said.

""Building back the herd will take time but Secretary Rollins is committed to reduce risk for cattle producers, deliver robust disaster relief to cattle country, and support new and beginning ranchers across the country,"" the spokesperson said.
