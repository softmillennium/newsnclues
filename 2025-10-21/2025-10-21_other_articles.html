Harigtay joked to the former “Saturday Night Live” star as both women laughed. I think, it was so long ago,” she said. After her recurring role as the incompetent desk clerk Cynthia Hooper on Season 4 of “ER” wrapped, Hargitay found herself in  a development deal to star in an “Ally McBeal”-style dramedy series. “That's what I felt like my gifts were.” Hargitay, who lived in Los Angeles at the time, recalled how her professional plans changed shortly after she consulted a psychic on a trip to New York. “He started staying all this amazing stuff to me. My grandmother had just died and he said there was going to be an issue with the ring, which there was.” Hargitay said she was listening “really intently” to the psychic with a serious look on her face. “‘You're going to be famous for that face. When Hargitay protested, telling the psychic she was intent on being a “comedian” in LA, the psychic wouldn't hear it. “He looks at me — and this is my favorite moment of my life — he goes like this, ‘I don't give a rat's a-- what you say. You're going to be famous for that face,'” Hargitay recalled. Not long afterward, Hargitay landed the part of Benson on “SVU.” “Six months later, I was walking around doing that face, going (imitating Benson interrogating a suspect), ‘Where were you Tuesday night?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Minneapolis police officers spotted a spherical Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) with six glowing rings that changed colors. The anonymous witnesses filed a report with Americans for Safe Aerospace, a non-profit led by former US Navy pilot and whistleblower Ryan Graves, saying they observed the object from a parking garage using binoculars. The officers described the object as hovering at 10,000 feet, moving with both slow and hypersonic speeds, and generating lift without any sound. That UFO reportedly traveled along the Mississippi River at around 460mph, then abruptly slowed and silently descended behind nearby trees. While believers view the report as yet another sign of advanced unknown technology, skeptics argue the sighting likely has a conventional explanation, perhaps one already orbiting high above Earth. Alejandro Rojas, an advisor at Enigma Labs, which analyzes reports of UAPs, told Daily Mail that the sighting may have been NASA's International Space Station (ISS). What we see in the video could be the ISS, but we will need more details to rule it out,' he said. 'The video also doesn't look like 'six interlocking rings of colored lights.' Americans for Safe Aerospace advocates for transparency in UAP research and collects reports from credible witnesses, including military and law enforcement personnel. Graves posted on X that the platform has nearly 1000 reports, noting that more are set to be released. He is a former US Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot who became one of the first military aviators to speak publicly about routine UFO encounters during training missions off the East Coast. Graves first drew national attention after revealing that Navy pilots regularly encountered unidentified craft off the US East Coast between 2014 and 2015, objects that appeared to defy known flight physics. These objects were detected both visually and on radar, appeared to hover against strong winds, and could accelerate instantly without visible propulsion. Graves later said the encounters were so frequent they became part of pre-flight safety briefings. He later testified before Congress about the risks these unidentified objects pose to flight safety. Graves said the incidents were so common that pilots began discussing them as part of pre-flight safety briefings. He emphasized that whatever these craft are, advanced foreign tech or something else, they represent a serious aviation safety concern.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two newly released peer-reviewed studies suggest that unidentified flying objects may have inadvertently been telescope-photographed in Earth's orbit prior to the development of satellites and space exploration. The studies by Dr. Beatriz Villarroel and her colleagues have identified bright “transient” objects that appeared in photographs but were not present in photographs taken soon thereafter. The transient nature of these lights strongly suggests they are not stars. Unlike many researchers who find alien UFOs in flares and balloons, Villarroel and her colleagues do not conclude that the transient objects are truly exotic UFOs. They simply offer their scientific research in the suggestion that the transient objects may be truly exotic UFOs and that more study is prudent. The first study notes, “One plausible explanation is that they are caused by brief light emissions from artificial objects in orbit or by objects with anomalous movements in Earth's atmosphere — emissions so brief that they appear as point sources rather than streaks, despite the telescope tracking the stars. Alternatively, they could arise from solar reflections off flat, highly reflective surfaces at geosynchronous altitudes.” Notably, this particular event coincides in time with one of the most extensively documented aerial anomalies in historical records: the Washington D.C. “UFO flap” of 1952 July, which unfolded over two consecutive weekends (July 18–19 and 26–27).… [Telescope photographic] plate defects or scanning artifacts are expected to occur randomly in time; the fact that these transient alignments appear preferentially within a day of reported [unidentified aerial phenomena] events strongly disfavors instrumental or spurious origins.” The D.C. UFO flap saw multiple radar and visual reports by military personnel of apparently fast-moving, bright objects flying in and around the capital region. Fighter jets were repeatedly deployed to intercept the objects, but could not maintain pace with them. Villarroel further asserts, “No matter how asymmetric or irregular the distributions of plate defects may be, they have no plausible reason to avoid the Earth's shadow. This shadow test provides a crucial empirical lever to distinguish between physical reflections and random defects—and remains an essential part of any validation framework moving forward.” Even if individual events remain uncertain, Bruehl & Villarroel (2025) shows statistically significant correlations between subsets of the transient sample in Solano et al. (2022) and historical nuclear activity and aerial anomalies. As the Washington Examiner has previously reported, and Robert Hastings has extensively documented, there is compelling evidence to suggest an unknown correlation between nuclear systems and a small subset of UFOs that manifest intelligent control and technologies far beyond those of any Earth nation. This stands them in stark contrast to other prominent figures in the UFO community who leverage wildly unsubstantiated claims to make money via lucrative TV shows. The UFO community has been frustrated by its inability to lobby for greater Congressional and government action. A good place to start in remedying this situation would be to focus attention away from entertainers and toward others, such as Villarroel, who choose the harder but more forensic approach of bold science.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Baltimore, MD – October 21, 2025 – Comet, the free TV home for fans of science fiction, fantasy, horror and supernatural series and movies, will celebrate its 10th anniversary on October 31, 2025, with a special lineup of blockbuster and cult classic movies. In addition, the network will feature a 10-day social media countdown filled with throwback promos and clips from the network's first decade, which kicks off today. In addition, Comet has made a series of strategic national distribution agreements, channel upgrades, and new multicast affiliate launches. The network has grown its household coverage by 80% since launch[1], added upgrades on the CBS O&Os and added distribution on YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, one of the first multicast networks to be included on these platforms. Comet has also built its own annual celebration of fandom with COMET FEST, a linear, digital and in-person event which featured the original Jurassic Park trilogy for its 3rd iteration this summer. With more than 2.4 million total viewers[2] tuning in, COMET FEST once again demonstrated the power of fan-first programming to drive audience loyalty and market-leading performance. “Comet was built by and for fans, and that connection is what's fueled our success for the last ten years,” said Adam Ware, Senior Vice President of Growth Networks, Sinclair. “From our first broadcast we've stayed true to what audiences love most: smart, imaginative, larger-than-life storytelling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for Forwarding the News, our essential morning briefing with trusted, nonpartisan news and analysis, curated by senior writer Benyamin Cohen. A newly tracked interstellar comet, which has been dubbed 3I/ATLAS and is likely to pass the sun, Jupiter, Mars and Venus this autumn, but nowhere near Earth, has sparked some unexpectedly Jewish reflections. Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor of astronomy, has posited that comets and space debris might be products of extraterrestrial intelligence and has theorized that there is a 60% likelihood that 3I/ATLAS is an extraterrestrial construction. Elsewhere, Loeb has suggested that after the arrival of extraterrestrials on Earth, “old religions might die and new religions might be born,” implying the possible end of Judaism, as one of the old-time religions. The professor has stated that he is “very proud” of Jewish tradition because “there's a lot of wisdom in it,” which might be seen as a neat understatement. But at the same time, in a blog he has declared that because the earth is no safe haven for Jews, it might be a good idea to move to outer space, where there are no lethal proprietary struggles of the Middle East type nor any antisemitism. This notion, although meant perhaps only half-seriously, overlooks the Jewish tradition of earth as a potentially blessed place for Jews, however long the blessing lasts. The biblical Book of Isaiah uses the term Beulah (from the Hebrew word for married) to refer to the land of Israel after its restoration, a symbolic state of being in a blessed covenant with God on earth, not in outer space. At the same time, Loeb has cautioned that extraterrestrial visitors might have malign motives and earthlings would not be able to oppose them;  on the other hand, ETs might also be nicer and better than humans. Justifying his assertion that roaming extraterrestrials seeking earthly contacts might be benevolent, Loeb stated: “Lonely people do not engage in blind dates if they believe that their dating partners are likely to be serial killers,” going on to observe that such interstellar wandering lonely hearts are “motivated to seek partners if they believe that kindness is abundant on the dating scene.” Whatever the eHarmony aspect of intergalactic dating might be, the concept of visitors from outer space who are kind to Jews and others is contradicted by Loeb's repeated claims that interstellar comets could also be espionage vehicles with menacing intent. These dire predictions have worried some readers, while annoying fellow astronomers who have called them mere distractions, implying that the time spent denying Loeb's much-publicized, highly improbable theories might be better used for further research. Still, Loeb is far from the first to associate Yiddishkeit with extraterrestrial phenomena — the tradition goes back at least as far as the vision of a chariot-like structure with four wheels described in the Bible's Book of Ezekiel, symbolizing God's omnipresence, omniscience and mobility. More recently, the Jewish psychiatrist John Mack, also affiliated with Harvard, investigated unproven claims of alien abductions, including one made by an Israeli woman who, under hypnosis, recalled a former 13th century life as an Arab merchant famed for justice and benevolence. These and other examples have been examined by David Halperin, an expert on Jews and UFOs, who alludes to the eminent American Jewish astronomer Carl Sagan, who was open-minded about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, but concluded that as yet, no purported discoveries had been proven scientifically. In a recent blog post, Loeb, who has previously likened his detractors to those who dismissed Galileo, Madame Curie, and the Wright Brothers,  compared himself  to a Jewish child prisoner in Theresienstadt concentration camp who drew idealized images of a “better world” rather than the grim reality of a Nazi jail. Loeb noted that he and others who dream “of a better world than Earth” might “guide [humanity] to the promised land” by encountering aliens. Whatever one thinks of these comparisons, Jews have long sought and found extraterrestrial inspiration in earthly phenomena, and the wisest scientific mavens, including Sagan and others, have remained temperate, whether or not such theories turned out to be factual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly half of Canadians believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon, according to a new UBC study exploring ghost sightings, alien encounters and cryptid beliefs across the country. Many Canadians reported 'ghost story' moments in hotels among their paranormal experiences. From ghost stories to Sasquatch sightings, belief in the paranormal is alive and well in Canada—though perhaps not as strong as you might think. A new national survey by UBC sociologists Dr. Tony Silva and Dr. Emily Huddart finds that nearly half of Canadians believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon. We spoke with Dr. Silva, associate professor in the department of sociology, about their findings. Most previous research has focused on the U.S. or Europe. Canada is one of the most secular countries in the world, but we hadn't seen a representative survey here in decades. We wanted to know how secularization, media and cultural shifts might be shaping people's beliefs in things science can't explain. About one-third of Canadians agree that places can be haunted by spirits, and roughly one in five believe that aliens have visited Earth. A lot of people are also on the fence—another quarter neither agree nor disagree. That middle ground was a big finding for us: Many Canadians don't have strong convictions either way, but they're open to the idea. Belief in cryptids like Sasquatch or Ogopogo was less common, but still notable—around 10 per cent believe in Sasquatch, and another 20 per cent say they're unsure. Some also reported classic ghost story moments in unfamiliar places, like hotels, and a few described cryptid sightings. About 44 per cent of Canadians believe in at least one paranormal phenomenon—lower than the roughly 72 per cent reported in the U.S. or U.K. Women were more likely to believe in ghosts and psychics. That may reflect deeper secularization among younger Canadians, or it could shift with age. A lot of people assume that as societies become more secular or modern, people will believe more in science and less in what science can't explain. People live more secular lives, but may still hold beliefs that are classified as paranormal. We found that people who consider themselves somewhat or very religious—but who don't attend services regularly—were more likely to believe in the paranormal. People who attend services more often were less likely to believe in things like Sasquatch or psychics. That likely reflects how institutional religion shapes which beliefs people adopt. At the same time, most Canadians say they trust science. For many people, belief in the paranormal and science can coexist. Especially with younger Canadians, it'll be interesting to track whether they remain less inclined toward paranormal belief, or if that changes with life experience. We're also continuing to analyze the personal stories people shared—they offer real insight into how people make meaning from these experiences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Acclaimed Filipino-American author Jason Tanamor brings a thrilling fusion of folklore and urban fantasy to life in “Vampires of Portlandia,” a genre-bending tale that transports readers from the Philippines to the eccentric streets of Portland, Oregon. When a mysterious rise in murders threatens to expose their existence, Percival and his love interest Penelope Jane must uncover who broke the aswang covenant—and why. As the investigation unfolds, they discover that Portland's supernatural underworld runs far deeper than imagined, teeming with were beasts, witches, ghouls, and viscera who have long called the city home. What follows is an atmospheric, fast-paced tale that blends Filipino legend with modern sensibilities, creating a world where myth and reality coexist—often uneasily. “It's about immigration, family, and the struggle to find community when you feel like an outsider. The aswang are metaphors for cultural identity—they're trying to survive in a world that doesn't understand them.” Readers who enjoyed “The Witcher” or “American Gods” will find similar layers of myth and meaning—woven here through a distinctly Filipino lens. With rich world-building, complex characters, and a narrative pulsing with heart and heritage, “Vampires of Portlandia” cements Jason Tanamor as a unique voice in modern fantasy. “Vampires of Portlandia” is now available everywhere books are sold — secure your copy here: https://www.tanamor.com/books/vampires-of-portlandia.html For review copies, interview requests, or additional information, please contact: The post ‘Vampires Of Portlandia': Jason Tanamor Reimagines Filipino Folklore In A Supernatural Pacific Northwest Tale first appeared on</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year alone has seen a set of new Coben adaptations dropping on Netflix, including Missing You, Just One Look, and Caught. Meanwhile, Prime Video's Lazarus (not to be confused with the anime series released earlier this year on HBO Max) is penned by Coben alongside BAFTA-winner Danny Brocklehurst, and it's a dark and twisty murder mystery with a mysteriously supernatural edge. The often tense series is kept continually fresh and novel thanks to a barrage of moving parts that mostly work. Its more unusual, otherworldly scenes are a standout element and the secret sauce of Lazarus' success, but a few persistent narrative issues hold it back from full greatness. The new series follows Joel Lazarus (Sam Claflin), a forensic psychologist who returns home after the death of his father, Dr. Jonathan Lazarus (About Time's Bill Nighy). As Joel spends copious time in his father's office attempting to make some sense of the tragedy (and of a very odd suicide note), he starts to have some, well, haunting experiences about his father's old clients. The tragedy also brings back an obsession with the murder of Joel's beloved sister Jenna (Alexandra Roach) 25 years prior, a set of factors leading to an increasingly set of terrible reveals as Joel tries to unearth the truth. Is there foul play in his father's supposed suicide? The centerpiece of Lazarus is an intense and emotional performance from Sam Claflin. Claflin lands complicated emotional beats with an intelligent on-screen presence while also being believably harried in the process. Nighy brings an air of guarded authority to a character with mysterious hidden layers. He shares an excellent and believable onscreen relationship with Claflin, and the pair do a great job navigating a series of tense exchanges. The series' drama is propelled by interesting reveals and surprises, alongside a gradual succession of Joel's supernatural experiences. Between that dynamic and carefully dreamy cinematography in the odder moments, Lazarus has a novel quality to it. As an entire package, Lazarus manages to feel fresh, but the explanations at its center are a mixed bag. One of its biggest mysteries, that of the senior Lazarus' suicide, wraps up with a true surprise, but another major plotline might feel fairly steadily telegraphed and predictable to anyone with a firm command of genre storytelling. Ultimately, Lazarus is an engaging if uneven viewing experience. It's hard to make a thriller investigation series feel fully new, given how prominent the genre's themes are. Harlan Coben's Lazarus boasts an intriguing mystery, standing out thanks to unusual supernatural elements, but its genre tropes don't fully click. Lazarus follows a man's return home after his father's suicide, where he encounters unexplainable disturbances. As he delves into the mystery of his father's death and his sister's murder from 25 years ago, he becomes entangled in a series of cold-case murders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ESPN's Stephen A. Smith has taken a more favorable stance on Kyrie Irving over the last few years, and now he's backing the NBA player's anti-vax ideas. Speaking on the "7PM In Brooklyn" podcast, Smith supported Irving's refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, saying he was “right” not to take it. The NBA did not have a mandate in place but ordered players to follow local laws. “Kyrie's a good brother,” Smith said. “And I'm like, yo man, this brother's electrifying, I want to see this brother dancing on the basketball court. Get your a** on the court. Now, obviously in hindsight, the brother's right because we see all the conspiracy theories that came out. We didn't see that at the time.” Smith was not clear about what “conspiracy theories” backed Irving up in his eyes. The CDC currently recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for “most” people 18 and over to prevent illness, hospitalization and death.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theories about Princess Diana's death left Virginia Giuffre feeling scared and powerless after allegedly being made to have sex with Prince Andrew, as she was surrounded by people with immense power and influence, her posthumous memoir reveals. Prince Andrew's accuser passed away by suicide in April at the age of 41 but before her death she completed her memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' which has been released today (October 21). What subsequently emerged from Giuffre's 400-page, diary-style account was a clear determination to expose how power, corruption and alleged sexual exploitation left lasting scars on victims like herself. Prince Andrew is referenced 88 times in Nobody's Girl as Giuffre provided graphic details of her alleged abuse by the late financier and child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Among shocking revelations, the memoir discloses Giuffre's account of being 17 and staying at Ghislaine Maxwell's London home when Maxwell told her Prince Andrew would be joining them for dinner. “Just like Cinderella, I was going to meet a handsome prince,” she wrote. However, what allegedly followed was anything but a fairy tale. Giuffre recounted that after allegedly having sex with Andrew for the first time, she was left deeply affected by conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death, feeling vulnerable and powerless among people who, in her words, “wielded vastly more clout than I ever would". She recalled her then-boyfriend Tony Figueroa being “scared that I was alone in a foreign country with people so powerful; he said he understood why I felt powerless,” and noted that “less than four years earlier, Lady Diana had died in a car accident, prompting some conjecture (never proven) that the Royal Family had somehow been involved.” Epstein was first convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor. He operated a vast sex trafficking ring involving underage girls and powerful individuals until his arrest in July 2019 and subsequent death in August 2019. Maxwell, a British socialite, was Epstein's close confidante and was convicted in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming young girls for abuse. In 2015, Giuffre accused Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her in 2001, when she was 17 years old, as part of Epstein and Maxwell's sex trafficking network. In a 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said: "It didn't happen. He also claimed he had "no recollection of ever meeting" Giuffre and provided an alibi for the night she alleges the abuse took place. Despite his denials, Prince Andrew settled a civil lawsuit brought by Giuffre in early 2022 without admitting any wrongdoing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a great time of the month to ask that question as we approach Halloween. Local paranormal specialist Alex Matsuo is deeply involved in ghosts, ghost stories, haunted houses, and making sure that it's not just a tree branch scratching the side of your house when the wind blows that's freaking you out. “First we try to debunk” what are some of the things that may explain something weird in your neighborhood, she said, noting that a feeling of being watched can be explained by uneven floors in your house. Thanks to tariffs, the cost of Halloween costumes are more trick than treat Matsuo said odd smells in your house can be explained by “walls and carpets that have absorbed smells and only emit them under certain conditions.” Also on the list is faulty wiring that may explain flashing lights; an animal that's actually the noise behind unexplained footsteps; and mental illness. But having experienced a paranormal presence herself, Matsuo said, “Ultimately, if we do run into something we can't explain, then that makes it more interesting.” “I saw the man who died everywhere,” she said. Matsuo said this went on until the Greek Orthodox Church sent a woman to anoint her. After going through a guided meditation, the ghost went away. Matsuo will be hosting another lecture later this month on Arlington's haunted places, including a home supposedly haunted by Jim Morrison, the famed lead singer of The Doors.
