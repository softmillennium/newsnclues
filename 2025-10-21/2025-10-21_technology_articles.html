                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total 2025 compensation rose nearly 22% from $79.1 million to almost $96.5 million, due mostly to the company's booming share price boosting the value of his stock awards. The numbers were disclosed Tuesday afternoon in the company's annual proxy statement, along with details on Microsoft board changes, shareholder proposals raising concerns about AI risks, and a request from the board for shareholders to approve a new stock plan. Microsoft's board nominated Walmart CFO John David Rainey as a new board member, to replace Carlos Rodriguez, current chair of the compensation committee, who is not seeking re-election. Much of Nadella's total compensation — about $84.2 million — is based on the performance of the company's stock, which has risen more than 23% in the past year, at one point pushing Microsoft's total market value briefly past $4 trillion. For the first time, security was used as one measuring stick for Microsoft executive compensation, part of an effort by the company to appease regulators and lawmakers after a series of high-profile breaches. In its review, the board focused on Nadella's role in attempting to address these issues through the implementation of its Secure Future Initiative. Nadella recently appointed veteran executive Judson Althoff as CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, a move designed to free Nadella to focus more intensely on long-term AI strategy and technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Seattle startup is betting that artificial intelligence can take marketing off the plate of small business owners. Omada.ai, founded earlier this year by longtime tech entrepreneur Pete Christothoulou, officially launched Tuesday with what it describes as an “AI marketing team” designed to handle the day-to-day digital marketing tasks for small and midsize business owners. Backed by Crosslink Capital, HubSpot Ventures, and Seattle-based firm Ascend, the startup says its platform can plan, create, and optimize marketing campaigns automatically for less than $9 per day. “Their agent-based architecture delivers a truly autonomous and proactive system that gives small business owners the access to capabilities and marketing expertise they've never had access to before,” Adam Coccari, managing director at HubSpot Ventures, said in a statement. Omada's pitch is that it acts less like another app and more like a full-service team — a “do-it-for-me” model rather than “do-it-yourself.” Its agents are built on proprietary infrastructure that coordinates specialized AI models for language, vision, and audio tasks. Larger companies such as HubSpot, Canva, and Adobe have also embedded AI marketing tools into their small business offerings. Omada marks Christothoulou's latest foray into applying automation and data intelligence to the marketing world. Christothoulou served as CEO at Marchex until 2016 and later launched Xembly, a Seattle startup that developed an “AI chief of staff” to automate productivity tasks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cryptocurrency promoted in January by US first lady Melania Trump was part of a sophisticated fraud that “leveraged celebrity association and ‘borrowed fame' to sell legitimacy to unsuspecting investors,” a new legal filing has alleged. In April, crypto investors brought a federal class action lawsuit against Benjamin Chow, cofounder of crypto exchange Meteora, and Hayden Davis, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Kelsier Labs, among other defendants, accusing them of a multimillion-dollar fraud involving a single memecoin, $M3M3. They claimed the pair had colluded to rig the market for $LIBRA, a coin promoted by Javier Milei, president of Argentina, which collapsed in value shortly after launch. On Tuesday, the plaintiffs sought the court's permission to file yet another amended complaint, based on alleged information provided by an anonymous whistleblower. The scheme allegedly inflicted millions of dollars in losses on unwitting investors. Trump, who is not a named defendant in the lawsuit, was used as “window dressing for a crime engineered by Meteora and Kelsier,” the proposed second amended complaint alleges. “This case could clarify basic expectations for token launches and disclosures in the US. The White House, Chow, and Davis did not respond immediately to requests for comment. By the time Chow and Davis launched $MELANIA in January, they had refined a “repeatable six-step ‘playbook' for pump-and-dump fraud,” the investors claim. Together, the filing alleges, they effectively control a network of “sniper” crypto wallets that snatch up large quantities of the coins at artificially discounted prices, then dump them on the market as regular investors pile in. “Going to try to tell all my buddies early,” Davis told an acquaintance prior to the $MELANIA launch, in a private exchange that features in redacted form as an exhibit in the lawsuit. Before launch, Davis prepared a carefully coordinated marketing campaign for $MELANIA, recruiting a network of paid crypto influencers to synchronously flood social media platforms with promotional messaging, the proposed second amended complaint alleges. The coin had a paper value of $1.6 billion at its height. It has since lost 95 percent of its peak value. “Investors reasonably interpreted the use of Melania Trump's name and likeness as evidence of legitimacy and due diligence—trusting that no one of her stature would knowingly associate with a fraudulent venture,” the proposed second amended complaint claims. But prior to launch, wallets controlled by Meteora and Kelsier had allegedly accumulated almost a third of the entire $MELANIA supply. Though the complaint does not allege any wrongdoing on the part of Trump, her family has been criticized heavily for its many and various forays into the crypto industry, which critics have cast as a glaring conflict of interest.

M5 chip delivers solid performance gains over its predecessor Nano-texture display option worth the price of admission Still no Wi-Fi 7, even though the Apple N1 chip is available in other devices Space Black is a fingerprint magnet despite Apple's claims Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Our review unit came equipped with a 1TB SSD and 32GB of RAM, but those are both pricey upgrade options for what is the entry point into the MacBook Pro family. With an as-tested price of $2,349, it's an expensive purchase for a MacBook without a “Pro” or “Max” in its CPU name. Apple has been using this same chassis for multiple generations, save for some changes to the available colors (like Space Black replacing Space Gray). Our review unit came cloaked in Space Black, which is a fingerprint magnet. The chassis is solid, with none of the flex that you'll find in systems that use plastic or a combination of plastic and aluminum. I've always been a fan of MagSafe and was happy to see it return when the current chassis design debuted back with the M1 Pro and Max chips. The way it's positioned, it sits in the space that is usually occupied by the Menu bar for apps, so I don't feel like I'm being robbed of any additional screen real estate. Do I wish that Apple found a better way to integrate the webcam? The other item of note with our MacBook Pro review unit is that it has the nano-texture display option, which costs an additional $150. The screen coating reduces glare and helps to minimize reflections, which can be beneficial outdoors, or in indoor areas with bright light sources.

Our 14-inch MacBook review unit measures 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches and weighs 3.4 pounds, which is identical to last year's model with the M4. 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display with Nano-texture option, 3,024 x 1,964, 120 Hz ProMotion 3x Thunderbolt 4 over USB Type-C, HDMI 2.1, SDXC card slot, 3.5 mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3 Our review unit is equipped with Apple's newly released M5 processor, which is also found (for now) in the iPad Pro and Vision Pro. The new MacBook Pro had no trouble outdistancing the other assembled competition — 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4), Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition (Core Ultra 7 258V), Dell 16 Premium (Core Ultra 7 255H) — in every performance benchmark. Apple consistently delivers anywhere from 10- to 20-percent improvements over the prior generation when it comes to CPU performance, and the M5 is no exception. However, the CPU isn't the only area that Apple decided to address when it comes to hardware upgrades. In our file transfer test, which copies 25GB of data, we saw 1,917.35 MBps compared to 1,167.29 MBps for the M4 MacBook Pro (also with a 1TB SSD). Last year's 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) completed the job in four minutes and 57 seconds. We use Cinebench 2024 to stress test laptops, and the benchmark estimates a single-core clock of 4.6 GHz and a multi-core clock of 3.5 GHz. In the real world, we saw 57 frames per second (FPS) at 1200p and 28 FPS at native resolution in Shadow of the Tomb Raider. In addition, our review unit managed 44 fps at 1200p and 31 fps at native resolution in Cyberpunk 2077 using the “For this Mac” setting. Apple's MacBook Pro family uses an IPS display with Mini LED backlighting. This is a noticeable upgrade from the entry-level MacBook Air, with its more traditional LED-backlit IPS display. Although this Mini LED can't quite touch the black level performance of competing OLED panels, it still a great looking display. The nano-texture display option, as configured on our review unit, is a great addition. My personal laptop is an older 14-inch MacBook Pro (M3) with the glossy screen finish. I'm not a musical kind of guy by any means, but I went to the theater last year with my wife and thoroughly enjoyed Wicked. Color performance was virtually unchanged compared to M4 MacBook Pro, which shows that Apple is likely using the same panels year-over-year. However, the Yoga 9i had more saturated colors, thanks to its OLED panel. They're clicky with just enough travel to satisfy my fingers, and are far superior to problematic butterfly switches that Apple thankfully banished. Apple employs single-zone white LED backlighting, which turns on automatically in low-light conditions. If you want to manually control the keyboard backlighting, you can do so by navigating to System Settings --> Keyboard. Another feature that I like on MacBooks is the large haptic trackpad, which simulates a physical “click.” The benefit of this design over traditional top-hinged trackpads that you find in Windows laptops is that the surface will register a click no matter where you press. The glass surface also is smooth to the touch, allowing my finger to easily glide when navigating through macOS Tahoe. The sound system on our review unit hasn't changed compared to last year, which is a good thing. The six-speaker setup is one of the best you'll find on any laptop regardless of price, and includes support for Dolby Digital, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus and Apple Spatial Audio. I played Rainey Haynes' “I'm Old Enough to Rock and Roll,” which is a jamming track from one of my favorite 80's movies: Iron Eagle. Even with the volume dialed up to near max levels, I could barely discern distortion. While you can remove four pentalobe screws at the bottom of the chassis to remove the cover, it won't do you any good when it comes other upgrading system components. The M5 SoC is a system-on-a-chip design with our review unit's 32GB included on-die. Our 14-inch MacBook Pro unit is equipped with a 72.4 Whr battery, enough to deliver 18 hours and 14 minutes of runtime using our battery test, which involves browsing the web, running OpenGL tests, and streaming video at 150 nits of brightness. However, this result was 20 minutes less than last year's MacBook Pro with the M4. The Yoga 9i 2-in-1 Aura Edition was also no match, with a runtime of 12 hours and 47 minutes. We measured skin temperatures during our Cinebench 2024 stress test on the 14-inch MacBook Pro. The touchpad was much cooler at 82.8 F. The system overall felt warm, but it was tolerable to sit on my lap while wearing shorts. The overall system temperature, which takes an average of several components (i.e., power supply, battery, SSD, logic board, etc.) Like last year's mode, the new M5 uses a 12MP Center Stage camera. Image quality looked impeccable, with good detail in my face (wrinkles, grey hairs in my beard, and everything else), and excellent color representation. I used the camera while sitting on a couch with a brightly lit window behind me, and the picture still looked great without blowing out details or causing halo effects. The Center Stage feature keeps your face centered in the frame during calls, should you move around in your seat. This an overabundant use of translucent menus and icons, which reflect displayed content in real time. Now that Liquid Glass is in its final form, I'm mostly OK with how it looks, mainly because its reach in macOS Tahoe isn't as broad as it is in iOS or iPadOS. Besides the fresh coat of paint for the UI, macOS Tahoe brings features like Live Translation for the Messages app and FaceTime, Live Activities for Mac, a refresh Phone app, Call Screening, more intelligent search Spotlight, and a universal clipboard (with history). Apple Intelligence was a prominent new feature Apple announced last year for macOS Sequoia, but most of the headlining features involving Siri never materialized. Apple took a lot of flak for overpromising and underdelivering, and expect the previously announced Siri features to debut sometime next year. With that said, macOS continues to be a well-rounded operating system with a slew of Apple-provided apps out of the box. One of my favorites is iPhone Mirroring, which allows you full access to your iPhone's screen from your macOS Tahoe desktop. It especially comes in handy when I need to perform two-factor authentication verification with my phone, and my phone is in another room or I'm too lazy to dig it out of my pocket. Apple offers three preconfigured options for the M5 MacBook Pro, all of which feature the M5 chip with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU. The base system features 16GB of unified memory and a 512GB SSD for $1,599. The middle tier includes a 1TB SSD for an additional $200 ($1,799). The top configuration gives you 24GB of unified memory and a 1TB SSD for $1,999. Our review unit came with 32GB of unified memory, a 1TB SSD, and the nano-texture display option, which brought the as-tested price to $2,349. That's quite pricey for an entry-level MacBook Pro with Apple's base-level chip. Apple's MacBook Pro comes with a one-year warranty. The coverage adds unlimited repairs covering accidents, 24/7 priority tech support, and battery replacement. Not only did Apple increase CPU performance for the 14-inch MacBook Pro this year with the brawny new M5, but it also delivered a healthy uplift in SSD performance. The performance is wrapped in a high-quality chassis with plenty of ports for pro users, although the Space Black finish remains susceptible to fingerprints. Our usual complaints about Apple laptops remain, including the high price of SSD and memory upgrades. I'll add one more: the lack of Wi-Fi 7. I find it odd that a laptop starting at $1,599 doesn't include Wi-Fi 7 as standard equipment, and this is made even more puzzling considering that Apple's excellent N1 Wi-Fi chip is available already in the iPhone 17/Air/Pro and the new iPad Pro (M5). Both the Dell and Lenovo assembled here include Wi-Fi 7. While we reviewed the Dell 16 Premium and used it as a competitor here, the Dell 14 Premium, which aligns more closely with the 14-inch MacBook Pro in terms of size, includes Wi-Fi 7 standard in its base $1,249 configuration. However, if you're coming from a much older M1 or M2 version, the performance gains are hard to ignore. With that said, at its base price of $1,599 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is a strong productivity workhorse. Brandon Hill is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware.

You may have heard about an upcoming fantasy MacBook Pro with a thinner chassis, an OLED display, and even a touchscreen. All the unchanged elements still rank it among the best laptops you can buy, just don't expect anything too Earth-shattering in this otherwise modest upgrade. In a year when performance is the only generational change, it was very smart for Apple to release the M5 MacBook Pro ahead of the other MacBooks. That means as of now, there's no M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro or M5 Max chips, or 16-inch MacBook Pro. These are probably not too far off, but the introduction of the M5 will tempt some people to buy this MacBook Pro instead one that is better suited for their needs. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Don't forget: historically, there's only around a two percent difference in performance between the Air and the Pro. Apple wants to talk up the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 as a powerful performer, and it is. But it's the display, port selection, and portability that distinguishes this MacBook Pro from the MacBook Air, none of which has changed in this generation. With that disclaimer out of the way, I want to unabashedly say: The M5 is pretty amazing. Benchmarks are just benchmarks, but as a laptop reviewer, I sat up in my chair when I saw the M5 hit 200 in single-core performance on Cinebench 2024. It's a first for any chip, and it's an area where Apple remains in a different league compared to the competition. Single-core performance is useful for bursty, frequency-sensitive tasks like opening applications, responsiveness in complex tasks, and in software like games. But 200 is just an abstract number.

So, if you want more multi-core performance, you'll need to wait for the M5 Pro or M5 Max. But for now, the M5 is seeing around a 17 percent improvement in multi-core performance too—and again, that's without increasing the core count. This is all good stuff, but I'm not sure that the average person will really notice the benefit in day-to-day performance. The M5 MacBook Pro remains great at not using the fan unless totally necessary, but when it does kick on, it's quite loud. I'm assuming it's around the same as the M4 MacBook Pro, but I didn't have it side by side to compare. I've seen CPU temperatures in MacBooks happily peak at 105 degrees Celsius when under full load. But I never measured anything over 89 degrees Celsius on this laptop, which is a great sign. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Storage performance is also an area of improvement Apple has highlighted, now using the latest PCIe Gen 5 standard to result in twice the SSD read and write speeds. Again, you have to compare apples to apples here, because the M4 Pro and Max models already had faster read/write speeds over the base M4. You can now configure this to 4 terabytes, up from 2 terabytes on the previous M4 and M4 Pro models. While the M5 happily keeps the CPU performance gains humming along, its larger strides are in graphics and AI. Regardless of what you think about the implementation of Apple Intelligence, there plenty of other things you can do with local AI processing, whether that's run on-device LLMs through apps like Draw Things or Misty Studio, both of which can leverage the AI hardware inside the M5 MacBook Pro. There are two primary changes to the M5 in terms of AI performance. One is the faster Neural Engine, which handles AI tasks that require speed or that run in the background, such as Apple Intelligence. The idea here is to speed up heavier, one-time AI workloads, especially in apps that already rely heavily on GPU performance, such as in video editing software. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. That means the M3 Max, M4 Pro—and especially the M4 Max—are still much more powerful chips in terms of graphics. It's quite an achievement that the M5—which will inevitably show up in a $999 MacBook Air—is as powerful as the $2,000 M3 Pro MacBook Pro when it launched.

You can, to my surprise, play the game at 1920 x 1200 without upscaling and get decent frame rates at the Medium or Low graphics settings. Averaging 39 frames per second on Medium or 51 fps on Low is decent, but in case you're wondering, there's still a massive gap between this and a discrete GPU—even a low-tier one. I recently tested the RTX 5050 in the Acer Nitro V 16, and it netted 53 percent faster frame rates in Cyberpunk 2077 in the same resolution. Admittedly, that's a much thicker laptop, but my point is that the base M5 does not make the MacBook Pro a true gaming machine. The M5 Pro and Max, however, may end up being a very different story, as the M4 Pro and M4 Max were already truly impressive on the GPU front. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I also tried out both Apple's own MetalFX and AMD's FSR 3.0 upscaling, which can boost the frame rates up to 70 fps on the Balanced setting, but I still found that I preferred the crisper native experience. You won't be using the new third-gen ray tracing engine much, at least not without over-relying on upscaling. But while I was at it, I also spun up Lies of P and Resident Evil: Village, and saw similar results. You might have to reduce settings, but you can play these games natively now at playable frame rates, which is a big step forward. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Although it's louder than other MacBooks as mentioned earlier, it's downright quiet compared to a proper gaming laptop. The fact that you can play a game as heavy as Cyberpunk 2077 at all without it sounding like a jet engine is notable on its own. Despite long sessions of benchmarking and gaming, the surfaces stayed relatively cool throughout, which makes for a much more pleasant gaming experience. There's nothing new to say about the MacBook Pro's design or display, which despite having remained stagnant, are still among the best on the market. I do think the MacBook Pro is a bit thick for the type of laptop it is, but at 0.61 inches, it's still fairly portable. The chassis has been around since 2021 when the M1 MacBook Pro was released, so it feels old at this point. I'm perhaps most weary of the notch in the screen, which I've always disliked but feels more and more outdated with each passing year. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. When it comes to the screen, I'm as excited about Apple's transition to OLED as much everyone else. It's been a year and a half since Apple released the tandem OLED iPad Pro, with its incredible brightness for HDR, and here we are, still with a four-year old display on these high-end MacBooks. However, I refuse to complain about a display this sharp, fast, colorful, accurate, and bright. With a resolution of 3024 x 1964 on the 14.2-inch screen, it has a pixel density of 254 pixels per inch, which is sharper than anything except 4K screens, which aren't particularly common on 14-inch laptops. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It does not feel like Apple is falling behind by continuing to use this screen, but with the glut of bright OLED laptops out there, you can't say that Apple has the de factor best laptop display. I do still love the nano-texture screen, though, which blocks reflections and glare without making the screen look washed out in a way no other solution does. Another thing I'm glad that hasn't changed are the speakers and webcam. The six-speaker audio system is bassy, full, loud, and crystal clear. The 1080p, 12-megapixel webcam isn't as much of a dead ringer as the speakers, but is still one of the better laptop webcams out there. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. In terms of ports, it's all the same, meaning you still get three USB-C Thunderbolt ports, HDMI 2.1, a full-sized SD card slot, a headphone jack, and the MagSafe 3 charger. Thunderbolt 5 was introduced last year, but it remains an exclusive feature of the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Slightly disappointing to see wireless connectivity not get upgraded, leaving Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 off the table, especially since many of the best routers you can buy this year have Wi-Fi 7 for faster speeds. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Those lack of features or other upgrades is notable. You certainly won't hate yourself for buying this machine, but as long as you can buy a similarly-specced M4 Pro MacBook Pro for the same price, the lack of anything else new in the M5 MacBook Pro makes it a harder sell. This is even the first time battery life has remained stagnant from the previous generation, with Apple still claiming 24 hours. From my own testing, the M5 MacBook Pro is aligned with the other MacBook Pros, giving me well over a full day of battery life with my work. The MacBook Pro still holds the crown, even if Intel and Qualcomm are far more serviceable competitors now than they used to be. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Unless you plan on gaming, I wouldn't even recommend needing to wait until the M5 MacBook Air comes out in the spring, especially if this M5 MacBook Pro is a sign of things to come. For that reason, the M5 MacBook Pro is probably not the MacBook most people should buy. But that's a casualty of Apple's marketing strategy than this laptop or the M5 itself. I was really impressed by the GPU and AI performance improvements this time around, and the M5 is going to really flex in both the MacBook Air (for its incredible value) and the M4 Pro/Max (for its enhanced performance). This is for the dabblers and hobbyists, which I don't mean in pejorative sense. If you want to do some video editing, photography, or gaming on the side, and could really benefit from the enriched multimedia experience that the better screen, ports, and speakers provide, the M5 MacBook Pro is your go-to machine. It can handle your work or school during the day, and whatever project you want to throw at it on weekends. On top of that, the display and speakers mean it's also a killer media machine for when you want to throw on a movie or play a game. These are the kinds of in-between, “prosumer” devices Apple has always staked its claim on, which is why this laptop has remained in the lineup, despite the feeling of redundancy it gives me next to the 15-inch MacBook Air.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of hiring thousands of warehouse employees and delivery drivers to build a roughly 1.2 million U.S. workforce, second only to Walmart, Amazon is reportedly shifting gears. The New York Times reported today, citing interviews and internal documents, that Amazon's automation team expects that by 2027, the company could avoid hiring more than 160,000 U.S. workers it would normally need. If true, that would save the company about 30 cents on every item it packs and delivers. On top of that, executives also told Amazon's board last year that robotic automation could potentially keep the company's U.S. headcount steady even as sales are expected to double by 2033. Overall, Amazon's robotics team has an ultimate goal to automate 75 percent of the company's operations, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times. The Times points out that Amazon is a major influence in the e-commerce space and wherever it goes, other players like Walmart and UPS, the first and third largest U.S. employers, are likely to follow. The company is also reportedly preparing for potential fallout from its plans. According to documents viewed by The New York Times, Amazon has considered working on its image by taking part in community events such as parades and toy drives. Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, told Gizmodo in an emailed statement that the leaked documents paint an incomplete picture of the company's plans, given that thousands of documents circulate throughout the company at any given time, each with varying degrees of accuracy. “In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines – now or moving forward,” Nantel wrote. Amazon also told The New York Times that it's not asking employees to avoid certain terms, and that its involvement in community events is not tied to its automation plans. Additionally, Amazon's head of worldwide operations, Udit Madan, told the Times that the company has a track record of reinvesting savings from automation into new roles, pointing to its recent effort to open more delivery hubs in rural areas. Still, some level of automation is already taking place in Amazon facilities, and it's likely to spread. The New York Times reported that documents show Amazon uses about a thousand robots in the facility, allowing it to employ roughly 25% fewer workers than it would have without automation. Amazon plans to copy the Shreveport design in about 40 facilities by the end of 2027, starting with a facility that opened in Virginia Beach this April.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta on Tuesday introduced new scam detection features for its messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger, as part of its broader initiative to crack down on online scams that target older people. It also took action on over 21,000 Facebook Pages and accounts that were pretending to be customer support operations that were attempting to trick people into sharing their information. The latter is so prevalent on the platform that many Page operators essentially know to ignore anything that claims to be a customer support message. This technique is often used to trick victims into giving away sensitive information like bank details and verification codes, Meta says. If so, it flags that signs of a scam have been detected and warns you to “be cautious, you could be at risk of losing money.” The screen also lists a variety of common scam techniques, like those involving work-from-home jobs or offers to make easy cash, and will suggest either blocking or reporting the suspicious account. Families often have to get involved, which embarrasses the victim or sees them digging in their heels, believing the scam to be a real opportunity of some kind. Scammers often use social engineering techniques or romantic interest to lure in victims who are not as online savvy or who may be suffering from early dementia. They also often target people who are lonely and appreciate the attention. Though it may not have access to the more sophisticated AI technologies to review possible scams, even informational alerts could have mitigated some of the prior abuse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's one of the main points of pride for Serval, an enterprise AI company that announced a $47 million Series A round on Tuesday. The round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with participation from heavy hitting venture firms like First Round, General Catalyst, and Box Group. But even more impressive than the funders is the company's list of clients, which include major AI players like Perplexity, Mercor, and Together AI. In broad strokes, Serval is using agentic AI models to automate IT service management, but the company has a unique approach that takes advantage of agentic AI's powers while avoiding many of its pitfalls. One agent is used to code internal automations for everyday tasks, like authorizing software or provisioning a device. The founders see it as a kind of vibe-coding tool, overseen by an IT manager, but doing most of the work on its own. “We don't want them to feel the marginal cost of building these automations,” Stauch told TechCrunch. When an automation is created, the manager will set rules for when it can be used, which provides an extra line of defense against overeager help desk agents. But I do have a tool for resetting your password or doing one of these other tasks.” And any time those rules need to be changed, there's an AI agent at the ready to dive into the codebase and change it. “You want to have full visibility and control into what that AI agent is doing,” says Stauch.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Microsoft has issued a patch for Windows 11 after an update released on October 14 quietly broke the Windows Recovery Environment on some systems. The new update, KB5070773, restores USB keyboard and mouse input inside WinRE for Windows 11 versions 24H2 and 25H2, reversing a bug that left the recovery interface completely unusable on affected machines. After installing it, users found that USB peripherals worked normally inside Windows proper but stopped responding inside the recovery environment. This is a pretty major failure, given that WinRE is the main route to Startup Repair, Reset this PC, and other tools needed when a machine won't boot. Without USB input in WinRE, you're effectively locked out of your own recovery tools. OEMs and enterprises can use the Preboot Execution Environment in Configuration Manager. Microsoft hasn't explained how the bug made it through testing, but this is the second major WinRE issue in as many months. Back in August, security updates to Windows 10 and 11 broke the Reset this PC feature entirely. That bug was also handled via emergency releases, and the quick turnaround this time suggests Microsoft didn't want to take any chances with November's Patch Tuesday still weeks away. While Microsoft is marking the issue resolved, this latest episode highlights just how brittle the company's update cadence has become. WinRE is supposed to be the safety net when things go wrong, but with back-to-back failures knocking out recovery features, it's not a good look.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Humanity's drive to explore has taken us across the solar system, with astronaut boots, various landers and rovers' wheels exploring the surfaces of several different planetary bodies. You may have heard about the extensive testing facilities for spacecraft and equipment, but how do scientists prepare for the human aspect of space exploration? One way to test out techniques and identify situations that may arise during a real mission is using a simulation, which in this field is more commonly known as an analog. Researchers choose and design analog missions and environments to replicate elements of a real mission, using what is available here on Earth. These missions are conducted in extreme environments on Earth that are comparable to the Moon or Mars, in habitats designed to replicate living quarters, or a combination of both. For example, operating a drill or wrench may seem easy here on Earth, but try doing the same task in thick gloves on a bulky, pressurized space suit in lower gravity. Testing these scenarios on Earth allows researchers to identify necessary changes before launch. Currently, I study environments on Earth that are similar to other planets to improve our understanding of their counterparts elsewhere in the solar system. I participated as a volunteer in one of these analog missions as an “analog astronaut,” serving as the crew geologist and applying my prior research findings from studying the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. These analog missions vary in setting, length, and intensity, but all aim to learn more about the human factors involved in space exploration. Analog missions are designed to simulate the crew's experience in a given mission plan. In some cases, they simulate surface operations on the Moon or Mars for up to a year. NASA uses several analog mission facilities spread across the world. For example, the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah is located in an environment chosen to imitate conditions on Mars, while analog missions at Aquarius, an undersea research station off the coast of Florida, help scientists learn about crew behavior and psychology in a confined habitat located in a hostile environment. They must undergo physical health and psychiatric evaluations, with the goal being to select individuals with similar backgrounds to those in the astronaut corps. The ideal crew is typically made up of participants who work and live well with others, and can stay cool under stress. Crews also include at least one person with medical training for emergencies, as well as a variety of scientists and engineers to operate the habitat's life support systems. My mission was designed so that the six crew members would not have any information about our crewmates until we arrived in Hawaii for training. In addition to geology expertise, I also have some medical training as a Wilderness First Responder, so I was there to assist with any medical issues. We practiced emergency procedures and were taught how to perform other tasks. After that orientation, we were deployed to the habitat for 28 days. We turned in our phones to mission control and could only access the internet to check emails or use a few preapproved websites required for our daily duties. The tasks included a variety of exercises to assess individual and group performance. They included individual assessments – similar to a daily IQ test – and group computer-based tasks, such as team 3D Tetris. They used our fluctuating performance on these activities as a proxy for estimating stress levels, group cohesion and individual well-being. During these expeditions, we conducted geologic investigations on the volcano. On our “off days,” we spent two hours exercising in the habitat. We had no additional food delivered during our stay. For example, a bucket shower one or two times per week was allowed, supplemented by “wilderness wipe” baths. As someone with a lot of very curly hair, I was happy to figure out a method for managing it using less than two liters of water per week. We were also permitted to do laundry once during our stay, as a group. Sorting through your crewmates' wet clothes was certainly one way to bond. Though physically demanding at times, the workload was not unreasonable. We were kept busy all day, as certain everyday tasks, such as cooking, required more effort than they might need in our normal lives. Preparing nutritionally balanced and palatable meals while rationing our very limited resources was hard, but it also provided opportunities to get creative with recipes and ingredients. We even managed to bake a cake for a crew member's birthday, using peanut butter protein and cocoa powders to flavor it. One crew member managed to acquire a downloadable form of the daily Wordle, so we could still compete with our friends back home. We also played board games, and all of these activities helped us get to know each other. Though different from our typical daily lives, the experience was one of a kind. We had the satisfaction of knowing that our efforts advanced space exploration in its own small way, one IQ test and slapdash cake at a time. Jordan Bretzfelder, Postdoctoral Fellow, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology Acting Administrator Sean Duffy said the agency will open up the Artemis 3 contract to other spaceflight companies because SpaceX has fallen behind schedule. The findings could prove essential for any future human missions to Mars. More than 50 years after the Apollo 17 Moon rocks returned to Earth, researchers are still uncovered surprising new details about their composition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research by NewsGuard has revealed that the latest version of OpenAI's video creation tool Sora 2 can be prompted to advance false or misleading information 80% of the time. Five of the 20 false claims Sora generated originated with Russian disinformation operations, it added. NewsGuard also asserted that its findings demonstrate how, with minimal effort and no technical expertise, bad actors, including health-hoax peddlers, authoritarian regimes engaged in hostile information operations, and political misinformers, can easily use this technology to make false claims more convincing. OpenAI cautioned users about the risks of Sora 2 on a “system card” at its website. “We're taking an iterative approach to safety, focusing on areas where context is especially important or where risks are still emerging and are not fully understood,” it noted. OpenAI explained that the new model introduces capabilities that have been difficult for prior video models to achieve, such as more accurate physics, sharper realism, synchronized audio, enhanced steerability and an expanded stylistic range. Michelle A. Amazeen, an associate professor of Mass Communication at Boston University, found NewsGuard's research “deeply concerning.” “Just when media consumers were already navigating a complex and often confusing information landscape, AI-generated content like Sora 2's videos further muddies the waters by producing highly convincing false claims,” she told TechNewsWorld. “This only intensifies the challenge of discerning truth from misinformation in today's digital age.” Scott Ellis, director of brand and creative at Daon, a biometric identity assurance and authentication solutions company in Fairfax, Va., asserted that Sora is effectively a deepfake tool. “We're talking about industrial-scale misinformation pipelines that can be created by anyone with a prompt.” Dan Kennedy, a professor of journalism at Northeastern University, in Boston, was unsurprised by NewsGuard's findings. “And skilled — and sometimes even not-so-skilled — users are always able to get around safeguards aimed at ensuring, for instance, that public figures can't be depicted, or that fake videos will be properly labeled.” “We've been living with such videos for quite some time, including crude efforts like that footage of Nancy Pelosi slowed down to make her sound like she was drunk,” he added. The “Sora” watermark that is present on all videos can be removed using free online tools, they wrote. “NewsGuard tested one free tool, developed by BasedLabs AI, and found that it successfully removed the watermark from an uploaded Sora video in approximately four minutes, allowing users to download a non-watermarked version of the same video,” they explained. Watermarks can help at first, but they're far from a perfect fix, observed Jason Crawforth, founder and CEO of Swear, a digital media authentication company, in Boise, Idaho. “As AI becomes more advanced at editing and manipulating digital media, even sophisticated watermarks can often be detected and removed, reducing their value as a safeguard,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The sturdier approach is provenance that travels with the asset, such as digitally signed content credentials at creation and edit, plus platform side checks and clear labeling,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Even then, provenance shows origin not truth, so layered defenses are needed.” The real issue is that companies built these systems on unauthorized training data without consent mechanisms, contended Jordan Mitchell, founder of Growth Stack Media, a content and communications agency, in Raleigh, N.C. “We need increased adoption of blockchain-based content authentication because it creates immutable records of content origin and ownership that are far more difficult to alter,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Blockchain could provide the transparency needed in an AI-dominated creative landscape, similar to how NFTs help creators establish verifiable ownership of digital works,” he said. “The inconsistency is more dangerous than blanket refusal would be,” maintained Growth Stack's Mitchell. “It suggests Sora operates on surface-level pattern matching rather than principled safety architecture.” “This unpredictability creates a trial-and-error environment where determined bad actors eventually discover exploitable gaps in the system's defenses.” “Large models are probabilistic and context sensitive, so refusals can flip with small changes in phrasing or history,” explained Sectigo's Soroko. “The bigger issue is that gaps like this leave room for bad actors to exploit loopholes,” he added. His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.
