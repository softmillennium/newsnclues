Shares of the company soared 146% to $3.62 on Tuesday, eclipsing Monday's 128% gain. He's been detailing his bullish outlook for the stock, posting on Reddit last week that he had bought about one twentieth of the shares outstanding and following that up with a video titled "Why I've purchased 4% of Beyond Meat stock." Now that it's trading firmly in the middle of that range, he said on Tuesday that the stock could keep going given the latest burst of momentum. Reached by text message, the Dubai-based trader and real estate developer said Beyond Meat shares could hit $6 apiece, another 104% gain from Tuesday's high of $2.93. He admitted that he didn't expect his posts to garner the attention that they have, saying that he simply believed investors were misinterpreting its upside potential due to misconceptions regarding recent events. The core of his original thesis, detailed in his seven-minute YouTube video, is the exchange of convertible notes that Beyond Meat recently completed with bondholders. "It is critical to understand this event if you are to consider the stock, as it is what has triggered this opportunity and volatility," an AI-generated newscaster tells viewers in the video. "If there are three things you need to remember about my investment thesis on Beyond Meat, they are: a fundamentally misunderstood conversion event, a technical setup leading to a potential short squeeze, and a strong balance sheet and book value post-converison." He highlighted its distribution expansion with Walmart, which also came with an announcement of offerings containing more protein and fewer GMOs, as a positive catalyst. "For the first time in a long time for Beyond Meat, there's a road to profitability and growth that's being written."</p>

While southern cities like Naples and Fort Lauderdale often dominate as destinations for retirees, the Midwest has emerged as a favorable landing spot — at least, according to WalletHub. WalletHub looked at 182 cities and ranked the best places for retirees based on four key measures: activities, affordability, healthcare, and quality of life. Each of those four categories was weighted equally, however, other relevant metrics were used inside each category and weighted differently. "Rounding out the top 10 are cities that balance affordability, access to quality care, and vibrant lifestyles," WalletHub writer and analyst Chip Lupo told Business Insider. "These locales all tend to offer a mix of mild weather, strong local economies, and plenty of ways for retirees to stay active and connected." "Minneapolis, which ranks third, stands out for its strong healthcare system, active senior community, and welcoming job market for older adults," Lupo said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company. Tesla's board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package "outrageous," in part because Musk's "political activities have damaged Tesla's brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla." The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf. "Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings," the site says. "That's our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable." Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk's previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested. Following those firms' suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, "ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla's proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced." The company added that shareholders who sold would "have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025." The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal. Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, "I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control." Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI's ChatGPT. By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he "vociferously opposes this pay package" and says other public fiduciaries should do the same. "Most of the time we've held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it's grown over time, and that's why we haven't chosen to dump it," Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August. The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said. Musk has "been an inconsistent CEO at best," Lander said, "and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence." Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.

Since the government shutdown began on October 1, an estimated 900,000 federal workers across various agencies have been furloughed, meaning they have been placed on unpaid leave. Congress has been in a gridlock, unable to reopen the government, as Democratic representatives push against legislation that would cut subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The budget approval process we know today was introduced in 1974, when Congress passed the Budget Act of 1974 in response to President Richard Nixon's impounding of federal funds approved by Congress during his presidency. Since then, there have been more than a dozen shutdowns. See how the ongoing shutdown compares to past government shutdowns. On November 13, 1995, the government entered a five-day shutdown as congressional Republicans and the Clinton administration failed to reach an agreement on budget priorities. The disagreements began after the House and Senate both flipped to a Republican majority during the midterm elections, when Republican politicians, including Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, campaigned on a platform of reduced government spending, as outlined in what they called a "Contract with America." Having control of the House for the first time in 40 years, the Republicans passed a spending bill that cut federal funding for Medicare and gave states more power over welfare programs, such as Medicaid. Clinton vetoed the bill, and the government shut down for five days before Congress passed a temporary funding bill to keep federal agencies working. The government shut down for eight days twice between October 31 and December 9, 1977, after a longer gap in funding at the beginning of that October. The three funding gaps accounted for a total of 28 days that year during which the federal government operated outside its appropriated budget. The gaps in funding came as the Democrat-led House and Senate argued over whether Medicaid funds should be used to pay for abortions. Despite the funding gap, most federal agencies continued to operate as usual, and workers were not furloughed. While Congress overrode the veto on October 1, the process resulted in a lapse in funding that lasted for 10 days. In 1979, the House and Senate, both held by Democratic majorities, disagreed on how Medicaid funds should be used for abortions, with the House passing a restrictive bill and the Senate looking for a more permissive approach that would allow for funding in cases of rape and incest. Funding restarted when a compromise bill was passed, which included the Senate's approach to abortion funding and a raise in congressional salaries. While both chambers were controlled by the president's party, the House advocated for funding only in cases where the mother's life was at risk, while the Senate backed a less restrictive approach, which would also provide funding in cases of rape and incest. The disagreement led to the passage of a temporary funding bill, which expired on October 31 and was followed by two more lapses in funding. After 16 years without a government shutdown, the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-held House failed to pass a funding bill due to disagreements over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The showdown led to over 800,000 federal workers being furloughed during budget negotiations, while pay for active-duty military members was agreed upon by the president and Congress. The longest government shutdown of the Carter presidency started on September 30, 1978, when the president vetoed a spending bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and a series of water public works projects, which he deemed wasteful. The shutdown came to an end when congressional Republicans, who had lost public support in the polls, as reported by NPR, passed a balanced budget that avoided hikes in Medicare premiums and funding cuts for federal agencies. The government did not shut down again for 16 years. During the nearly five weeks the government was closed, airports began experiencing flight delays as air traffic controllers and TSA workers, who were working without pay, began calling out sick en masse. The government shut down on October 1, 2025, after Congress failed to agree on funding measures, with a key point of contention being healthcare subsidies. Democrats refused to support a temporary funding bill passed by House Republicans that lacked protections against provisions from Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill," which they say would cut federal funding, expand Medicaid requirements, and reduce subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, citing increased healthcare premiums. Federal funding expired on October 1 as both sides failed to reach an agreement. As far as negotiations go, the stalemate appears to have no clear end in sight, even as furloughed federal workers and some employees working without pay experience a third week of uncertainty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy after he told media outlets this week that the billionaire's space company is falling behind U.S. plans to return to the moon. "The person responsible for America's space program can't have a 2 digit IQ," Musk wrote in a Tuesday post on X. Musk later posted a poll asking users "Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America's space program?" On Monday, Duffy told CNBC that SpaceX was "behind" schedule on building its lunar landing system for the space agency's Artemis III mission and that he would consider other contracts with competitors such as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. SpaceX and Blue Origin will have until Oct. 29 to offer ways to speed up the project, a NASA official told CNBC. President Donald Trump selected Duffy to become the acting NASA administrator in July. Trump had previously nominated Musk ally Jared Isaacman, but he pulled the nomination earlier this year, saying he was a "blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before." CNBC reported earlier this month that Trump has held talks with Isaacman to reconsider the role. NASA is racing against China and others to get humans back to the moon for the first time since 1972. SpaceX won a $2.9 billion contract to build the technology in 2021. Other contractors such as Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are participating in various stages of the program. But the project has been fraught with setbacks. NASA launched its first Artemis mission in November 2022. Last December, the agency delayed its planned Artemis missions. NASA's first Artemis launch with astronauts is now slated for April 2026, with a third mission to land two astronauts on the moon planned for 2027. Now, the space agency is also grappling with the aftershocks from an ongoing government shutdown that threatens to stall any plans to reopen contracts. NASA made exceptions for employees and contractors working on Artemis missions to keep working during the shutdown, CNBC previously reported. When Musk worked at the helm of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, NASA faced sweeping, anti-DEI-related reductions in force, and implemented deferred resignation programs that have slashed the space agency's workforce.

Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said on the company's earnings call on Tuesday that "the investment hypothesis didn't work out as we expected." Still, Quincey said coffee is a "super attractive category" that's large and profitable for Coca-Cola. It has invested in Costa's UK stores and expanded the use of automated coffee machines that use the Costa name, he said. The business "just didn't create a multiplier so far that we are looking for," Quincey said. Coca-Cola is "reflecting" on what its coffee business should look like going forward, he said. In August, Reuters reported that Coca-Cola was working with an investment bank to explore a sale of Costa. Quincey did not address a potential sale of Costa on Tuesday's call. Coke's stock was up about 4% on Tuesday after the company reported that net sales grew 5% to $12.46 billion in the third quarter.</p>

When an AI wearable's ad campaign sparked backlash in New York City, Heineken said: Hold my beer. Friend, the company behind an AI companion you wear around your neck, spent over $1 million to plaster the city's subway system with 11,000 car cards, 1,000 platform posters, and 130 urban panels on September 25. New Yorkers quickly defaced the ads with graffiti like "surveillance tool" and "AI is not your friend." Within two weeks, Heineken joined the fray, launching an ad campaign of its own. The campaign is "tongue-in-cheek" but reinforces Heineken's belief that "a refreshing social life matters more than we realize," wrote Guilherme de Marchi Retz, Heineken USA's marketing VP, in an email to Business Insider. "In a culture defined by constant scrolling, it's both timely and intentionally ironic, because we know the best social experiences happen offline," he wrote. Schiffmann called the backlash to Friend's ad campaign "entertaining" and even attended an anti-Friend protest. Heineken declined to disclose exactly how many impressions the campaign has received. "Social media engagements and conversations around this campaign have been above the average for similar topical brand activities," Retz wrote. The social media response from many has been gleeful. Six Point Ventures cofounder Trace Cohen posted on X that it was "next level trolling." EssenceMediacom Global EVP Michael Miraflor wrote that it was "Incredible speed for a giant org." Their AI goals include operational efficiency, driving smart sales, and hyper-personalized marketing. Retz wrote that Heineken saw AI "as a tool to give our people more time to focus on what really matters: creativity, insight, and connection."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HBO Max is the latest streaming services to raise its prices. The streaming giant, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Tuesday that it is raising prices across all plans. HBO Max last raised prices in June 2024. The price hikes are effective immediately for new subscriptions. Existing monthly subscribers will be notified 30 days in advance of their plan renewing, with the new prices starting on their next billing date on or after November 20, the company said. The updates come as the streaming market becomes increasingly saturated with options — and as other major apps hike their prices. Disney raised the price of its Disney+ plans and bundles last month, Apple hiked the price of Apple TV by 30% in August and Netflix raised its prices early this year. WBD CEO David Zaslav indicated in September that price increases were on the way along with a stricter crackdown on sharing passwords. "The fact that this is quality, and that's true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality, we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices," Zaslav said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference last month. As of June 30, WBD said it had 125.7 million paying subscribers to all of its streaming services. That stat includes HBO Max as well as other legacy linear subscribers to HBO, who have access to the streaming service. The company announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. A streaming and studios company would include its movie properties and HBO Max, while a global networks business would include linear channels like CNN and TNT Sports. At the same time, WBD is fielding takeout interest from companies including Paramount Skydance and said Tuesday it's open to a sale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, said the surge in enthusiasm around artificial intelligence has all the markings of a bubble. "We are absolutely in an AI bubble now. It is going to burst," she said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" Tuesday to David Faber. A lot of people are going to lose money." Her remarks come as enthusiasm for AI continues to drive markets higher, with investors betting the technology will transform industries and lift corporate earnings. Taylor Wolfe said investors are underestimating the risks tied to the surge in AI-related spending by major technology companies. "There are trillions of dollars that are being earmarked to be spent relative to hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow generated by the Mag 7," she said, referring to the group of large-cap tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500. Her remarks come at a time when analysis shows the S&P 500 has become pretty much an AI index. Taylor Wolfe believes the mismatch between capital expenditures and profit potential makes current valuations difficult to justify. "Show me the trillions of dollars of profits that are going to be generated in the next five years," she said. She said the current environment is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when investors chased anything associated with the internet regardless of valuation or business model. During the dotcom era, the right thing to do wasn't short the bubble companies; it was to look where no one else was looking, she said. "You'd have been better off owning a railroad in 2000 than buying Cisco at 35 times earnings, Taylor Wolfe said. "So at Impactive, what we're doing today is looking for our railroads." At the 13D Monitor's Active-Passive Investor Summit Tuesday, Taylor Wolfe presented her new idea Advanced Drainage Systems, which she called the undisputed leader in plastic stormwater and residential septic systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Tuesday announced ChatGPT Atlas, a new artificial intelligence-powered web browser. The company said Atlas looks and feels similar to existing browsers, but is built around OpenAI's generative chatbot ChatGPT. That means users will be able to access ChatGPT to create summaries, ask questions and complete tasks as they navigate across any page on the web. "We think that AI represents a rare once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during a livestream on Tuesday. The launch of Atlas puts OpenAI in direct competition with rivals like Google and Perplexity AI, which are jostling to attract users and win market share with their own browser offerings. Perplexity rolled out its Comet browser for free earlier this month, and Google embedded a Gemini model within its Chrome browser in September. Shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, closed down 2% following OpenAI's announcement. Atlas users will see an "Ask ChatGPT" button on the top right corner of every web page, and clicking it will open up the chatbot in a companion sidebar. Since ChatGPT will follow users across the web with Atlas, there is no need to copy and paste between tabs, Adam Fry, the product lead for Atlas at OpenAI, said during the livestream. The browser is also equipped with memory, which will help it understand users and become more personalized over time, he said. If users forget where they saw a piece of information, for instance, they could use the homepage to type in a prompt like "search web history for a doc about Atlas core design." Atlas also has an agent mode, which means that ChatGPT can take actions for users and complete tasks like booking reservations, flights, shopping or editing a document. ChatGPT Atlas is available to macOS users worldwide, though agent mode is only available to Plus and Pro users. OpenAI said experiences for Windows, iOS and Android are coming soon.

The AI Race:

Dario Amodei

Anthropic Chief Executive Officer Dario Amodei put out a lengthy blog post pushing back at “inaccurate claims” about its policy positions days after White House AI czar David Sacks criticized the company's calls for more AI regulation.

In the post, published Tuesday, Amodei stressed that Anthropic has been aligned with the Trump administration on “key areas of AI policy,” including publicly praising a set of executive orders intended to bolster US competitiveness on artificial intelligence. Amodei said he also met President Donald Trump during a July AI and energy summit in Pennsylvania, “where he and I had a good conversation about US leadership in AI.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swiss-based bottler, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (Coca-Cola HBC) has agreed to acquire a 75% stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for US$2.6 billion, in a deal that will make it one of the most influential beverage players on the continent once completed. According to Bloomberg, the deal, which has been in progress since 2021, grants Coca-Cola HBC operational control of one of Africa's largest bottlers, expanding its footprint into 14 additional markets, including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Ghana. "Coca-Cola HBC is a strong and valued bottler that will help usher in the next chapter of growth for CCBA," said Coca-Cola Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun. Under the deal, Coca-Cola HBC will purchase shares from The Coca-Cola Company and Gutsche Family Investments (GFI), which currently control 66.5% and 33.5% of CCBA respectively. Founded in 2014, CCBA operates across more than a dozen African countries and produces roughly 40% of all Coca-Cola beverages sold on the continent. The acquisition will give Coca-Cola HBC control of a fast-growing portfolio that includes popular brands such as Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite, and Minute Maid, and in some markets, energy drinks like Monster. Coca-Cola HBC, which is listed in London and Athens, also announced plans for a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to signal its commitment to the African market. Trade unions have since cautioned against possible layoffs, urging management to prioritise job security alongside operational efficiency. Coca-Cola HBC, however, has maintained that the deal will strengthen long-term investment, encourage technology transfer, and enhance operational sustainability across the region. Beyond its corporate implications, the transaction could reshape Africa's industrial and consumer landscape. The US$2.6 billion investment, which values the deal at US$3.4 billion, reinforces confidence in African markets at a time when many global firms remain cautious about emerging economies. Africa's beverage industry, valued at over US$60 billion, is expanding rapidly, driven by population growth, urbanisation, and a youthful consumer base. If executed effectively, the acquisition could help transform Africa from a peripheral market into a manufacturing and innovation hub for global beverage production, firmly cementing Coca-Cola's long-term stake in the continent's economic future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new World Bank report has revealed that the Congo Basin's vast forest, often dubbed the “lungs of Africa,” holds over $23 trillion in untapped value, urging African governments and investors to act swiftly to harness their potential for climate resilience and economic growth. The report, Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem Accounts, found that the value of ecosystem services nearly doubled between 2000 and 2020, from $590 billion to $1.15 trillion, while the total forest asset value surged to $23.2 trillion. Despite this enormous potential, local governments earned just $8 billion in benefits in 2020, mostly from timber, bushmeat, wild foods, and ecotourism. “These forests, managed sustainably, can serve as powerful engines for sustainable development, contributing to job creation, climate-smart growth, and stronger local economies,” said Ousmane Diagana, World Bank Vice President for Western and Central Africa. But its management varies widely. Gabon and the Republic of Congo are leading in embedding sustainability into national policy, while Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea are working to strengthen governance. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic face mounting pressure from informal logging, mining, and agricultural expansion. The World Bank called for integrating forest assets into macroeconomic planning and expanding climate finance, positioning the Congo Basin as a critical frontier for green growth, and a potential model for Africa's climate-driven development future.
