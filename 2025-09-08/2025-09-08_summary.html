            The House Oversight Committee has received its first documents from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including the so-called “birthday book” – a reported collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday that included a note bearing President Donald Trump's name.
    


            Democrats on the committee posted on X an image of the page with Trump's name. Trump has repeatedly denied writing the letter and sued The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on it, for defamation. Deputy White House chief of staff Taylor Budowich said on X that “it's not his signature,” in response to the image released by Democrats, alongside several images bearing the president's signature.
    


            The panel has been investigating the Epstein case and had subpoenaed the estate for documents as part of its probe. The investigation comes amid a bipartisan push for more transparency over the case and the release of more information.
    


            Republicans and Democrats on the panel said they plan to make additional documents public after taking time to review what was turned over by the estate. It was not immediately clear when more documents would be made public.
    


            Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel, said the committee had secured the “note from President Trump that he has said does not exist,” adding: “It's time for the President to tell us the truth about what he knew and release all the Epstein files.”
    


            A House Oversight Committee aide said that in addition to the “birthday book,” the estate turned over “the last will and testament of Epstein immediately preceding August 8, 2019; the September 24, 2007 non-prosecution agreement between the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida and Epstein; entries from Epstein's address/contact books from January 1, 1990 through August 10, 2019; and information about Epstein's known bank accounts.”
    


            Attorney Daniel H. Weiner, a representative for the estate, confirmed to CNN that an initial document production had been transmitted to the panel and said “the Co-Executors will continue to produce on a rolling basis documents responsive to the Committee's subpoena.”
    


            Lawyers representing the estate noted in a letter obtained by CNN accompanying the document production that there are certain redactions in the book, which was reportedly compiled by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, that comprises three volumes.
    


            “Please note that, in an abundance of caution, we have redacted names and faces of women and minors who appear in the book (other than Ms. Maxwell, public figures, and family or class photos) to ensure that no potential victims are publicly identifiable,” Weiner and attorney Daniel Ruzumna wrote.
    


Speaker Johnson walks backs comment that Trump was an ‘FBI informant' in Epstein case



            “We have also redacted photographs revealing any nudity from the book,” the co-counsel for the co-executors of Epstein's estate added.
    


            Committee members and their staff will have the opportunity to review the unredacted versions of the book and other documents, as CNN previously reported.
    


            In response to the committee's request for “a potential list of clients involved in sex, sex acts, or sex trafficking facilitated by Mr. Jeffrey Epstein,” in the subpoena, lawyers for Epstein's estate said they “are not aware of the existence” of such a list.
    


            As CNN previously reported, a bipartisan group of staffers on the committee is expected to travel to New York City later this week to meet with lawyers representing the estate and view unredacted documents related to the investigation.
    


            The committee previously released tens of thousands of pages of documents of Epstein files turned over to the panel by the Justice Department. Democrats on the panel criticized that document production, however, saying that it contained little new information.

President calls Hanks ‘woke' in vitriolic post after US Military Academy calls off ceremony with little explanation

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump launched a vitriolic attack against Tom Hanks for supposedly being “destructive” and “woke” after one of America's most beloved actors was snubbed without much explanation by West Point last week.

On his social media site on Monday, the US president applauded the alumni association of the US Military Academy (or West Point) for abruptly calling off a ceremony honoring Hanks, twice an Academy award winner who has played numerous military characters and also has a long history of advocating for veterans.

Trump wrote: “Our great West Point (getting greater all the time!) has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks. Important move! We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”

Hanks had been scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award later this month for his “service and accomplishments in the national interest”.

In a message to faculty, retired Col Mark Bieger declared the cancellation would allow the institution to “continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight and win as officers in the world's most lethal force, the United States Army”, without elaborating how the two are connected.

Hanks has previously endorsed Democratic candidates including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

He has been deeply involved in veterans' causes. He was the national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial in Washington DC. He also supported Bob Dole's fundraising campaign for the Dwight D Eisenhower Memorial, according to the alumni association's own original statement.

He has already been inducted as an honorary member into the US Army's Ranger Hall of Fame. In 2016, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Among his military portrayals are Capt John Miller in Saving Private Ryan, the Vietnam war soldier Forrest Gump (for which he won the Oscar for best actor), and Cmdr Ernie Krause in Greyhound, for which he also wrote the screenplay. He also portrayed the title role in 2013's Captain Phillips and appeared in the cold war film Bridge of Spies.

His work has made him one of the US's most decorated actors, with seven Emmy awards to go alongside the five Academy award nominations for best actor, which he won twice in a row.

Trump, who has dabbled in acting including a cameo in Home Alone 2, has regularly complained about never winning an Emmy for his reality television show The Apprentice, lamenting that he “should have gotten it”, that he “got screwed out of an Emmy” and that “the Emmys are all politics”.

Palestine Action has repeatedly targeted Elbit facilities with protests and shutdowns.

Major Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems has reportedly shut down a U.K. facility after it was repeatedly targeted by Palestine Action activists, in a major victory for the group that was recently banned by the U.K. government.

The Guardian reported on Saturday that one of the company's Bristol facilities, in Aztec West, appears abandoned, with no staff other than a security guard outside of the premises. This is despite the company's lease on the facility not set to expire until 2029.

Palestine Action had targeted the facility and other Elbit buildings in the U.K. with numerous protests, pouring red paint on the facility and halting operations by occupying the roof and blocking the entrance. Some of these actions came even as the U.K. was in the process of proscribing the group. 

“We need to remind ourselves that Elbit (Systems) is one of the two most important Israeli arms films, along with [Israel Aerospace Industries], that is it is obviously a key component of Israel's military industrial complex,” global arms trade expert and South African politician ​​Andrew Feinstein told The Guardian. 

Feinstein said the plant closure is “extremely significant.”

Elbit plays a major role in Israel's genocide in Gaza and assault on the occupied West Bank. It makes most of the Israeli military's drones, as well as systems for other military vehicles and aircraft. 

Activists have said that the Bristol complex is a research and development facility for the company. Elbit denied closing the plant due to protests when contacted by Haaretz, saying the “site is temporarily inactive for commercial reasons.”

UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese named Elbit as a major company making up the “economic backbone” of Israel, which she said is dependent on the military industrial complex. 

Elbit has been subject to protests in its branches across the world. Law enforcement in the U.K. have arrested dozens of activists with Palestine Action for protesting Elbit. Anti-Elbit protesters in the U.S. and Germany have also faced arrest.

The U.K. declared Palestine Action a terrorist group in July, in a move widely decried as an attempt to silence and criminalize pro-Palestine activism. This weekend, law enforcement arrested nearly a thousand people at a rally against Palestine Action's proscription in London. 

The U.K.'s Ministry of Defense faced criticism recently for reportedly nearing a contract with Elbit Systems UK worth £2 billion, or roughly $2.7 billion, for the company to be a “strategic partner.” This is despite the Labour government announcing last year that it was suspending 30 arms export licenses to Israel over the “clear risk” that the weapons would be used in violations of international law in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

Letitia James's intervention increases the likelihood SCOTUS will weigh in on shield laws and telehealth abortions.

New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that she will defend her state's abortion protections in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas. James' involvement sets up the first interstate fight over abortion laws since the fall of Roe v. Wade, opening the door for the Supreme Court to weigh in on a key legal mechanism that has helped people in states with bans access abortion.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a civil suit against Dr. Margaret Carpenter in December for providing a telehealth abortion to a Texas-based patient. Carpenter lives and practices in New York, where abortion is legal; in Texas, where her patient received the health care, there is an almost total ban on abortion. 

New York is one of several states where abortion providers are protected by shield laws — statutes that ban cooperation with other states' attempts to enforce abortion bans. The law prohibits New York law enforcement officials from arresting or extraditing health professionals who provided abortions that are legal in New York; law enforcement also cannot cooperate with investigations or punishments of such procedures.

By setting up a clash between two states' chief law enforcement offices, James' intervention increases the likelihood that the New York-Texas dispute becomes a vehicle for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the constitutionality of shield laws and the telehealth abortions they enable. 

This month, James, the first woman and first Black person to serve as her state's attorney general, will argue in legal filings that the Empire State has the right to pass laws protecting its residents from another state's abortion bans.

“Texas has no authority in New York, and no power to impose its cruel abortion ban here,” James said in a statement.

The implications are significant. Since Roe's undoing, tens of thousands of people living under abortion bans have relied on telehealth to get care. Health providers living in states with legal abortion consult with them virtually and then have abortion pills mailed to them to take from home. Now, about 1 in 4 abortions are done through telehealth — and half of those are for people receiving shield-law-protected care. The practice is medically safe and effective and often easier and more affordable for patients than traveling to another state. 

But the legality is fraught.

Supporters of the practice argue that, because the medical providers are practicing in their home states where abortion is legal they are not violating any laws. Abortion opponents say the opposite: that because the abortion ultimately occurs in a state where the procedure is banned, telehealth providers are breaking the law and must be punished accordingly.

Legal analysts have said the legality of shield laws will likely be decided by the Supreme Court. Several cases are pending that address abortions allegedly provided over telehealth to patients in states with bans, including a criminal case brought by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and two civil cases both filed by anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell.

In February, a judge in a Texas state court ruled against Carpenter, saying she had to pay a penalty of $113,000. But New York state officials have refused to enforce the ruling, citing the state's shield laws. Carpenter herself has not entered Texas. Then in July, Paxton sued the Ulster County, New York, clerk for declining to enter the Texas judgement against Carpenter. In that petition, he argued that New York's shield law violates the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit clause, which requires that states honor other states' judicial proceedings.

When a home is destroyed, entire worlds of safety, love, and identity crumble with it.

Your home is not just a building. It is a space carefully crafted by your family — a place that witnessed your first steps, heard your whispers, and held your laughter and tears. It is the place where your childhood lives.

Every room tells a tale. A nook holds old toys. There's a window where the morning sun kissed your face, and the threshold you crossed thousands of times.

Imagine a peaceful neighborhood around your home — a narrow, quiet street shaded by olive trees whose branches stretch to cover the sidewalks. You have neighbors who are like family, exchanging greetings and stories. Children play and laugh in the alleys. Every evening, the scent of taboon bread fills the air, and the call to prayer echoes gently, giving the neighborhood a feeling of peace and timelessness.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

This home, in the heart of this neighborhood, is more than just a shelter — it is a part of you.

Now imagine that in a single moment, it all turns to dust.

Aya Adnan Ibrahim Al-Derawi is a 20-year-old medical laboratory student at the Islamic University of Gaza. Aya is my dear friend, and she shared with me this story of her family's home.

Their house in Nuseirat had a small courtyard with a lemon tree, a rooftop where laundry swayed in the wind, and windows that caught the first light of morning. But on December 12, 2023, an Israeli airstrike reduced it to rubble and ashes.

“We had a safe, warm home that held us all together, standing proudly in a four-story building,” Aya said. “Everything disappeared, except the loss — a loss that never leaves, haunting every moment of our days.”

Since that day, Aya's family members have been wanderers, searching for shelter while trying to pick up the shattered pieces of their souls and fragmented memories.

That tragic day, Aya lost not only her home but also her older brother, Yasser Adnan Al-Derawi. She speaks of him with deep love and respect: “My brother was a lawyer — kind, gentle, and honorable,” she told me. “His face was always cheerful, his spirit light and beloved by all who knew him. He was the calm that chased away every fear.”

We are not just mourning lost buildings or material possessions. We long for the quiet comfort of days when we did not have to count the seconds between bombs.

She emphasized that Yasser's loss was not just the absence of a person: “It was the loss of a whole world — safety, love, and brilliant legal work. His presence was peace on Earth, a beacon in darkness.”

Yasser's passing took him to a place of eternal peace, but the weight of his absence crushes Aya's spirit daily.

“I carry the heaviness of longing — I fight the feelings of loss, the dark days, the burning of my soul, and the sharp sting of missing him.”

She pleaded to God, “We accepted, though it was hard to accept; so please be pleased with us and take care of us.”

Aya told me that when the house collapsed, taking her brother's life, something inside her broke beyond repair. “It felt as if my heart was homeless, the Earth became too small, and the sky drifted far away.”

Yet, despite all the rubble, Aya still sees her home clearly in her mind: a refuge, a source of peace, and the most precious place she can never replace.

Islam Abu Mohsen, a 24-year-old civil engineering student from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, told me about his life before everything changed. He works as a digital content creator and is a professional trainer in barista skills — a young man trying to build a future amid the ruins.

He described his home in one of the most upscale neighborhoods in Khan Younis — a modern, beautifully designed house, with large windows that filled every room with sunlight. “The area was very lively,” he told me, “close to malls, restaurants, and schools. It was safe — relatively safe — and we lived surrounded by a warm family atmosphere, despite all the harsh conditions in Gaza.”

Islam shared how everyday life inside that home was stable and peaceful. “Each of us had our own daily routine. I was focused on my engineering studies, working on digital content, and training others in barista arts. Every day, we gathered around the dinner table — laughing, sharing stories, trying to hold on to a sense of normalcy. The house had a soul; it was a place of safety, comfort, and beautiful memories.”

Then came the devastating night of October 14, 2023. Islam described it vividly: “At 7:00 pm, suddenly the whole area was engulfed in a ring of fire. The smoke was suffocating; we literally felt like we were choking. We couldn't understand what was happening. Ambulances couldn't reach us — it was as if our neighborhood had vanished from the map.”

He described his family's final moments in the house. “We were sitting at the dining table, cooking pasta, ready to eat — and then the bombing started. We never finished our meal,” he told me. “The pasta tray remained untouched for more than five months. When we finally returned, it was rotten.”

The losses went far beyond food. The house had been looted. The walls were covered with mocking graffiti drawn by Israeli soldiers. “It hurt deeply,” Islam said, “but I tried to stay patient and trust in God's justice. It was not just material loss.”

Thankfully, no one in his family or neighborhood was physically harmed, but the psychological wounds ran deep. “The fear and shock affected us all profoundly. We live with constant anxiety now because of what happened.”

After losing their home, Islam and his family first took shelter in a school, then moved to a tent in Khan Younis, where they lived for five difficult months.

Islam's story reveals a harsh truth: Families that once lived comfortably in Gaza now face unimaginable loss — their homes, memories, and stability reduced to rubble and uncertainty.

What remains etched most vividly in my mind after speaking with Islam is a simple memory he shared, a memory that carries the weight of a lifetime: “I loved sitting in the garden, tending the fruit trees, cleaning it myself every day. That simple, daily routine was what gave us a feeling of stability — it was the thread that kept our lives grounded.”

It sounds so ordinary, yet for us in Gaza, home was everything. Our domestic routines — those small, repetitive moments of waking up, sharing a meal, laughing over small jokes, tending to the garden — were our anchor amid endless chaos. Home was the fragile thread that connected us to a world that felt safe and predictable, a world that once embraced us like a warm hug.

Please understand: We are not just mourning lost buildings or material possessions. What we grieve for is far deeper. We long for the ordinary. We long for the quiet comfort of days when we did not have to count the seconds between bombs.

A home is never just walls and stones — it is the poem of our lives, the reservoir of our memories, and the sanctuary of our souls.

We ache for life before the annihilation — a life where stability was not a luxury but a given. We crave just one day, even one minute, when the normalcy we once took for granted wraps around us again, shielding us from the unrelenting violence and despair.

This longing is not just nostalgia — it is the essence of survival. That yearning keeps us alive. It reminds us who we were, who we are, and who we must become.

So yes, we yearn for normal life — not as a distant dream, but as a rightful claim. We yearn to live, simply, peacefully, with dignity intact. Because behind every shattered wall, behind every lost home, there beats a heart still dreaming of stability, safety, and the return of those simple, beautiful routines.

Islam showed me photos of homes that were true jewels of Gaza's architectural heritage.

His friend Mohammed's house, once an iconic symbol of Gazan craftsmanship, now reduced to ashes after being burned completely.

Another home — a masterpiece with furniture so rare and elegant that even its epoxy resin tables were priceless — now shattered, meaningless to those who destroyed it.

Gaza was once dotted with palaces and historic landmarks — beauty and history intertwined. Today, they are all dust and memory.

I, too, have lost places I love.

On November 1, 2023, tragedy struck with a force that shattered my family's world. The Israeli occupation bombed my uncle's house. That day, my aunt Asmaa was martyred, along with her newborn daughter Fatima — who had barely breathed for two months — and my uncle's wife, Neveen.

My uncle's house had always been a warm sanctuary for our family. I remember how, especially during Eid, my father would drive there, the car's tires crunching on familiar streets, and we would spend peaceful hours with my aunt. The kitchen windows caught the golden afternoon light. Those simple, profound moments now feel like a distant dream, fragile, unreachable, yet etched deep in my heart.

Then, on December 30, 2023, the occupation forces destroyed my grandfather's four-story home — the place that had embraced me since birth. Every corner held a memory, every step told a story. The garden where we ran free, the winding corridors, the rooftops where my cousins and I chased each other under the sun — those spaces were our private world, our refuge.

We never played in the streets; the area beneath my grandfather's house was our haven, filled with laughter and safety. On that cruel day, my uncle Abd al-Salam, his 13-year-old son Huthaifa, and his 8-year-old daughter Hala were killed.

There is also my sister, Doaa. Her house was bombed on January 14, 2024 — just 10 days after her wedding. We sought shelter in her home in Khan Younis for over a month. That beautiful house still lives in my memory, especially the guest room and her office, filled with echoes of our shared moments.

Doaa lost everything in that strike — her home, her sanctuary, every piece of her life.

Home in Gaza is never just walls and roofs. It is memory layered on memory, fragile and stubborn at once. It is the smell of bread rising in clay ovens, the laughter that once filled courtyards, the weight of photographs carried across generations. As the poet Mosab Abu Toha writes:

What Is Home?

It is the shade of trees on my way to school before they were uprooted.

It is my grandparents' black and white wedding photo before the walls crumbled.

It is my uncle's prayer rug where dozens of ants slept on wintry nights before it was looted and put in a museum.

It is the oven my mother used to bake bread and roast a chicken before a bomb reduced our house to ashes.

It is the cafe where I watched football matches and played. My child stops me.

Can a four-letter word hold all of these?

A home is never just walls and stones — it is the poem of our lives, the reservoir of our memories, and the sanctuary of our souls. When a home is destroyed, entire worlds of safety, love, and identity crumble with it. Losing a home means losing an inseparable part of oneself — a never-ending journey to reclaim what was lost, the sense of belonging and stability. Now, amid the rubble and ruins, the true home remains within us — in our memories, in every heartbeat yearning to return to the warmth of peace and security.

The ruling would force immigrants to litigate their cases — a process that could take years — while being detained.

Last week, the Department of Justice's Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that people who enter the country without authorization must be detained throughout their removal proceedings, a process that can take years. 

The decision stems from the case of Jonathan Javier Yajure Hurtado, a Venezuelan citizen who entered the United States in 2022. In 2024, he was granted Temporary Protected Status, which expired in April; he was subsequently arrested. At his bond hearing, the immigration judge ruled he did not have the authority to set bond, which meant Hurtado would stay in detention.

The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) agreed with the judge's ruling. In its September 5 decision, the three-judge panel ruled that “[a]liens who are present in the United States without admission …. must be detained for the duration of their removal proceedings.”

Two of the judges were appointed during Trump's first presidential term by then-Attorney General William Barr and one was appointed during his second term by Attorney General Pam Bondi. 

Previously, people were generally eligible for bond hearings if they had been in the United States for at least two years. 

“[J]ust as Immigration Judges have no authority to redetermine the custody of arriving aliens who present themselves at a port of entry, they likewise have no authority to redetermine the custody conditions of an alien who crossed the border unlawfully without inspection, even if that alien has avoided apprehension for more than 2 years,” the board wrote. 

According to the board's website, its “decisions are binding on all DHS officers and Immigration Judges unless modified or overruled by the Attorney General or a federal court.”

“Most BIA decisions are subject to judicial review in the federal courts,” the website states. 

The Trump administration applauded the decision. 

“Big win for our ICE attorneys securing our ability to detain illegal aliens until they are deported,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted on social media. “The One Big Beautiful Bill includes significant funding for new ICE lawyers.”

Advocates warn that the board's decision will coerce people to “self-deport” even if they could ultimately win their case and stay in the United States. The Trump administration has waged an aggressive campaign to encourage people, including DACA recipients, to leave the United States. In social media posts and public statements, they have warned immigrants that if they stay, they may be detained in inhumane facilities like Alligator Alcatraz or Louisiana Lockup, a unit at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola. 

Dana Leigh Marks, a former immigration judge and former head of the judges' union, told Politico the board's ruling was “horrific.”  

“No self-respecting lawyer could look themselves in the mirror and take these positions,” she said. “It's a total cynical move to try to force people to litigate their cases while they're detained.”

The decision affirms a July 8 memo from the the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), that states, effective immediately, those who entered the country without prior authorization are “ineligible for a custody redetermination hearing (‘bond hearing') before an immigration judge and may not be released for the duration of their removal proceedings absent a parole by DHS.”

The American Immigration Lawyers Association wrote that the new policy “would be facilitated by the $45 billion in new detention funding Congress enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill, which will enable ICE to double detention capacity to 100,000 beds.”

“If fully implemented, the new ICE policy would apply to millions of people who entered the country without inspection and, as a result, would mandate their detention,” the group continued. “ICE's new policy is an unlawful attempt to strip noncitizens of their statutory right to a bond hearing and will subject millions of people to mandatory detention and possible fast-track deportation under expedited removal.”

Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network, told Truthout in a statement that the Board's decision is “yet another example of how Trump is using immigration detention as a testing ground for authoritarianism.”

“Let's be clear about what this decision means: millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. could be denied due process rights and can be detained indefinitely,” she said. “Detention facilitates deportation, and expanding detention is key to Trump carrying out his cruel, multi-layered, mass detention and deportation agenda.”

However, Shah noted, the “expansion of detention is not a done deal.”

“Advocates across the country have fought to shut down facilities in their communities and block the opening of new ones, and we can do it again,” she said. “Nationwide protests have once again illuminated that people do not want ICE agents and detention centers in their communities.” 

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            French lawmakers voted to oust Prime Minister François Bayrou Monday, plunging the country into a new political crisis and leaving it without a government at a time of increasing economic strain and geopolitical tensions.
    


            A total of 364 MPs voted against Bayrou and 194 voted for him after he called the vote in a bid to push through an unpopular €44 billion ($51 billion) savings plan that included scrapping two public holidays and freezing government spending. The 364 votes against Bayrou were well above the 280-vote threshold needed to topple the government.
    


            Bayrou will now be forced to step down after just nine months in office, following in the footsteps of his predecessor Michel Barnier, who lost a no-confidence vote last December.
    


            Bayrou is expected to submit his resignation to French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday morning, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. The prime minister's departure leaves Macron with few palatable options.
    


            Investors have been rattled. Yields on French government bonds – or the interest rate demanded by investors – have risen above those of Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bonds, which were once at the heart of the eurozone debt crisis. A possible downgrade of France's sovereign debt rating review Friday would deliver another blow to its economic standing in Europe.
    


            “You have the power to bring down the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,” Bayrou told lawmakers on Monday ahead of the vote. “Reality will remain relentless: expenses will continue to rise, and the burden of debt, already unbearable, will grow heavier and more costly.”
    


            “We broke the social contract” with younger generations, Bayrou added.
    


            The political instability can be traced back to Macron's own dramatic decision last year to call a snap election. Piqued by the remarkable results of the far-right National Rally in the European Parliament elections of May 2024, the French president forced a vote in which his party lost seats to the far right and far left, leaving France with a splintered parliament.
    


            Even before the vote, the prospect of Bayrou's downfall sparked calls for the president to step aside, though he has vowed to serve out his term. Far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen has demanded he dissolve parliament, but fresh elections would almost certainly strengthen her party and fracture the French parliament further.
    


            Another path would be for Macron to appoint a caretaker government while looking for a new prime minister, with Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin among the frontrunners for what is likely to be a poisoned chalice.
    


            The trouble for Macron is that, after three failed centrist prime ministers, the opposition parties are in no mood to give another one a chance. Both the far right and far left have signaled they would immediately call for a vote of no confidence if another such premier were appointed. Naming a prime minister from another political camp is, in theory, an option, but a choice on the right would be blocked by the left, and vice versa.
    


            For the next prime minister, the budget fight will be just as fraught. The Socialists want to tax the rich and roll back Macron's tax cuts for businesses – all red lines to Les Republicains, the long-standing conservative party and a key player in the coalition cobbled together after the snap election. The upshot is that France's fiscal mess is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon.
    


            In the event of another snap parliamentary election, a recent Elabe poll suggests the National Rally would emerge on top, with the left coming in second and Macron's centrist bloc a distant third. Many now assume the far right will eventually take power – if not now, then after the 2027 presidential election – though few believe such an outcome would solve the country's problems.
    


            Public trust in the political class has collapsed and anger is set to spill onto the streets: the far left has called nationwide protests for Wednesday, under the banner “Bloquons tout” (“Let's block everything”), with trade unions planning another mobilization on September 18.
    


            All of this comes at the worst possible geopolitical moment, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. Instability in Paris is a gift to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, who share a common delight in mocking Europe's weaknesses.

            US Steel is shuttering production at a mill in November, but its hundreds of workers will keep their jobs – for now – thanks to an agreement the company reached with the Trump administration.
    


            US Steel will stop producing steel at its Granite City, Illinois, mill at the end of October, but the 800 workers at the plant will stay on the job, maintaining equipment, until at least 2027. That's due to the structure of the deal the company reached with President Donald Trump to allow its purchase by Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel. The agreement included various job protections and production guarantees.
    


            “US Steel will optimize its footprint by focusing on producing and processing steel slabs at the Mon Valley (Pennsylvania) Works and Gary (Indiana) Works, and reducing slab consumption at Granite City Works,” the company said in a statement to CNN Monday. “As a result of this decision, US Steel will not lay off any Granite City Works employees nor adjust their pay rate.”
    


            The company added that it would not idle the plant, and keep it in an operational state.
    


            As for what the workers will be doing without any steel to produce, US Steel said it will continue some ancillary operations and that the facility will be “maintained by employees so production could resume quickly if the situation changes.”
    


            Trump promised at a May rally at a US Steel mill outside of Pittsburgh that the deal, and new 50% tariffs on steel imports, would be good for US Steel employees.
    


            “The deal got better and better and better for the workers. I'm going to be watching over it. It's going to be great,” Trump said at the time. “They're going to be here for a long time… There will be no outsourcing and no layoffs whatsoever.”
    


            But the clock is ticking. US Steel's deal only blocks it from closing Granite City and laying off workers until June of 2027.
    


            The White House did not have an immediate comment on the closing plans, nor did the United Steelworkers union. While USW locals in Pennsylvania supported the agreement with Nippon, the larger USW organization objected to the deal.
    


            “Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy,” the union said in a statement after the rally in May. “Binding commitments are hard. The devil is always in the details, and that is especially true with a bad actor like Nippon Steel that has again and again violated our trade laws, devastating steel communities in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.”
    


            The plant in question has 700 hourly workers represented by the USW and about 100 salaried staff. But that is a fraction of the 2,000 hourly workers it used to employ when the plant had its own blast furnaces to make steel from raw materials such as iron and coke.
    


            Granite City Works first blast furnace was shut in 2019, and its remaining one closed in 2023. Since then, it has only processed slabs made at other mills.

US president applauded West Point alumni for abruptly calling off a ceremony honoring the actor

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump launched a vitriolic attack against Tom Hanks for supposedly being “destructive” and “woke” after one of America's most beloved actors was snubbed without much explanation by West Point last week.

On his social media site on Monday, the US president applauded the alumni association of the US Military Academy (or West Point) for abruptly calling off a ceremony honoring Hanks, twice an Academy award winner who has played numerous military characters and also has a long history of advocating for veterans.

Trump wrote: “Our great West Point (getting greater all the time!) has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks. Important move! We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”

Hanks had been scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award later this month for his “service and accomplishments in the national interest”.

In a message to faculty, retired Col Mark Bieger declared the cancellation would allow the institution to “continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight and win as officers in the world's most lethal force, the United States Army”, without elaborating how the two are connected.

Hanks has previously endorsed Democratic candidates including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

He has been deeply involved in veterans' causes. He was the national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial in Washington DC. He also supported Bob Dole's fundraising campaign for the Dwight D Eisenhower Memorial, according to the alumni association's own original statement.

He has already been inducted as an honorary member into the US Army's Ranger Hall of Fame. In 2016, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Among his military portrayals are Capt John Miller in Saving Private Ryan, the Vietnam war soldier Forrest Gump (for which he won the Oscar for best actor), and Cmdr Ernie Krause in Greyhound, for which he also wrote the screenplay. He also portrayed the title role in 2013's Captain Phillips and appeared in the cold war film Bridge of Spies.

His work has made him one of the US's most decorated actors, with seven Emmy awards to go alongside the five Academy award nominations for best actor, which he won twice in a row.

Trump, who has dabbled in acting including a cameo in Home Alone 2, has regularly complained about never winning an Emmy for his reality television show The Apprentice, lamenting that he “should have gotten it”, that he “got screwed out of an Emmy” and that “the Emmys are all politics”.

            As Democrats continue their internal debate over transgender rights, Abigail Spanberger, the party's nominee for governor of Virginia, is directly responding to Republican ads that echo the commercials run against Kamala Harris last year.
    


            “I'm Abigail Spanberger, mom to three girls in public school,” Spanberger says in a new campaign ad that shows her daughters on screen. “Nothing matters more to me than the safety of all our kids, and as a law enforcement officer, I went after child predators, so it really angers me to hear these lies about who I am.”
    


            “I believe we need to get politics out of our schools and trust parents and local communities. As a mom and as your governor, I will be focused on making our schools the best in the nation.”
    


            Spanberger's Republican opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, is trying to follow Gov. Glenn Youngkin's playbook from four years ago when he focused on schools and parental rights.
    


            Earle-Sears, the state's lieutenant governor, has been accusing Spanberger of allowing trans girls to compete in female sports as part of a broader wave of anti-transgender rhetoric. She is among several Republicans nationally airing anti-trans commercials that echo “Kamala is for they/them,” the tagline of three commercials run by President Donald Trump during his successful 2024 campaign.
    


            Four years ago, Youngkin campaigned heavily on pandemic-related school closures and overhauls of how the history and implications of racism was taught in public schools, holding “Parents Matter” rallies across the commonwealth.
    


            He seized on a fall debate moment from his Democratic opponent Terry McAuliffe when McAuliffe said, “I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”
    


            McAuliffe was referring to a bill he vetoed as governor that would force schools to warn parents if their children will be assigned books with sexually explicit content. The former governor instead thought the decision should be left up to local school boards.
    


            But the damage was done.
    


            “We decide in fact that we are going to be in charge of our children's education,” Youngkin repeated in the closing weeks of the campaign.
    


            Earle-Sears, who is behind Spanberger in public polling and has faced Republican criticism about her campaign, is running ads that underscore she will “defend kids” and “empower parents.”
    


            “It's time for everyone to recognize what is settled truth. Girls are girls and boys are boys,” said Earle-Sears at a news conference last month.
    


            Though the focus on transgender children was not as prominent then as it is now, tapping into gender issues in schools both animated Republican voters and drew religious and conservative Democratic voters in 2021. And after Harris' loss to Trump in last year's presidential election, some Democrats, notably California Gov. Gavin Newsom, have said trans girls should not be allowed to participate in girls' sports.
    


            Spanberger's campaign declined to address the specific criticism in Earle-Sears ads, both in its new ad and in follow-up questions from CNN.
    


            Spanberger has not answered whether she agrees that young people should be able to use any bathroom in a school building that corresponds with their gender identity even if it doesn't correlate with their sex assigned at birth. She also has avoided getting into specifics when addressing transgender athletes' participation in women's sports. She has instead said that her “priority is making sure Virginia's kids are safe and supported.” Her campaign says she believes these are choices that should be made at the local level with local parental input.
    


            “I understand the delicate balance that she's trying to strike,” said Monica Hutchinson, a community organizer and parent of a trans young adult who attended Virginia schools. “We have allowed this issue to balloon and overshadow all of the other really serious issues that plague Virginia.”
    


Virginia will elect its first female governor this fall. Neither candidate is talking much about it



            Fred Hicks, a longtime Democratic strategist, says the Spanberger campaign is making the right choice by addressing the issue but doesn't know if it will be sufficient.
    


            “I think for an opening salvo, a first attempt at addressing it, this is a smart way to play it,” Hicks said. “The real issue at hand is, who do you trust to protect your children.”
    


            All indications are that Earle-Sears will continue to focus on gender politics and that her campaign views it as a victory that Spanberger had no choice but to address it.
    


            “Abigail Spanberger was forced to go on defense and release an ad after remaining silent about her stance on boys' in girls sports and locker rooms. Now, instead of hiding in her basement, she's hiding behind a manufactured TV ad trying to repair her badly damaged image,” Earle-Sears campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel said in a statement.
    


            Meanwhile, the Democratic Governors Association is confident they can navigate the conversation around transgender students because they've combatted similar efforts in the recent past. In their view, this conversation is not what moves most voters; the governor's race in Virginia will come down to public safety and lowering costs.
    


            “In battleground races for governor in 2022, 2023 and 2024, voters consistently rejected extreme Republicans who spent all their time stoking division with culture wars in favor of Democratic candidates who won by aggressively campaigning on plans to address the biggest kitchen table issues impacting families,” said DGA Communications Director Sam Newton.

            While many CEOs have stayed silent during President Donald Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve, hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin is speaking out about the dangers.
    


            Trump risks “stoking both higher inflation and higher long-term rates” by undermining the independence of the Fed, Griffin co-wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday titled “Trump's risky game with the Fed.”
    


            “The president's strategy of publicly criticizing the Fed, suggesting the dismissal of governors and pressuring the central bank to adopt a more permissive stance towards inflation carries steep costs,” wrote Griffin, CEO of Citadel; and Anil Kashyap, a professor at the Chicago Booth Business School and a consultant to the Chicago Fed's research department.
    


            The duo warns that history shows how this strategy can backfire, including the Nixon-era pressure on the Fed in the 1970s that set the stage for the Great Stagflation crisis.
    


            “In a worst-case scenario, if the Fed visibly bows to political pressure and permits inflation to rise unchecked, tens of millions of retired Americans will see their savings diminished,” Griffin and Kashyap wrote. “Senior voters — tired of bearing the brunt of inflation — could cost the administration dearly in the midterms.”
    


            The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            The warning represents a rare reprimand from a CEO at a time when many business leaders have tried to steer clear of publicly criticizing the president and others have gone out of their way to curry favor. Big bank CEOs publicly defended Fed independence this summer, while avoiding criticizing Trump directly.
    


            Griffin, who has said he voted for Trump in last November's election, has repeatedly slammed the administration's trade war.
    


            Trump has relentlessly condemned Jerome Powell, his handpicked Fed chair who was later reappointed by former President Joe Biden. Some Fed watchers worry Trump could try to give the US central bank a MAGA makeover in an effort to exert greater influence over interest rates.
    


            Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued the Fed must be relieved of its duties regulating America's banks because the US central bank has veered from its core mission.
    


            Griffin and Kashyap, in the Journal op-ed, expressed concern that Trump's war on the Fed will backfire in at least two ways.
    


            First, artificially low rates from the Fed could overheat the economy — worsening inflation at a time when polls show voters remain frustrated over the cost of living.
    


            Secondly, investors could lose faith the Fed is committed to keeping prices stable, leading to even higher long-term borrowing costs for both the federal government and homebuyers.
    


            “While the US benefits from a large stock of credibility accumulated over decades, it isn't limitless,” Griffin and Kashyap wrote. “If eroded, markets will demand far higher interest rates for longer-term debt.”
    


            The two also argued that it's in the president's “best interest” for the Fed to be viewed as independent and to actually act independently.
    


            This frees Fed officials to make unpopular but necessary choices — like spiking interest rates to fight inflation. That's what the Powell-led Fed did (albeit belatedly) in 2022 when prices skyrocketed.
    


            “Credibility in economic policymaking is built slowly, through practice and respect for processes,” Griffin and Kashyap wrote, “and can be lost quickly if those processes are disregarded.”

Court's action gives the justices additional time to consider Trump's formal request to let him fire Rebecca Slaughter

US politics live – latest updates

The US supreme court allowed Donald Trump on Monday to keep a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission away from her post for now, temporarily pausing a judicial order that required the reinstatement of the commissioner who the Republican president has sought to oust.

The court's action, known as an administrative stay, gives the justices additional time to consider Trump's formal request to let him fire Rebecca Slaughter from the consumer protection agency that enforces antitrust law before her term expires.

The stay was issued by John Roberts, the chief justice who handles emergency filings arising in Washington DC.

The Trump administration had asked the US supreme court on Thursday to let him temporarily remove Slaughter as the legal fight over the Republican president's dismissal of her plays out.

The request came after US district judge Loren AliKhan blocked Trump's firing of Slaughter. AliKhan ruled in July that Trump's attempt to remove Slaughter did not comply with removal protections in federal law. Congress put such tenure protections in place to give certain regulatory agencies a degree of independence from presidential control.

The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit on 2 September in a 2-1 decision upheld the judge's ruling, prompting the administration's request to the supreme court.

The lower courts ruled that the statutory protections shielding FTC members from being removed without cause conform with the US constitution in light of a 1935 supreme court precedent in a case called Humphrey's Executor v United States.

In that case, the court ruled that a president lacks unfettered power to remove FTC commissioners, faulting then president Franklin Roosevelt's firing of an FTC commissioner for policy differences.

The administration in its supreme court filing argued that “the modern FTC exercises far more substantial powers than the 1935 FTC,” and thus its members can be fired at will by the president.

The court in a similar ruling in May said the constitution gives the president wide latitude to fire government officials who wield executive power on his behalf.

The administration has repeatedly asked the justices this year to allow implementation of Trump policies impeded by lower courts. The supreme court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has sided with the administration in almost every case that it has been called upon to review since Trump returned to the presidency in January.

Group of men in 20s found in Catskill Mountains by forest rangers, who later hiked up to retrieve one man's keys

Four hikers who had consumed psychedelic mushrooms – including one experiencing a “debilitating high” – had to be rescued from New York's Catskill Mountains after they got lost there, according to state authorities.

In a news release, forest rangers from the the New York state department of environmental conservation (DEC) said that they were alerted to the situation at about 5pm on 29 August after the receipt of a satellite text.

The message came from a hiker who reported that a group of four hikers were lost near Giant Ledge in the Slide Mountain Wilderness – an interconnected trail hike with elevations ranging from 1,100 to 2,600ft and several sheer cliffs and drops.

“The original caller admitted the group had consumed mushrooms and one of them was experiencing a debilitating high,” the DEC said.

Three forest rangers responded and located the group at approximately 6.45pm. They helped the group to the trailhead, where the hikers were evaluated by a Shandaken ambulance crew.

Complicating matters for the group of hikers was the fact that they had also lost their car keys, the news release said.

“Rangers provided a courtesy ride to the subjects' rental lodging,” authorities said. They added that ranger Russell Martin “hiked back up” the following day and “found a sling bag with the keys under a log in tall ferns”.

Martin, who participated in the rescue, told the New York Times: “I'm not an expert in mushrooms, but these gentlemen definitely rode highs and lows.”

The DEC did not release the names of the hikers, but Martin said that all four were men in their 20s.

The Police Benevolent Association of New York State, a law enforcement union, commended the rangers' efforts in a statement.

“This level of dedication, at the start of a busy Labor Day weekend, is representative of the commitment shared by our forest ranger members,” the union said. “The PBA of New York State is proud to highlight our forest rangers and all members' continued dedication to public safety in the face of difficulty and danger.”

The rescue in the Catskills called to mind a similar case from May, in which two hikers who had reportedly ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms called authorities to report that a third member of their group had died.

But, when the rangers arrived, they found the third individual alive and uninjured. It was determined that the two hikers were in an “altered mental state”, a news release said.

The two hikers who had “ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms” were escorted to a waiting ambulance as well as a New York state police cruiser, and the third was taken back to the group's campsite.

The government will take steps to develop “world-class genomic medicine,” according to a draft basic plan for medical measures that utilize genomic data.

The government will work to balance the medicine with bioethics and discrimination prevention, according to the draft. It will also work to promote research and development and improve delivery systems for medical services.

The draft is set to be submitted to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Health, Labor and Welfare Division on Tuesday, with Cabinet approval sought by the end of this year.

It is the first such draft to be formulated under the genomic medicine law, which was enacted in June 2023. Genomic medicine utilizes genetic information to treat diseases, and expectations are high that genome analysis could lead to the development of drugs and ways of identifying causes of diseases such as cancer.

On the other hand, there are concerns that genomic medicine could lead to discrimination, as an individual's genetic information can be used to predict their future health status, as well as that of their family.

Included in the draft is the overall goal of “contributing to public health by promoting genomic medicine while respecting individual rights and interests.”

The draft also establishes three pillars: conducting activities to raise awareness and gain public support; building delivery systems for medical services; and promoting research and development.

Regarding the activities to raise awareness, the draft states that the government will establish a service for consultations about genomic medicine through the Justice Ministry's consultation system for issues related to human rights and through labor standards inspection offices, among others, within fiscal 2025. It plans to compile information on unjust treatments and disseminate it to relevant agencies.

The government also plans within the fiscal year to prepare educational materials, and utilize them at schools and workplaces across the nation from next fiscal year.

For the medical service delivery systems, the government aims to establish an environment in which patients can easily access genomic medicine by improving medical institutions, which play a central role in delivering genomic medical services, with national and other public hospitals thought to be in mind.

It will also work on building a cooperative network between medical institutions.

For research and development, the draft states that the government will work to develop a framework for establishing a database of genomic information, as well as nurturing personnel related to genomics. It will also help the personnel hone their expertise.

A deputy chairman of the Slovak parliament and member of the ruling Smer party, Tibor Gaspar, compared Ukraine to the Hamas militant group and said Russia had been provoked to launch its full-scale invasion, Slovak media outlet Aktuality reported on Sept. 7.

Gaspar made the comments during a televised debate, echoing Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's repeated claims that while Russia violated international law, it had "reasons" to attack Ukraine.

"Robert Fico has repeatedly spoken about how he perceives Russia's actions. He considers the start of the war a violation of international law, but... this is a provoked aggression," Gaspar said.

The lawmaker went further by equating Ukraine to Hamas and its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

"This is the same kind of provoked conflict as when terrorists from Palestine attacked Israel. The war developed in exactly the same way," Gaspar added.

Russia's unprovoked act of aggression against a U.N.-recognized country was condemned by international law and the overwhelming majority of the world.

The comparison distorts reality by likening Ukraine, a sovereign state defending itself against Russian invasion, to Hamas, a militant group designated as terrorist by multiple countries, that massacred civilians and took hostages.

Since returning to power in 2023, Fico and his Smer party have ended military aid to Ukraine and questioned EU sanctions on Russia. He has also vowed to block Ukraine's NATO accession.

During his meeting with Fico in Beijing on Sept. 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Bratislava's stance as an "independent foreign policy" that brings "positive results."

Slovakia, along with Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has faced growing criticism from European allies for deepening ties with Moscow.

The EU has dispatched a delegation to Washington to discuss potential new restrictions with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who, despite repeated threats, has yet to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

Alexey Sinitsyn, CEO of potash producer K-Potash Service, was found dead near Kaliningrad.

"If the Europeans drew a line and said: 'We're not going to buy more Russian gas, we're not going to buy Russian oil.' Would that have a positive influence on the U.S. leaning in more aggressively (on sanctions) as well? Absolutely," U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.



U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Sept. 7 that he is prepared to advance to a new phase of sanctions against Russia, prompting experts to speculate on what the next step might involve.

China's exports to Russia fell 16.4% year-on-year in August, the sharpest drop in five months, adding to July's 8.6% decline.

Khabarovsk in Russia's Far East is more than 6,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Russian propagandist Margarita Simonyan said on Sept. 7 that she has been recently diagnosed with a "serious illness" and is about to undergo surgery.





A 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee was fatally stabbed in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 22, The Charlotte Observer reported.

"Potatoes, eggs, milk, and butter are becoming more expensive... But some unscrupulous producers, suppliers, or sellers are allowing themselves to profit in this way," Russian Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov said.

Russian authorities are known to extract confessions under duress, and the highly formalized language of the arrested man's testimony suggested it may have been pre-written.

"The drone is unarmed, and there are Cyrillic inscriptions on it," said Agnieszka Kepka, spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Poland's eastern city of Lublin.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched 810 Shahed-type drones and 13 cruise and ballistic missiles during the attack.

The Chinese military has condemned the passage of Canadian and Australian warships through the Taiwan Strait, calling it a provocation.

China considers Taiwan – self-ruled since 1949 when nationalist forces retreated after losing the Chinese Civil War – as part of its territory under the One-China principle.

It also claims the strait as its own. While neither Canada nor Australia formally recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, many, including the US, Canada, the UK, France, and Australia, view the strait as an international channel and conduct regular transits.

The Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec and the Australian destroyer HMAS Brisbane entered the strait early Saturday, a day after Beijing accused both nations of stoking tensions with military drills in the South China Sea.

China said its forces tracked and warned the vessels, describing the operation as “trouble-making and provocation.”

“The actions of the Canadians and Australians send the wrong signals and increase security risks,” the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command said on Sunday.

An Australian Defense Department spokesperson said Brisbane made a “routine transit” with the Canadian ship from September 6 to 7. “Australian vessels and aircraft will continue to exercise freedom of navigation and uphold international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,” the spokesperson added.

Canadian Joint Operations Command declined to comment on the transit, saying the Ville de Quebec was deployed on Operation Horizon, Canada's Indo-Pacific mission aimed at promoting “peace and stability.”

Earlier this week, the frigate also joined what Canada and its partners described as freedom-of-navigation drills off the Philippines with Australia, the US, and local forces. Beijing rejected this, denouncing the exercise and accusing Manila of colluding with Western powers to undermine regional stability.

The Taiwan Strait, one of the world's busiest shipping routes, remains a vital corridor for global trade and a flashpoint between China and Western navies. Earlier this year, another Canadian frigate, HMCS Montreal, also transited the strait in what Ottawa called a routine passage. The Chinese military at the time vowed to “resolutely take countermeasures against any threats or provocations.”

 How the War Is Driving a Wave of Purges and Suicides Among the Country's Elites

 Andrei Kolesnikov

In the 1920s, the Bolshevik economic theorist and Communist Party darling Nikolai Bukharin was one of Stalin's closest allies. But as Stalin became entrenched in power, Bukharin found that he was no less vulnerable to the dictator's wrath than anyone else. Accused of conspiracy in 1937, Bukharin was executed the following year. Bukharin is credited with a grim joke: “We may have two parties—one in power, the other in prison.” He might have added, “or dead.” By the time of Bukharin's arrest, Stalin was systematically replacing the people who had secured his ascent to power with a new generation of young and ambitious politicians and officials for whom total loyalty to the leader would be everything.

Among elites in Russia today, something like Bukharin's story is happening once again. On July 7, Roman Starovoit, the minister of transport, killed himself with a firearm a few hours after being sacked by Russian President Vladimir Putin. A few days earlier, Andrei Badalov, the vice president of the oil transportation company Transneft, fell from the window of an apartment building. Badalov was only the latest of a series of top officials in the oil and gas sector who have been purged or died mysteriously since Putin's “special military operation” in Ukraine began in 2022. According to Novaya Gazeta, the independent Russian newspaper, there have been 56 deaths of successful businesspeople and officials under strange circumstances since February 2022. Many of them have fallen out of windows. More and more, people who have loyally served Putin's system are being persecuted, mainly on the grounds of corruption.

In 2024, the Ministry of Defense was hit with a sweeping corruption crackdown. In May of that year, Sergei Shoigu, the longtime defense minister known for his proximity to Putin, was sacked, and appointed to the primarily ceremonial position of chair of the Security Council. Shoigu's deputy Timur Ivanov was less fortunate: he was arrested on large-scale corruption charges and, in July, sentenced to 13 years in prison—one of the longest sentences for any current or former high-ranking Russian official since the end of the Cold War. Since then, there have been many more arrests—especially of regional functionaries at various levels. As the Putin regime turns on its own people, it, too, has begun to replace them with a new breed of loyalists, people whose primary qualifications are their apparent fealty to the leader, and sometimes their participation in the war. Still, Putin prefers experienced and talented technocrats for the most responsible positions, such as governors and ministers.

After more than three and a half years of war and mounting economic challenges, Putin's aim is not to fight corruption. His goal is to avoid internal threats. And to do that, he needs to turn the elites into a frightened and therefore controllable class. With the demise of Starovoit, a trusted Putin official, a feeling has emerged among Russian elites that no one is protected and that loyalty alone is not always enough to survive in the system. As in the Stalin era, it is not clear who might be next.

Even for experienced members of Russia's political class, the meaning of Starovoit's suicide was difficult to interpret. On the one hand, he had not yet been charged with anything, but on the other, it was clear that he had chosen death over prison. Nonetheless, several important figures, including St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov, attended Starovoit's funeral; earlier, a number of members of the government and deputy prime ministers appeared at a memorial ceremony for Starovoit in Moscow. State news agencies reported that Putin was supposed to send a wreath to one of these events. But later, they were forced to retract those reports.

All this may have caused a feeling of awkwardness and fear among those who attended: Had they done the right thing to pay last respects to a man who had lost the president's trust? In fact, it appeared that Starovoit had become ensnared in a campaign against large-scale corruption in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, where he had served as governor until the spring of 2024. Starting in December of that year, a number of Starovoit's former colleagues and subordinates were implicated in embezzlement of military funds—including 19 billion rubles (around $250 million) that had been allocated for defenses along the Ukrainian border. These are the kinds of things that Putin does not forgive.

But Starovoit's death was hardly an isolated case. In January, the deputy head of the Vladivostok administration fell from a hotel window in Thailand. The following month, the head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in the Republic of Karelia fell from a window in his office. Later in the spring, a high-ranking police officer and a prison system employee died from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds. And shortly before Starovoit's suicide, the vice governor of the Leningrad region was found dead with a gunshot wound in a country house. Meanwhile, according to Novaya Gazeta, some 140 officials and administrators of medium and high rank were arrested in June and July alone, mostly on corruption-related charges.

Until now, corruption has rarely attracted much attention in Putin's system. There are no poor officials, and no one is ashamed of their wealth, no matter how it was obtained. But the siphoning of state funds connected to the war has become too sensitive for Putin. This has been confirmed not only by the purges of defense ministry officials and Starovoit's death but also by the arrest of officials in Belgorod and Bryansk, two other regions bordering Ukraine. Ivanov, the fabulously wealthy former deputy defense minister who was responsible for military construction projects, among other things, received his harsh prison sentence for allegedly embezzling more than four billion rubles ($52 million) through foreign bank transfers. But the recent arrests are not only related to military graft; some appear to be part of a broader purge of regional officials with connections at the federal level.

Fear does not play a determining role in the lives of ordinary Russians. Most members of the public have adapted to current circumstances and continue to either support Putin's regime, or, to avoid problems, pretend that they do. (According to August polling by the independent Levada Center, a large majority—69 percent—of respondents agree that “the country is moving in the right direction”; this is despite the fact that for several months now, similar majorities—some two-thirds of respondents—have said that it is necessary to move toward peace talks rather than continue military action, the highest such figures since the start of the war.) 

Many Russians are convinced that the silencing of Putin's opponents, and now the widening arrests of officials, are bells tolling for someone else; they do not concern them. People know they need to behave cautiously, but their conformist behavior is shaped more by learned indifference and anticipatory obedience to everything they cannot influence. Any unpleasant government decision—such as the August order blocking voice calls on WhatsApp and Telegram, on the pretext of preventing scams and terrorist activity—tends to be perceived mostly with passive discontent and immediate adaptation with the search for alternative practical solutions.

For the political bosses, oligarchs, bureaucrats, and business executives who constitute Russia's elites, however, it is an altogether different story. For them, fear has become a highly effective means of control. The problem for them is that they own their wealth only as long as the state allows them to do so. After more than three and a half years of war, the Kremlin is in dire need of additional funds—informal income streams from big business and “patriotic” investments in industries that are important for the state. Lately, the government seems determined to nationalize any privately owned asset or company it can easily get its hands on. The most significant case so far was the seizure, in June 2025, of Moscow's huge Domodedovo airport on the grounds that its owners held foreign passports or dual citizenship. Such blatant grabs by the state send a clear signal to those who are tempted to think that the perquisites of Russian elite status—money and businesses—belong exclusively to them.

In Putin's system, it turns out that joining or maintaining a place in the establishment—whether close or more distant to the regime—is dangerous. Until the war, there were various patronage networks, and mini-patrons could regulate relations and protect their own vassals from the biggest patron: the president. Much of this system is still in place, but it no longer works properly. For example, it was widely understood that Starovoit was under the protection of the Rotenberg brothers, Boris and Arkady, billionaires who have been close to Putin since their youth. But in the end, it didn't help him. Mini-patrons, it appears, are no longer able or willing to protect their vassals. 



Take Vadim Moshkovich, the billionaire founder of Russia's largest agro-industrial business and former member of the upper house of parliament, who was arrested in March 2025 and charged with embezzling 30 billion rubles ($357 million). Moshkovich has denied the charges and no one seems to know who among his detractors was behind his detention. Yet no one from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs—the so-called trade union of oligarchs that represents major businesses—publicly stood up for him.

Sometimes the attacks have been more overtly political. On August 20, a court in Yekaterinburg fined the deputy director of the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center, Lyudmila Telen, for reposting an old Facebook post that “discredited the Russian Armed Forces”—signaling a new front against the remaining liberal elements of Russian society. In previous years, Russian authorities largely avoided attacking Yeltsin, who died in 2007 and who as the country's first president after the Cold War was the man who picked Putin to succeed him. In 2015, the Yeltsin Foundation opened the Yeltsin Center, a prominent independent museum and research institution in Yeltsin's hometown of Yekaterinburg, and the foundation has also run a smaller branch of the Yeltsin Center in Moscow.

But influential conservative forces close to the Kremlin have long sought to tarnish his liberal legacy, and “patriotic” influencers and quasi-public organizations have been allowed to discredit and interfere with the work of the Yeltsin Center. Now, the legal case against Telen, a former liberal journalist, signals that this campaign is transitioning to a more formal legal and administrative level. What Telen reposted on Facebook was an antiwar message written more than three years ago by Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Yumasheva. The state knows that it cannot prosecute the daughter of the first Russian president, so it has set out instead to stymie the Yeltsin Center and the allegedly pro-Western liberals who run it. 

Along with the ruling against Telen, the center's activities have largely been ground to a halt. It doesn't seem to matter that the head of the center's board of trustees is also the head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation, Anton Vaino. As in the case of Starovoit, no one in the system today is going to stand up for anyone. Everyone is afraid.

For Russian elites, there is another important lesson in Starovoit's demise. In pursuing first the transport minister's former subordinates and then the man himself, Putin was deploying a strategy that has also been seen elsewhere, including at the defense ministry. In this approach, ever higher levels of the military, federal, and regional elites are gradually implicated, layer by layer, like slices of salami.

 There is no question that the government is now slicing off layers with much greater speed—suggesting how suspicious the top leadership and, possibly, the top leader himself, has become since the start of the “special military operation”: people who dare to steal while others are fighting for him, or people who are not sincere in support for the government and the war, but simply biding their time, must be punished. Or perhaps it is a self-developing process: the system has begun to devour itself as it did in the Stalin era. And many officials now know they could well end up as the next slice.

But this doesn't mean there aren't opportunities for others. During the purges of the late 1930s, a new generation of young and ambitious politicians and officials quickly arrived to take the places of Stalin's purged comrades. Officials were dismissed in waves even from the very source of repression—the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs—as new commissars arrived to replace them. The scale of what is happening today is of course incomparable to the mass purges of those times. But the point is the principle: Putin has now indicated that he trusts, at least for the moment, those who “protect” Russia, and that means new career prospects for these people—including special retraining programs, incentives to adapt to civilian life, and preferential access to education and employment. For instance, the state pays for the education of “participants in the special military operation” and their children, and universities are required to allocate at least ten percent of their places for them. As of mid-August, 28,000 people were enrolled in Russian universities in 2025 under the preferential quota for special military operation participants and members of their families—a nearly 75 percent increase over the previous year.

In fascist Italy, this kind of patronage of the warrior class was known as trincerocrazia, the “trenchocracy,” based on Mussolini's idea that veterans from the trenches had a natural right to rule the country. In Russia's case, Putin cannot help all of Russia's veterans, given how many there are. But he will be able to promote a few, positioning them for leadership roles in the distant future. (Putin has no intention of going anywhere any time soon.) The rise of these trenchocrats has created another layer of anxiety for Russia's existing elites. The system has already signaled to members of its upper echelons to watch their financial transactions carefully; now, they will need to be more Putinist than Putin himself.

Over time, the replacement of Russia's elite with a new generation of military heroes can degrade the quality of the regional and federal bureaucracy. In certain crucial areas, it could more directly threaten the functioning of the state. Consider the country's financial managers. An enduring mystery to many Western observers is how Russia has been able to remain relatively solvent despite the extraordinary pressures of three and half years of war. One answer is the Kremlin's highly skilled financial and economic officials, and the leaders of Russia's central bank. These institutions are still led by former liberals such as Anton Siluanov, the finance minister, and Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of the central bank. Putin's system would have collapsed long ago if it weren't for the remnants of the market economy, including adaptive small and medium-sized businesses, as well as competent monetary and budget policy.

Since the “special operation” began, Nabiullina has managed to keep the financial system relatively stable despite extraordinary levels of military spending, in part by keeping interest rates very high: in July, they were lowered to 18 percent, after reaching a peak of 21 percent last year. In doing so, she has put a break on inflation (which is nevertheless nearly approaching a double-digit figure on an annual basis). She has also signaled in a somewhat veiled way that only by reducing the extravagant levels of spending now required for the “special military operation” will the government set the conditions for her to bring rates down. 

So far, Russia's financial technocrats have not been fired because Putin seems to recognize that he needs them. But if the system continues to deteriorate, perhaps they will become scapegoats, as well, and he will replace them with voodoo economists. If that happens, the country will almost certainly face an economic crisis, including a runaway budget deficit, unabated inflation, and recession. (Economists are already now arguing whether the Russian economy has entered a period of technical recession, implying a decline in GDP for two consecutive quarters.)



This scenario may seem far-fetched, but the effects of degrading expertise have already been shown in other domains, even as the problems that Russia must deal with are far more complex than before: shortages of doctors, teachers, and public-transport drivers; collapsing city and regional budgets; slowdowns in factory production; and demographic decline. For now, members of the new military elite are being assigned insignificant positions such as deputy mayor for youth affairs and patriotic education. But the picture could look different if they begin to fill more important administrative posts.

Thus far, the most notable example of a trenchocrat attaining a high federal position is Artem Zhoga, who built his career in the ranks of anti-Ukrainian military units in the Donbas region. In 2022, his son was killed fighting in the Sparta Battalion, an anti-Ukrainian militia in the Donetsk Republic, and shortly afterward, Putin met with Zhoga to award his son a posthumous Hero of the Russian Federation medal. Then, in December 2023, Zhoga played a major part in an orchestrated public event with Putin in which Zhoga asked the president to run for reelection as head of state. Putin accepted Zhoga's staged proposal, and following the meeting, Zhoga—who had no experience in government or administration—became the president's plenipotentiary representative in the Ural district. Under Zhoga's leadership, the region's somewhat liberal governor, Yevgeny Kuyvashev, was forced to resign. Putin then appointed Zhoga to serve as a nonpermanent member of Russia's National Security Council. Although the position is largely ceremonial, this meteoric rise has set a precedent—showing that it is possible to make a career in Putin's system by performing one's fealty.

But those hoping to follow in Zhoga's footsteps will need to remember that it is a game without rules. In any case, the existing elites can no longer rest easy. Having reconciled themselves to the regime's radicalism, they may have now sealed their own doom. Many members of Putin's aristocracy continue to hold out hope that after the end of hostilities, everything will become, if not different, then at least milder. They are counting on the repeal of the laws on “foreign agents” and “undesirable organizations” and an end to the encroaching nationalization of the private sector, among other things. But the larger lesson of the recent purges is quite different: Putin lacks a reverse gear.

Paul Henderson initially knew Ken Dryden only as the opposing goaltender for the Montreal Canadiens.

“When I played against him, I hated that sucker,” former Toronto Maple Leaf Mr. Henderson said Sunday, two days after Mr. Dryden's death at the age of 78. 

They became friends in 1972 when both were members of Team Canada during the historic Summit Series against Russia.

It was the first competition ever between National Hockey League players and the Soviet national team, which had long dominated the world championships.

Mr. Henderson recalled Sunday the conversation he had with Mr. Dryden, the winning goalie, during the eighth and final game. 

“We were losing 5-3 after the second period,” he recalled on Sunday. “I went to Ken and told him that he couldn't give up another goal – that if he did we would never win.

“The third period was the best he played in the entire series.”

Mr. Dryden had a long and fruitful posthockey career as a lawyer, sports executive, member of Parliament, cabinet minister and author. After his death Friday of cancer, an illness few outside his inner circle knew he had, many in the hockey world said they remember him for his greatness on the ice as well as off it.

In the final game of the Summit Series, it was Mr. Henderson who broke a 5-5 tie when he scored, with just 34 seconds remaining, the goal heard and seen around the world that made Canada the champions. 

In Moscow, Mr. Dryden raced out of the net to the opposite end of the ice to celebrate. Then he realized he had to collect himself and returned to his net and closed out the victory.

The last time Mr. Dryden and Mr. Henderson saw each other was in February in Montreal at the Four Nations Face-Off. They bumped into one another in a hotel lobby and grabbed some chairs and chatted for more than a half-hour, Mr. Henderson recalled. 

“That's when he told me that when I scored that goal, it was the first time he ever skated to the other end during a game,” Mr. Henderson remembered. “We talked about a lot of things. Hockey and life.”

On Saturday, tributes to Mr. Dryden poured in from hockey and other quarters.

Prime Minister Mark Carney posted this on social media: “Few Canadians have given more, or stood taller, for our country. Ken Dryden was Big Canada. And he was Best Canada.”

Ken Dryden: It does matter, in the end, if you win or lose. The only question left: does it still matter how you play the game?

In a statement, Geoff Molson, president of the Canadiens, said, “We mourn today not only the loss of the cornerstone of one of hockey's greatest dynasties, but also a family man, a thoughtful citizen, and a gentleman who deeply impacted our lives and communities across generations.

“Ken embodied the best of everything the Montreal Canadiens are about, and his legacy within our society transcends our sport.”

Mr. Dryden played eight seasons for Montreal during the 1970s, during which the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup on six occasions. He was revered as the game's greatest goaltender.

Unlike most NHL netminders of the day, who were acrobatic and smallish, Mr. Dryden was a towering presence at 6 foot 4. When he would skate out of the goal crease a bit to challenge a shooter, Mr. Henderson said, there was little chance the puck could get past him.

“It was pretty much, ‘Good luck with that,'” Mr. Henderson said.

Fans of the Montreal Canadiens reflected on the career of Hall of Fame goaltender Ken Dryden after he died Friday at the age of 78 following a battle with cancer.

The Canadian Press

Mr. Dryden was selected the NHL's top goalie five times. He won his first Stanley Cup as a rookie in 1971 and was named the most valuable player during the playoffs that same year. In the more than half-century since, only 11 goalies have been awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP.

Mr. Dryden retired at 31 after winning the Stanley Cup for the sixth time in 1979. And then he did much more to distinguish himself.

Allan Walsh grew up in Montreal during the 1970s, when the Canadiens enjoyed some of their greatest success. He says he was more than a fan.

“For me, it was an obsession,” Mr. Walsh said Sunday from Los Angeles, where he runs an agency that represents professional hockey players.

As for Mr. Dryden, “he was my childhood hero,” he said.

Mr. Walsh met the goalie as a seven-year-old. He'd had an appendectomy, but his appendix burst during surgery. When he woke up, his dad was leaning over the bed.

“He asked what the one thing was that I wanted in all of the world,” Mr. Walsh recalled. “I told him the only thing I wanted was to meet Ken Dryden.”

Somehow or other, his father made it work. He reached out to the Canadiens, told them about his son and they in turn got in touch with Mr. Dryden.

“He invited me to a Canadiens practice,” Mr. Walsh said. “Then he brought me into the dressing room and he introduced me one by one to all of the players.”

After that, he took the young Mr. Walsh into Scotty Bowman's office so the seven-year-old could chat up Montreal's head coach.

“That day was one of the greatest memories of my life,” Mr. Walsh remembered. 

“As a goalie there was nobody like him. As a fan you felt a certain confidence. There was almost a majesty about him.”

Mr. Walsh had not seen Mr. Dryden in a while, but they connected via e-mail in July. He also sent Mr. Dryden a birthday wish last month.

“There are a lot of friends that I haven't heard from that reached out to me as soon as they learned Ken died,” Mr. Walsh said. “They told me I was the first person they thought of.”

Kevin Lowe, a six-time Stanley Cup winner and Hall of Fame defenceman, recalls seeing Mr. Dryden in the second NHL game he ever attended.

Mr. Lowe, who is from Quebec, is a former general manager for the Edmonton Oilers and knew Mr. Dryden through hockey circles.

“One thing that stands out for me is that he was booed in Game 1 in Montreal of the 1979 Stanley Cup final,” Mr. Lowe said. “I was shocked.”

“He stood on his head in Game 2 and they won four straight.”

Lanny McDonald, who retired as chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame on July 1 after 10 years, played against Mr. Dryden and knew him for most of his life.

“He stood tall on the ice and off it,” Mr. McDonald said on Sunday by telephone from Alberta. “He was much more than a hockey player. I am so sad for his family.

“I respected him so much as a player but more so as a man.”

Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Paul Henderson as a Hockey Hall of Fame inductee. That reference has been removed. Previous versions of this article incorrectly stated that Mr. Dryden played for the Montreal Canadiens for nine seasons. He was with the team for eight.

Ukraine expects a strong response from its international partners, particularly the United States, in the wake of Russia's latest record-breaking mass strike, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 7. 

The previous night, Russia assailed Ukraine with over 800 drones and a barrage of missiles, killing four people and injuring over 40. Half of the victims were in Kyiv, the primary target of the attack. 

The strike damaged the Cabinet of Ministers building in central Kyiv, marking the first time the government building has been hit in the course of Russia's full-scale war. 

"We are counting on a strong reaction from America. This is what is needed," Zelensky said the following evening. 

The president thanked world leaders who have condemned the attack and said he had spoken with French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte regarding Europe's role in ramping up pressure on Moscow. 

Zelensky called on leaders to back up their statements with "strong actions — sanctions against Russia, against individuals associated with Russia, and strong tariffs and other restrictions on trade with Russia." 

Zelensky also said increasing Ukraine's long-range strike capability would mount pressure on Russia. 

"Their losses must be felt," he said. 

In response to Russia's attack, U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg called the strike an "escalation" and said it showed Moscow was not interested in a diplomatic end to the war — though he stopped short of condemning Russia. 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said on the same day that Washington was prepared to increase pressure on Russia by expanding secondary tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil. He stressed, however, that Europe would need to play a part in the pressure campaign. 

U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ready to enter a new phase of sanctions against Russia, but declined to give any further details. 

Zelensky's address comes two days before the upcoming Ramstein-format summit in London, where Kyiv's allies will gather to coordinate military support for Ukraine. Zelensky said Ukraine's focus at the summit will be defense technology and long-range operations. 

In his remarks, Zelensky said that nearly half of the 800 drones launched at Ukraine during Russia's attack were decoys, cheap Shahed imitators designed to overwhelm Kyiv's air defenses. The volume of drones highlights Ukraine's urgent need to scale up air defense capabilities, including interceptor drones.

The EU has dispatched a delegation to Washington to discuss potential new restrictions with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who, despite repeated threats, has yet to impose additional sanctions on Russia.

Alexey Sinitsyn, CEO of potash producer K-Potash Service, was found dead near Kaliningrad.

"If the Europeans drew a line and said: 'We're not going to buy more Russian gas, we're not going to buy Russian oil.' Would that have a positive influence on the U.S. leaning in more aggressively (on sanctions) as well? Absolutely," U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.



U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Sept. 7 that he is prepared to advance to a new phase of sanctions against Russia, prompting experts to speculate on what the next step might involve.

China's exports to Russia fell 16.4% year-on-year in August, the sharpest drop in five months, adding to July's 8.6% decline.

Khabarovsk in Russia's Far East is more than 6,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Russian propagandist Margarita Simonyan said on Sept. 7 that she has been recently diagnosed with a "serious illness" and is about to undergo surgery.





A 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee was fatally stabbed in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 22, The Charlotte Observer reported.

"Potatoes, eggs, milk, and butter are becoming more expensive... But some unscrupulous producers, suppliers, or sellers are allowing themselves to profit in this way," Russian Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov said.

Russian authorities are known to extract confessions under duress, and the highly formalized language of the arrested man's testimony suggested it may have been pre-written.

"The drone is unarmed, and there are Cyrillic inscriptions on it," said Agnieszka Kepka, spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Poland's eastern city of Lublin.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched 810 Shahed-type drones and 13 cruise and ballistic missiles during the attack.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released on Monday a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein purportedly signed by President Donald Trump, which he has denied.

Trump has said he did not write the letter or create the drawing of a curvaceous woman that surrounds the letter. He filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for a report on the alleged letter. 

The letter was included as part of a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein's birthday. The president has denied having anything to do with it. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee received a copy of the birthday album on Monday as part of a batch of documents from Epstein's estate. 

The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

After the letter was released, White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich posted pictures on X of Trump's signature and tagged The Wall Street Journal's parent corporation, News Corp., writing: “Time for @newscorp to open that checkbook, it's not his signature. DEFAMATION!”

Trump has denied writing the letter and creating the drawing, calling a report on it “false, malicious, and defamatory.”

“These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,” Trump said.

The letter released by the committee looks exactly as described by the The Wall Street Journal in its report.




The letter bearing Trump's name and signature includes text framed by a hand-drawn outline of what appears to be a curvaceous woman.

“A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” the letter says. 

The letter's disclosure comes amid a bipartisan push in Congress for the release of the so-called Epstein files amid years of speculation and conspiracy theories. Calls for the release of the records came from Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance before he was sworn into the country's No. 2 position. 

Epstein, a wealthy and well-connected financier, killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges that said he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of underage girls. The case was brought more than a decade after he secretly cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida to dispose of nearly identical allegations. Epstein was accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them.

Trump's ties to Epstein have been well-documented, though he said they had a falling-out two decades ago. He has said he kicked the financier out of his private club in Florida after Epstein betrayed him more than once by hiring people who had worked for him.

The president has not been accused of misconduct in connection with their social relationship.

The Justice Department in August began turning over records from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation to the House Oversight Committee.

The committee subpoenaed the Epstein estate for documents last month. In addition to the birthday book, lawmakers requested Epstein's last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his contact books, and his financial transactions and holdings.

            President Donald Trump on Monday decried the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee in Charlotte, calling the alleged killer a “madman, a lunatic.”
    


            “It's right on the tape, not really watchable because it's so horrible,” Trump said of the unprovoked stabbing on the city's light rail train, which was caught on a surveillance video. “She's just sitting there.”
    


            The president added that he'd given his “love and hope to the family of the young woman.”
    


            Trump said his administration would not tolerate violent crime, vowing “to get to the end of it.”
    


            “When you have horrible killings you have to take horrible actions,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump touched on his administration's efforts to exert influence over Smithsonian Institute museums during remarks at the White House Religious Liberty Commission, saying he got “a little involved” due to what he believes is an overemphasis on negative aspects of American history.
    


            “I got a little involved with museums, you know, because that little problem with the Smithsonian, we like, like, a little more positivity. It was all about all the bad things in our country. I said, ‘What about the good things we've done?' So, I got a little involved,” Trump said during remarks at the Museum of the Bible.
    


            Trump gave credit to the Smithsonian, however, adding, “Honestly, they're making changes. You know, they were also told what to do by people that came before me, in all fairness, but they're making changes. Big changes are being made at the Smithsonian.”
    


            The Smithsonian Institute is approaching a deadline on Friday to submit the first round of requested materials to the White House as it undergoes an internal review, including 250th anniversary programming, current exhibition content, traveling and upcoming exhibitions and internal guidelines and governance.
    


Last month, Trump said that the Smithsonian is “out of control” and puts too much focus too much on “how bad slavery was.”
    


            At the Museum of the Bible Monday, Trump also said that he delivered his personal family bible, which he said was given to him by his mother, to go on display.
    


            According to financial documents released in June, Trump made more than $1.3 million Trump from Lee Greenwood's “God Bless the USA” Bible.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration will soon issue guidance aimed at protecting the right to pray in public schools.
    


            Trump made the announcement during a speech on religious liberty at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC.
    


            The Education Department is expected to issue the guidance, which Trump said was spurred by an episode in Texas where a student was prevented from organizing a group prayer on school grounds for an injured classmate.
    


            “The principal didn't like it, can you imagine?” Trump said, adding that the student “held her ground and she won.”
    


            President Donald Trump again lashed out at Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker this morning, questioning why the Democrat doesn't want federal intervention to crack down on crime in Chicago.
    


            “6 people were murdered in Chicago this weekend, 12 others were shot, and in serious condition. This would mean that over the past number of weeks, approximately 50 people were killed, and hundreds were shot, many expected to die. Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn't want Federal Government HELP! WHY??? “ Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            Trump also said that “only the criminals will be hurt” by any federal efforts in the city, and that crime there is “ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!!!”
    


            Over the weekend, Pritzker called Trump “a wannabe dictator” and interpreted his “Chipocolypse Now” meme as a threat “to go to war with an American city.” Pritzker said in a recent appearance on MSNBC that if Trump really wanted to help Chicago fight crime, “why not help us with providing ATF, the people that can interdict firearms?”
    


            “FBI, DEA, we're fighting gangs, we're fighting drugs. That happens in every major city. If you want to help us fight crime, send us civilian law enforcement,” Pritzker said.
    


As CNN reported, seven people were killed in Chicago from Friday evening through Sunday, preliminary police figures show. Fatal shootings are down 34.2% this year through September 6 in the city compared with the same period in 2024, with 237 killed in 2025, data from the mayor's office shows.
    


            Trump administration officials have, for weeks, privately discussed targeting Chicago and Boston — two Democratic-led cities that drew the ire of the administration over their so-called sanctuary policies.
    


            The escalating rhetoric from the president and his officials is in line with how the administration is planning its aggressive immigration agenda moving forward, equipped with more funds and efforts to bring on more federal personnel.
    


            Immigration arrests have already been ongoing in each city this year. But the expectation is to expand those operations in the days to come, akin to what unfolded in Los Angeles over the summer.
    


            Federal officials had planned for a phased approach to Chicago lasting weeks and are continuing to surge federal personnel to the city. But discussions picked up over the weekend to move forward with an operation sooner.
    


            Operations in Chicago are expected to mirror Los Angeles. The man charged with operations there, Gregory Bovino, was deployed to Chicago to do the same there, officials told CNN.
    


            One official described it to CNN as “Los Angeles on the road.”
    


Some context: In the early days of the administration, Chicago was among the first cities targeted for immigration enforcement, with White House border czar Tom Homan on hand for the operation.
    


Pressed yesterday on if the administration will send the National Guard in to Chicago this week, Homan told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that the option is “always on the table.”
    


            President Donald Trump is continuing to tease more federal action on crime in American cities, praising his initiative in Washington, DC, and signaling on social media that he's still mulling the decision of where to go next.
    


                    “Washington, D.C. IS A SAFE ZONE IN JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS. Thank you, President Trump. Who's Next???” Trump posted on Truth Social this morning.
                





            The administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, DC, and federalized the city's police force, though that aspect is expected to expire this week. Yesterday, Trump told reporters that he would make a decision “as to where we go over the next day or two,” when asked about his plans for Chicago.
    


            Over the weekend, Trump posted what appears to be an AI image of himself as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a character in “Apocalypse Now,” writing that he loves the “smell of deportations in the morning.”
    


            He added Chicago is “about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.” CNN has reported the administration is preparing a major immigration enforcement operation in the city.
    


            President Donald Trump remains broadly underwater on his approval rating as two new polls find widespread opposition to his use of the National Guard against crime in American cities.
    


            Trump's approval rating stands at 44% in the CBS News/YouGov poll and 43% in the NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll. The CNN Poll of Polls averaging surveys conducted from mid-August through early September finds Trump's approval rating at 43% approve to 55% disapprove, similar to where it's held all summer.
    


            In the CBS poll, nearly six in 10 Americans say they oppose Trump deploying the National Guard to Washington, DC (57% oppose) or other cities (58%). Slightly more (61%) say they would oppose Trump deploying National Guard troops to their own local city or area. Americans are generally split over whether the use of the Guard to fight crime actually reduces crime (49% say it does, 51% that it does not), and only 36% say that the deployment of the National Guard to cities makes them feel personally safer. More see Trump's deployment of the National Guard as a purely political move (45%) than as one designed to reduce crime (33%), with another 22% saying Trump is motivated both by political reasons and a goal of reducing crime.
    


            The poll finds broad partisan divides across all these questions, with independents generally opposed and far more likely to see political motivation in Trump's moves (51%) than a push to reduce crime (28%).
    


            The NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll was conducted online August 13 through September 1 among 30,196 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. The CBS News/YouGov poll was conducted online September 3 through 5 among 2,385 adults and has an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 points.
    


            President Donald Trump plans to announce a new initiative encouraging Americans to pray for the United States during his remarks today at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC.
    


            A White House official said the program, called “America Prays,” would be tied to the upcoming 250th anniversary of the country's founding. It encourages weekly prayer in groups.
    


            “As we approach the 250th anniversary of the greatest country in the world, President Trump invites Americans to pray for our nation and for our people. America is stronger with the power of prayer,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.
    


            Trump's remarks today will come amid a meeting of the Religious Liberty Commission he established by executive order in May. The commission has a particular focus on religious liberty in education, which the White House claims was curtailed during the previous administration.
    


            The Museum of the Bible is a non-profit organization in Washington that opened in 2017. It is unassociated with the city's major Smithsonian museum system, and unlike Smithsonian institutions or the National Gallery of Art, it charges an admission fee.
    


            Trump's visit today will be his first stop at a museum since he ordered a review of Smithsonian organizations for programming and exhibitions the administration found objectionable.
    


            Europe's top sanctions envoy is in Washington, DC, today for discussions with US administration officials on tightening pressure on Russia, according to people familiar with the meetings.
    


            European Union sanctions envoy David O'Sullivan, who has spearheaded the bloc's sanctions regime against Russia, is expected to meet with officials at the US Treasury Department to discuss and coordinate potential measures on Moscow as it escalates the war in Ukraine.
    


            The meetings come as President Donald Trump has said he's ready to slap new measures on Moscow.
    


            The meetings will include officials from the White House, State Department and the Office of the US Trade Representative, the people said, describing the talks as a sign of forward momentum on new coordinated sanctions against Russia.
    


            Trump said yesterday that European leaders were expected in Washington early this week to discuss the Ukraine war. It wasn't clear if he was referring to O'Sullivan or other leaders. The White House did not clarify who the president was speaking about.
    


            He also said he was prepared to apply new sanctions on Russia after it launched the largest drone attack to date in its three-and-a-half-year war. He said he expected to speak soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But he stopped short of describing what options he was considering, and many of his previous threats of sanctions have melted away.
    


            President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would speak to Russia's Vladimir Putin “very soon.”
    


            “Over the next couple of days. Look, we're going to get it done. The Russia-Ukraine situation. We're going to get it done,” he said.
    


            Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war this weekend, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time.
    


                    “The danger in any war is escalation. Russia appears to be escalating with the largest attack of the war hitting offices of the UKR Cabinet in Kyiv,” Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg said on X. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these … The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.”
                





Last month, administration officials told CNN that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace.
    


            Yesterday, Trump said: “I believe we're going to get it settled. But I am not happy with them. I'm not happy with anything having to do with that war.”
    


            Trump added European leaders would visit the US this week to work on a solution.
    


            “Certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday and individually, and I think we're going to get that settled.”
    


            Trump previously threatened “severe consequences” for Putin if he does not end the war, including the possibility of “massive sanctions or massive tariffs,” also signaling yesterday that he was ready to move on sanctions.
    


            The Trump administration is moving ahead with its crime and immigration crackdowns, now focusing its attention on Chicago and Massachusetts.

            House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday attempted to clean up earlier remarks he made claiming that President Donald Trump had been an “FBI informant” in the Jeffrey Epstein case.
    


            “What I was referring to in that long conversation was what the (Epstein) victims' attorney said,” Johnson told reporters. “More than a decade ago, President Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago, and he was one of the only people, one of the only prominent people, as everyone has reported … that he was willing to help law enforcement go after this guy who was a disgusting child abuser, sex trafficker, all the allegations. That's what they heard. So the president was helpful in that.”
    


            The speaker added: “I don't know if I used the right terminology, but that's common knowledge, and everybody knows that. So this is much ado about nothing.”
    


Here's what's next in the Epstein files saga



            Some had seized on Johnson's comments on social media, seeking to paint Trump as a hero in relation to the case that has seen heightened national political furor in recent weeks.
    


            Pressed by CNN Monday on whether Trump had specifically told him about any involvement with law enforcement's investigation of the late convicted sex offender, Johnson said he was “recounting what others have said” but that he and the president have spoken about “the Epstein evils many times.”
    


            Johnson, when asked, said he had no information about whether Trump had ever been asked to wear a wire.
    


            “I was repeating what has been common knowledge for a long time. The president was helpful in trying to get Epstein for the law enforcement to go after Epstein. That's always been my understanding. That's common knowledge. It's the public's understanding. I didn't — I was not breaking news there, OK? What I'm trying to emphasize is that the president is as disgusted about this as everyone is.”
    


            Speaking with reporters at the Capitol last week, Johnson defended the president's handling of the Epstein files and said he helped law enforcement in the case.
    


            “He's not saying that what Epstein did is a hoax. It's a terrible, unspeakable evil. He believes that himself. When he first heard the rumor, he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago. He was an FBI informant to try to take this stuff down. The president knows and has great sympathy for the women who have suffered these unspeakable harms.”
    


            Asked at the time to clarify the comment, a spokesman for the speaker's office said in a statement that Johnson was “reiterating what the victims' attorney said, which is that Donald Trump — who kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago — was the only one more than a decade ago willing to help prosecutors expose Epstein for being a disgusting child predator.”
    


            The White House declined to comment on the matter.
    


GOP leaders won't help Massie's bid for reelection as Trump plots his ouster



            Brad Edwards, a lawyer for numerous Epstein abuse victims, implored the president last week to back survivors' push for transparency around the case, saying Trump had helped him with his investigation of the case in 2009.
    


            At the time, Trump was not in public office and Epstein had just been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison for his crimes with minors as part of a plea deal that has since faced significant criticism for being too lenient.
    


            “Back in 2009 and several times after that, he didn't think that it was a hoax then. In fact, he helped me. He got on the phone, he told me things that were helping our investigation. Our investigation wasn't looking into him, but he was helping us then,” Edwards said.
    


            “So at this point in time, I would hope that he would revert back to what he was saying to get elected, which is, ‘I want transparency.' This about face that occurred, none of us understand it,” he continued
    


            Johnson on Monday indicated that House Oversight Chairman James Comer and committee members were planning to visit the Epstein estate in Florida to view visitor logs as part of their probe into the case.
    


            As CNN has reported, a bipartisan group of House Oversight staffers are expected to travel to New York City this week to meet with lawyers representing Epstein's estate to view unredacted documents related to the case.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles, the latest victory for President Donald Trump's administration at the high court.

The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location. The court's 6-3 decision followed a pattern of at least temporarily allowing some of the Republican administration's harshest policies, while leaving room for the possibility of a different outcome after the legal case plays out fully. The net effect, meanwhile, has Trump pushing ahead in many of the areas he considers most critical.

The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court's emergency docket. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can carry out brief stops for questioning. “The prospect of such after-the-fact judicial second-guessing and contempt proceedings will inevitably chill lawful immigration enforcement efforts,” he wrote in a concurrence.




In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision erodes constitutional freedoms. 

 “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” she wrote. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

Kavanaugh, for his part, suggested stops in which agents use force could yet face legal challenges. 

The Supreme Court's decision comes as ICE agents also step up enforcement in Washington as part of Trump's unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city's law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard. 

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the Trump administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area. 

U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong's ruling in place.

Federal attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that ICE agents can use at least some of those factors in combination with others, and Kavanaugh said apparent ethnicity could be a relevant factor for a stop.

The Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that authorities had made 5,210 immigration arrests since June 6 and praised the work of its lead commander there, Gregory Bovino, whose “success in getting the worst of the worst out of the Los Angeles region speaks for itself.”

The Los Angeles region has been a battleground for the Trump administration after its hard-line immigration strategy spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines. The number of immigration raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong's order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store. 

The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong's order only prevents federal agents from making stops that align with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent. 

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the decision would fuel aggressive immigration enforcement in other major cities and constrain lower-court judges.

“The Supreme Court majority makes clear that average non-white workers are targets, and it functionally gives its stamp of approval for Trump to trample their bedrock constitutional rights,” he said.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer countered that the order was too restrictive in an area the Trump administration considers a top priority as it carries out the president's goal of mass deportations. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the Supreme Court decision as a “massive victory” in a social media post. “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” she wrote. 

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It had covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents as he yelled, “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said he found Kavanaugh's rationale for lifting the stay “disturbing.” He pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can't be considered in college admissions. “They prevent the use of race (in college admissions) to tackle discrimination but allow the use of race to potentially discriminate,” Bonta said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a vocal Trump opponent, said the order would allow agents wide latitude to make stops “including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California's families and small businesses.”

Plaintiff Pedro Vasquez Perdomo said ICE agents never explained why they stopped him or showed a warrant. 

“I was treated like I didn't matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that's okay?” he said in a statement. “That's not justice. That's racism with a badge.”

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram looks at how Congress may be getting involved in the debate over pay for college athletes on 'Special Report.'

Some epic drama in the first two weeks of the college football season.

The defending national champion Ohio State Buckeyes shut down the then-No. 1-ranked Texas Longhorns at the goal line three times. Ohio State quickly curbed talk about the greatness of Texas quarterback Arch Manning. The Buckeyes are now the No. 1 team in the country. Especially after they shellacked Grambling State 70-0 in Week 2.

Florida State whipped Alabama. And we haven't even talked about Bill Belichick's coaching debut at North Carolina.

So settle in for quite a season between now and mid-January.

But there could be new rules off the playing field. Congress may attempt to referee what collegiate athletes can earn from their own name, likeness and image, better known as NILs.

LEGENDARY SPORTS AGENT BREAKS DOWN TRUMP'S 'SAVING COLLEGE SPORTS' EXECUTIVE ORDER

"Without clear rules and an enforcement mechanism, the NIL landscape has become akin to the Wild West," said Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C.

There are competing bills in the House and Senate to address compensation for student-athletes. The House bill, prepped over the summer by the Energy and Commerce Committee, sets a national standard for NILs and allows schools to directly pay athletes. That would supersede a bevy of differing rules which change from state to state.

"We've already seen states competing with one another to get a leg up. And that patchwork is threatening the values and the balance that makes college sports so special," said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REGULATE THE BUSINESS OF COLLEGE SPORTS

She has reservations about the current House bill.

The House legislation comes on the heels of a multibillion-dollar agreement approved by a federal judge earlier this summer. That agreement lets schools pay student-athletes up to $20.5 million per year.

That's just a sliver of what most major schools in big conferences reel in annually. But the schools will likely fork out most of the money to football and basketball. Those sports generate the most revenue in college athletics.

But the score is far from settled.

"Whether or not we should allow student-athletes to be considered employees under the law, the ramifications of that would be pretty profound," said Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind.

SWEEPING BIPARTISAN BILL WOULD NATIONALIZE STANDARDS FOR STUDENT-ATHLETE PAY

Sen. Todd Young speaks at the Russell Senate Office Building on Nov. 1, 2023 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.  (Alex Wong)

He noted that a Senate bill to regulate pay in college sports is on "the proverbial one-yard line."

Most House Democrats oppose the plan. They believe it inhibits the rights of college athletes – as workers.

"This bill bans student-athletes from First Amendment rights to form unions, also guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act," said Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla. "They have basic rights. Like the right to organize."

Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., is the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee. She said the House Energy and Commerce Committee bill rolls back money for minor sports, women's programs and only benefits major conferences like the Big 10 and SEC. She claims the bill will trigger "a conflict" between sports that earn money at schools and those that don't.

Most Democrats argue that lawmakers should focus instead on problems in higher education, not the athletic field. Especially as some schools now face a threat from the federal government and the Trump administration.

"You have to have a college to have college sports," said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee. "And the way we're going with this administration, I don't even know if there's going to be any colleges or universities worth fighting for."

Pallone added that the committee's focus was misguided amid questions about education and healthcare.

"Yet Republicans are ignoring them. And instead would rather talk about college sports," said Pallone. 

Republicans on the Energy and Commerce panel supported the package, but Democratic support was limited. In addition, players associations for Major League Baseball, the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Soccer all oppose the legislation. They believe the bill inhibits college athletes from negotiating a fair wage.

The "pay" and "NIL" issues have vexed top collegiate athletic officials for years. The NCAA and many schools have long pushed for congressional intervention.

"We feel like there's a better destination and a stabilization coming forward. But we need the help of Congress and national legislation," said ACC commissioner Jim Phillips on Fox News earlier this year.

Former Alabama football coach Nick Saban echoed Phillips during an interview with colleague Bret Baier.

"Now we just have state legislation, and every state is different," said Saban. "We need some kind of federal standard and guidelines that allow people to enforce their own rules."

Pallone may have questioned the priorities of his committee focusing on paying student-athletes, but other lawmakers question why the NCAA itself couldn't settle the pay-for-play fight.

"I think if they had had stronger management, if they made some decisions early on, we wouldn't be in this position," said Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C. "It's unfortunate that Congress has to step in at all."

However, the North Carolina Republican added he was "deeply concerned about the future of college sports if we don't act."

That's why Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., wants Congress involved – even if she opposes the current House plan.

"We simply cannot turn to the same entities that created the broken and inequitable system of the past to serve as the stewards of a new system," said Clarke.

Attorneys general from Florida, Ohio, New York, Tennessee and the District of Columbia are worried about antitrust provisions in the House plan. The Big West Conference believes the legislation is skewed toward major conferences.

So this fight may spill into overtime on Capitol Hill.

Congress could vote sometime on legislation refining NILs. Or lawmakers may again punt – as they've done for several years now.

But this is a lower priority for Congress. Lawmakers must avoid a government shutdown by Oct. 1, and they may need to wrestle with another government funding round later this fall.

The college football season just started, but the real challenge is whether Congress will address this issue before the National Championship Game on Jan. 19, 2026.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump celebrated news on Monday that an alumni group from West Point canceled an award ceremony set to honor Tom Hanks, with the president calling the famous actor “destructive” and “WOKE.”

Hanks was scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award on Sept. 25, but the U.S. Military Academy's alumni association canceled the ceremony last week, according to news reports. 

“Important move!” Trump said in a post on his social media network Monday. “We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice.” 

West Point, its alumni association and a representative for Hanks did not immediately respond to messages and calls seeking comment Monday.

It comes as Trump has moved to direct the ideology and leadership of higher education institutes and the military in his second term, seeking to assert control with a mix of executive orders and threats of legal action and withholding funds.

This summer, the Army secretary directed West Point to review its hiring practices, bar outside groups from choosing employees and remove a newly announced hire who led the nation's cybersecurity agency under then-President Joe Biden.

Earlier this year, West Point disbanded a dozen cadet clubs centered on ethnicity, gender, race and sexuality in response to the Trump administration's push to eliminate diversity programs throughout government. The school also rehung a painting of Gen. Robert E. Lee dressed in his Confederate uniform in the library as the Trump administration has pushed to restore Confederate names and monuments that have been removed in recent years.




The Sylvanus Thayer Award award is named for an early superintendent of the military academy who is known as the “Father of West Point.” It has been given out every year since 1958 “to an outstanding citizen of the United States whose service and accomplishments in the national interest exemplify personal devotion to the ideals expressed in West Point's motto: ‘Duty, Honor, Country,'” according to the West Point Association of Graduates. 

“Tom Hanks has done more for the positive portrayal of the American service member, more for the caring of the American veteran, their caregivers and their family, and more for the American space program and all branches of government than many other Americans,” association board chairman Robert McDonald said in a June press release about the award.

Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger, president and chief executive officer of the association, wrote in an email Friday that the decision to call off the award ceremony “allows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world's most lethal force, the United States Army,” according to The Washington Post, which was first to report on the cancellation. 

Last year's recipient was former President Barack Obama.

Hanks starred in the 1998 war drama “Saving Private Ryan” and co-produced with Steven Spielberg the World War II HBO miniseries “Band of Brothers.”

Hanks is among Hollywood's most politically active celebrities, donating to support a slew of Democratic politicians and progressive causes. He vocally endorsed Obama, Hillary Clinton and Biden in their presidential bids and signed an open letter endorsing Kamala Harris last year.

He's also gone to work for the Democrats. In 2012, he narrated a short documentary, “The Road We've Traveled,” for Obama's reelection campaign. 

To fete Biden's inauguration in 2021, Hanks hosted a 90-minute prime-time television special, “Celebrating America.”

A year later, he narrated a two-minute ad spot from the Biden Inaugural Committee touting the accomplishments of the president's first term. He also served as a celebrity co-chair for When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization founded by former first lady Michelle Obama to boost voter outreach.

And for the better part of the past decade, Hanks has made no secret of his disapproval of Trump and the president's policies. He called the then-Republican candidate a “self-involved gasbag” during an on-stage interview in 2016. After Trump took office, Hanks said during an American Civil Liberties Union fundraiser that actions like the attempted travel ban for Muslim-majority countries represented a “brand of tragedy.” 

During Biden's inauguration, he spoke of “deep divisions and a troubling rancor in our land” and warned against attempts to twist the truth by those entrusted with public service during a 2023 Harvard commencement speech. Just this past year, he stoked the ire of Trump supporters after depicting a caricature of one during the 50th anniversary special of “Saturday Night Live.”

The Department of Homeland Security launched Operation Midway Blitz on Monday to start detaining illegal immigrants in Chicago and Illinois after Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) repeatedly refused to cooperate with the Trump administration's crime crackdown.

DHS announced the operation on social media, revealing it was “in honor” of Katie Abraham, 20, who died in a hit-and-run car crash caused by a Guatemalan national illegally residing in the United States.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the department said.

The Washington Examiner contacted DHS for additional information.

“For years, Governor Pritzker and his fellow sanctuary politicians released Tren de Aragua gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago's streets—putting American lives at risk and making Chicago a magnet for criminals,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem have a clear message: no city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

The announcement featured an interview with Abraham's parents, both of whom denounced illegal immigration based on their personal experience. Abraham died in January when Julio Cucul-Bol hit her with his vehicle and fled.

The father said his daughter's killer shouldn't have been admitted into the U.S. in the first place.

“To me, these are not the productive folks we want to bring into the country,” Joe Abraham said. “You want to build the country on migrants? Probably not the guy you want to stand behind.”

They pushed back against claims that the Trump administration is not giving illegal immigrants due process, saying their daughter did not get that right.

“Why do these people who break these laws, who are not U.S. citizens deserve due process?” asked Michelle Abraham, the mother. “Because again, Katie got nothing. She got death.”

Days after the deadly crash in Illinois, Cucul-Bol was arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service about an hour south of Dallas, Texas. He used a false name, a crime for which he was charged by the Department of Justice for in May.

Ever since President Donald Trump teased that Chicago would be one of the cities after Washington, D.C., to see federal pressure on violent crime and illegal immigration, Pritzker vowed to oppose the effort. Trump fired back, most recently posting an AI-generated, Apocalypse Now-inspired meme depicting a squadron of helicopters en route to Chicago.

TRUMP INTENSIFIES WAR WITH PRITZKER AS CHICAGO AWAITS IMMINENT DECISION ON FEDERAL TAKEOVER

Operation Midway Blitz appears to be solely related to immigration enforcement rather than a full-blown policing mission, as Trump said Monday morning, he was “waiting for a call from Chicago” for armed troops and agents to enter the city.

The president previously indicated he would like Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to invite federal assistance to the Windy City, even though they have condemned Trump's threats.

Police said the attack on Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old who had fled to the U.S. from war-torn Ukraine, was random. (Obtained by NewsNation)

GoFundMe said that it removed multiple fundraising campaigns created on behalf of Decarlos Brown Jr., the ex-convict accused of stabbing and killing Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska aboard a Charlotte, North Carolina, light-rail train.

"GoFundMe's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit fundraisers for the legal defense of anyone formally charged with a violent crime. Consistent with this long-standing policy, all fundraisers for Decarlos Brown Jr.'s legal defense have been removed from the platform, and any donors have been fully refunded," a company spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

According to information reviewed by Fox News Digital, the campaigns were taken down within hours of being flagged. GoFundMe declined to specify how many pages were removed but emphasized that it actively scans for and blocks attempts to launch campaigns on behalf of individuals facing violent charges.

The company's action followed social media backlash over the fundraisers, with critics turning to social media to lambaste the fundraiser for the murder suspect as "an insult" to the 23-year-old victim.

Zarutska, 23, fled Ukraine with her family in 2022 to escape Russia's war before settling in Charlotte, according to her obituary. She was working at a local pizzeria, Zepeddie's Pizza, at the time of her death. Fox News Digital has reached out to Zepeddie's for comment.

"Recently, our Zepeddie's family suffered a tremendous loss. We lost not only an incredible employee but a true friend. Our dear Iryna left this world far too soon, and our hearts are heavy with grief. Since her passing, we have kept a candle burning in her memory—a small reminder of the warmth, kindness and light she brought into our lives every single day. We are so grateful for the love, support and prayers we've received during this difficult time," Zepeddie's Pizza said in a statement. "Iryna, we miss you more than words can say. You will forever be in our hearts."

On Aug. 22, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, authorities found Zarutska stabbed to death on the Lynx Blue Line after she sat in front of Brown, who allegedly pulled out a folding knife and attacked her without provocation.

Surveillance video reviewed by Fox News Digital shows Zarutska boarding the train just after 9:45 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 22. Wearing her pizzeria uniform, she is seen scrolling on her phone as a man in a red hoodie sits behind her.

AMERICAN TOURIST STABBED IN FACE BY SYRIAN AFTER DEFENDING WOMEN ON GERMAN TRAM: REPORT

Around four minutes later, the man pulls out a knife and begins stabbing Zarutska three times, including in the neck. According to the affidavit, Zarutska was stabbed in the middle of her throat. 

He is charged with first-degree murder under North Carolina law and is being held without bond. 

Records obtained by Fox News Digital reveal that Brown has a lengthy criminal history spanning more than a decade. His convictions include larceny and breaking and entering in 2013, as well as a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, for which he served more than six years in prison. He was released in 2020 and remained on parole until 2021. More recent charges included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year.

While campaigns to raise money for Brown's defense have been shut down, a separate, verified fundraiser supporting Zarutska's family remains active on GoFundMe. 

The stabbing death on public transportation has renewed calls for increased public safety across cities in America.

President Donald Trump mentioned the stabbing during remarks at the Museum of the Bible.

"We're all people of religion, but there are evil people," Trump said. "And we have to confront that. I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed this morning or last night in Charlotte by a madman."

Fox News Todd Piro reports the latest on the murder and the suspects lengthy rap sheet. 

North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein broke his silence over the murder of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte train after facing heated criticism over the weekend for not speaking out earlier despite the release of a brutal video of the attack. 

"I am heartbroken for the family of Iryna Zarutska, who lost their loved one to this senseless act of violence, and I am appalled by the footage of her murder. We need more cops on the beat to keep people safe," Stein posted on X on Monday morning after a weekend of criticism for not posting about last month's murder and a request for comment from Fox News Digital earlier Monday morning. 

"That's why my budget calls for more funding to hire more well-trained police officers. I call upon the legislature to pass my law enforcement recruitment and retention package to address vacancies in our state and local agencies so they can stop these horrific crimes and hold violent criminals accountable," he continued.

Social media exploded over the weekend after surveillance footage, released by the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS), showed 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska boarding a Lynx Blue line last month before a man pulled out a knife and began stabbing Zarutska three times, including at least once in the neck.

Zarutska, who had fled war-town Ukraine, grabs her neck as blood spilled onto the floor. Authorities later pronounced her dead at the scene.

The attack, which took place on August 22, prompted many on social media to criticize Stein for speaking out about George Floyd, a Black man killed by a White police officer, but not being as vocal for this murder, where a White woman was murdered by an alleged Black assailant. 

".@NC_Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, has had nothing to say about the brutal murder of Iryna Zarutska, a resident of his state," journalist Megan Basham posted on X. "Yet, in 2020, when he was attorney general, he DID find time to lament the death of George Floyd and initiate a "Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice."

"This task force's recommendations included increasing ‘pre-trial release'--which is exactly the kind of thing that allowed Zarutska's killer, DeCarlos Brown, to be on the streets after 14 previous arrests."

"Not a word about Iryna Zarutska from Democrat North Carolina Governor Josh Stein," conservative influencer account LibsofTiktok posted on X.

"Iryna Zarutska's slaying is the #1 new story on X - not just North Carolina - and yet NC Governor Josh Stein has had NOTHING to say about it," Article III Project senior counsel Will Chamberlain posted on X. "This is why friends don't let friends vote Democrat."

"The lack of response by Democrat politicians in North Carolina is outrageous," John Lott, founder and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, posted on X. "This murderer had a long violent criminal record. Gov ⁦@JoshStein_⁩ says nothing."

Stein's comment on Monday didn't satisfy many social media users who accused the governor of shifting the blame for the attack.

"He was arrested 14 times," White House deputy press secretary Abigail Marone posted on X. "The police did their jobs. You did not. And shame on your for trying to shift the blame."

"Preposterous statement from the @NC_Governor," conservative commentator Michael Knowles posted on X. "The problem isn't that cops didn't arrest the guy. He was arrested over two dozen times! The problem is that liberal prosecutors, judges, and legislators like you refused to keep him locked up."

"You were Attorney General of North Carolina when her killer was arrested and released from jail 14 times," conservative commentator Greg Price posted on X. "The police did their job. You did not."

The suspect, identified as 34-year-old Decarlos Brown, was arrested shortly after the stabbing and hospitalized before being arrested on a charge of first-degree murder. Records obtained by The New York Post showed that Brown has a history of arrests going back more than a decade, including charges of felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon and communicating threats. Police said Brown and Zarutska did not know each other and the attack had been random.

Zarutska's death has renewed calls for action on public safety in Charlotte. Members of the Charlotte City Council expressed concern after Zarutska's murder about violence on the city's transit system.

President Donald Trump on Sunday defended a massive immigration raid by federal agents on an electric-vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia operated by South Korean automaker Hyundai. South Korea says it has reached a deal with the U.S. for the release of detained South Korean workers.

The South Korean government announced Sunday that 300 workers who were detained after a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's foreign minister departed for the U.S. on Monday to finalize steps for the return of several hundred South Korean workers detained in a massive immigration raid in Georgia, a spectacle that has caused confusion, shock and a sense of betrayal among many in the U.S.-allied nation.

The Sept. 4 raid on a battery factory under construction at a sprawling Hyundai auto plant resulted in the detainment of 475 workers, more than 300 them South Koreans. Some were shown being shackled with chains around their hands, ankles and waists in video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

South Korea announced Sunday that the U.S. has agreed to release them and that it would bring them home on a charter flight once final administrative steps are completed.

President Donald Trump said the workers “were here illegally,” and that instead, the U.S. needs to work out arrangements with countries like South Korea to bring their experts in to train U.S. citizens to do work such as battery and computer manufacturing.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters in London that Trump sent a “powerful” message to investors and their employees.

“His message today that he sent to the world was, ‘Listen, our laws will be enforced, and we're encouraging all companies who want to come to the United States and help our economy and employ people, that we encourage them to employ U.S. citizens and to bring people to our country that want to follow our laws and work here the right way,'” she said.

Speaking with reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the Hyundai plant raid sends a clear signal.




Appearing at a legislative hearing before his departure, Foreign Minister Cho Hyun called the raid “a very serious matter” that he hadn't anticipated at all, as many lawmakers lamented the American operation.

“If U.S. authorities detain hundreds of Koreans in this manner, almost like a military operation, how can South Korean companies investing in the U.S. continue to invest properly in the future?” said Cho Jeongsik, a lawmaker from the liberal governing Democratic Party.

Another lawmaker, Kim Gi-hyeon from the conservative opposition People Power Party, said the “unacceptable” raid dealt South Korea a “severe blow that will be difficult to heal.” 

Some lawmakers even called for the government to retaliate by investigating Americans who are alleged to work illegally in South Korea. 

Seoul has expressed regret over the raid, but experts say it won't likely take any major tit-for-tat measures given the country's security dependence on the U.S. in deterring potential North Korean aggressions and other spheres of cooperation between the two countries, including business ties.

The Trump administration has made a series of workplace raids to fulfill its mass deportation agenda, but this was the Homeland Security agency's largest yet at a single site, and targeted Georgia, a symbol of bilateral cooperation where many large South Korean businesses operate and plan future investments. 

Particularly stunning is that this raid came only weeks after South Korea promised to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. investments as part of a tariff deal, and days after Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung held their first summit meeting in Washington on Aug. 25.

“The way that Trump is pressuring the Korean government and inflicting damages on its people is very rough and unilateral,” said Kim Taewoo, former head of Seoul's Korea Institute for National Unification. “Can this be forgotten easily in South Korea? In a long-term perspective, it won't be good for U.S. national interests as well.”

In an editorial Monday, South Korea's biggest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, wrote that “Fundamental doubts emerge: What does the U.S. mean by ‘alliance,' and are investment benefits guaranteed across administrations?”

Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University said the U.S. goal of restoring manufacturing through foreign investments is colliding with its lack of visa and immigration systems that could support such an effort. 

South Korean companies operating in the U.S. will likely suffer “a great confusion” as they will now be forced to bring workers back home to resolve visa issues, he said. Such developments would undermine U.S. interests, but Trump won't likely make any concessions anytime soon, Paik predicted.

Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said Friday that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working. 

But South Korean officials and experts have expressed frustration over what they call strict U.S. limits on visas for highly skilled foreign workers to protect its domestic workforce, and inaction on Seoul's calls to expand work visas for skilled South Korean nationals. As a result, South Korean companies have been relying on short-term visitor visas or the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to send the workers they need to launch manufacturing facilities or handle other setup tasks.

“The incident will inevitably exacerbate shortages of skilled workers with legal work authorization and create pressure for increases in labor costs, potentially disrupting operations and rising costs across major business projects in the United States,” South Korea's Eugene Investment & Securities said in a report Monday.

Daishin Securities, meanwhile, predicted in a report that the raid could delay operations at the targeted battery plant, which was slated to begin production early next year, potentially affecting Hyundai's EV business in America.

During Monday's legislative hearing, Cho, the foreign minister, told lawmakers that the U.S. had “not responded adequately” to South Korea's requests to expand visas for its workers, and that Seoul plans to use this raid as an opportunity to move related negotiations forward.

Cho said some of the people detained in Georgia may need to return to the site to complete their work at the factory, and that South Korean officials are negotiating to ensure they can reenter the United States.

“I will clearly point out to them that a delay in (the factory's) completion would also cause significant losses for the United States,” Cho said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called out New York Democrats, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, for not endorsing Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor.

Democrats are facing a fight for the party's future, Sen. Bernie Sanders warned during his "Fighting Oligarchy" town hall with mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani at Brooklyn College in New York City on Saturday. 

The independent senator from Vermont criticized New York Democratic leaders, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, for refusing to endorse Mamdani in the heated race for Gracie Mansion. 

"I find it hard to understand how the major Democratic leaders in New York State are not supporting the Democratic candidate," Sanders said. 

"One might think that if a candidate starting at 2% in the polls gets 50,000 volunteers, creates enormous excitement, gets young people involved in the political process, gets nontraditional voters to vote, Democratic leaders would be jumping up and down. This is our guy!" 

Sanders called his party's lack of support "strange" and made his stance on the direction of the party clear: "We got another fight on our hands, and that is the future of the Democratic Party."

The Brooklyn native capitalized on the event as an opportunity to pressure New York Democrats to rally behind their nominee. Mamdani is fielding challenges from two independent candidates, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, as well as the Republican nominee, Curtis Sliwa.

When reached for comment regarding Sanders' apparent call to action on Saturday, Hochul's office pointed to the governor's comments on "Fox News Sunday."

"There's been so much speculation about what I'm going to do. I think the bigger question is what the voters of New York want to do. I vote in Buffalo, New York, just for the record. I'm not a New York City — I'm here part-time. But listen, it is up to the voters and there should not be outside influences on this decision from the White House on down. Let the voters of New York decide," Hochul told Fox News' Shannon Bream. 

Regardless of who wins the New York City mayoral race, Hochul said she needs that person to work with her to protect the Jewish community and ensure businesses can continue to thrive through affordability and public safety. 

"Stay tuned. We'll see what happens," Hochul added regarding an endorsement. 

Schumer and Jeffries did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

As Sanders rallied New Yorkers for Mamdani, the town hall wasn't without its detractors. "You are a communist!" one protester yelled at Mamdani as he addressed the crowd. 

President Donald Trump has dubbed Mamdani a "100% communist lunatic" since he won the Democratic primary in June. 

Ahead of the town hall in Brooklyn, the two progressive leaders marched alongside union members in Manhattan's Labor Day parade. On Saturday afternoon, Mamdani posed for a photo with Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in Astoria. The post amassed more than 6 million views on X as of Monday morning.

Sanders, a two-time Democratic presidential nominee runner-up, was an early endorser of Mamdani's primary campaign, along with Ocasio-Cortez. Their endorsements helped Mamdani consolidate progressive support in the 11-candidate field during the final weeks of the primary campaign.

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez sparked sizable buzz on the "Fighting Oligarchy" tour earlier this year, firing up thousands of Democrats at rallies across the United States who have been left without a clear party leader since devastating losses up and down the ballot in 2024. 

While Sanders' "Fighting Oligarchy" tour seemed for a time a glimmer of hope for a fractured party, Mamdani's surprising primary win this summer seems to have reignited that Democratic base in a new, albeit more progressive, direction.

Mamdani's campaign platform promises progressive ideas like rent freezes, city-run grocery stores, free buses and raising the minimum wage — all of which he plans to pay for by raising taxes on corporations and the 1%.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi discusses the crime crackdown in Washington D.C. and the Department of Justice's lawsuit against the city of Boston on ‘Hannity.'

With the Trump administration zeroing in on Boston's sanctuary stance toward illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed it is reviewing the status of an African-born former councilwoman who was sentenced Friday in a corruption probe.

Cape Verde-born Boston Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson pleaded guilty earlier this year in relation to what the Boston Herald described as a kickback scheme she carried out in a City Hall bathroom.

Libs of TikTok, a social media account known for criticizing liberal hypocrisy and run by activist Chaya Raichik, highlighted Anderson last week, and said that a source had told her DHS was investigating Anderson.

"We are looking into this, yes," Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital when asked about the claim on Monday.

After she was elected in 2021, Anderson spoke to WGBH about her Muslim and African background, mentioning that she had "been undocumented."

"We always say the ‘ummah' which means ‘community'. It doesn't necessarily exclude non-Muslims."

"As the person that I am – Muslim, Cape Verdean, someone who's been undocumented, an African immigrant and now African American – I think that all of that is what makes me a very dynamic Black woman," Anderson said at the time.

Cape Verde, an archipelago a few hundred miles offshore of Senegal, is home to about 600,000 people and best known in the U.S. as the area from which many North Atlantic hurricanes develop. 

During her post-election speech in Boston's Nubian Square, Anderson said she hoped to work to break down "segregation" between the heavily minority Roxbury neighborhood and the South End of Boston.

"If we can begin to be actually sincere about the work and putting the community first. That's when I will start feeling really good," said Anderson, who was the first African immigrant elected to the council, according to WGBH.

In regard to her court case, the Herald reported Anderson gave a staff member $13,000 under the condition that $7,000 would return to her, adding the swap happened in the aforementioned restroom.

BOSTON'S WU FIRES BACK AT BONDI, CITING REVOLUTION, AS OTHER CITIES SLAM FEDS OVER ‘SANCTUARY' WARNINGS

Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee, told Anderson the kickback may have been considered "low-hanging fruit," but was a "breach of trust," nonetheless, according to the paper.

Anderson later lashed out at the media, naming the Herald as well as Fox's Boston affiliate, demanding they "stop talking about me," and that being in the news is not helpful as an "introvert."

She alleged the press does not always "report accurately on Black people," and that the media also "tr[ies] to create stories" and should "verify your facts."

Special Agent-in-Charge Ted Docks of the FBI's Boston division said Anderson "let the power she wielded go to her head and routinely put herself over her constituents who trusted her to act on their behalf and for their benefit."

"Today's sentence holds her accountable for flagrantly embracing a culture of fraud and deceit and brazenly pocketing taxpayer money inside a City Hall bathroom to feather her nest."

The DHS announcement of a probe came several days into an ongoing spat between the Trump administration in Washington and the Wu administration in Boston.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu held a raucous press conference last month, daring Attorney General Pam Bondi to follow through on her letters to blue-city leaders threatening federal action over sanctuary city policies.

Wu, a Democrat, accused the Trump administration of being a party that "doesn't follow the law."

"At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential," she said. The remarks came after the Trump administration warned it could sue or cut federal funds if cities refused to cooperate on immigration enforcement.

"Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law… You are wrong on the law, and you are wrong on safety," Wu said.

Bondi had issued letters to several sanctuary jurisdictions warning them that their ordinances in regard to cooperation with immigration enforcement run counter to federal law.

Fox News Digital reached out to the public defender listed for Anderson, Scott Bauer, but did not immediately hear back.

New York Attorney General Letitia James indicated on Monday that she is intervening in a lawsuit filed by her Texas counterpart, who is suing a New York county clerk for refusing to enforce a judgment against an abortion provider operating in the Empire State.

The legal battle is set to test the legality of New York's abortion shield law, which prevents other states from suing or prosecuting abortion providers in New York. James will defend the constitutionality of the state's shield law against what she calls “blatant overreach.”

“Texas has no authority in New York, and no power to impose its cruel abortion ban here,” she said in a statement. “Our shield law exists to protect New Yorkers from out-of-state extremists, and New York will always stand strong as a safe haven for health care and freedom of choice. I will fight every last attempt to roll back our rights and turn back the clock on reproductive freedom.”

Ulster County Clerk Taylor Bruck twice declined to file a summary judgment and court summons against Dr. Margaret Carpenter, who lost a civil lawsuit in March. The judgment involved a $100,000 penalty and a permanent injunction prohibiting her from sending abortion drugs to Texas patients.

Carpenter, a founder of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine Access, allegedly prescribed and mailed abortion pills to a patient in Collin County, Texas. She did not have a medical license in Texas.

In July, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton took legal action against Bruck for failing to enforce the court order against Carpenter.

In a letter to the Ulster County Supreme Court, James said she will file written arguments in the case by Sept. 19. She is expected to maintain the legality of New York's abortion laws.

Paxton, confident in his argument, responded forcefully to the Democratic attorney general's intervention.

“Letitia James is a lawless abortionist who is obsessed with killing babies and weaponizing her office for her political career,” he wrote on X. “I will defeat her in court.”

Like James, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) defended New York against out-of-state litigation and prosecution regarding the abortion case. When Gov. Jeff Landry (R-LA) signed a warrant for Carpenter's arrest in February, Hochul denied the request. Carpenter faces criminal charges in Louisiana for providing abortion pills across state lines, while her case in Texas was a civil matter.

KEN PAXTON SUES NY CLERK TO ENFORCE TEXAS JUDGMENT OVER TELEHEALTH ABORTION PILL PRESCRIPTION

Monday's action filed by James comes days after Texas lawmakers passed a bill enabling private citizens to sue out-of-state abortion providers who send abortion pills to patients in Texas, where abortion faces a near-total ban. Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) is expected to sign the bill into law.

Shield laws are strongly opposed by Republicans. In late July, 16 GOP attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to ban shield laws in blue states. New York is one of eight states that have passed such a law since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022.

Fox News contributor Hugh Hewitt joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the murder of Iryna Zarutska by repeat offender Decarlos Brown and why dangerous criminals continue to roam free.

President Donald Trump on Monday reacted to the fatal stabbing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee that happened last month in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying that the U.S. must act against "evil people" for the good of the country.

Trump mentioned the stabbing of Iryna Zarutska on the city's light rail train during remarks at the Museum of the Bible.

"We're all people of religion, but there are evil people," Trump said. "And we have to confront that. I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed this morning or last night in Charlotte by a madman."

The suspect, identified as 34-year-old Decarlos Brown, was arrested shortly after the stabbing and hospitalized before being arrested on a charge of first-degree murder.

"A lunatic just got up and started," Trump said of the suspect. "It's right on tape. Not really watchable because it's so horrible, but just viciously stabbed. She's just sitting there."

The surveillance footage, recently released by the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS), shows Zarutska boarding the Lynx Bline line just after 9:45 p.m. on Aug. 22. She is seen wearing a pizzeria uniform while scrolling on her phone. A man in a red hoodie is seen sitting behind her. 

Around four minutes later, the footage shows the man pulling out a knife and stabbing Zarutska three times, including at least once in the neck. Authorities later pronounced her dead at the scene.

The video shows the suspect walking through the rail car, taking off his sweatshirt, and waiting by the doors as passengers look on. 

"So they're evil people," Trump said. "We have to be able to handle that. If we don't handle that, we don't have a country."

Records obtained by The New York Post showed that Brown has a history of arrests going back more than a decade, including charges of felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and communicating threats. Police said Brown and Zarutska did not know each other and the attack had been random.

Trump noted other recent killings in the U.S., saying that actions, like his administration's push to end cashless bail, must be taken.

"This cashless bail started a wave in our country where a killer kills somebody and is out on the street by the afternoon and, in many cases, going out and killing again, cashless bail," Trump said.

            “It's right on the tape, not really watchable because it's so horrible,” Trump said of the unprovoked stabbing on the city's light rail train, which was caught on a surveillance video. “She's just sitting there.”
    


            The president added that he'd given his “love and hope to the family of the young woman.”
    


            Trump said his administration would not tolerate violent crime, vowing “to get to the end of it.”
    


            “When you have horrible killings you have to take horrible actions,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump touched on his administration's efforts to exert influence over Smithsonian Institute museums during remarks at the White House Religious Liberty Commission, saying he got “a little involved” due to what he believes is an overemphasis on negative aspects of American history.
    


            “I got a little involved with museums, you know, because that little problem with the Smithsonian, we like, like, a little more positivity. It was all about all the bad things in our country. I said, ‘What about the good things we've done?' So, I got a little involved,” Trump said during remarks at the Museum of the Bible.
    


            Trump gave credit to the Smithsonian, however, adding, “Honestly, they're making changes. You know, they were also told what to do by people that came before me, in all fairness, but they're making changes. Big changes are being made at the Smithsonian.”
    


            The Smithsonian Institute is approaching a deadline on Friday to submit the first round of requested materials to the White House as it undergoes an internal review, including 250th anniversary programming, current exhibition content, traveling and upcoming exhibitions and internal guidelines and governance.
    


Last month, Trump said that the Smithsonian is “out of control” and puts too much focus too much on “how bad slavery was.”
    


            At the Museum of the Bible Monday, Trump also said that he delivered his personal family bible, which he said was given to him by his mother, to go on display.
    


            According to financial documents released in June, Trump made more than $1.3 million Trump from Lee Greenwood's “God Bless the USA” Bible.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration will soon issue guidance aimed at protecting the right to pray in public schools.
    


            Trump made the announcement during a speech on religious liberty at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC.
    


            The Education Department is expected to issue the guidance, which Trump said was spurred by an episode in Texas where a student was prevented from organizing a group prayer on school grounds for an injured classmate.
    


            “The principal didn't like it, can you imagine?” Trump said, adding that the student “held her ground and she won.”
    


            President Donald Trump again lashed out at Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker this morning, questioning why the Democrat doesn't want federal intervention to crack down on crime in Chicago.
    


            “6 people were murdered in Chicago this weekend, 12 others were shot, and in serious condition. This would mean that over the past number of weeks, approximately 50 people were killed, and hundreds were shot, many expected to die. Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn't want Federal Government HELP! WHY??? “ Trump posted on Truth Social.
    


            Trump also said that “only the criminals will be hurt” by any federal efforts in the city, and that crime there is “ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!!!”
    


            Over the weekend, Pritzker called Trump “a wannabe dictator” and interpreted his “Chipocolypse Now” meme as a threat “to go to war with an American city.” Pritzker said in a recent appearance on MSNBC that if Trump really wanted to help Chicago fight crime, “why not help us with providing ATF, the people that can interdict firearms?”
    


            “FBI, DEA, we're fighting gangs, we're fighting drugs. That happens in every major city. If you want to help us fight crime, send us civilian law enforcement,” Pritzker said.
    


As CNN reported, seven people were killed in Chicago from Friday evening through Sunday, preliminary police figures show. Fatal shootings are down 34.2% this year through September 6 in the city compared with the same period in 2024, with 237 killed in 2025, data from the mayor's office shows.
    


            Trump administration officials have, for weeks, privately discussed targeting Chicago and Boston — two Democratic-led cities that drew the ire of the administration over their so-called sanctuary policies.
    


            The escalating rhetoric from the president and his officials is in line with how the administration is planning its aggressive immigration agenda moving forward, equipped with more funds and efforts to bring on more federal personnel.
    


            Immigration arrests have already been ongoing in each city this year. But the expectation is to expand those operations in the days to come, akin to what unfolded in Los Angeles over the summer.
    


            Federal officials had planned for a phased approach to Chicago lasting weeks and are continuing to surge federal personnel to the city. But discussions picked up over the weekend to move forward with an operation sooner.
    


            Operations in Chicago are expected to mirror Los Angeles. The man charged with operations there, Gregory Bovino, was deployed to Chicago to do the same there, officials told CNN.
    


            One official described it to CNN as “Los Angeles on the road.”
    


Some context: In the early days of the administration, Chicago was among the first cities targeted for immigration enforcement, with White House border czar Tom Homan on hand for the operation.
    


Pressed yesterday on if the administration will send the National Guard in to Chicago this week, Homan told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” that the option is “always on the table.”
    


            President Donald Trump is continuing to tease more federal action on crime in American cities, praising his initiative in Washington, DC, and signaling on social media that he's still mulling the decision of where to go next.
    


                    “Washington, D.C. IS A SAFE ZONE IN JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS. Thank you, President Trump. Who's Next???” Trump posted on Truth Social this morning.
                





            The administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, DC, and federalized the city's police force, though that aspect is expected to expire this week. Yesterday, Trump told reporters that he would make a decision “as to where we go over the next day or two,” when asked about his plans for Chicago.
    


            Over the weekend, Trump posted what appears to be an AI image of himself as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a character in “Apocalypse Now,” writing that he loves the “smell of deportations in the morning.”
    


            He added Chicago is “about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.” CNN has reported the administration is preparing a major immigration enforcement operation in the city.
    


            President Donald Trump remains broadly underwater on his approval rating as two new polls find widespread opposition to his use of the National Guard against crime in American cities.
    


            Trump's approval rating stands at 44% in the CBS News/YouGov poll and 43% in the NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll. The CNN Poll of Polls averaging surveys conducted from mid-August through early September finds Trump's approval rating at 43% approve to 55% disapprove, similar to where it's held all summer.
    


            In the CBS poll, nearly six in 10 Americans say they oppose Trump deploying the National Guard to Washington, DC (57% oppose) or other cities (58%). Slightly more (61%) say they would oppose Trump deploying National Guard troops to their own local city or area. Americans are generally split over whether the use of the Guard to fight crime actually reduces crime (49% say it does, 51% that it does not), and only 36% say that the deployment of the National Guard to cities makes them feel personally safer. More see Trump's deployment of the National Guard as a purely political move (45%) than as one designed to reduce crime (33%), with another 22% saying Trump is motivated both by political reasons and a goal of reducing crime.
    


            The poll finds broad partisan divides across all these questions, with independents generally opposed and far more likely to see political motivation in Trump's moves (51%) than a push to reduce crime (28%).
    


            The NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll was conducted online August 13 through September 1 among 30,196 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. The CBS News/YouGov poll was conducted online September 3 through 5 among 2,385 adults and has an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 points.
    


            President Donald Trump plans to announce a new initiative encouraging Americans to pray for the United States during his remarks today at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC.
    


            A White House official said the program, called “America Prays,” would be tied to the upcoming 250th anniversary of the country's founding. It encourages weekly prayer in groups.
    


            “As we approach the 250th anniversary of the greatest country in the world, President Trump invites Americans to pray for our nation and for our people. America is stronger with the power of prayer,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.
    


            Trump's remarks today will come amid a meeting of the Religious Liberty Commission he established by executive order in May. The commission has a particular focus on religious liberty in education, which the White House claims was curtailed during the previous administration.
    


            The Museum of the Bible is a non-profit organization in Washington that opened in 2017. It is unassociated with the city's major Smithsonian museum system, and unlike Smithsonian institutions or the National Gallery of Art, it charges an admission fee.
    


            Trump's visit today will be his first stop at a museum since he ordered a review of Smithsonian organizations for programming and exhibitions the administration found objectionable.
    


            Europe's top sanctions envoy is in Washington, DC, today for discussions with US administration officials on tightening pressure on Russia, according to people familiar with the meetings.
    


            European Union sanctions envoy David O'Sullivan, who has spearheaded the bloc's sanctions regime against Russia, is expected to meet with officials at the US Treasury Department to discuss and coordinate potential measures on Moscow as it escalates the war in Ukraine.
    


            The meetings come as President Donald Trump has said he's ready to slap new measures on Moscow.
    


            The meetings will include officials from the White House, State Department and the Office of the US Trade Representative, the people said, describing the talks as a sign of forward momentum on new coordinated sanctions against Russia.
    


            Trump said yesterday that European leaders were expected in Washington early this week to discuss the Ukraine war. It wasn't clear if he was referring to O'Sullivan or other leaders. The White House did not clarify who the president was speaking about.
    


            He also said he was prepared to apply new sanctions on Russia after it launched the largest drone attack to date in its three-and-a-half-year war. He said he expected to speak soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But he stopped short of describing what options he was considering, and many of his previous threats of sanctions have melted away.
    


            President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would speak to Russia's Vladimir Putin “very soon.”
    


            “Over the next couple of days. Look, we're going to get it done. The Russia-Ukraine situation. We're going to get it done,” he said.
    


            Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war this weekend, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time.
    


                    “The danger in any war is escalation. Russia appears to be escalating with the largest attack of the war hitting offices of the UKR Cabinet in Kyiv,” Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg said on X. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these … The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.”
                





Last month, administration officials told CNN that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace.
    


            Yesterday, Trump said: “I believe we're going to get it settled. But I am not happy with them. I'm not happy with anything having to do with that war.”
    


            Trump added European leaders would visit the US this week to work on a solution.
    


            “Certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday and individually, and I think we're going to get that settled.”
    


            Trump previously threatened “severe consequences” for Putin if he does not end the war, including the possibility of “massive sanctions or massive tariffs,” also signaling yesterday that he was ready to move on sanctions.
    


            The Trump administration is moving ahead with its crime and immigration crackdowns, now focusing its attention on Chicago and Massachusetts.

            The Supreme Court on Monday backed President Donald Trump's push to allow immigration enforcement officials to continue what critics describe as “roving patrols” in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the Fourth Amendment.
    


            The court did not offer an explanation for its decision, which came over a sharp dissent from the three liberal justices.
    


            At issue were a series of incidents in which masked and heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulled aside people who identify as Latino – including some US citizens – around Los Angeles to interrogate them about their immigration status. Lower courts found that ICE likely had not established the “reasonable suspicion” required to justify those stops.
    


            The decision deals with seven counties in Southern California, but it has landed during a broader crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration – and officials are likely to read it as a tacit approval of similar practices elsewhere.
    


            A US District Court in July ordered the Department of Homeland Security to discontinue the practice if the stops were based largely on a person's apparent ethnicity, language or their presence at a particular location, such as a farm or bus stop. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld that decision, which applied only to seven California counties.
    


            But the Supreme Court disagreed with that approach. Though the court did not provide any analysis explaining its decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the conservative wing who sided with Trump, wrote in a concurrence that the factors the agents were considering “taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”
    


            “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this court's case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors,” Kavanaugh wrote.
    


            “Importantly,” Kavanaugh added, “reasonable suspicion means only that immigration officers may briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status.”
    


            The order drew a fiery dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice to serve on the Supreme Court.
    


            “We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”
    


            Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the “on-the-ground reality” of immigration arrests cuts against the federal government's fears that a court ruling could chill authorities' ability to detain and deport undocumented migrants.
    


            “The evidence in this case, however, reveals that the government is likely to continue relying solely on those four factors because that is what agents are currently authorized and instructed to do,” Sotomayor wrote.
    


            Since a district court issued a ruling temporarily barring interrogations and arrests based only on a person's apparent ethnicity, language or their presence at a particular location, members of the Trump administration have made clear they intend to proceed with their agenda as planned, the justice said.
    


            Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “has called the District Judge an ‘idiot' and vowed that ‘none of [the government's] operations are going to change,'” Sotomayor wrote. “The CBP Chief Patrol Agent in the Central District has stated that his division will ‘turn and burn' and ‘go even harder now,' and has posted videos on social media touting his agents' continued efforts ‘[c]hasing, cuffing, [and] deporting' people at car washes.”
    


            Referring to Kavanaugh's concurrence, Sotomayor said that ICE agents aren't just conducting brief or routine traffic stops. They are seizing both undocumented immigrants and US citizens “using firearms, physical violence, and warehouse detentions.”
    


            The case was the latest of nearly two dozen emergency appeals the administration has filed at the Supreme Court since Trump began his second term in January. Many of those have dealt with Trump's immigration policies.
    


            US District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, in her earlier ruling siding against Trump in the case, said the administration was attempting to convince the court “in the face of a mountain of evidence” that none of the plaintiffs' claims were true.
    


            Frimpong, appointed by President Joe Biden, said in her ruling that the court needed to decide whether the plaintiffs could prove the Trump administration “is indeed conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.”
    


            The American Civil Liberties Union also condemned the ruling.
    


            “Today's Supreme Court order puts people at grave risk, allowing federal agents in Southern California to target individuals because of their race, how they speak, the jobs they work, or just being at a bus stop or the car wash when ICE agents decide to raid a place,” said Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the ACLU, which was part of the legal team challenging the stops.
    


            “For anyone perceived as Latino by an ICE agent,” she added, “this means living in a fearful ‘papers please' regime, with risks of violent ICE arrests and detention.”
    


            Kavanaugh used his 10-page concurrence to launch into a broader discussion about the debate around illegal immigration.
    


            “To be sure, I recognize and fully appreciate that many (not all, but many) illegal immigrants come to the United States to escape poverty and the lack of freedom and opportunities in their home countries,” he wrote.
    


            “But the fact remains that, under the laws passed by Congress and the president, they are acting illegally by remaining in the United States – at least unless Congress and the president choose some other legislative approach to legalize some or all of those individuals now illegally present in the country,” he added.
    


            Sotomayor leaned into a growing criticism around how the Supreme Court has handled high-profile emergency cases dealing with Trump: That it has offered no explanation. The court itself offered only a single paragraph of boilerplate language in siding with Trump.
    


            The sometimes-terse orders have been a topic of discussion for several justices who have appeared at events over the summer. Kagan said earlier this year that she thought the court could often provide further explanation in its emergency decisions. But Kavanaugh and others have noted that the court is sometimes hesitant to signal which way it's leaning in a case.
    


            “The court's order is troubling for another reason: It is entirely unexplained,” Sotomayor wrote. “In the last eight months, this court's appetite to circumvent the ordinary appellate process and weigh in on important issues has grown exponentially.”

A shocking incident on board the light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina, in which a Ukrainian refugee was fatally stabbed and the suspect has a lengthy rap sheet, has once again put the spotlight on violent crime in cities and President Donald Trump's plans to use the federal government to counter it.

The unprompted attack happened shortly before 10 p.m. on Aug. 22. The victim, Iryna Zarutska, was a refugee from Ukraine. Court documents with a video of the attack showed Zarutska entering the light rail train car and sitting down directly in front of the suspect.

“The train travels for approximately four and half minutes before the suspect pulls knife from his pocket, unfolds the knife, pauses, then stands up, and strikes at the victim three times,” a police detective wrote in an affidavit.

“Blood visibly drips on the floor as the defendant walks away from the victim. The victim goes unresponsive shortly after the attack. The defendant is the assailant on the video. There appears to be no interaction between the victim and defendant,” the affidavit states.

Zarutska was pronounced dead at the scene.

Zarutska, a 23-year-old refugee, fled Ukraine in 2022 with her immediate relatives due to the war. She worked at a pizzeria and was wearing her uniform the night of the attack.

“Iryna will be remembered for her kindness, her creativity, and the lasting impression she left on everyone she met. Her absence leaves a deep void, but her spirit will forever remain in the hearts of those who loved her,” her obituary reads. 

Her uncle called her “a sweet angel” during a court appearance for the case.

The suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown Jr., has over a dozen charges dating back to 2014. 

After the Aug. 22 attack, Brown was taken to the hospital to be treated for a laceration on the outside of his hand, but he is now in jail. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bond. A judge ordered Brown to be evaluated for 60 days, and his next court appearance is on Sept. 19.

Brown's criminal record includes armed robbery, felony larceny, breaking and entering, and shoplifting dating back to 2014, according to jail records reviewed by WBTV. He was jailed for five years for armed robbery. After he was released in 2020, he was arrested five months later for assault.

In court Friday, Zarutska's uncle said, “The accused has taken a very bright, beautiful woman from our family, and we are heartbroken by that. I ask the court not to release him.”

The video of the attack spread in online circles over the weekend.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles offered her condolences and said she did not think it was appropriate to share video of the attack widely. 

“The video of the heartbreaking attack that took Iryna Zarutska's life is now public. I want to thank our media partners and community members who have chosen not to repost or share the footage out of respect for Iryna's family,” she said. 

“This was a senseless and tragic loss. My prayers remain with her loved ones as they continue to grieve through an unimaginable time,” the mayor said. “Like so many of you, I'm heartbroken — and I've been thinking hard about what safety really looks like in our city. I remain committed to doing all we can to protect our residents and ensure Charlotte is a place where everyone feels safe.”

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized the mayor's comments.

“Charlotte's Mayor doesn't want the media to show you the ugly truth. Why? Because she and other public officials in her city bear responsibility,” Duffy posted on social media.

Local and national Republican leaders also accused the mayor of not doing enough to combat violent crime in the city. North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall tied the attack to “soft on crime” policies, and Rep. Mark Harris (R-NC) said “violence in Charlotte is a microcosm of a national epidemic.”

President Donald Trump commented on the attack during a speech at the Religious Liberty Commission on Monday morning.

“I give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed in Charlotte by a madman — a lunatic — while she's just sitting there. There are evil people. We have to be able to handle that. If we don't handle that, we don't have a country,” he said.

A federal appeals court upheld an $83.3 million judgment against President Donald Trump for defamation against writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019.

A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected on Monday Trump's appeal of a January 2024 jury finding related to the president's 2019 denial of Carroll's allegation that he raped her at a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room sometime in the mid-1990s. Trump has repeatedly denied that the incident occurred, and his 2019 denials of the allegation led to Carroll filing the first of two defamation lawsuits against him.

The appeals court panel rejected Trump's appeal, in which he argued he was entitled to presidential immunity for the statements he made denying Carroll's accusation because he made them while serving his first term in the White House.

“We conclude that Trump has failed to identify any grounds that would warrant reconsidering our prior holding on presidential immunity. We also conclude that the district court did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury's damages awards are fair and reasonable,” the unsigned ruling from the panel said.

The three-judge panel that issued the ruling Monday was made up of two Biden appointees and one Obama appointee.

The ruling concerns the first of two defamation cases Carroll has brought against Trump. In the first case, Carroll was awarded $83.3 million for Trump's 2019 comments. In the second case Carroll brought, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing her during the alleged Bergdorf Goodman incident, along with finding him liable for defaming her with comments he made in 2022 denying the incident again, leading to a $5 million judgment against him.

TRUMP WILL APPEAL $5 MILLION E. JEAN CARROLL RULING TO SUPREME COURT

Trump could appeal Monday's ruling and request an en banc review by the full bench of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals or appeal the case to the Supreme Court.

The president's lawyers have told the Supreme Court they intend to appeal the $5 million judgment against him after a split full bench of the 2nd Circuit denied an appeal in June. A panel on the 2nd Circuit similarly rejected the appeal in that case in December.

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel explains the voice box injury to the legendary singer.

Steven Tyler is doing what he does best. 

During Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards, the 77-year-old rock legend — along with Joe Perry, Yungblud, and Nuno Bettencourt — honored the late Ozzy Osbourne with an emotional tribute performance of "Mama, I'm Coming Home."  This marks Tyler's first award-show performance since Aerosmith announced the band would retire from touring after Tyler injured his larynx while singing onstage.

"This is what a rock show should be," one fan wrote on X.

"Yup, tears in my eyes for Ozzy again. Absolutely awesome performance from Yungblud, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Nuno, and crew on the VMAs. OZZY FOREVER," another wrote of the tribute for the late singer, who died in July.

A representative for Tyler did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

In August 2024, Aerosmith announced the band would retire from touring after more than 50 years after Tyler faced a vocal cord injury. 

"It was 1970 when a spark of inspiration became Aerosmith. Thanks to you, our Blue Army, that spark caught flame and has been burning for over five decades. Some of you have been with us since the beginning and all of you are the reason we made rock ‘n' roll history," the lengthy statement read on the band's official X account.

"It has been the honor of our lives to have our music become part of yours. In every club, on every massive tour and at moments grand and private you have given us a place in the soundtrack of your lives. We've always wanted to blow your mind when performing," the statement continued. 

The band then addressed the current state of Tyler's health. 

"As you know, Steven's voice is an instrument like no other. He has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where it was before his injury," the statement read. "We've seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side.

"Sadly, it is clear, that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible. We have made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band of brothers — to retire from the touring stage."

"We are grateful beyond words for everyone who was pumped to get on the road with us one last time," their statement continued. "Grateful to our expert crew, our incredible team and the thousands of talented people who've made our historic runs possible. A final thank you to you - the best fans on planet Earth. Play our music loud, now and always. Dream On. You've made our dreams come true."

Earlier this year, Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum said that despite singing at a recent charity concert, Tyler won't be going on tour again. 

"It was a really big moment for him because he hurt himself bad," Sorum told WBAB radio recently of Tyler's performance at the Jam for Janie Grammy Awards Viewing Party, which benefits his charity Janie's Fund, after injuring his larynx last year.

"Now is he going to tour again? No, he's not, and I explain this to people. Steven cannot put himself under the rigors of doing a full worldwide tour because it's a lot of pressure and if you're not a singer you wouldn't understand what he goes through, but he's 77 years old, and he's a perfectionist, and if he doesn't sing correctly, it bothers him."

Sorum added that Tyler wasn't willing to prerecord his voice like some other artists do.

"He's not going to put it on tape, like 80% of the people that are out there taking your money. He will not be on tape, and he will not change the keys to the song," he explained. "That's just who he is. He's like, ‘I'm an artist. I'm a singer. This is my band. I've been doing this for 50 years and if I can't do it perfect, I can't do it,' and I respect that."

Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst brings the latest on Russia's massive air attack on Ukraine while 'Fox & Friends' hosts Lawrence Jones, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade react.

President Donald Trump says he's ready to punish Russia with a "second phase" of sanctions after it launched its largest-ever barrage of drone and missile strikes on Sunday, damaging a cabinet building and killing a mother and her baby. 

"Yeah, I am," Trump told a reporter, who asked whether he's ready to move forward with more sanctions following months of failing to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to cease his military operations or meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump said he still has plans to chat with Putin "over the next couple of days" though it remains unclear what he hopes to get out of the latest conversation.

RUSSIA HITS UKRAINE WITH LARGEST AIR ATTACK OF THE WAR AS TALKS OF PEACE FLICKER

"Look, we're going to get it done," he told reporters on Sunday. "The Russia-Ukraine situation. We're going to get it done."

Trump said he was "not thrilled" with Russia's Sunday attack, which damaged the Cabinet of Ministers Building in Kyiv and killed four, including a mother and her baby, after 810 drones and 13 missiles were fired across Ukraine.

Ukraine's air force said it neutralized 747 drones and four of the fired missiles.

"I am not thrilled with what's happening there," Trump said. "I believe we're going to get it settled. But I am not happy with them. I'm not happy with anything having to do with that war."

PUTIN WARNS WESTERN TROOPS IN UKRAINE WOULD BE 'LEGITIMATE TARGETS'

The strike came just days after Putin alleged he was willing to meet with Zelenskyy so long as the Ukrainian leader traveled to Moscow – a move Western and Ukrainian officials alike said was not only a dangerous proposition for Zelenskyy, but lacked any real effort by Putin to engage in good faith negotiations to end the war. 

Trump told reporters on Sunday that European leaders will also be heading to Washington D.C. this week to discuss next steps in ending the war, though he did not detail who will make the trip and whether Zelenskyy would be among them. 

Putin said last month that his terms for ending the war would focus on freezing the front lines where they stand in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, but appeared to suggest that Ukraine would need to withdraw its forces from Donetsk and Luhansk, amid other stipulations.

But on Monday, Ukraine's military said it had recaptured the strategically important town of Zarichne in Donetsk – a region which Russia was assessed to occupy roughly 75% of last month.

Zarichne sits near Luhansk – a region which Russia is assessed to nearly fully occupy – and is near key transport routes connecting strategically important cities in Donetsk. 

Ukraine last month also said it had made advances in areas near Pokrovsk in western Donetsk, where Russian forces have been concentrating their summer operation efforts.

Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) Robert Wieczorek sits down with Fox News Digital to discuss work by the FBI Chicago Division to cut down on neighborhood crime, gun violence and drug trafficking.

The FBI will welcome a second deputy director for the first time in its history in the coming days after Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey resigned his position on Monday to join the bureau.

Bailey will serve as co-deputy director alongside Dan Bongino, with the pair reporting to FBI Director Kash Patel. The unprecedented setup comes as President Donald Trump is placing a new emphasis on federal law enforcement amid his wider crime crackdown. There also has been controversy within the FBI regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, with sources saying Bongino has been deeply frustrated.

"As I approach the final hours as your Attorney General, I am profoundly grateful to Missouri, as it has been the honor of my life to serve you," Bailey wrote on social media Sunday night. "Together, we have accomplished much for the place we call home. Until Missouri calls again, thank you."

Fox News Digital has learned that Bailey is set to start at the FBI next Monday.

As Missouri's AG, Bailey made national headlines opposing former President Joe Biden's efforts to wipe away student debt. He also worked to curb Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs at multiple major companies, including at Starbucks, which he accused of "race-based hiring" earlier this year. Bailey also spoke up in favor of President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.

Bailey also launched an anti-human trafficking task force and addressed more than 1,100 reported incidents in Missouri, in addition to clearing the backlog of Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence (SAFE) kits to improve prosecution of sexual assault cases.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., hailed Bailey's hiring in a statement to Fox News Digital on Monday, praising the former prosecutor's work in his home state.

"Andrew Bailey is going to be terrific at the FBI," Hawley said. "He's been a stand-out prosecutor for Missouri. Now he will bring all those skills to bear for the country."

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed Bailey's hiring last month as Trump launched the federal takeover of Washington, D.C. and his national crime crackdown.

"I am thrilled to welcome Andrew Bailey as Co-Deputy Director of the FBI," Bondi told Fox News Digital. "He has served as a distinguished state attorney general and is a decorated war veteran, bringing expertise and dedication to service. His leadership and commitment to country will be a tremendous asset as we work together to advance President Trump's mission." 

Bailey's entry comes after weeks of rumblings within the FBI regarding the Epstein files. Bongino is said to have raised his voice in outrage during a private discussion with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Bondi before storming out of the meeting, according to two sources close to DOJ leadership. The ordeal had led him to consider resigning from the FBI, another source said.

Bongino was frustrated about the rollout of a public Epstein memo in July and what he viewed as Bondi's "lack of transparency from the start." The memo, a joint product of the DOJ and FBI, said the two agencies had no further information to share with the public about Epstein's case, a revelation that sparked fury among the MAGA base.

It has been nearly two months since the rumors of Bongino's potential resignation began, however, and he still remains at the FBI.

PARIS (AP) — Legislators toppled France's government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe's second-largest economy that obliges President Emmanuel Macron to search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months.

Prime Minister François Bayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. Bayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation, gambling that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to repair its debts. Instead, they seized on the vote that Bayrou called to gang up against the 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.

The demise of Bayrou's short-lived minority government — now constitutionally obliged to submit its resignation to Macron after just under nine months in office — heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Although Macron had two weeks to prepare for the government collapse after Bayrou announced in August that he'd seek a confidence vote on his unpopular budget plans, no clear front-runner has emerged as a likely successor. 

After Gabriel Attal's departure as prime minister in September 2024, followed by former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's ouster by parliament in December and Bayrou now ousted, too, Macron again faces an arduous hunt for a replacement to build consensus in the parliament's lower house that is stacked with opponents of the French leader.




As president, Macron will continue to hold substantial powers over foreign policy and European affairs and remain the commander in chief of the nuclear-armed military. But domestically, the 47-year-old president's ambitions are increasingly facing ruin.

The root of the latest government collapse was Macron's stunning decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024, triggering a legislative election that the French leader hoped would strengthen the hand of his pro-European centrist alliance. But the gamble backfired, producing a splintered legislature with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France's modern republic.

Shorn of a workable majority, his minority governments have since lurched from crisis to crisis, surviving on the whim of opposing political blocs on the left and far-right that don't have enough seats to govern themselves but can, when they team up, topple Macron's choices. 

Bayrou, too, rolled the dice by calling the confidence vote, a decision that quickly backfired on the political veteran as left-wing and far-right legislators seized the opportunity to oust his government, seeking to increase pressure on Macron.

Bayrou conceded in his last speech as prime minister to the National Assemnly that putting his fate on the line was risky. But he said that France's debt crisis compelled him to seek legislative support for remedies, in the face of what he called “a silent, underground, invisible, and unbearable hemorrhage” of excessive public borrowing.

“The greatest risk was to not take one, to let things go on without changing anything, to go on doing politics as usual,” he said. “Submission to debt is like submission through military force. Dominated by weapons, or dominated by our creditors, because of a debt that is submerging us — in both cases, we lose our freedom.”

At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of gross domestic product. Debt servicing remains a major budget item, accounting for around 7% of state spending.

The 577-seat National Assembly interrupted its summer recess to convene for the extraordinary session of high political drama. Macron's opponents worked to leverage the crisis to push for a new legislative election, pressure for Macron's departure or jostle for posts in the next government.

Far-right leader Marine Le Pen called for Macron to again dissolve the National Assembly, seemingly confident that her National Rally party and its allies would win a majority in another snap legislative election, positioning it to form a new government.

“A big country like France cannot live with a paper government, especially in a tormented and dangerous world,” she said in the National Assembly.

In a last-ditch effort to save his job before the vote, Bayrou warned that France is risking its future and its influence by racking up trillions in state debts that are “submerging us,” pleading for belt-tightening.

Macron's chosen successor will operate in the same precarious environment and face the same pressing budget problems that dogged Bayrou and his predecessors. Macron himself has vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, but risks becoming a lame duck domestically if political paralysis continues.

Under the French political system, the prime minister is appointed by the president, accountable to the parliament and is in charge of implementing domestic policy, notably economic measures. 

Arguing that sharp cuts are needed to repair public finances, Bayrou had proposed to cut 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in spending in 2026, after France's deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, way above the official EU target of 3%.

He painted a dramatic picture of the European Union's No. 2 economy becoming beholden to foreign creditors and addicted to living beyond its means. He castigated opponents in the National Assembly who teamed up against his minority government despite their own sharp political differences.

“You have the power to overthrow the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,” Bayrou said. “Reality will remain inexorable. Spending will continue to increase and and the debt burden — already unbearable — will grow heavier and more costly.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — National Guard troops patrolling the streets of U.S. cities. Weapons of war deployed against international gangs suspected of drug trafficking. Military bases and resources redirected to mass immigration enforcement operations. 

President Donald Trump is swiftly implementing his vision of the military as an all-powerful tool for his policy goals. It's ground that presidents have hardly ever crossed outside of times of war, and experts say it's remaking the role of the most powerful military in the world and its relationship with the American public.

Yet as Trump has dramatically stepped up his use of military force, fellow Republicans in Congress — where authorization for such actions is supposed to originate — have done little but cheer him on. That's giving the president significant leeway as he raises plans to send troops next to Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans. 

“If I were one of those mayors, I'd be glad to have the help,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, speaking from a Capitol building where National Guard troops were patrolling the surrounding city. “I think the big city Democrats are really making a mistake. I think they're being tone deaf.”

Lawmakers from Louisiana — a red state that surrounds politically blue New Orleans — said it was a great idea for National Guard troops to go there next.




“New Orleans, like most Democrat-run cities, has a high crime rate, so it would be helpful,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told The Associated Press.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., agreed: “We need all the help we can get. I'm delighted to bring in the National Guard.”

Republicans have in recent years found political success focusing on the issue of crime. The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities, according to recent polling from the The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats. 

However, statistics show overall crime is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.

In the past, the use of National Guard troops on American soil was reserved for extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters or when local officials became overwhelmed by civil unrest or disorder. Rarely have presidents used the troops for law enforcement purposes. 

Notable examples include the 1894 Pullman strike in Chicago, during the Civil Rights era to enforce desegregation in the South, and in 1992 during deadly rioting after police officers brutally beat motorist Rodney King and were acquitted on state charges.

Experts say that Trump's crime mission stands out because he's not responding to a particular crisis. Instead, Trump is using the military to implement his domestic policies, whether that means using military aircraft for deportation flights, beefing up military at the U.S.-Mexico border or ordering National Guard troops to be ready for law enforcement duties.

“All of these things indicate an administration that is making a broad, concerted effort to insert the military into civilian law enforcement in a way and on a scale that has no precedent in American history,” said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.

Trump says he has the “right” to send National Guard troops to the cities, even over the objections of state governors.

“I'm the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger — and it is in danger in these cities — I can do it,” he said this past week.

Congress under its constitutional duties has laid out laws that govern when and how the National Guard can be deployed domestically. But as Trump has pushed the limits of those laws, the Republican-controlled Congress has stood by. Instead, it's been left to the courts to put any guardrails on Trump's maximalist approach to the presidency.

A federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration “willfully” broke the Posse Comitatus Act, a nearly 150-year-old federal law that limits the U.S. military's role in domestic law enforcement, when he sent National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area in early June after days of protests over immigration raids. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco noted Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated they intend to deploy National Guard troops to other cities across the country, raising concerns they're “creating a national police force with the President as its chief.”

That sort of use of the National Guard was just what the writers of the Constitution were trying to guard against, said Andrew Wiest, co-founder of the Center for the Study of the National Guard at the University of Southern Mississippi. 

The young nation had just endured a war of independence that was sparked by a British military acting as a police force on the colony, and its early leaders were reticent to give the president too much control over the military. Since then, presidents have increasingly exercised more power over the troops that started as state-based militias.

“This is another one of those pendulum moments where the Guard will become more federal or maybe it will swing back in the other direction,” Wiest said. “But since the founding of the Republic, it's been swinging towards the federal side.”

            Sabrina Carpenter's performance Sunday night at the MTV Video Music Awards seemed meant to inspire both dancing and resistance.
    


            The petite powerhouse performed her new song, “Tears,” with backup support from drag performers made famous by the reality series “Drag Race,” as well as dancers dressed as police officers.
    


            One of the drag performers, Honey Balenciaga, was recently featured on Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour.
    


            Carpenter, who started out in what appeared to be a silver, sparkly, fringe dress before a quick costume change, delivered an energetic performance that also contained a message.

            Some of those on stage with her held signs with messages that read, “In Trans We Trust” and “Protect Trans Rights.”
    


            It comes at a time when many in the trans community are raising concerns about state and national legislative efforts to limit gender identity care.
    


            Carpenter is a well known ally to the LGBTQIA+ community and her performance Sunday night felt inspired by the music video for “Tears.”
    


            Emmy-winning actor Colman Domingo appears in drag in that video, which pays homage to the classic, campy film “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.”

            Gruesome video shows a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee getting stabbed to death on a Charlotte light rail train – a case that has turned into a flashpoint as the Trump administration vows to crack down on crime in large, predominantly Democratic cities.
    


            The unprovoked attack happened shortly before 10 p.m. August 22, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said. A caller said a woman was stabbed in the throat.
    


            The victim, Iryna Zarutska, fled Ukraine in 2022 with her mother, sister, and brother to escape the war with Russia – “and she quickly embraced her new life in the United States,” her obituary states.
    


            Zarutska attended Rowan-Cabarrus Community College, worked at Zepeddie's Pizzeria, was a talented artist and had dreams of becoming a veterinary assistant. 



            Video of the attack shows Zarutska entering a train car and taking a seat directly in front of the suspect, court documents state.
    


            “The train travels for approximately four and half minutes before the suspect pulls knife from his pocket, unfolds the knife, pauses, then stands up, and strikes at the victim three times,” a police detective wrote in an affidavit.
    


            “Blood visibly drips on the floor as the defendant walks away from the victim. The victim goes unresponsive shortly after the attack. The defendant is the assailant on the video. There appears to be no interaction between the victim and defendant,” the affidavit states.
    


            The suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown, was taken to a hospital for treatment of a laceration and charged with first-degree murder.
    


            A judge has ordered Brown to be evaluated for 60 days in a local hospital. CNN is trying to reach his attorney for comment.
    


            Brown has a lengthy criminal history, including convictions for armed robbery, felony larceny and breaking and entering.
    


            He spent more than eight years behind bars for robbery with a dangerous weapon, state records show. 
    


            Earlier this year, Brown was charged with misuse of 911 after he allegedly asked officers to investigate a “man-made” material that controlled when he ate, walked and talked, court documents state. Officers told Brown “the issue was a medical issue,” and there was nothing more they could do. Brown became upset and called 911, the records state.
    


            President Donald Trump, who has recently escalated the presence of federal troops in urban areas as a crime-deterrent, denounced the slaying and called the  killer a “madman, a lunatic.”
    


            “It's right on the tape, not really watchable because it's so horrible,” Trump said of the surveillance footage “She's just sitting there.”
    


            The president offered his condolences to the victim's family and vowed to “get to the end” of violent crime.
    


            “When you have horrible killings you have to take horrible actions,” he said.
    


            Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles offered her condolences and came under criticism for her responses to the slaying.
    


            Her initial statement, days after Zarutska's death, did not identify the victim but focused on the suspect, homelessness and mental illness.
    


            “First and foremost, my thoughts and prayers go out to the young women's family and friends. This is a tragic situation that sheds light on problems with society safety nets related to mental healthcare and the systems that should be in place,” Lyles' initial statement said.
    


            “While I do not know the specifics of the man's medical record, what I have come to understand is that he has long struggled with mental health and appears to have suffered a crisis,” the mayor said.
    


            “I want to be clear that I am not villainizing those who struggle with their mental health or those who are unhoused,” she continued. “Also, those who are unhoused are more frequently the victim of crimes and not the perpetrators. … We, as a community, must do better for those members of our community who need help and have no place to go.”
    


New polls find broad partisan divide over Trump's approach to crime



            The mayor identified the victim in a social media post more than a week later.
    


            “The video of the heartbreaking attack that took Iryna Zarutska's life is now public. I want to thank our media partners and community members who have chosen not to repost or share the footage out of respect for Iryna's family,” the Democratic mayor wrote Saturday.
    


            “Like so many of you, I'm heartbroken – and I've been thinking hard about what safety really looks like in our city. I remain committed to doing all we can to protect our residents and ensure Charlotte is a place where everyone feels safe.”
    


            US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy lambasted the mayor's response.
    


            “Charlotte's Mayor doesn't want the media to show you the ugly truth. Why? Because she and other public officials in her city bear responsibility,” Duffy posted on X on Sunday.
    


            Duffy also slammed local authorities, citing the suspect's criminal record.
    


            “By failing to properly punish him, Charlotte failed Iryna Zarutska and North Carolinians.”
    


            Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, posted about the stabbing on social media and blasted major media organizations for what he described as a lack of coverage.
    


            In the first half of this year, “Charlotte experienced a 25% reduction in violent crime, which includes homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults, encompassing shootings,” the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said.
    


            Overall crime has decreased 8%, the department said.
    


Trump's crime crackdown is also his midterm sales pitch



            The data, released in July, compares violent crime from January through June 2025 with the same period last year.
    


            “I am incredibly proud of our patrol officers, who are in our neighborhoods daily, engaging with the community, observing suspicious activity and providing our detectives with the crucial information needed to arrest violent offenders,” Deputy Chief Ryan Butler said in July.
    


            Zarutska was stabbed in Charlotte's South End, a neighborhood that was transformed into an area of high-end apartments, restaurants, shops and breweries – fueled by the 2007 debut of the light rail system.
    


            Despite her youth, Zarutska was already an accomplished artist who quickly became fluent in English.
    


            “Iryna graduated from Synergy College in Kyiv with a degree in Art and Restoration,” her obituary states. “She shared her creativity generously, gifting family and friends with her artwork. She loved sculpting and designing unique, eclectic clothing that reflected her vibrant spirit.”
    


            Zarutska “also had a deep love for animals” and wanted to become a veterinary assistant. “She often cared for her neighbors' pets, and many fondly remember seeing her walking them through the neighborhood, always with her radiant smile,” the tribute states.
    


            She attended Rowan-Cabarrus Community College from 2023 to 2025, a spokesperson told CNN.
    


            “We are heartbroken to hear about the death of one of our former students, Iryna Zarutska, whose life was taken in this tragic event,” the spokesperson said.
    


            She was also a beloved coworker at Zepeddie's Pizzeria.
    


            “We lost not only an incredible employee, but a true friend,” the restaurant posted on social media. “Iryna, we miss you more than words can say.”
    


            Despite the horrors of her home country, Zarutska “just had a heart of gold,” a family friend told WCNC.
    


            “She was always very helpful, very supportive,” said the friend, identified only as Lonnie. “She was a sweetheart. And it makes me sick to think that she's gone.”
    


            Lonnie described the daily bombing in Ukraine that Zarutska and the agony of not knowing “if you're going to live or breathe another day.”
    


            Zarutska found refuge in Charlotte, only to lose her life there.
    


            “It's very, very sickening and sad that we have such evil in our society today,” Lonnie said.
    


            Zarutska is survived by her parents, two siblings and her life partner.

CHICAGO (AP) — As President Donald Trump threatens to expand immigration raids and deploy the National Guard, Chicago has become the latest flashpoint in a broader national struggle over how far the federal government can push local authorities to cooperate with its immigration agenda. 

For the Chicago Police Department, the challenge is acute. The force must preserve public safety in a city already under strain while avoiding the appearance of working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities, a stance that could erode community trust and ignite new protests.

The same balancing act has confronted other big-city departments in recent months. Local police in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., were drawn into fraught arrangements with federal agencies that experts say left residents wary and, at times, undermined public confidence in their police.

Now, Chicago finds itself on the same path, with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker objecting to any National Guard deployment and city officials bracing for how the added federal presence could reshape the dynamic on the ground. The outcome, policing experts warn, may determine whether Chicago police can maintain credibility in immigrant communities likely to be targeted by a president determined to show force.

“What the Trump administration is doing here is engaging in federal policing in a way that really rips at the seams of the relationships between state and local police and the federal government, between communities and law enforcement,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council. “Those kinds of standoffs and contentious practices is what erodes public safety.”

Over the course of the Trump administration's immigration surges, Chicago officials repeatedly reaffirmed the city's so-called sanctuary policies that have been place for four decades. But as fear grew about looming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, the city's mayor has avoided detail about how local police will navigate tensions on the ground. 

Chicago's policies bar local law enforcement from asking about or detaining someone for their immigration status or from supporting ICE, including by securing perimeters for raids, transporting detainees or sharing information about undocumented immigrants.

Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order last week declaring city police would not collaborate with federal immigration agents. It also requires Chicago officers to wear uniforms and not wear masks to “clearly distinguish them from federal agents.”

“We will not have our police officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,” Johnson said before signing the order.

Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said any cooperation between ICE and local officers hurts public trust and blurs the lines between agencies.

“It can get really messy,” Futterman said. “There's how sanctuary cities are supposed to work on paper vs. what happens in practice.”

Gupta said Chicago police will have to coordinate with federal agencies to some degree, even to respond to protests against immigration raids and detentions. 

In the meantime, city officials say they're following a similar strategy to policing as the one in place around the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which cost the city about $27 million in officer overtime. 

ICE detained at least 10 Chicagoans at an immigration office on June 4, drawing dozens of protesters and local elected officials to the street outside. Police didn't originally know it was an immigration action and left after realizing that, officials said.

Some protesters and local elected officials claimed they saw Chicago officers clearing the way for ICE agents and protecting their vehicles. Chicago City Council members demanded an internal probe into officers' behavior.

Similar tensions played out in California, where hundreds of protesters clashed with federal immigration authorities in June, prompting Trump to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, despite the objections of local authorities.

Los Angeles police made hundreds of arrests and dispersed demonstrations, including at locations where ICE agents were conducting raids. 

Sanctuary city policies “don't mean a local police officer will stand in between an ICE officer and a non-citizen,” which would be considered an obstruction of justice, said Rose Cuison-Villazor, a professor at Rutgers University Law School. 

But whether local officers step in if they disagree with federal agents' interactions with protesters is also uncertain.

“Do they have the power to intervene?” Futterman asked. “These are really difficult legal questions. It's a really fraught situation.”

Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Washington D.C.-based think tank the Police Executive Research Forum, said local police leaders are used to working with federal authorities including joint task forces aimed at terrorism, drugs or organized crime. But if the National Guard is deployed in Chicago, its role in performing local policing hasn't been clearly defined.

On Thursday, the District of Columbia sued to stop President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard during his law enforcement intervention there.

“As far as the National Guard as police, they have traditionally assisted in natural disasters, large scale disturbances and aiding law enforcement in support functions like traffic and crowd control,” Wexler said. “I don't recall the National Guard being deployed to deal directly with day-to-day crime issues.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling has asked for more communication from federal authorities so “we don't have people running scared and it doesn't create chaos on our streets.”

In Philadelphia, District Attorney Larry Krasner says the Trump administration's use of the National Guard is a threat to successful prosecutions of crime, risking witness statements being thrown out and evidence suppressed.

“None of these people are trained in evidence gathering procedures,” Krasner said. “None of them are trained in Miranda warnings. None of them are trained in Fourth Amendment rights and procedures and illegal searches and seizures.”

Kenneth Corey, a former department chief with the New York City Police Department, warned that surging resources like the National Guard leads to an artificial and often temporary reduction in crime.

“Any time you surge resources like that you are going to see an immediate reduction in crime because it has a deterrent effect,” said Corey, who now works at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy. 

“But the problem is it's short-lived. It can't be sustained. When they leave, crime returns. You haven't addressed the root causes of crime.”

There are more than 200 mosquito species in the country — but just a few to worry about.

There are more than 200 species of mosquitoes in the United States, but only a handful are known to be dangerous to humans because of the diseases they carry.

When the conditions are right, swarms of these bloodsuckers can fill the air, ruining picnics, ball games, and campsites. But now, the concern for mosquito-borne disease threats is rising. While a mosquito bite may have long been merely an itchy inconvenience, getting bitten today could be much more serious.

The good news is mosquitoes aren't indestructible monsters; a well-aimed finger flick can end one forever. Most live just a few weeks and rarely venture more than a few miles from where they're born. They aren't fans of the cold — most mosquitoes stop biting when temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Freezing temperatures can kill off adult mosquitoes, though their eggs can survive until the next warm season.

Most of us in the US haven't needed to worry too much about vector-borne disease threats. Here, diseases such as malaria and yellow fever have dropped in the rankings as public health threats over the 20th century with concerted efforts to keep them in check.

But this progress is fragile — and it's time to be on the lookout.

Dangerous mosquitoes are starting to regain ground. Temperatures are rising on average due to climate change. That is opening up new habitats for these bloodsuckers while making them more vivacious in places where they're already established. In general, the ranges of the mosquito species we need to be most worried about in the United States are expanding northward. Newer invasive mosquito species that arrived as stowaways are also setting up shop across the country. It's not just the geographic range — warmer temperatures are allowing mosquitoes to survive at higher elevations, too.

Mosquitoes are also very sensitive to humidity and rainfall. They need water to lay their eggs and for their larvae to mature, and the climate is changing in rather unfortunate ways in this regard, too; more extreme rainfall events are creating the standing water conditions that are ideal breeding grounds for some of the more dangerous disease carriers.

Humans have also stacked the deck in mosquitoes' favor. Deforestation and ecosystem losses mean that there are fewer natural mosquito predators like bats and birds to keep a lid on their numbers, while urbanization — with its more impervious roads, sidewalks, and parking lots — creates more places where water can pool and mosquitoes can breed. International travel is also much more feasible these days, and more people are heading back and forth from places where mosquito-borne diseases are more common. If enough travelers get infected abroad and return home to the US, they can become the seeds for local disease outbreaks as mosquitoes spread the pathogens among their neighbors. Newer diseases like chikungunya and Zika have started to make inroads into the country as well.

There are seven key mosquitoes worth tracking in the US that have benefited from these changes and are known to transmit some of the most common and dangerous infections. These are some of the biters you're most likely to see and could be the ones that make you sick.

Containing mosquitoes requires a coordinated strategy between cities, states, and the federal government to anticipate where they're going and quench outbreaks. But knowing which mosquitoes are around you can help you track the potential threats in your neighborhood and take steps to protect yourself from annoying bites — or worse.

In the grand scheme of things, it's actually uncommon for a given mosquito to spread any kind of disease at all. First, she — only female mosquitoes bite — has to draw blood from a host that is already carrying a pathogen.

The pathogen — whether a bacterium, virus, or parasite — has to then be able to survive inside the mosquito, replicate, and make its way to her salivary glands. The mosquito then has to bite another uninfected host to transmit the germ. So, the spread of mosquito-borne disease is a numbers game, a function of how many mosquitoes and how many infected hosts are around.

In America's growing urban and suburban centers, there are a lot of opportunities.

But because so many factors have to fall in line, it's hard to predict outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease. Perfect temperature and rainfall conditions might create a bumper crop of mosquitoes, but if there are no infected animals or people around, there won't be any transmission. Still, more favorable conditions for mosquitoes increase the odds that a disease will spread. Figuring out which ones are spreading and what infections they might be carrying can help health officials determine what kinds of pesticides to use, where they should target spraying, what kinds of repellents are effective, and the symptoms individuals should try to identify.

Right now, West Nile virus is the biggest mosquito-borne threat in the US. The virus was first detected in the US in 1999. Birds like crows are its main host. This disease causes headaches, fever, and body aches, though most people don't develop symptoms at all. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1,200 people in the US develop severe illness from the virus annually, which ends up killing more than 120 people per year.

Mosquitoes from the Culex genus are the main vectors for West Nile virus and can be found throughout the country, though different species have regional specialties. They can also carry St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern equine encephalitis, rare but dangerous diseases that can cause fatal brain infections. They tend to bite in the evening and at night, and they're often found in urban areas.

Here are the seven types of mosquitoes to watch out for. Before (or maybe after) you swat one, take a look and see if you can identify the species. And remember: It's only the females in each of these insects that you need to worry about, and that gives you a great starting point for narrowing in on potential threats. In general, female mosquitoes are larger than males and males tend to have bushy, feathery antennae, while females have straight, unadorned antennae.

Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, originated in Europe but is now found on every continent except Antarctica. It's a brown-colored mosquito, between 4 and 10 millimeters long, around the size of the nail on your little finger.



Culex quinquefasciatus, the southern house mosquito, looks similar to Culex pipiens and can cross-breed with it, though it tends to prefer warmer climates. Its name, “quinquefasciatus” in Latin, means “five bands” and refers to the five black stripes across its abdomen.



Culex tarsalis, the Western Encephalitis mosquito, is much more prevalent in the Western US, especially in wetlands and areas with irrigated farms. It has distinct black and white bands on its legs and a white band on its proboscis.



Mosquitoes from the Anopheles genus were once some of the deadliest insects in the US, because they spread the parasite that causes malaria in humans. The disease was a scourge for much of US history until a national campaign of insecticide spraying and destroying mosquito breeding sites drove down infection rates. Malaria was declared eliminated in the US in 1951, but the Anopheles mosquitoes that spread it are still around and rebounding. In 2023, the US saw the first locally acquired cases of malaria in 20 years in Florida and in Texas.

Anopheles mosquitoes have a pair of long appendages called palpi on either side of their proboscis, giving their heads a distinctive trident. They are often found resting with their abdomens pointing in the air and are about 5 millimeters long, less than a quarter inch.

Anopheles freeborni, the western malaria mosquito, is brownish-black with spotted wings. It tends to be found in rural areas in the West, breeding in ditches and culverts with vegetation in states like California, Oregon, and Arizona.



Anopheles quadrimaculatus, the common malaria mosquito, is mainly found in the Eastern US. The name “quadrimaculatus” refers to the four dark spots often found on its wings.



The Aedes genus can spread a variety of viruses, including the pathogens behind yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika, and dengue, which sickens almost 100 million people around the world each year. These mosquitoes are notorious container breeders, meaning they only need tiny pools of water — such as in flower pots, old tires, or bottle caps — to reproduce. That's why they're so prevalent on the margins of urban development and why they're so difficult to control.

Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, has white stripes on its thorax in the shape of a lyre, and it likes to bite people indoors.



Aedes Albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, has a striking black and white stripe coloration (hence “tiger”). It's a daytime biter and can reach 10 millimeters in length. It likely arrived in the US in 1985 and now has a foothold in most of the country.



Again, a lot of things have to align to ignite a mosquito-borne disease outbreak, but the US is becoming more hospitable to the insects that spread some of the most worrying illnesses. Mosquito-borne diseases are often spotted in travelers returning from areas like the tropics where these illnesses are endemic, but in recent years, the US has seen cases of them spread to people who haven't been abroad.

With warmer average temperatures, mosquitoes have longer breeding seasons as spring starts earlier and summer ends later. Their reproductive cycles accelerate, as well, so more generations can arise in a season. Pathogens also replicate faster inside the mosquitoes when it's warmer, increasing the likelihood that a bite will lead to an infection.

However, the various mosquito species all have slightly different preferences for their environments. Some like the fast-paced city life and flourish in places like potholes and garbage dumps, while others prefer the idyllic country life with its ponds, ditches, and ample vegetation. Some are more tolerant of the cold (to a point). Some mosquitoes will venture miles, while others will spend their whole lives across just a couple of city blocks.

Depending on how much average temperatures continue to rise, the suitable range for each mosquito species will look different. Even under a scenario where humanity's greenhouse gas emissions eventually taper off and global temperatures stabilize by the end of the century, it will still be warmer than it was, and most disease-spreading mosquitoes will have a much larger tolerable range across the US.

The upside is that researchers can anticipate these changes to the environment, producing early warnings of where the vector-borne disease threat is going to get worse and the new places where it may emerge. Health departments can begin surveillance to proactively find out which mosquitoes are present and what pathogens they're carrying.

From there, they can deploy interventions like preventing water accumulation or spraying targeted pesticides. The growing range of mosquitoes also makes a compelling case for preserving habitats for mosquito-eaters like bats to control their numbers. In the long term, humanity needs to limit greenhouse gas emissions to slow changes in the climate. Mosquito-borne diseases are a threat, but they can be managed with good planning. Otherwise, there will be more dangerous infections buzzing over the horizon.

More than a decade ago, Alaska bush pilot Ken Jouppi was on a routine run from Fairbanks to the tiny village of Beaver, carrying a passenger and her groceries. What he didn't know was that tucked inside the passenger's suitcases were three cases of beer and a six-pack.

The problem? Residents voted in 2004 to outlaw alcohol entirely in Beaver. The alcohol was discovered during a search by state troopers prior to takeoff, and Jouppi was charged with a misdemeanor. Even though the beer wasn't his, Jouppi was convicted as a bootlegger by a jury of his peers. The trial judge, who noted Jouppi had “a stellar [clean] criminal record,” handed him the minimum sentence the law allowed for a first-time offender: a $1,500 fine, another $1,500 assessed against his company, and a three-day jail term.

Now, $3,000 and three days in jail for a six-pack of beer might sound crazy, but the story gets stranger.

For the past 13 years, prosecutors have been attempting to take Jouppi's Cessna U206D, an aircraft worth about $95,000, as forfeit. And the state has been winning. In April, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the prosecutors did not violate the Constitution's excessive fines clause when they seized Jouppi's plane.

“We hold, as a matter of law, that the owner of the airplane failed to establish that forfeiture would be unconstitutionally excessive,” Justice Jude Pate wrote on behalf of a unanimous court. “Forfeiture of the airplane constituted a fine within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause, and … the forfeiture is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of the harm caused by the offense.”

The court based its decision on a two-part test stretching back to United States v. Bajakajian, a 1998 ruling that involved a man named Hosep Bajakajian who was traveling from the United States to Cyprus when he was, ahem, liberated of $357,144 because he failed to report the money to U.S. Customs.

A trial court ruled the forfeiture was “grossly disproportionate” to Bajakajian's “crime,” and the Supreme Court agreed, ruling that the government violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on excessive fines.

Apparently, however, seizing a man's airplane over a passenger's six-pack of Budweiser was not an excessive fine in the eyes of members of the Alaska Supreme Court. (One can only wonder if they would have agreed with such a ruling if they were on the receiving end of such a verdict, which stripped an 82-year-old man of his plane and his livelihood.) 

Fortunately, the Institute for Justice took up Jouppi's case and appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, noting that the Alaska decision ran afoul of various precedents in the excessive fines clause.

“The Excessive Fines Clause of the Constitution was built for cases like this,” said Sam Gedge, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice.

One can only hope that the Supreme Court hears the case and brings justice to Jouppi, whose experience reveals a terrifying reality in modern America: local governments routinely steal from people under the pretense of “law enforcement.”

Many Americans have no idea how widespread civil asset forfeiture is, in large part because law enforcement tends to target marginalized people who lack the resources to fight back in court.

In her groundbreaking article on the subject, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Sarah Stillman notes that the primary victims of the practice tend to be low-income individuals, immigrants, and people of color. Stillman's reporting reveals that the practice involves routinely seizing property from people who aren't even charged with a crime, let alone convicted; yet many of them lack the will or funds to fight back in court.

I read Stillman's article when it was first published in the New Yorker in 2012, which happened to be the same year Alaska came after Jouppi's Cessna. It terrified me.

When the 19th-century economist Frédéric Bastiat wrote about legalized plunder and the perversion of the law, taxation naturally comes to mind. Civil asset forfeiture is something different. It's a rougher, darker form of legal plunder, closer to legalized highway robbery than to the cold hand of tax collection.

Civil asset forfeiture strikes at the very heart of the Constitution, a document that spells out not what the government must do for you but all the things the government cannot do to you — like take your stuff through excessive fines.

Jouppi deserves to keep his airplane. But this case isn't just about him, and he knows it.

EX-BIDEN OFFICIALS SIT FOR SENATE INTERVIEWS ON APPARENT MENTAL DECLINE

“I'm in my 80s now, and I've been fighting this for over a decade because I see it as my duty to ensure that the Bill of Rights actually means something,” Jouppi said.

Chief Justice John Roberts, I hope you're listening.

This small Texas city is leading the country's response.

BROWNSVILLE, Texas — How do you capture the deadliest animal on Earth, one that has been responsible for the death of more people than any other species in history? Here at America's southern border, it's not with high-tech weaponry, but with a black plastic tub of stinky water tucked under a bush.

Surrounded by tall, yellowing grass near a sports complex, the bait water reeks of damp soil and decaying vegetation. And on top of the basin is the trap: a gray toolbox with a small battery-powered fan sucking air into a mesh net.

This simple, humble device is called a gravid trap and its fetid smell is meant to mimic the ideal breeding site for mosquitoes. On a recent, humid Texas summer day with triple-digits on the thermometer, it proved to be very effective: Ensnared inside are dozens of mosquitoes, many ready to lay eggs.

Collecting mosquitoes from traps and looking for larvae in roadside ditches isn't an activity you'll find in South Texas tourism brochures. But for Brownsville officials like Yaziri Gonzalez, 32, it's one of the more important — and enjoyable — parts of the job of understanding the extent of mosquito-borne threats. To lay eggs, mosquitoes have to drink blood, so if they can be captured right before they breed, she can find out what they've been biting, and potentially, what diseases they're spreading.

The diseases these insects may carry have left an indelible mark on history and culture, here in the US and in the world. Malaria has been around for as long as people walked on two feet, and it still infects around 250 million people per year and kills more than 600,000. Yellow fever infects about 200,000 people around the world annually, causing around 30,000 deaths.

These diseases prompted the creation (and popularity) of gin and tonic cocktails, shaped the construction of the Panama Canal, and even influenced the outcome of the Civil War. Mosquito-borne diseases like malaria used to infect tens of thousands of people in the US each year, and in regions like the Tennessee River Valley, almost one-third of residents were infected. Mosquitoes are humanity's blood tax collectors.

Right now, most of the devastation from infections transmitted by mosquitoes is in developing countries. In much of the US, mosquitoes are mostly just a buzzy, itchy nuisance.

It took decades of painstaking public health work in the US to control disease-carrying insects, reshaping the landscape and using blunt tactics like draining swamps, cutting down forests, and recklessly spraying pesticides like DDT, whose effects we're still dealing with.

Continuing to keep these diseases away demands constant vigilance, but the country's success in diminishing mosquito-borne disease has pushed surveillance down the list of public health priorities, and few health departments are investing the resources to keep tabs on these bloodsuckers. Laying traps, collecting them a day or two later, cataloging the insects, running genetic tests to identify pathogens, collating the data, and preparing a counteroffensive is difficult, tedious work, and Gonzalez is one of just a handful of experts in the whole country doing this job full time, and Brownsville is one of the few cities willing to invest in her work.

That's because Brownsville, a city of 190,000 people on the US-Mexico border, can't afford to be complacent.

Every day, thousands of people — potential hosts — cross back and forth by car and on foot from Brownsville and the Mexican city of Matamoros to go to school, to work, or to the doctor, in addition to unauthorized border crossings. For some residents, the towering border fence is their backyard fence.

Brownsville's location has made it a sentinel for the US-wide rise in vector-borne disease driven by travel, urbanization, and a warming climate — and the city's efforts to stay ahead of the threats are uncommonly robust because it's where all these factors collide. “We usually get the first of everything and anything,” Gonzalez said.

It's good for the rest of the US that a city like Brownsville is leading the resistance. Vector-borne illnesses are starting to erupt further inland as changes in the environment and human movement overwhelm our past efforts to contain mosquitoes. Over the past 20 years, the number of reported vector-borne disease cases in the US has doubled and shows no signs of slowing down, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mosquitoes are a fact of nature, but the evolving threats they pose are a consequence of how humanity has reshaped the environment, and how that environment in turn is changing us. “We're blaming the mosquito, but honestly, it's the humans who are bringing the diseases from other countries,” said Arturo Rodriguez, Brownsville's director of health, wellness and animal services. “Now you have a greater presence of mosquitoes because of the warmer temperatures, and you're going to end up with an outbreak in parts of the world that probably would never have seen it before.”

In an overgrown lot in a residential neighborhood dotted with illegally dumped mattresses and furniture, Gonzalez checks another type of mosquito trap. This one is a bucket-sized collapsible cylinder, like a laundry hamper, and is meant to look for biters.

Its lure is meant to well, smell like us.

It essentially imitates the scent of a person after a hard workout on a hot day, emitting carbon dioxide and the smell of lactic acid. Our most dangerous adversaries, it turns out, see us merely as carbon-spewing bowls of sweat. “Everyone smells different, and that's why some people get attacked more than others,” Gonzalez said with a shrug. (The lure's manufacturer offers a line of scents designed to attract even the most discerning mosquitoes.)

Back in 2016, Brownsville reported some of the earliest known cases of local transmission of the Zika virus in the US, meaning it wasn't found in people coming back from a trip, but in residents who caught it locally. Zika virus disease is a heartbreaking infection spread by Aedes mosquitoes, a collection of species that thrives in tiny pools of water near where people live. In pregnant people, the disease can cause serious birth defects, including infants born with shrunken heads. In total, there were 26 Zika cases reported in 2016 in Cameron County, where Brownsville is located, and 315 cases across Texas.

The prospect of the virus taking root in Brownsville alarmed residents and city officials and shocked the community into action. City health officials began to build up a mosquito surveillance program to try to find dangerous diseases before they start infecting people. “Zika, for us, was the big moment,” said Rodriguez, Brownsville's public health director.

Gonzalez joined the team in October 2020, fresh out of grad school, and just in time to put her skills to the test. “I literally had just defended my thesis that Wednesday, and by the next Thursday, I was already dealing with four cases of suspected dengue,” Gonzalez said.

Dengue continues to lurk in the Rio Grande Valley. Last year, Cameron Country reported a locally transmitted case of dengue.

Gonzalez now regularly deploys and checks a network of traps across neighborhoods, industrial areas, and roadsides. The city has a hotline where residents can report mosquito infestations and request spraying, especially if they know which species is buzzing around. The health department also tracks potential vector-borne infections. That data then feeds into mapping software that can identify potential hot spots and coordinate mosquito control measures across the city.

Alexis de la Cruz, a public health analyst for the city of Brownsville, told me that officials can see where citizens have asked for insecticide treatments, identified potential breeding sites, or found mosquito larvae. Using GPS, de la Cruz can track the routes of spraying trucks and where anti-vector treatments like mosquito dunks have been deployed.

The data tracking has revealed some surprises. “People think neighborhoods that are low income are going to have the worst mosquitoes, but people in really nice neighborhoods also have really bad mosquito problems because they water their lawns a lot,” de la Cruz said. “All of that water goes into the storm drains and that water is just easier to breed in.”

Read our field guide for identifying the species across the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes genuses — featuring quick-reference cards, just like this one:



Applying mosquito controls is already a complicated and expensive process. Hard as it may be to believe, most mosquitoes aren't harmful — even if they do leave us pretty itchy. In the US, there are more than 200 mosquito species, but only a dozen are known to spread disease. And of those, there are just three main genuses to worry about: Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes — and seven key species among them.

Many of the chemicals used to spray for mosquitoes aren't precise and can kill off valuable insects like bees and butterflies, or harm humans and their pets. Mosquitoes can also become desensitized to certain pesticides over time. So city workers have to be very precise with spraying to stay within their budget and limit collateral damage.

Plus, the most dangerous mosquito species are cagey, hiding away during the day and creeping back out at dusk to bite. While the temperatures can get too hot even for mosquitoes to get on our nerves, they know how to lay low. Unfortunately, “they don't spontaneously combust,” Gonzalez lamented.

All of this is taking place against an environment that is becoming more hospitable to mosquitoes. Brownsville, like much of the US, is getting warmer, and mosquitoes prosper in the heat, breeding faster and for a longer duration. The region is also poised to suffer more bouts of severe rainfall thanks to climate change. Sudden deluges can create pools and puddles that make ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes; some mosquitoes, like those from the Aedes genus, don't need much and can breed in a bottle cap filled with standing water. Expanding suburban sprawl plays a role as well. Losing natural habitats means there are fewer natural mosquito predators like bats and birds around — allowing mosquitoes to creep in closer and in greater numbers.

New neighborhoods are going up around Brownsville, which means lots more paved surfaces and retention ponds — essentially creating little island chains where water can stagnate and mosquitoes can jump from one region to another. “Brownsville is growing so fast,” Gonzalez said. “In the past year, we have about 48 miles of new subdivision, which is insane. That is very hard to keep up when you are only nine people trying to cover the entire city.”

The city has also seen a change in its demographics as migrants pass through and new residents move in. There have been more asylum-seekers coming through the city from regions like Central America or even further in recent years. Just 30 minutes from the Gulf Coast, Brownsville is also a popular staging area for vacationers. It's also just inland from Starbase, SpaceX's rocket launch facility. Brownsville has a rising profile as a birdwatching destination, particularly for migratory birds like the Redhead duck and the Blue-winged Teal.

With the city's changing landscape and with more people moving in and passing through, Brownville health officials are staying on their toes about new infections taking root and spreading. But there's only so much the city can do on its own when surveillance is so spotty in neighboring regions, across the border, and throughout the country. “We have a limited view,” Gonzalez said.

Surveillance is only the first step in limiting the spread of vector-borne disease. Brownsville used to have to send suspected infected mosquitoes to the Texas Department of State Health Services in Austin for testing, but now they have a modular laboratory where they can do the work in-house, speeding up the turnaround time. In a white shipping container kitted out with a PCR machine, a microscope, a computer, a super cold freezer, and a super cold AC, Gonzalez documents the mosquitoes she's collected and grinds a few of them up to be tested for diseases.

Once a mosquito tests positive or a resident falls ill, city health officials work to trace the geographic epicenter of the outbreak. They begin spraying insecticides in the area tailored to a specific vector species. Workers comb the area, dumping small pools of standing water and treating larger water pockets with larvacides. They also talk to local residents and advise them on how to keep mosquitoes out. This whole process of spaying, dumping water, treatment, and communication can last weeks. During that time, city workers like Gonzalez continue to set up traps and patrol the city with F-150 pickup trucks outfitted with noisy insecticide sprayers and air conditioners powerful enough to keep up with the South Texas sun.

It's a time-consuming, labor-intensive process. And it's expensive. Each mosquito trap can cost up to $300, a PCR machine to confirm the presence of a disease can cost $15,000, and the salary of a specialist like Gonzalez adds even more to the bill, on top of the other city workers roped in to help with a mosquito outbreak response. Gonzalez is one of three full-time staffers on the vector control team, and the program has an annual operations budget of $400,000. Three-quarters of the budget goes toward buying chemicals and maintaining equipment, and these costs are rising.

That's why few cities have followed Brownsville's lead in developing their own in-house mosquito surveillance and response system — it's a big, ongoing expense to deal with a threat that may not materialize for a long time. But that means help may not be readily available when dengue or West Nile cases suddenly start piling up.

“We have one state entomologist and everyone thinks because she's available that she's going to be able to respond to an outbreak, and it's not the case,” Gonzalez said. “She's going to be spread super thin.”

Truly containing vector-borne disease requires a multipronged strategy, and there's only so much city officials can do on their own. Jose Campo Maldonado, an infectious disease physician at the University of Texas Health Rio Grande Valley, said he's trying to educate his fellow doctors and patients about their role in dealing with infections spread by mosquitoes. Health workers are getting better at recognizing potential symptoms of vector-borne disease, but “there is room for improvement,” Campo Maldonado said. One of the challenges is that vector-borne diseases don't always present on their own; they often occur in people who are facing other health problems like heart disease or diabetes, so they can be tricky to recognize and treat.

Many patients, on the other hand, have unstable living situations that leave them more vulnerable to getting bitten, or they can't afford treatments. “It's really hot outside, and sometimes it's hard to follow some of the recommendations like using long sleeves,” Campo Maldonado said. Fixing this requires more community outreach as well as efforts to improve housing and access to healthcare.

Containing diseases like yellow fever and chikungunya in the US also requires coordination across the country. “I really see this as a national security matter,” said Christopher Romero, a health researcher in Brownsville.

The US can't take its historical victories against vector-borne disease for granted, Romero said. It takes active, sustained work to keep these illnesses out and prevent new ones from coming in. Old foes like yellow fever and malaria can still come roaring back. “When you're dealing with combating pathogens whose evolutionary clock works at a faster pace than humanity, we always will be dealing with an evolving landscape of threats,” Romero said.

Though some of the old tactics that helped the US push vector-borne disease to the margins in the 20th century aren't viable now, there's a whole new suite of tools available that Brownsville is trying out: mosquito surveillance, less harmful and more targeted insecticides, disease risk forecasting models, and more.

“We don't look away from the problem; we realize it's here and we try to address it,” Rodriguez said.

Now, it's time for the rest of the country to take notice.

            South Korea is dispatching its top diplomat to the United States as it tries to prevent swirling discontent over an immigration raid at a factory in Georgia from ballooning into a crisis that could do long-term damage to relations with its most important ally.
    


            Foreign Affairs Minister Cho Hyun was scheduled to leave Monday evening local time for Washington, DC, officials in Seoul said.
    


            Hours earlier, the government announced that some 300 South Koreans who were detained in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid last Thursday on the Hyundai-LG joint factory in southern Georgia will return to Korea on a chartered flight following negotiations with the US.
    


            A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the chartered plane schedule has not been set yet, but the government is trying to bring back the nationals as soon as possible.
    


            The raid was one of the largest by US immigration enforcement agencies in recent years. Images of workers, many of them Korean, being shackled and led away into detention have circulated widely across South Korea and sparked criticism at a time when the country is pouring multi-billion-dollar investments into the US, much of it at the behest of US President Donald Trump.
    


            Last month South Korea business heavyweights including Korean Air and Hyundai unveiled multibillion-dollar deals in the United States following the summit between the two countries' leaders.
    


            The plant in Georgia, which is supposed to be operating next year, is a massive investment for the state and projected to employ up to 8,500 people when complete.
    


            What the foreign minister's role in the process would be was unclear, but the government of President Lee Jae Myung was trying to quickly contain simmering discontent in the country about how its nationals were being treated by US law enforcement.
    


Hear how South Koreans are reacting to Georgia immigration raid



            The spokesperson for the opposition People Power Party – a conservative party that usually speaks favorably of the US – called the raid “an unprecedented diplomatic disaster.”
    


            “This is the United States expressing its diplomatic dissatisfaction with South Korea in the strongest possible way,” said spokesperson Song Eon-seog, adding that Lee “must clearly explain where this diplomatic breakdown began.”
    


            Kim Jae-yeon, South Korea's Progressive Party leader, called the raid “a breach of trust.”
    


            “President Trump should apologize for what happened and promise measures to prevent recurrence,” Kim said.
    


            Thursday's raid was still the top story on a range of South Korean newspapers and websites on Monday morning, with stories questioning Washington's treatment of South Korean nationals and whether business and diplomatic relations could suffer permanent damage.
    


            But the blowback from the raid appears to go deeper than business deals, with some seeing it as an affront to a bilaterial friendship forged over more than seven decades since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
    


            “Seeing our own people being mercilessly detained and put into detention centers in a country we regard as a friend was truly painful,” said a visiting professor of business at a South Korean university who asked not to be named.
    


            “This could have been my family, myself, or even my friends, and I felt a strong sense of unfairness,” the professor said.
    


            The images even caused shock among die-hard supporters of the US.
    


            It is not unusual to see conservative protesters in Soth Korea waving US flags at demonstrations for various causes.
    


            Song Seok-ha, 67, who has been protesting every day for five years near the US Embassy in Seoul to call for a stronger US-South Korea alliance, was concerned about long-term damage to relations.
    


            “I can understand if the US is deporting illegal immigrants, but this time it seemed too extreme… I'm worried this might put a crack in the US-South Korea alliance,” he said.
    


            It's unclear what kind of visas the Korean nationals working at the plant had. Some of the 475 detained entered the US illegally, according to Steven Schrank, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge, while others had overstayed their visas.
    


            Others were in here under the US Visa Waiver Program which allows workers to travel for tourism or business for up to 90 days, and had subsequently been prohibited from working.
    


            Georgia immigration attorney Charles Kuck told CNN two of his clients were detained at the raid after having arrived from South Korea under a visa waiver. One client arrived in the US in August, and the other arrived several weeks ago, he said.
    


            While none of the Korean nationals worked for Hyundai, about 50 of them worked for LG Energy Solutions. Another 250 mostly Korean national employees worked for HL-GA Battery Company LLC, which operates under Hyundai and LG.
    


            In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for LG Energy Solution said the company was cooperating with the process: “We will commit our best efforts to ensure the safe and prompt return of our employees and those of our partners.”
    


            When asked Monday about the visa status of the detained workers, the company told CNN, “The visa status of the detained individuals is under investigation, so we don't know yet.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Hyundai for comment.

            Add this to the list of Donald Trump's accomplishments: Helping elect a socialist mayor of New York City.
    


            That's the assessment from many politicians and operatives in the president's hometown after a chaotic week of White House intervention, between Trump talking repeatedly about the candidates and his aides discussing an ambassadorship or other jobs with Mayor Eric Adams to get him to leave the race. Trump allies want to consolidate support for Andrew Cuomo against Zohran Mamdani, the state assemblyman and democratic socialist whom Trump has labeled a “communist.”
    


            Adams is still in the race. Cuomo's opponents are tying the former governor closer to Trump in a city where Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans. And Mamdani and his aides are savoring what they see as another bit of good luck.
    


            Support has picked up for the Democratic nominee, as have endorsements and media attention. Mamdani, joined by independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, had to have a collection of campaign aides and union members use a red, white and blue rope to form a perimeter around him as he marched up Fifth Avenue on Saturday morning for New York's Labor Day parade, which is held the Saturday after Labor Day.
    


            They even marched by Trump Tower, where they cheered and applauded the perennial protesters across the street, though they did not stop to engage.
    


            “The specialty of Donald Trump and his puppets is lots of noise and very few results, but what we've seen over the past few weeks is just how fixated the president is on doing everything in his power to stop our campaign from getting to City Hall,” Mamdani told CNN after his energetic town hall at Brooklyn College with Sanders on Saturday night. “And he's doing that because he knows that while we share the same diagnosis of a cost-of-living crisis in this city and across this country, unlike him and his movement, we will actually do something about it.”
    


            Adams marched in the same parade as Mamdani without any campaign staff with him. He wore a white collared shirt embroidered with “Eric Adams” in script in the front and “MAYOR” in big letters on the back, along with a blue cap that read “MAYOR ADAMS.”
    


            Some around Cuomo believe that Adams will soon drop out even after the mayor summoned reporters on Friday to label Cuomo a “snake” with a history of undercutting Black politicians.
    


            He turned zen when asked by CNN on Saturday what New York voters should make of him and the talk he might not finish the race, then turned that zen into an attack.
    


            “It's life. Life is twists and turns,” Adams said. “It's unfortunate that those who are running have not had those twists and turns; they haven't had hard times.”
    


            Mamdani and Cuomo, he said, are just privileged scions who only recently decided they wanted to be mayor, unlike his lifelong pursuit of the job he's being pushed by some to abandon.
    


            “I mean, what have we become?” Adams said indignantly. “That's what New Yorkers must ask: Who am I running against? That's what we need to focus on.”
    


            The White House did not respond to questions about the president's efforts. But John Catsimatidis, the billionaire friend of Trump whose calls to the president about the race instigated his involvement, said, “I'm not worried.” He said those repelled by Trump's involvement have “derangement” since the president is just calling attention to the threat they believe Mamdani poses.
    


            A key deadline is Thursday, when the city board of elections will certify November's ballot. “Let things sort themselves out the next few days,” Catsimatidis said.
    


            Saturday night, Catsimatidis hosted Adams at his birthday party. He said he told Adams again at the party to take the Trump administration's job offer.
    


Zohran Mamdani looks to consolidate support as he rallies with Bernie Sanders



            An hour after Adams was on the same parade route, Cuomo stood on his own a few blocks away, taking in the scene of each city union delegation marching by. He had just a few volunteers and staff at the parade, with nowhere near the attention Mamdani was drawing.
    


            Cuomo ran over to chat with the driver of a bright blue 1970s-era Dodge Charger, a vintage model of his own preferred car. He took some selfies. He kissed a few old labor leaders on the cheek.
    


            “Make a deal,” one union official said, peeling out of his delegation to run over to Cuomo. “Save us from Mamdani. Do whatever you have to do. I'm counting on you to save us from Mamdani.”
    


            Some of these union members, Cuomo knew, had drifted toward Trump. Others were holding up their own handmade signs for Mamdani. When a Cuomo volunteer was rebuffed trying to hand a Cuomo sign to one group — “Mamdani,” a person in the group said back — it enraged Chris Erikson, the business manager for Local Union No. 3, IBEW electrical workers, which had officially backed the former governor that morning after first endorsing him in the primary.
    


            “The socialist sh*t!” he called out. “Don't buy that sh*t!”
    


            There's still time for Cuomo, Erikson told CNN. Union members and every other New Yorker should read the Democratic Socialists of America platform, he said, and be scared. As for Adams, Erikson said, “the ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia would be hard to pass up for a guy like him.”
    


            Since Mamdani defeated him in June's Democratic primary, Cuomo has become more active on social media, frequently posting with meme-inspired language that differs from his usual style. He has also been making more public appearances around the city — something he often claimed to do during the primary campaign but rarely actually did.
    


            He spent the weekend repeating he didn't want the White House's help.
    


            “This is very simple: The Republicans want Mayor Mamdani at the end of the day. … Why? If Zohran Mamdani wins, they will pick him up and carry him around the country and kill Democrats with him. They will use him in the midterm elections. They will use him to run against the governor of New York. He is the perfect stooge for President Trump,” Cuomo told reporters. “There is no doubt about it. Everything else is baloney.”
    


            Cuomo denies he's involved with what Trump is doing. He says he's not dropping out. For all their entangled personal and political history, Cuomo says he “would never go working with Trump officials.”
    


            He walked about half the route, peeling off before they passed Trump Tower.
    


            “The punditry and the polls, you take that all with a grain of salt: Who are they talking to? But these are New Yorkers, right? Unfiltered,” Cuomo told CNN after he finished marching, now turning around how burnt he felt after being ahead in every primary poll before he lost in June. “Thousands of people walk by, right? And you see the response. That's the poll that counts.”
    


            Cuomo told CNN he is not bothering with any of his own conversations to try to game the race. But he has mused about it at fundraisers and in one-on-one meetings. Over breakfast on Friday, he asked the Rev. Al Sharpton that “if it comes down to him and Mamdani, would I at least keep an open mind?” Sharpton recalled in an interview.
    


            Sharpton's answer: “We'll see.” (A Cuomo spokesman called the conversation “positive and productive.”)
    


            Sharpton said he won't call on Adams to quit. He said he suspects that Trump's attention tracks back to real estate interests that the president, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and adviser Steve Witkoff have in the city. Kushner and Witkoff both joined Trump to watch the US Open in Queens on Sunday, an appearance at which Trump drew a mix of boos and cheers.
    


Pressure grows on top Democrats to endorse Mamdani as Trump intervenes in NYC mayor's race



            At his town hall Saturday evening with Sanders, Mamdani said he expected the president to soon send in National Guard troops to New York City, as Trump has done in Washington and been threatening to do more broadly. The only way to fight back is partnership among elected officials, Mamdani argued, and Trump's interventions would now leave other Democratic leaders even less likely to want to work with Cuomo as mayor.
    


            One of the people New York's mayor would have to work with is the state attorney general, Letitia James. She was a bitter Cuomo antagonist long before she backed Mamdani.
    


            “Since the president of the United States would like to see Andrew Cuomo as the mayor of the city of New York, one has to question his loyalty,” James told CNN.
    


            As governor, Cuomo rebuffed two attempts to move the National Guard into the city in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic and racial justice protests.
    


            Even Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, who has also refused Trump's help or any talk of job offers, criticized the president's intervention.
    


            “If anything, when you deal with such a polarizing figure in New York City —appealing in other places, but not in New York City — for Democrats, you're hitting the third rail,” Sliwa told CNN. “By Trump trying to determine the outcome, which he can't, he's forcing those that stayed away from Zohran to come to him.”
    


            Sliwa said if Trump really wants to blunt Mamdani's appeal, he should end the war in Gaza. Mamdani is a strident critic of Israel and refers to its conduct of the war as a “genocide,” lining up with younger Democrats who are far more skeptical of Israel than older members of their party.
    


            Mamdani's campaign says Trump's interest in Cuomo — and Cuomo's own approach — helps them drive their message about the former governor not diving into the specifics.
    


            “We spent nine months telling everyone this is what Andrew Cuomo is. That was obviously convincing to enough people, but not everyone,” charged top Mamdani adviser Morris Katz. “Then Andrew Cuomo decided to spend the week telling everyone that we in fact were right: This is what he is.”
    


            Mamdani's failure to secure the support of most of New York's top Democrats — including Gov. Kathy Hochul, Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — was already causing deep tension and accusations on the ground that those leaders are too scared of upsetting big donors than backing the socialist who is the Democratic nominee. Sanders, an independent who tends to back Democrats, made a point of scolding the holdouts onstage in Brooklyn.
    


            Cuomo told CNN he's not trying to win top Democrats over himself. But that they're holding out on Mamdani, he said, “tells you something. He is a socialist. He's a socialist who won the Democratic primary. I'm a Democrat who's on an independent line.”
    


            Trump has shifted that too.
    


            “I think Democratic leaders are misreading how harmful it is for them to stay on the sidelines in this race,” said Lincoln Restler, a city councilman from Brooklyn.
    


            Queens Borough President Donovan Richards says he sees it differently. Trump has only reassured him in supporting Mamdani, Richards said, and will bring in more backers.
    


            “People are living in fear. This is not a Trump town,” Richards said.

There are two big winners for the $1.787 billion Powerball jackpot — and one could face a bigger tax bill.

Winning tickets sold in Missouri and Texas matched all six numbers from Saturday night's drawing, and those individuals will split the second-largest lottery jackpot, according to Powerball.

Each ticket holder can pick between two pretax options: a lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million. The annuity consists of one upfront payment, followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year.

"Virtually everybody who wins the lottery picks the lump sum distribution," Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based lawyer who has represented several lottery winners, previously told CNBC. "And I think that's a mistake."

In some cases, the annuity is a better option because "the typical lottery winner doesn't have the infrastructure in place to manage such a large sum so quickly," he said.

But either way, the winners will face a hefty tax bill. Here is what they can expect.

Both Powerball jackpot winners will face an automatic federal tax withholding. For prizes over $5,000, the IRS requires a mandatory 24% withholding.

If the winners choose the $410.3 million lump sum payment, the 24% federal withholding reduces their prize by roughly $98.5 million.

The next Powerball jackpot winner will easily land in the 37% federal income tax bracket, regardless of whether they choose the lump sum or yearly payments.For 2025, the 37% rate applies to individuals with taxable income exceeding $626,350 and married couples filing jointly with taxable income of $751,600 or more for 2025.

You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.

But the 37% rate doesn't apply to all of your taxable income. 

For 2025, single filers pay $188,769.75 plus 37% of the amount over $626,350. Meanwhile, joint filers pay $202,154.50 plus 37% of the amount over $751,600.

The jackpot winners' remaining tax bill after the 24% federal withholding depends on several factors, but could easily represent millions more.

President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" raised the standard deduction, among other breaks, which could reduce taxable income for many filers in 2025.

On top of federal taxes, the Missouri ticket holder could also owe millions in state income taxes.

In addition to the 24% federal withholding, the Missouri Lottery is required to withhold 4% for state income taxes for prizes over $600. That could reduce winnings by about $16.4 million if the winner chooses the lump sum. But the bill could be higher since Missouri's top income tax rate is 4.7% for 2025.

Meanwhile, Texas does not tax lottery winnings, which means that ticket holder could pay millions less.

Powerball isn't the only chance to win big. The jackpot for Tuesday night's Mega Millions drawing now stands at an estimated $358 million. The chance of hitting the jackpot in that game is roughly 1 in 290.4 million.

In the latest sign of trouble for the U.S. labor market, confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday.

Respondents to the central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for August indicated a 44.9% probability of finding another job after losing their current one. The reading tumbled 5.8 percentage points from the prior month and is the lowest in the survey's history dating back to June 2013.

The result further demonstrates the reversal of the "Great Resignation" that occurred in 2021-22, when at one point 4.5 million workers a month were quitting their jobs and feeling good about finding new ones. That number stood at 3.2 million in July, well off the pace of a few years ago and down more than 5% from the same period in 2024, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.

"Consumers are feeling down about job-finding opportunities, and those feelings are wholly appropriate," said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at consumer site NerdWallet. "It's very difficult to find work right now. And unlikely to get better any time soon. Employers aren't hiring much, so workers are stuck job-hugging, clinging to their current jobs because the market isn't favorable to job seekers."

Various factors that had come into play during the Covid pandemic helped influence the high level of mobility, including a supply-demand mismatch in the labor market that saw more than two open jobs for each available worker.

But a labor market that has ground to a virtual standstill has ended the trend. While there are not too many signs that employers are laying off workers en masse, hiring has slowed dramatically. That has caused workers to stay put in their jobs as uncertainty over inflation and economic growth has caused employers to be cautious about growing payrolls.

There are now more workers available than job openings, something that hasn't been the case since well before Covid.

Other parts of the Fed survey reflect the trend: The probability of leaving one's job voluntarily over the next year was little changed, down just 0.1 percentage point to 18.9%. At the same time, expectations that the unemployment rate will be higher a year from now rose to 39.1%, up 1.7 percentage points from July and a point above the 12-month average.

The results follow a dismal August nonfarm payrolls count.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday reported just 22,000 new jobs on the month, well below the expectation for 75,000. Moreover, the June count was revised lower to a loss of 13,000, the first monthly decline since December 2020. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% while a broader level that includes discouraged workers and the underemployed climbed to 8.1%, both the highest since October 2021.

Markets widely expect the Fed to respond to the labor market weakness with its first interest rate cut since December 2024 when it next decides on rates on Sept. 17.

StubHub is aiming to raise as much as $851 million in its initial public offering, giving it a valuation of up to $9.2 billion, the company revealed in a new filing on Monday.

The ticket reselling marketplace plans to sell more than 34 million shares priced between $22 and $25 per share, according to the filing.

The long-awaited IPO comes after StubHub hit pause on the process in April as the stock market was reeling from President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. The company also eyed an IPO last year, but it postponed its efforts in July 2024 amid a slowdown in the IPO market.

StubHub plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "STUB."

The IPO market has bounced back in recent months, with recent debuts from Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, design software company Figma and crypto firm Circle.

Klarna, a Swedish provider of buy now, pay later loans, and Gemini, the crypto firm founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, are gearing up for public debuts this week.

StubHub filed an updated IPO prospectus last month, showing that first-quarter revenue grew 10% from a year earlier to $397.6 million. Operating income came in at $26.8 million for the period.

The company's net loss widened to $35.9 million from $29.7 million a year ago.

The company has been a longtime player in the ticketing industry since its launch in 2000. It was purchased by eBay for $310 million in 2007, but was reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 for $4 billion through his new company Viagogo.

StubHub had sought a $16.5 billion valuation before it began the IPO process, CNBC previously reported.

A federal appeals court on Monday rejected President Donald Trump's bid to overturn a jury verdict ordering him to pay $83.3 million for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll.

The ruling from a trio of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld that verdict, which Trump argued was both excessive and invalid following a Supreme Court decision that expanded his presidential immunity.

The panel held that Trump "has failed to identify any grounds that would warrant reconsidering our prior holding on presidential immunity."

The judges also ruled that a lower federal court "did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury's damages awards are fair and reasonable."

The decision came less than a week after Trump's lawyers signaled they will soon ask the Supreme Court to overturn a jury verdict in a second civil case Carroll had filed against the president, for which she has been awarded $5 million.

Both lawsuits accused Trump of defaming Carroll in statements denying her claim that he raped her in the mid-1990s in the Manhattan department store Bergdorf Goodman. 

The jury in Carroll's second case, known as Carroll II, found after a spring 2023 trial that Trump sexually abused the writer in 1996 and defamed her more than two decades later.

In his appeal of the first case, known as Carroll I — which was filed first but went to trial second — Trump had argued that a lower court was wrong to bar his lawyers from relitigating whether his statements about Carroll were true or false.

In Monday's ruling, the appellate judges disagreed.

While Carroll I centered on claims Trump made in 2019 and Carroll II focused on claims he made in 2022, "the statements were identical in material respects because both accused Carroll of fabricating the sexual assault allegations for improper purposes," they wrote.

The judges added, "The jury in Carroll II decided that Carroll was telling the truth."

They also rejected Trump's argument that a Supreme Court decision in July 2024 — which granted former presidents presumptive immunity for "official acts" and other protections — cast doubt on the Second Circuit's prior dismissal of his immunity claims.

Trump "submits that [the Supreme Court case, Trump v. United States,] represents a sufficient intervening change of law and that enforcing our prior decision on immunity would work a manifest injustice in light of that change."

"We are not persuaded," the judges wrote.

Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, celebrated the ruling, telling CNBC in a statement, "We look forward to an end to the appellate process so that justice will finally be done."

The White House referred CNBC to Trump's personal lawyers in the case, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The panel who delivered Monday's ruling comprised two judges appointed by former President Joe Biden and one judge picked by former President Barack Obama.

A startup developing a home energy system to take on the likes of Tesla has secured $2.6 million.

California-based Kora's technology consists of a smart panel, modular batteries, a hybrid inverter, and an energy trading platform.

It gives residents an energy storage platform to help them cut their energy bills, and also sell excess energy generated from solar panels on the wholesale market.

"Most people have a 100-year-old technology, a metal box with some plastic switches in their homes," Greg Connolly, the cofounder and CEO of Kora, told Business Insider. "They have no control over their circuits, no backup, no insight into how their energy is being used."

Renewable energy is intermittent, which means its supply may not always match demand. That can lead to wasted energy or a forced reduction of power generation, usually from sources like wind and solar.

"We could significantly power more of the grid with renewables, if we just had somewhere to put that power, instead of just turning off all of these solar rays and wind farms when we have nowhere to store it," Connolly said.

Kora says its platform allows customers to decide which rooms and appliances stay on during a power outage, and use its app to sell excess energy at wholesale market rates.

Connolly, who previously cofounded the meal delivery service Trifecta, said Kora aims for customers to save enough money by reducing their bills and selling surplus energy to make their investment back in "three to five years." Kora plans to start shipping its systems in January 2026.

The startup bills itself as a Tesla competitor because it offers a fully integrated stack that goes beyond Tesla's Powerwall, a home battery system that stores energy generated by solar or from the grid. Kora claims to have a higher photovoltaic intake and additional services, such as its energy trading platform.

Cleantech stocks — and, collaterally, climate startups — have had a difficult year as Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" slashed federal tax credits for many green energy projects. Connolly said it's been a tough funding environment, but certain upcoming regulatory changes, such as the FERC Order 2222, would be a boon for customers, as they would be able to participate more freely in the wholesale energy market.

The $2.6 million funding round was led by Moneta Ventures and Growth Factory Ventures. Additionally, Connolly has invested $300,000 of his own money in the startup.

With the fresh funding, the startup plans to focus on its research and development efforts, as well as test manufacturing.

Business Insider got an exclusive look at the pitch deck Kora used to secure the fresh funding.

Women's 3-on-3 basketball league Unrivaled is now valued at $340 million after a new funding round that included tennis legend Serena Williams, the league announced Monday.

Williams' Serena Ventures was part of a Series B funding round that was led by Bessemer Venture Partners and also included Warner Bros. Discovery and Alex Morgan's Trybe Ventures. Unrivaled did not disclose the size of the individual contributions.

Unrivaled's latest cash infusion means a dramatic rise in its valuation from just one year ago when the league was valued at $95 million, according to a person familiar with the league who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters.

The investment comes as women's sports have soared in both popularity and valuations in recent years.

"To add arguably the most iconic female athlete to play sports, I think it exemplifies who Unrivaled is not just with our players on the court, but the number of investors on our cap table who had been icons in their own lanes," said Alex Bazzell, co-founder and president of Unrivaled.

Other Unrivaled investors include high-profile names such as tennis legend Billie Jean King, NBA superstar Stephen Curry, tennis champion Coco Gauff and Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps.

Bessemer has previously invested in ticketing resale site StubHub, as well as streaming services BallerTV and Twitch. The venture firm sees Unrivaled as a blueprint for the next generation of sports leagues, according to Caty Rea, a vice president at Bessemer.

"We always look for category-defining businesses with generational tail winds and really audacious founders who kind of have that product hard to fit," Rea said. "We felt like we found that with Unrivaled."

Unrivaled was founded in 2023 and offers women's professional basketball players a league that runs in the offseason of the WNBA. Previously, many players went abroad in the offseason for extra compensation.

The league says it offers women the highest average salary in professional women's sports history and provides equity to players.

For comparison, the WNBA does not offer its players equity, and players are currently negotiating their collective bargaining agreement, which expires Oct. 31. One of the key issues being debated is an increase in player compensation. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told CNBC in July that the average WNBA team valuation has increased to about $260 million.

Bazzell said the new funding will be used to add more resources to the league's facilities, for developmental efforts and to create additional awareness of the league as it heads into its second season.

"We've built a sustainable and sticky audience, both on television and certainly on social. So now we have to grow that footprint," he said.

American graduates are facing a tough job market, and things aren't much different across the pond.

The UK branch of the Big Four accountancy firm PwC confirmed to Business Insider that it had lowered entry-level recruitment this year.

PwC will take on 1,300 entrants to its graduate and school leaver programmes, compared with 1,500 last year, the firm said.

The news was first reported in an op-ed published in The Sunday Times by Marco Amitrano, PwC's UK chief.

"PwC will always be a large employer and training ground for young people in the UK," but the impact of AI and a sluggish economy are changing the firm's hiring practices, Amitrano wrote.

The UK's economic slowdown and the resulting drop in investment, hiring, and dealmaking in the UK are the "single biggest factor behind a lower graduate intake at PwC this year," Amitrano said.

AI is also reshaping roles, Amitrano said. For now, the development of new tools and investment in skills was offsetting more serious disruption to jobs, but that balance was likely to change in the future, he said.

The PwC chief said consistent policy, regulatory reform, and a more predictable tax environment would help create jobs. He was also optimistic about AI's potential, saying the technology could create new industries if there was "sustained and serious investment in tech, infrastructure, and training."

"Most technologies, if not all, have boosted both productivity and wages," Amitrano said.

Entry-level hiring is also set to slow at the firm's US branch.

In August, BI obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years.

A bullet point on the presentation slide said leadership's decision to slow down associate-level hiring related to "transformation efforts, the impact of AI, and further AC integration" — with AC integration referring to PwC's acceleration centers, or offshoring hubs.

In his Sunday op-ed, Amitrano addressed offshoring, saying the global labour market was "more competitive and accessible than ever before."

"Where it makes sense, and where it helps us remain competitive, we must draw on a global dimension," he said.

Deloitte UK has also lowered its intake for graduate and apprentice hires in recent years.

Last week, the firm announced it was taking on 1,400 entrants to its graduate programme, BrightStart apprenticeship, and industrial placement programme — 300 fewer than it accepted for the same programmes in 2023.

Deloitte didn't respond to a request for comment from BI about why it has reduced the numbers.

While artificial intelligence has caused turbulence in the labor market, the recent decline in job opportunities has more to do with economic uncertainty, experts say.

"As we look across the broader labor market, we see that AI's impact on the labor market has still been fairly small," said Cory Stahle, a senior economist at Indeed, a job search site. 

"The important asterisk is that that doesn't mean that it has been zero," he said. 

Mandi Woodruff-Santos, a career coach, agrees, "I don't think AI is to blame, I think the economic uncertainty is to blame."

The job market has not been good in recent months, whether you're looking for a job or currently employed.

The U.S. economy added about 22,000 jobs for the month of August, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report on Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for payrolls to rise by 75,000.

Of those who are still employed, some are "job hugging," or "holding onto their job for dear life," according to an August report by Korn Ferry, an organizational consulting firm.

But others are "quiet cracking," which is a "persistent feeling of workplace unhappiness that leads to disengagement, poor performance, and an increased desire to quit," according to cloud learning platform TalentLMS.

Growing economic uncertainty has kept workers from quitting their jobs and has led businesses to slow down hiring decisions, experts say.

"No business knows what the heck the Trump administration is going to do next with the economy," said Woodruff-Santos.

"And in this kind of economic climate, companies are not sure of anything, and so they're being very conservative with the way that they're hiring," she said.

While some companies have announced layoffs to pursue AI technologies in their organizations, most of the impact has been isolated in the tech industry, said Indeed's Stahle. 

Most recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the company laid off about 4,000 customer support roles, due to advancements in the company's use of artificial intelligence software.

Other studies show AI has mostly affected younger workers rather than mid-career employees. 

An August report by Stanford University professors found that early career workers (ages 22 to 25) in the most AI-exposed occupations experienced a 13% decline in employment. On the flip side, employment for workers in less exposed fields and more experienced workers in the same occupations has either stayed the same or grown.

The study also found that employment declines are concentrated in occupations "where AI is more likely to automate rather than augment human labor."

Yet, the tech industry itself is not a large sector, said Stahle. According to a March 2025 analysis by nonprofit trade association CompTIA, or the Computing Technology Industry Association, "net tech employment" made up about 5.8% of the overall workforce.

Net tech employment is a designation that represents all those employed in the industry, including workers in technical positions such as cybersecurity and business professionals employed by technology companies, as well as full-time and self-employed technology workers.

For AI-driven layoffs to be considered a broad threat to the job market, the technology needs to start impacting other sectors, such as retail and marketing, said Stahle.

Some predictions on AI's workforce impact contend that employers may be more likely to retrain workers rather than lay them off, according to a new report by the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank.

"AI may be more likely to augment rather than fully replace human workers," the authors wrote.

In fact, "we're seeing more and more demand for AI skills," said Stahle.

If you have the opportunity, experts say, it's smart to learn how your field and employer are using AI. 

"You'd be foolish not to do the research into your own field," and understand how AI can be a tool in your industry, said Woodruff-Santos. 

Look for training programs or webinars where you can participate or free trials of AI tools you can use, she said.

Correction: A new report came from the Brookings Institution. An earlier version misstated the name of the organization.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives is joining a new company focused on accumulating Worldcoin (WLD), the native token of the blockchain used in Open AI creator Sam Altman's biometric identity verification startup, World.

Eightco Holdings, a tiny company that currently trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker "OCTO," announced Monday that Ives, Wedbush's global head of technology research, is now chairman of the board of directors. It also announced a $250 million private placement to implement a buying strategy around Worldcoin as its main treasury asset.

"As someone that's so passionate about the AI revolution and the future of tech, I view World as really the de facto standard for authentication and identification in the future world of AI," Ives told CNBC. "I would not be doing this initiative if it was just a cookie cutter token strategy."

The offering is expected to close on or around Sept. 11, at which point it plans to change its ticker to "ORBS."

Ives' move is similar to one made by another widely-followed Wall Street forecaster, Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who in June joined the ether accumulator BitMine Immersion Technologies as chairman. BitMine shares have rocked more than 800% since Lee announced his involvement.

That company also made a $20 million strategic investment in Eightco, it announced Monday, marking the start of its "Moonshot" strategy to back bold ideas that strengthen Ethereum's ecosystem.

Given the more crypto-friendly regulatory environment this year, more public companies have adopted the MicroStrategy playbook of using debt financing and equity sales to buy crypto to hold on their balance sheet to try to increase shareholder returns. Companies with high-profile backers like Fundstrat's Lee and tech billionaire Peter Thiel (who has a stake in both ether-focused companies BitMine and Ethzilla) have been holding up better in the recent crypto pullback.

Ives, known for his bold street calls (and fashion choices) also runs the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES), which launched earlier in the summer with a focus on software and chips, and has said tech will be in a bull market for the next two to three years.

Increasingly, companies pursuing crypto treasury strategies are looking further out on the risk spectrum of crypto, beyond bitcoin, hoping for even bigger gains. For example, DeFi Development Corp launched in April with a focus on accumulating Solana's SOL token, and a little-known Canadian vape company called CEA Industries announced a Binance Coin (BNB) accumulation plan in July.

Altman's World venture aims to authenticate actual humans on its network given the acceleration of the number of threats from artificial intelligence, such as deepfakes. The project provides users with a "World ID" for anonymous sign-ins and rewards them with its Worldcoin cryptocurrency.

"As the AI infrastructure and [large language models] are built out without true identification and proof of human, it's a limiting factor in the growth of AI for the coming years," Ives said. "I view the whole crypto world going more and more toward a focus on blockchain, and how are you going to identify humans … in a future where robots are going to play a major role in physical AI?"

His comments on the need for a digital identity verification system echo those made by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink who has said in his annual letter this year that one day "tokenized funds," or funds represented on a blockchain network like Ethereum, "will become as familiar to investors as ETFs — provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification."

Worldcoin launched in 2023 and has a market cap of about $1 billion, compared to bitcoin's roughly $2 trillion and ether's $518 billion, according to CoinGecko.

Geoffrey Hinton helped invent the technology behind ChatGPT. Now he's warning it could destroy the very jobs it was meant to enhance.

"What's actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers," Hinton, who is often referred to as the "godfather of AI," told the Financial Times last Friday.

"It's going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer."

Hinton, who won the Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on neural networks and spent a decade at Google before leaving in 2023, said the disruption is less about the technology itself than the system it operates within.

"That's not AI's fault," he said, instead blaming the "capitalist system."

The 77-year-old researcher also dismissed ideas like a universal basic income as a solution, arguing that a cash stipend wouldn't address the loss of dignity people derive from their jobs.

Universal basic income "won't deal with human dignity," he said, adding that people get their worth from their jobs.

Not all tech leaders share Hinton's bleak view on the future.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has long pitched a universal basic income as a cushion against job losses, even funding one of the largest UBI trials in the US.

Elon Musk has echoed those calls, telling an audience at VivaTech last year that in a benign AI future, "probably none of us will have a job" — but universal income could let humans pursue meaning while machines handle work.

The investor Vinod Khosla has gone further, predicting that AI will perform 80% of the work in 80% of jobs. That, he argues, will slash the value of human labor and make UBI "crucial" to prevent a surge in inequality.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, meanwhile, has called UBI just "a small part" of the solution, warning that society will need to invent entirely new systems to manage the shift.

Hinton isn't convinced. While he's previously advised the UK government to explore UBI, he now says cash payments won't replace the sense of dignity people derive from their work.

Having lost two wives to cancer, he still hopes AI delivers breakthroughs in healthcare and education.

But beyond that, he believes the technology is more likely to erode livelihoods than uplift them.

"We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening," he said, "and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad."

For Elon Musk, the future of Tesla isn't its global fleet of electric vehicles.

It's Optimus, the humanoid robot the company is developing to assist humans with everyday tasks.

"~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus," Musk wrote on X this month.

Although Musk is involved in several business ventures — including aerospace manufacturing and AI development — creating an autonomous humanoid robot has long been a priority. In 2024, Musk told shareholders that Optimus could help Tesla raise its market cap to $25 trillion in the future.

"Even the most optimistic estimates that I've seen for Optimus — the Optimus optimist — I think underaccount the magnitude of what the robot will be able to do," Musk said.

If Musk's predictions hold true, Optimus will help ensure that he meets the various thresholds on his $1 trillion pay package proposed by Tesla's board this month.

Here's everything you need to know about Optimus.

Although Tesla became a household name as an automaker, the company announced during an AI event in 2021 that it would expand into humanoid robots.

Musk said what was then called the Tesla Bot would be 5'8" and weigh 125 pounds. The robot would be able to deadlift 150 pounds and carry 45 pounds, but only travel around 5 mph.

Musk said the robot, built with eight cameras and the company's Autopilot software, would make working optional

"Essentially, in the future, physical work will be a choice," Musk said. "If you want to do it, you can, but you won't need to do it."

However, audience members didn't see an official prototype that day. Instead, a man wearing a robot-themed bodysuit danced and paraded across the stage.

By January 2022, Musk had developed lofty ambitions for Tesla's humanoid robot, which became known as Optimus.

"In terms of priority of products, I think the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid," he said during Tesla's Q4 earnings call.

Musk unveiled an official Optimus prototype eight months later during Tesla AI Day. At the event, audience members watched as the robot walked across the stage, moved its limbs, and waved at the crowd.

Tesla accompanied the demonstration with a video of Optimus completing various tasks, including delivering a package and watering plants. "There's still a lot of work to be done to refine Optimus and improve it," Musk said. "Obviously, this is just Optimus version one. "

Tesla showed off Optimus Gen 2 in late 2023.

In a December promotional video, the company said a 30% walk speed boost and improved full-body control were among the updates for Optimus Gen 2. Footage also showed the robot doing squats and picking up an egg.

The robots' improved capabilities highlight how quickly the larger humanoid robotics landscape is transforming.

"Everything in this video is real, no CGI," Tesla senior manager Julian Ibarz wrote on X. All real time, nothing sped up. Incredible hardware improvements from the team."

Although Tesla unveiled its Robotaxi and Robovan during its 2024 "We, Robot" event, the Optimus robots stole the show.

During the event, robots served drinks, answered questions, and played rock-paper-scissors. Videos of guests interacting with the robots gained traction on social media.

"One of the things we wanted to show tonight is that Optimus is not a canned video, it's not walled off," Musk told guests. "The Optimus robots will walk among you. Please be nice to the Optimus robots."

However, the robots aren't fully autonomous just yet. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the Optimus robots at the event "relied on tele-ops," meaning a human controlled the robot remotely. The event failed to impress Wall Street analysts and investors, resulting in Musk's net worth falling $15 billion that October.

In May, Musk told CNBC he planned to place Optimus robots in Tesla factories by the end of 2025.

"We expect to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this year, beginning this fall," Musk said. "And we expect to scale Optimus up faster than any product, I think, in history, to get to millions of units per year as soon as possible."

He said Tesla could produce one million units by 2030.

"I think we feel confident in getting to one million units per year in less than five years, maybe four years. So by 2030, I feel confident in predicting one million Optimus units per year — it might be 2029," he said.

Tesla's Q1 2025 update said the company is "on track" for its Optimus builds on its Fremont pilot production line.

However, Chris Walti, the former team lead for Tesla's robot, told Business Insider that humanoid robots may not be an ideal fit in factories.

"It's not a useful form factor. Most of the work that has to be done in industry is highly repetitive tasks where velocity is key," Walti said.

During Tesla's earnings call in April, Musk said Optimus production was affected by supply chain issues in China. Tesla uses rare-earth magnets from China to power the robot's actuators.

China requires an export license for certain rare-earth materials, which pushed Tesla to look for alternative sources. Beijing paused exports of specific rare-earth elements in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Additionally, Musk said China needed reassurance that the magnets Tesla acquires wouldn't be used for a weaponized system or in other robots.

"Tesla as a whole does not need to use permanent magnets, but when something is volume constrained, like an arm of the robot, then you want to try to make the motors as small as possible," Musk said.

At the time, Musk said Tesla was "working through" the issue with China and hoped to get a license.

Tesla has changed its strategy for training the Optimus robot.

The company will now primarily use video recordings of humans performing tasks to train the robots instead of motion capture suits and teleoperation.

The company believes stepping back from teleoperation and motion capture suits will allow Tesla to scale data collection faster, insiders told Business Insider last month.

The pivot underscores Musk's belief that AI can complete complex tasks using cameras. He's used a similar approach when training Tesla's autonomous driving software.

That's Optimus 2.5. Optimus 3 will have agility roughly equal to an agile human.

Musk has hyped up the newest model of Optimus multiple times on X, including in July when he said, "Optimus 3 will have agility roughly equal to an agile human."

More recently, Musk called Optimus V3 "sublime" in an X post on Sunday.

Get ready for round-the-clock emails from your CEO.

US companies will soon face pressure from rivals and investors to elevate AI to the top of the org chart — not just as a C-suite helper — but as co-CEO or perhaps even as a stand-alone chief. That's the prediction of futurist Michael Tchong, who's spent decades writing about the role of tech in business.

AI's gains in efficiency are starting to challenge traditional executive functions, including decision-making, forecasting, and risk modeling, he told Business Insider. Add in investors' endless demands for efficiency, Tchong said, and you're all but promoting AI to co-CEO.

"It becomes inevitable," he told Business Insider.

Tchong expects that early corporate adopters will help create competitive pressures that lead other companies to install boss bots.

"If you don't have an AI co-CEO," Tchong said, "you're going to be seen as being corporately deficient in the way you're handling your affairs."

Chatter about AI in the office tends to stir fears that a bot takeover will make loads of desk workers as necessary as reply-all email chains. Yet when it comes to the C-suite, the discussion often centers on leaders' plans for AI — not the reverse.

Many leaders are already using AI. Yet what Tchong predicts is more than just a CEO querying ChatGPT about strategy. One result of AI bosses would be tireless leaders who could fire off emails at any hour — perhaps not unlike some humans — and tinker continually with a company's operations.

Having AI in the corner office could be an outgrowth of the pressure that many companies already face to talk about AI. Corporate leaders often discuss their investments in the technology and the payoffs they're hoping to get or already seeing.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent podcast that the company had slashed about 4,000 customer-support roles because AI agents were taking on so much work at the tech giant.

What tends to get less airtime is how AI could refashion the C-suite — not just the duties of workaday desk jockeys.

Tchong said examples of corporate chiefs handing duties like reporting quarterly results to AI are indicators that more leaders could get comfortable having digital sidekicks who share titles and never take PTO. And a handful of companies outside the US have named AI leaders.

Already, various leaders, including Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, have said AI could do their jobs. Tamay Besiroglu, who cofounded and runs the startup Mechanize, wants to use AI to automate every role, including those of execs like himself. Others, like Sam Liang, CEO and cofounder of the note-taking app Otter, expect more top leaders will soon use avatars to attend meetings and field questions.

Tchong said investor pressure could also make it more likely that some companies name AI as CEO, not just co-CEO.

"The inevitable conclusion that everyone will reach is that, 'Hey, your co-CEO is already doing a fabulous job at optimizing your profits. Why can't it also run the whole company?'" he said.

Yet not everyone thinks workers will toil under digital bosses.

"I think the CEO always remains a human," Tom Gimbel, founder of the staffing firm LaSalle Network, told Business Insider.

Gimbel, who is the incoming chairman of the American Staffing Association, said that CEOs lean on advisors, attorneys, accountants, and their boards to help navigate business decisions. On top of that, he said, chiefs now have AI to help outline various scenarios.

The risk to workers, he said, is when they complete certain tasks that AI might be able to take on. That's different from leadership jobs that are "100% decision-making," Gimbel said.

"Those jobs aren't going anywhere," he said.

Tchong said that because AI tools are already embedded at the executive level, it will just take time before the technology handles managerial work.

He said one immediate concern is about what happens if an AI leader makes a mistake. Yet, Tchong said, that would make the bots similar to human beings, who also have "bouts of fantasy."

In a scenario where AI is a co-CEO, he said the bot's human counterpart could lead in areas involving a company's strategic vision, responding to a crisis, or where emotional intelligence is useful.

"I would give him the informal title of 'chief empathy officer,' because that's what an AI can't do," Tchong said. AI, for its part, could work to optimize a company's operations and take over "laborious tasks" that even CEOs might not like to do, he said.

Wall Street could be a driver, too, Tchong said. That's because he expects that companies with AI in at least one driver's seat will outperform, and, as a result, investors will demand to see more tech with a decision-making role.

And, unlike highly paid C-suiters, bots would be far cheaper, Tchong said.

"The AI CEO does not demand a $29 billion salary," he said.

JPMorgan's new 270 Park Avenue headquarters, opening this year, includes a wellness hub with medical clinics, meditation rooms, and a fitness center run by a company known for training professional athletes. One detail has already stirred grumbling: Employees will have to pay for gym access.

The move highlights a broader shift on Wall Street, where flexing about your workout has become almost as important as closing a big deal. Firms see gyms as both a perk and a way to keep staff anchored to the office, so Wall Street gyms have evolved to include everything from river-view spin studios to juice bars, features designed with the long hours and high demands of finance in mind.

In the past decade, banks and hedge funds have poured money into in-house gyms that now rival independent fitness studios and national gym chains. Josh Love, founder of Kinema Fitness, which runs Bank of America's gym in Chicago, said he's seen demand for sophisticated facilities rising as companies connect the importance of work and wellness.

"Ten years ago, the conversation was more about checking the box — 'What's the least we can do, Josh, just to make our building competitive and give employees something?'" Love told Business Insider. "Today, the conversation is, 'What else can we do? We want to do more.' It's no longer about the ROI, where I had to convince them of the return. Now, they're the ones saying, 'We want to do more.'"

Here's a look at five of Wall Street's luxe workout spaces, from Goldman Sachs to Citigroup, which boast amenities from Himalayan salt rooms to Peloton bikes; even skyline views count as a perk.

At Goldman Sachs, the gym attracts a wide mix of employees, from junior analysts to partners — a setup that means a first-year banker might find themselves lifting weights next to a managing director.

The facility spans about 40,000 square feet — nearly the size of a football field — with floor-to-ceiling Hudson River views, a full suite of cardio and strength machines, and studios offering everything from yoga to HIIT training, according to people familiar with the space.

An on-site laundry service relieves employees from having to pack a gym bag, providing standardized workout clothing, including T-shirts and shorts, people who have used the gym told Business Insider.

"When you join Goldman, especially as an analyst or intern, you're excited. You pick up the little banker bag, put your gym clothes in it. It's part of the mentality — the deal toys, the zip-up vest, and the Goldman gym. It's part of the thing," a former Goldman Sachs employee said.

Trainers are available, and some senior partners have their regulars, this person said.

Membership, which is subsidized, is tiered with analysts, associates, and administrators paying around $50 a month, vice presidents closer to $70, and managing directors over $100, these people said.

JPMorgan's new Park Avenue HQ, which has started welcoming some employees and will open more fully later this year, features a state-of-the-art fitness center run by performance-training firm EXOS, which calls itself a "human performance" company specializing in employee wellness programming.

The gym is designed as part of a broader health hub that will also include medical clinics and meditation rooms.

Offerings will include cardio and strength training areas, group fitness classes, nutrition consultations, and access to "well-being performance coaches." Locker rooms and showers will be integrated into the sleek, futuristic facility.

The bank told employees on its online portal that there'd be a monthly charge, but didn't say how much. The detail has already sparked grumbling online.

Monthly Fee: $59

At its tower in Chicago, BofA employees have access to 110Fit+, a 17,000-square-foot facility managed by Kinema Fitness. Kinema operates more than 50 corporate gyms across the country.

The center features high-end locker rooms with overnight storage and laundry, along with a training floor designed around functional rigs and performance equipment rather than rows of machines, the company's website shows. Amenities include a Himalayan salt room, cryotherapy lounge beds, massage and acupuncture services, reiki, and aerial yoga. A mix of strength, cardio, and free weights equipment is available, as well as Peloton bikes for cyclers.

Members can work with three certified personal trainers, booking 30-, 45-, or 60-minute sessions that cost under $100. Every membership begins with a free fitness assessment before members decide whether to purchase a training package.

Love said Kinema's Chicago location has drawn 600 members, including Bank of America's employees. Demand has been strong enough that Kinema recently added new therapeutic offerings, including a salt cave. For finance professionals working long, high-pressure hours, Love says the space offers "a chance to reset."

Monthly Fee: Unknown

The gym at the Chicago office and former headquarters of hedge fund giant Citadel is equipped with cardio machines, weights, and space for group classes, plus locker rooms and training, the Citadel Center website said.

The gym offers midday stretch breaks for 15 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, half-hour classes on training basics, cardio, strength, and core workouts. Trainers are available on demand, giving staff flexibility around demanding schedules. Permanent lockers are $15 a month, a form on the building's website said.

Less is known about what Citadel has in store for its planned Miami headquarters, where the firm is developing a new tower that could feature an even more ambitious fitness setup. Spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment about the fitness center at Citadel Center.

Monthly fee: $50

Citi's Live Well Fitness center in Tribeca, staffed by degreed fitness professionals, features cardio and weight equipment, group classes, and personal training, public documents show.

Membership is $50 per month, according to a spokesperson, but rates fluctuate across Citi locations. A $6 per day rate is also available to offer flexibility to Citi's hybrid workers.

Membership includes a complementary digital fitness platform.

LONDON — Surging power demand has reignited interest in nuclear energy, but vast capital requirements and an uncertain political and regulatory climate raise questions about the sector's fiscal capacity.

Tech giants are pumping money into nuclear energy investments, looking to power energy-intensive data centers and realize their AI ambitions.

AI and data centers are the "canary in the coal mine," World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León told CNBC ahead of the conference. "We are finally recognizing that the demand of electricity and energy in general is only going to increase. But the reality is that all sectors of the economy are going to need more electricity."

In addition to AI, applications range from nuclear energy for the metallurgical industry, which is looking to electrify as fast as possible, to the chemical, maritime and shipping sectors, León said.

The question of how to meet the world's growing power needs took center stage as chief executives of the world's biggest uranium and nuclear energy firms, experts and investors gathered for the annual World Nuclear Association (WNA) symposium at the Royal Lancaster London hotel last week.

Kicking off discussions at the conference, Leon told attendees in her welcoming speech that the event is a "working summit" looking to move past mere conversation.

Investments in the nuclear value chain through 2025 are projected to increase to $2.2 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley estimates, up from a 2024 forecast of $1.5 trillion. That level of investment raises questions over the role of government, banks and other financial players in providing sufficient fiscal capacity.

Nuclear energy is said to provide a more reliable, 24/7 energy source compared to renewables, which can be more intermittent. The development of small modular reactors (SMRs) provides a more scalable power solution due to their size. According to the IEA, the payback period of a SMR investment is half the usual 20 to 30-year period for larger scale projects.

But SMRs have yet to reach the commercial stage, and most planned projects won't come online until 2030. While a significant amount of money is being pledged, there have been no new large-scale nuclear projects in the U.S. in the last 15 years.

"The first positive story with respect to the financial sector with regards to nuclear, is that they are open to financing nuclear," Mahesh Goenka, founder of market and commercial advisory firm Old Economy, told CNBC on the sidelines of WNA. "That was not the story a few years ago when a lot of banks didn't want to touch nuclear projects. That has changed. The question now remains, do they have the risk appetite to finance nuclear projects?"

Challenges include over-running budgets, the late delivery of projects due to long construction lead times, the technical complexity of initiatives and difficulties obtaining licenses.

Goenka compared the West to China, where financial institutions are happy to finance nuclear projects because they can be delivered on time and on budget — leading to better margins than on other infrastructure projects. Meanwhile, the West has not built many new reactors in a very long time, so the learning rate is not quite there yet, he said.

Nearly all of the nuclear generating capacity in the U.S. comes from reactors built between 1967 and 1990, with no new constructions until 2013 when work started on the Vogtle units in Georgia. Meanwhile, the last plant to be built in the U.K. was Sizewell B, which started operating in 1995.

Nuclear investments are "inherently political projects," said Mark Muldowney, managing director of energy, resources and infrastructure at BNP Paribas. He noted that, while clients are much more receptive to the investments, uncertainty over cost and build time remains.

"We are many years away from the situation in which techniques like project finance can be used by themselves to finance large nuclear [projects]," he said during a panel discussion.

"It's not going to be the contractors, even if they were willing to, and by and large they aren't, they will be bankrupted by some of the risks that sit with these projects. So it's either going to be a government, or it's going to be the electricity consumers of that country, and in some places that could be intermediated by utilities."

Nuclear power plants are among the most capital intensive assets. The U.K., for example, has greenlit the construction of a massive two-reactor nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast that will generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity — enough, the government says, to provide power for the equivalent of 6 million homes. But costs of the majority government-owned project have jumped to £38 billion, exceeding an initial target of £20 billion.

Other major projects have run into similar issues. The Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, ran several years behind schedule and had a budget that more than doubled during development. The U.K.'s Hinkley Point nuclear power point faced many concerns around security risks during its initial stages, as well as a budget that swelled to an estimated £40 billion.

Trevor Myburgh, senior executive in corporate finance advisory at Eskom, stressed that the private sector cannot be a "silver bullet" and solve the problem of financing nuclear energy.

Public private partnerships are going to be "crucial" in the development of nuclear, particularly in any emerging economy, Myburgh said during a panel discussion on Wednesday.

While some European countries such as Switzerland — which currently has a ban on the construction of any new nuclear plants but has drafted legislation to lift this motion — and Germany remain adverse to nuclear energy, other governments such as those of the U.K., France, and the U.S. have leaned into the energy source.

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a number of executive orders designed to fast track the development of nuclear reactors and quadruple nuclear generating capacity by 2025.

Such actions from Trump's administration have put positive nuclear energy policies "on steroids," said Uranium Royalty Corp CEO Scott Melbye.

"What we're seeing are really concrete measures being taken by this administration to spur not only the building of small modular reactors, advanced reactors and large reactors, but [also] in the fuel cycle," Melbye told WNA attendees.

Investor Arfa Karani noted the growing interest from the investor community to find opportunities with startups, particularly those that supply nuclear-adjacent tech.

The U.K. government, in particular has adopted a more "hands-on" approach in helping founders of startups secure investors in clean tech, she said.

"The regulation has to figure itself out. It's no longer a question of, where do we get the capital from? ....because now suddenly it's become a matter of national security and global power and global dominance," she told CNBC, adding that commitment Stateside to funding AI and nuclear has meant that "all the insolvable problems suddenly becomes solvable which is very exciting for nuclear."

With capital harder to come by, private equity giants and investment banks are waging a global battle for talent as dealmaking activity ekes out a recovery.

Private equity recruitment accelerated in the first half of 2025, led by fundraising, investor relations and marketing roles, according to a recent report from Magellan Advisory Partners. Broader investment hiring also rebounded after two years of freeze or slowdown.

This hiring spree comes after the private equity sector remained stuck in a holding pattern in recent years, as rising interest rates and market volatility put the brakes on dealmaking. Fund managers were left with an expanding pipeline of companies they couldn't sell, with exits postponed.

In the first quarter of 2025, buyout activity picked up, but the momentum faded quickly in the next quarter as tariff turbulence unsettled investors and stalled deal pipelines, according to Bain & Company. Global buyout deal value in April was 24% lower than the first-quarter monthly average, while deal count slipped 22%, according to Bain analysis.

"While deal flow is cyclical, the need to secure capital is permanent — firms are investing ahead of the curve," said Sasha Jensen, founder and CEO of Jensen Partners, a global executive recruitment firm.

Fundraising distribution teams are "central to survival" in the current constrained, limited partner liquidity environment, said Jensen. LP liquidity refers to the amount of fresh capital that limited partners — including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices or high net worth individuals — have available to commit to new funds.

"Firms are happy overpaying for fundraising talent," said Christopher Connors, a principal at Johnson Associates. "It can be a large expense to the firm, but relative to how much revenue these people could bring in, it's a good deed to the firm."

While fundraising has been challenging, many large U.S. firms are still sitting on nearly $1 trillion in undeployed capital, also known as dry powder, noted PitchBook's Kyle Walters. And with expectations of rate cuts, these firms are positioning themselves for a rebound with deeper benches of talent, he noted.

As global investment firms channel more resources into the market to ride a wave of deals and rising assets, private equity behemoth Apollo is reportedly growing its footprint in Japan and expanding hiring in its Asia wealth arm.

Similarly, Warburg Pincus and Carlyle are also increasing their presence in Japan through new hires as the country emerges as one of the few bright spots for dealmaking.

Beyond Japan, industry experts whom CNBC spoke to noted that the hiring spree cuts across all regions. Southeast Asia and India also saw hiring pick up with new offices opening in Singapore and Mumbai,  Magellan Advisory Partners noted.

Despite policy uncertainties in Washington, overall hiring in North America has surpassed mid-2022 and 2023 levels, with many U.S. megafunds and growth equity firms interviewing first-year analysts for 2026 start dates.

"This reflects the reality that demand for top junior talent in North America is undiminished; firms fear missing out if they don't engage in the recruiting race," the executive search firm said in its report.

Europe's private equity industry is also seeing stronger hiring momentum, underpinned by macroeconomic shifts such as the start of rate-cutting cycles. The Bank of England, for instance, has lowered rates five times since August last year, a move expected to fuel deal activity, exits, fundraising, and the broader private equity "flywheel," said PitchBook's Walters.

"International expansion is a common thread, with firms in the U.S. expanding into Asia and vice versa. Similarly, U.K. private equity firms often first target the U.S. before moving to Asia," noted Chris Eldridge, Robert Walters' CEO of North America, Ireland and U.K. recruitment.

Many of these firms have also started recruitment long in advance, even before potential employees are out of college, signaling a shift away from reactive hiring, he added.

There is, however, a divide between firms with scale and those with less ammunition to navigate the industry storms.

"I think there's a clear bifurcation between the largest firms [that are multi-strategy], and have economies of scale that can afford to hire," said Connors. "Whereas some of the smaller firms are struggling with fundraising…very much not hiring, really at all, and some of them are shrinking." 

As large firms go on their hiring spree, some of them are even engaging in talent wars with investment banks.

Private equity firms have long cultivated a reputation for raiding Wall Street's analyst pool, to the point where investment banks had to establish stronger boundaries recently.

In mid-2025, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan reportedly introduced tough new rules to curb poaching by private equity firms. JPMorgan warned that analysts who accept future-dated job offers from private equity firms before completing 18 months would be terminated, while threatening to fire those who miss training for job interviews.

To retain talent, the bank shortened the analyst-to-associate track to 2.5 years from the current three years. Goldman, meanwhile, rolled out a quarterly "loyalty pledge," requiring analysts to confirm they have no outside offers—though disclosure won't trigger termination.

At the junior level, the traditional investment banking analyst pipeline is being disrupted by changes in early recruiting, said Jensen Partners' Jensen.

"Banks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are tightening mobility, and [private equity firms] are responding by building in-house training programs," she said.

These moves suggest that the recruitment frenzy, where private equity firms lock in junior bankers years ahead, may become even more competitive.

Private equity careers may have an edge over investment banking because of carried interest — a share of fund profits that can far exceed annual pay and is taxed at lower capital-gains rates, Connors explained.

While junior pay looks similar in both industries, mid-levels like senior associates and vice presidents usually start receiving carried interest, he added. At senior levels, the difference is stark: a managing director might earn $1.5 million to $2 million in salary and bonus, but carried interest tied to fund performance could deliver $20 million to $30 million over time. 

"It's a significant economic vehicle that lures talent to the space," he said."It's an economic vehicle that just doesn't exist in the investment banking world, and it doesn't exist in traditional asset management. It's unique to the private markets industry," he said.

Rosé from Blackpink just secured a massive win for K-pop.

The New Zealand and South Korean singer won the "Song of the Year" award at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, for her song "APT" with Bruno Mars.

"APT," the lead single from Rosé's debut album in 2024, "Rosie," became a hit for its catchy tune and playful lyrics about a Korean drinking game. It spent 15 weeks at the top of the Billboard Global excluding the US chart.

This is the first time a K-pop song has won in the VMAs category. Previous recipients of the award were Sabrina Carpenter for her 2024 song "Espresso" and Olivia Rodrigo for her 2021 song "Driver's License."

Rosé, whose real name is Roseanne Park, was visibly emotional when she accepted the award. Through tears, she thanked Mars, whom she called her "absolute idol," for believing in her and helping her through the collaboration.

"I dedicate this award to my 16-year-old self, who dreamed, and to all those who have watched me grow into the artist that I am today, and placed their dreams in me to make this change," she said in her acceptance speech.

"And now I believe there is no imposter in the world, when MTV has given me this award here at the VMAs," she said, to cheers from the audience. She also thanked her fellow Blackpink members, Jennie, Lisa, and Jisoo.

Rosé wore a shimmery butter yellow dress for the occasion, accessorized with a tennis bracelet and dangly earrings.

In December, during its first week of release, "Rosie" sold 102,000 equivalent album units and 70,000 albums, Billboard reported.

The singer's VMA win comes as K-pop is having a cultural moment in the West. K-pop artist Felix Lee from boy band Stray Kids walked the runway for LVMH in March as its brand ambassador.

The boy band Seventeen is also making inroads into the US, with a new tour and solo collaboration tracks from members like Joshua Hong. Other group members, including the band's leader S.Coups and rapper Mingyu, have also been recognized in fashion, landing collaborations with brands like Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss.

And one of the biggest Gen Z-favorite acts of the moment is Katseye, a girl group managed by Seoul-based Hybe Entertainment.

Rosé is on Blackpink's "Deadline" world tour, with over 30 stops in Asia, North America, and Europe.

Representatives for YG Entertainment did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

President Donald Trump said foreign companies that want to do business in the US should respect the country's immigration laws and bring their workers in legally.

Trump made these remarks in a Truth Social post on Sunday. His post came after hundreds of workers were detained in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on a Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday.

"I am hereby calling on all Foreign Companies investing in the United States to please respect our Nation's Immigration Laws," he wrote.

"Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so. What we ask in return is that you hire and train American Workers," he added.

On Sunday, Kang Hoon-sik, the chief of staff to South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, said his country had concluded talks with the US on returning its detained citizens.

"Negotiations for the release of the detained prisoners have been concluded," Kang said on Sunday. "Only administrative procedures remain, and as soon as these are completed, the chartered plane will depart to take our citizens home."

Nearly 500 workers were detained at a Hyundai-LG battery facility in Georgia. Footage released by ICE showed the workers being shackled at the wrists, waist, and ankles before being led onto a bus.

The raid was part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, an official for the Department of Homeland Security told Business Insider.

"This, in fact, was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security investigations," said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, during a press conference Friday.

A total of 475 workers were detained, a majority of whom were Korean nationals, the official said. The arrests included many subcontractors, and no formal charges had been filed at the time of the press conference, the official added.

On Sunday, LG Energy Solution's chief human resource officer, Kim Ki-soo, flew to Georgia to address the fallout from the raid.

Kim told reporters before his flight that LG's "top priority" is for the "prompt and early release" of both LG's and Hyundai's employees.

"The government is also responding with all its might, and we will do our best to ensure everyone's safe and speedy return," Kim added.

Hyundai, based in Seoul, is one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers by revenue.

The Georgia battery factory that was raided is still under construction and due to open in the first half of next year. It is part of a larger, $7.6 billion operation that includes a production plant for Hyundai's electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, as well as autos for its Genesis luxury brand and sister company, Kia.

"Hyundai Motor Company is aware of the immigration enforcement action that took place at the construction site of its supplier, the HL-GA Battery Company, in Bryan County, Georgia," the company said in an updated statement.

"We are closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances. Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company," it added.

Hyundai said that it is "committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate," including employment verification and immigration laws.

Chris Susock, the North America chief manufacturing officer, is taking over the Georgia site and ensuring that subcontractors follow regulations, per Hyundai.

"As we continue to invest in American manufacturing and create thousands of jobs, we will do so in full accordance with US law and in a manner that reflects our values of treating all people with dignity and respect," the company added in its updated statement.

South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Park Yoon-joo, the country's first vice-minister of foreign affairs, expressed regret over the matter during his call with US Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker.

Park told Hooker during their call that the economic activities of Korean companies investing in the US, as well as the rights and interests of its citizens, must not be unfairly violated when the US kicks off any law enforcement proceedings.

Since the start of Trump's second presidency in January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have made arrests at a range of worksites across the country, including a meat-processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, a fire-equipment company in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and a Louisiana racetrack. Day laborers outside of Home Depot locations have also been targeted. Trump administration officials have reportedly pushed for a goal of making a minimum of 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.

Trump signed a bill into law in July that provides ICE with additional funding and resources to assist in the arrests of immigrants living in the US illegally, including enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 individuals.

The raid comes more than a month after Trump announced a new trade agreement between the US and South Korea. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most US imports from South Korea, including automobiles, in exchange for duty-free treatment on many American products.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that his country's interceptor drones struck 150 Russian long-range attack and decoy drones in a single night.

In his regular public address, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched a total of 810 drones in one wave, including over 400 Shahed loitering munitions.

His tally indicates that nearly a fifth of the drone wave was downed that evening by interceptor drones — an emerging low-cost air defense that Ukraine is rushing to produce at scale.

"Of course, not everything is being shot down yet, and we still need to further strengthen our air defenses," Zelenskyy said in his address.

Interceptor drones, originally made to catch and destroy reconnaissance craft, are high-speed uncrewed aerial systems that must fly fast enough to chase down their target midair and crash into it.

Many of these are first-person-view drones that feed live camera footage to a pilot who must fly the system into its target. With Russia's growing use of the Shahed, Ukraine is now pivoting its interceptor development to fight loitering munitions.

As with much of Ukraine's homegrown drone technology, the effort is largely decentralized, driven by a range of local manufacturers. Each produces its own drone, which is sold or donated to Ukrainian air defense troops in coordination with the government.

"This is a top priority," Zelenskyy said on Sunday. "Russians keep the number of Shaheds in massive strikes at the level of 300 to 400 per strike, and our interceptors must reach a matching level. This is realistic."

The rest of Ukraine's air defense system relies on jamming, air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and mobile fire groups, which are vehicle crews equipped with mounted machine guns.

But they've often been overwhelmed by the sheer number of drones Russia launches in one wave. Moscow has increasingly started accumulating attack drones and ballistic missiles to launch them in greater numbers at the same time.

The Shahed-136, originally of Iranian design, has been a staple of those nightly barrages. The drone is known to fly roughly at a top speed of 115 mph, so an interceptor must usually be faster to catch up to the Shahed after detecting the Russian craft.

The Kremlin also deploys a similar drone, known as the Gerbera, designed to mimic the Shahed in a bid to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses. Kyiv thus hopes interceptors can soon be used as a cheap, reliable way to counter the onslaught. One Shahed is roughly estimated to cost Russia about $35,000 per unit, while many interceptors typically cost between $2,000 and $6,000 each.

Zelenskyy said on Sunday that his government has been securing financing and contracts for interceptors.

"Developing this interceptor technology, deploying it, training crews, all of this saves lives," he said.

Ukraine said that the drone attack on Sunday — the one referred to by Zelenskyy — was Russia's biggest wave so far. Roughly 56 drones made it past Ukrainian air defenses, with at least one impacting Kyiv's parliamentary headquarters, officials said.

At least four people, including an infant, were killed in the attack, Ukrainian authorities said.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum treasury company Sharplink got a muted response from investors when it told Decrypt last week that it'll stake a portion of the $3.6 billion worth of ETH in its treasury on Linea once mainnet goes live.

The company's shares, which trade on the Nasdaq under the SBET ticker, are currently trading for $15.73, or 11% less compared to five trading days ago.

And now, it's been the case for a week that users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company DASTAN, are doubting that Sharplink will scoop up enough Ethereum to hold 1 million ETH before Sept. 16. The company currently has 837,230 ETH in its treasury, worth approximately $3.62 billion at current prices.

At the start of the month, odds flipped to 70% of users saying Sharplink, which trades as SBET, will not make it to 1 million ETH before Sept. 16. And now the pessimism is growing, with 82.5% of users doubting the company is going to hit that milestone soon.

The sagging share price and growing doubts about the pace of its ETH acquisition likely has to do with Sharplink aggressively issuing shares and diluting existing investors, Samantha Bohbot, chief growth officer at RockawayX, told Decrypt.

Sharplink has been raising money to buy ETH through equity financing, which requires it to issue new SBET shares. But each new issuance dilutes the value of the stock held by existing shareholders. The prospect that Sharplink will do that again in a way that dilutes value could be making its stock unattractive to investors, Bohbot explained.

She added that digital asset treasury, or DAT, investors don't yet seem to be interested in the prospect of holdings being used to generate yield.

“Currently, most DAT ‘investors' should be thought of more as technical traders than long-term business backers,” Bohbot said. “They are trading around the premiums of listed DAT shares versus their underlying crypto holdings, or speculating that share prices spike alongside broader crypto rallies. Few appear focused yet on whether a DAT's premium valuation is justified by its ability to generate yield above simply holding the asset.”

SharpLink Will Explore Staking Portion of $3.6 Billion Ethereum Treasury on Linea, CEO Says

That doesn't mean she thinks Sharplink's plans are a bad idea. But they're a long-term play that most investors don't place a high value on at the moment.

“We expect that to change; over time, the market is likely to differentiate DATs that successfully deliver attractive, sustainable yield on their crypto treasuries,” Bohbot said, “while those that fail to generate returns will likely trade at a discount to assets, as often befalls public holding companies.”

It's also worth noting that Sharplink already stakes a percentage of its ETH holdings on the Ethereum mainnet, so far earning 2,318 ETH (or $10 million worth at today's prices) in rewards since June. So moving ETH over to Consensys's Ethereum layer-2 network Linea is likely a bigger deal for Linea stakeholders than it is for SBET investors.

There's other factors to consider too, said James Harris, CEO of institutional digital asset firm Tesseract.

Ethereum Treasury SharpLink Adds $176 Million in ETH to Holdings

“Linea is still new and untested at scale, so investors may be wary of smart contract or operational risks that don't exist with more established custodial staking providers, though Consensys' involvement should help mitigate this concern” he told Decrypt. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Leading Ethereum development company Consensys has been central to Sharplink's ETH treasury since it was first announced in May. The company led a $425 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE, round in May. As part of the deal, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin became chairman of SBET's board and Sharplink joined the Linea Consortium.

So it's likely that Ethereum investors have been expecting Sharplink to stake on Linea for months, but as Harris pointed out, “yield terms and liquidity mechanics haven't been fully disclosed yet, making it harder for institutions to assess risk-reward.”

 The breach hit core JavaScript libraries such as chalk and strip-ansi, downloaded billions of times each week, raising alarms over the security of open-source software. 

Hackers have compromised widely used JavaScript software libraries in what's being called the largest supply chain attack in history. The injected malware is reportedly designed to steal crypto by swapping wallet addresses and intercepting transactions.

According to several reports on Monday, hackers broke into the node package manager (NPM) account of a well-known developer and secretly added malware to popular JavaScript libraries used by millions of apps. 

The malicious code swaps or hijacks crypto wallet addresses, potentially putting many projects at risk.

“There's a large-scale supply chain attack in progress: the NPM account of a reputable developer has been compromised," Ledger Chief Technology Officer Charles Guillemet warned on Monday. “The affected packages have already been downloaded over 1 billion times, meaning the entire JavaScript ecosystem may be at risk.”

The breach targeted packages such as chalk, strip-ansi and color-convert — small utilities buried deep in the dependency trees of countless projects. Together, these libraries are downloaded more than a billion times each week, meaning even developers who never installed them directly could be exposed.

NPM is like an app store for developers — a central library where they share and download small code packages to build JavaScript projects.

Attackers appear to have planted a crypto-clipper, a type of malware that silently replaces wallet addresses during transactions to divert funds. 

Security researchers warned that users relying on software wallets may be especially vulnerable, while those confirming every transaction on a hardware wallet are protected. 

Attackers sent emails posing as official NPM support, warning maintainers that their accounts would be locked unless they “updated” two-factor authentication by September 10.

The fake site captured login credentials, giving hackers control over a maintainer's account. Once inside, the attackers pushed malicious updates to packages with billions of weekly downloads.

Charlie Eriksen, a researcher at Aikido Security, told BleepingComputer the attack was especially dangerous because it operated “at multiple layers: altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what users' apps believe they are signing.”

This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Prominent NFT marketplace OpenSea said Monday that it has committed more than $1 million to acquiring culturally relevant NFTs as it charges towards the launch of its native ecosystem token, SEA.

The marketplace's reserve, called the Flagship Collection, will begin with CryptoPunk #5273, which was last purchased for $282,000 on August 25 before being transferred to a new address on Monday. After acquiring “essential pieces,” the firm aims to acquire and elevate pieces from emerging artists. 

“We've always said NFTs are culture. The Flagship Collection is about picking the pieces we believe will stand the test of time,” OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer told Decrypt.

Today we're introducing:

- OS Mobile: a beautiful trading experience powered by AI- Flagship Collection: honoring web3's cultural heritage- Final Rewards Phase: 50% of platform fees funding millions in token & NFT prizes- $SEA Update: details in early October

The firm will choose pieces for the collection using a committee of OpenSea employees and a group of external advisors with strict internal procedures in place to prevent the leak of information prior to acquisitions. 

In 2023, a former OpenSea employee was convicted in the first-ever NFT insider trading case, as the executive had purchased and profited from assets that were to be featured on the popular marketplace. The conviction was ultimately overturned this July. 

“There are a variety of elements that factor into our buying criteria, ranging from cultural significance, impact on Web3 as a whole, unique expressions of creativity and more,” OpenSea CMO Adam Hollander told Decrypt. 

“Some of the selections for the Flagship Collection will seem obvious, while others much less so,” he added. “The goal is to spotlight well-deserving artists and creators, even new and emerging ones, placing their works shoulder-to-shoulder with historical pieces that represent digital culture.” 

Beyond the Flagship Collection, OpenSea is gearing up for a final push before the official launch of the SEA token, the native ecosystem token announced by the OpenSea Foundation in February. 

Starting on September 15, the firm will begin using 50% of its platform fees to create a prize vault for the final phase of pre-token generation rewards. Additionally, it is kickstarting the vault with $1 million worth of the native tokens from Ethereum layer-2 networks Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB).

Based on activity on the platform, such as NFT and token trading and completing daily tasks, users can level-up their portion of the prize vault, which will also play a “meaningful role” at the time of the SEA token generation.

Full tokenomics details are expected to be shared by the OpenSea Foundation in early October. 

The Miami-based firm—which hit a valuation of $13.3 billion in 2022 amid the NFT boom—announced a complete overhaul earlier this year with the launch of “OS2,” a renewed vision for NFT and fungible token trading.

In July, OpenSea acquired crypto portfolio application, Rally, to level up its mobile experience. Waitlists for a revamped mobile application and an AI-focused trading experience are expected to launch in the coming weeks, the firm said Monday.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

OpenSea, the largest NFT exchange, is launching a $1 million "flagship collection" funding initiative to commemorate digital culture, according to an announcement on Monday. The so-called OpenSea Flagship Collection will include a "$1+ million commitment to acquiring, curating, and celebrating digital art and culture."

"The Flagship Collection is OpenSea's first formal NFT reserve, designed to showcase NFTs as cultural artifacts and support the artists and collectors who've shaped the space," the announcement reads, noting that this is the startup's first "formal NFT reserve."

OpenSea noted that the collection selection process is "designed to showcase NFTs as cultural artifacts and support the artists and collectors who've shaped the space," and will begin by purchasing CryptoPunk #5273. It will also be overseen by a "Committee of OpenSea employees and a small group of trusted external advisors."

Notably, this is not the first CryptoPunk to be used as a reserve asset. In July, Ethereum holding company GameSquare purchased a rare Punk NFT for $5.15 million worth of preferred shares from DeFi mainstay Robert Leshner for use as a treasury asset.

"We've always said NFTs are culture," OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer said in a statement to The Block. "The Flagship Collection is about picking the pieces we believe will stand the test of time."

In addition to announcing its new NFT reserve strategy, OpenSea also hinted at its upcoming mobile app and SEA token launch in its announcement. OpenSea Mobile will enter beta in mid-September, with waitlists opening over the next two weeks, while the OpenSea Foundation promises to share details on the token generation event in October. 

As part of the SEA token launch, OpenSea will "start sweeping millions in tokens and NFTs into a massive prize vault" using 50% of all platform fees beginning Sept. 15 that will be passed on as user rewards. Apparently, $1 million worth of OP and ARB tokens are "already loaded in the vault."

"Next week, when you log into your rewards portal, you'll receive a starter Treasure Chest. The chest can be leveled up – and the higher level your chest at the end of the session, the larger your share of the loot," the team said, explaining the gamified way users can "level up" their rewards by completing daily challenges.

OpenSea has faced criticism in the past for its internal controls. Most notably, in 2021, former OpenSea product manager Nathaniel Chastain was accused of insider trading after using confidential information to buy NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea's homepage, then selling them at a profit. Chastain was convicted of wire fraud and money laundering in 2023, sentenced to three months in prison, but the conviction was overturned last month.

Although a large part of the pandemic-era bull run, NFTs have yet to regain the cultural imagination. According to The Block's data, trading data is still a fraction of a fraction of NFT trading at its height. The number of NFT mints has also collapsed from a high of about 450,000 to under 2,000 per day.



That said, OpenSea, launched in 2017, has begun retaking that top spot as the leading NFT exchange, after a couple of months of losing out to Blur. OpenSea has also been teasing a series of product launches and improvements, as well as a native SEA token.

Ripple integration with Finastra opens access to 11,000 SWIFT-connected financial institutions. Finastra's payments hub already serves more institutions and handles about $5 trillion in cross-border flows each day.

Routing RippleNet through that middleware would give Ripple an immediate, indirect pathway to a substantial share of SWIFT's member banks.

Finastra operates a global payments service used by thousands of banks. Documents circulated publicly by industry researchers show its hub can route payments via SWIFT messaging or via alternative rails such as RippleNet.

SWIFT has not rejected blockchain outright. In 2025, SWIFT ran pilots that assessed public ledgers — including the XRP Ledger. 

The tests examined whether tokenised settlement could speed transfers and improve data richness. Those pilots do not equate to endorsement, but they do show SWIFT is exploring interoperability with token rails. (SWIFT pilot reports, 2025).

The XRP Ledger settles payments in seconds and at very low cost  — settlement times of roughly 3–5 seconds and micro-dollar fees per transfer are typical in ledger performance summaries.

By contrast, cross-border transfers via correspondent banking and SWIFT can take days and require pre-funding across multiple accounts. 

Ripple's CEO has positioned the ledger as a liquidity rail that can sit alongside existing messaging systems. In June 2025, Ripple executives reiterated that banks do not need to rip out SWIFT to use XRP for settlement; they can add it for liquidity on demand.

Banks do not adopt rails on speed alone. They adopt them where legal, compliance, and operational controls are clear.

SWIFT is a cooperative governed by its members. That governance model underpins trust and dispute resolution among 11,000 institutions.

Any material re-routing of bank liquidity to public token rails will need custodial models, settlement finality rules, and regulatory sign-offs acceptable to banks and supervisors.

SWIFT's public statements emphasise that neutrality and a legal framework are prerequisites for large-scale change.

SWIFT's network moves enormous volumes annually. Industry commentary supplies rough scenario math: even a small reroute of SWIFT flows to tokenised settlement could represent hundreds of billions, or more, in value running through on-chain rails.

Technically and practically, the plumbing is falling into place for Ripple to function as a bridge between token rails and legacy messaging infrastructures.

A Finastra integration gives Ripple a realistic path to tens of thousands of bank endpoints without forcing banks to abandon SWIFT.

SWIFT's own pilots acknowledge blockchain's promise but underscore that governance and legal enforceability are non-negotiable.

MegaETH, an Ethereum scaling network designed for transactions that process so quickly it calls itself a "real-time" blockchain, said on Monday it is launching a native stablecoin with fast-growing DeFi protocol Ethena ENA$0.7695.

The token, dubbed USDm, will be embedded closely into applications and protocols built on top of the network and aims to help keep transaction costs low on the chain by redirecting revenues from the reserve assets to subsidize sequencer costs, according to a blog post.

"USDm means lower fees for users and a more expressive design space for applications," MegaETH co-founder Shuyao Kong said in the blog post. "We are excited to work with Ethena to enable a win-win scenario for all stakeholders in our ecosystem."

The token will be backed in the beginning by Ethena's USDtb, a yield-generating token backed by BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL. Later, other and future Ethena-issued tokens may be added such USDe, MegaETH said in a blog post.

Ethena's governance token, ENA (ENA), gained 7% over the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader crypto market.

Stablecoins are a fast-growing, $270 billion group of cryptocurrencies, predominantly with prices tied to the U.S dollar. They serve as a primary liquidity and trading pairs on crypto venues, and are also increasingly used for cross-border payments promising faster, cheaper transactions on blockchain rails compared to traditional banking channels. They received a regulatory boost earlier this year in the U.S. when President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first major piece of crypto legislation in the country, into law.

MegaETH's stablecoin is the latest example of crypto ecosystems making steps to issue a proprietary stablecoin with a service provider instead of solely relying on the existing stablecoin offerings, currently dominated by Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT. 

Popular crypto wallet MetaMask recently announced the launch of its own stablecoin with infrastructure providers M0 and Stripe's Bridge, while Hyperliquid, a layer-1 network known for its popular on-chain perpetual swaps exchange, is holding an audition for a stablecoin issuer partner for its own token.

MegaETH's token plan also highlights Ethena venturing into the stablecoin-as-a-service business, helping other crypto ecosystems to issue their own stablecoins. The protocol is behind the $13 billion digital dollar USDe, which provider yield by holding spot crypto like bitcoin and ether while selling (shorting) an equal amount of derivatives to harvest the funding rate.

Christie's has shut down its digital art department, cutting staff including VP Nicole Sales Giles at the end of August, according to a report from Now Media. The auction house confirmed the move, saying digital works will now be sold within its 20th and 21st Century Art category.

The changes follow the appointment of new CEO Bonnie Brennan in February and coincide with a downturn in the digital art market. 

Christie's, which helped spark the NFT boom with Beeple's $69 million sale in 2021, later launched its onchain platform Christie's 3.0, now facing an uncertain future.

The PPA has submitted a response to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) consultation on its regulatory approach to online advertising. In our submission, we emphasised the importance of Government using its powers to create a more enabling environment for publishers, specifically by extending PECR – Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, exemptions on consent requirements to include data sharing with third parties for advertising purposes.

We highlighted that the privacy risks in this area are marginal, given the vast availability of personal data online (particularly that controlled by large platforms), and that genuine digital anonymity is now virtually non-existent.Our response also underlined that publishers cannot sustain viable advertising models on contextual or consent-less inventory alone. Continued access to personalised advertising is critical to maintaining quality, independent content and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the sector.The consultation comes as the ICO sees a change in leadership, with William Malcolm, a former Google lawyer, replacing Stephen Almond as regulatory lead. We are engaging with the ICO to arrange a meeting between Malcolm and PPA members to discuss these issues in more detail.

Kazakhstan's leader, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, is pushing for the quick establishment of a “full-fledged” digital asset ecosystem, including a state-administered crypto reserve, Akorda Press, the official press office of the President of Kazakhstan, reported on Monday.

The reserve, overseen by the National Bank's investment arm, would accumulate crypto assets deemed vital to the emerging digital financial system, according to Tokayev.

“Given the current realities, we must focus on crypto-assets. A State Digital Asset Fund should be established under the National Bank's investment corporation. This fund would accumulate a strategic crypto reserve consisting of the most promising assets of the new digital financial system,” Tokayev said.

The president urged the government and the National Bank to finalize and pass new legislation that would liberalize digital asset markets, support fintech innovation, and open the financial sector to new competitors.

The proposed banking law is expected to address how tokenized assets and fintech platforms will be integrated into Kazakhstan's regulated financial system.

Tokayev also emphasized the need to scale the country's use of the digital tenge, Kazakhstan's central bank digital currency (CBDC). The tokenized tenge has already been used to finance projects through the National Fund, and he wants to extend its use across national, local, and state-owned enterprise budgets.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin miner turned Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies has surpassed 2 million ETH in holdings, boosting its ETH treasury to a value of approximately $9 billion, the firm announced on Monday. 

BitMine (BMNR) now maintains holdings of 2,069,443 ETH, 192 Bitcoin (about $215 million worth), and $266 million in cash. 

“As we mentioned in our August chairman's message, the convergence of both Wall Street moving onto the blockchain and AI/agentic-AI creating a token economy is creating a supercycle for Ethereum,” said BitMine Chairman Tom Lee, in a statement. 

The firm also made its first strategic “moonshot” investment, investing $20 million in Eightco Holdings, an ecommerce company that is undertaking a digital assets treasury strategy centered on Worldcoin (WLD)—the native token of the World Chain network co-founded by OpenAI's Sam Altman. 

The investment is its first as part of a strategy it says is like Google's “Other Bets,” or relatively small investments that may lead to outsized returns. For the Ethereum treasury company, that means making “select investments in bold ideas that enhance Ethereum network value.” 

"BitMine wants to support and back innovative projects that create value for the Ethereum ecosystem. As an ERC-20 native token, World is aligned with Ethereum,” Lee said.

Amid news of the firm's investment, shares of Eightco Holdings (OCTO) jumped more than 3,000% to $46.01 after the opening bell on Monday. 

Shares in BMNR are also up around 0.5% in early trading, now changing hands for $42.36. That mark is down about 18% in the last month, even as it has raced out to a commanding lead in ETH holdings among treasury companies. BitMine now holds well more than double the ETH of runner-up SharpLink Gaming, which holds $3.63 billion worth of Ethereum.

Ethereum ETFs Shed $788M Over Four Days in Institutional Exodus

The firm's current holdings now exceed more than 1.7% of the entire ETH supply, enough to keep its standing as the second-largest crypto treasury among all publicly traded companies. It only trails Bitcoin behemoth, Strategy, which maintains a Bitcoin portfolio of nearly $72 billion. 

Ethereum is up 0.7% to $4,328 in the last 24 hours, but remains more than 12% off the all-time high it created in late August.

In the U.S. Senate Banking Committee's most recent version of the CLARITY Act, Bitcoin and crypto developers would be protected from being charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business moving forward — and retroactively.

On Friday, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee released its latest draft of the CLARITY Act (CLARITY), in which it proposes an amendment to 18 U.S. Code § 1960(a) stipulates that only crypto developers or providers that “knowingly exercise control over currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency” be treated as money transmitting businesses.

What is more, this amendment would not only protect Bitcoin and crypto developers in the wake of a bill with this language included in its passing, but it would also protect said developers retroactively.

In Section 501 of section Title V of the draft, entitled “Protecting Software Developers and Software Innovation,” it states that “This section, and the amendments made by this section, shall apply to conduct occurring before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act.”

If this language is included in a version of the bill that is enacted into law, Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who was found guilty of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business last month, stands to benefit.

Storm has alluded to the notion that he plans to appeal the guilty verdict, as per reporting by Eleanor Terrett.

If CLARITY becomes law and the language regarding retroactive developer protection is included in the draft of the bill that passes, Storm's legal team should theoretically have no issue winning at the appellate level.

Unfortunately, if CLARITY passes with the retroactive protections included, this will not help the Samourai Wallet Developers, who accepted a plea deal for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in July.

This most recent draft of CLARITY also stipulates that developers or providers of “non-controlling” (noncustodial) crypto technology shall not be treated as money transmitting businesses under 31 U.S. Code § 5330. This would also be applied retroactively.

Non-controlling developers are defined as those who create or work on “distributed ledger service(s), that in the regular course of operations, does not have the legal right of the unilateral and independent ability to control, initiate upon demand, or effectuate transactions involving digital assets to which users are entitled, without the approval, consent, or direction of any other third party.”

The definition applies to developers of crypto services, software, or hardware that helps customers facilitate the self custody and safekeeping of digital assets.

Congress is back in session as of September 2, 2025, and the U.S. Senate Banking Committee plans to continue to prioritize CLARITY, after accepting input on the bill from many members of the crypto industry.

“This legislative draft reflects feedback from hundreds of stakeholders on a wide range of questions as part of the Request for Information (RFI) on the July discussion draft,” a spokesperson from the Senate Banking Committee told Bitcoin Magazine. “Chairman Scott, Senator Lummis, and their colleagues will continue working in a bipartisan way to deliver a final product that will protect investors, foster innovation, and keep the future of digital finance anchored in America.”

No hearings regarding the bill are currently on the Senate Banking Committee's calendar.

Tetra Digital Group Aims to Pioneer Regulated Stablecoin Issuance in Canada




Financial service market leaders Urbana Corporation, Wealthsimple, Purpose Unlimited, Shakepay, ATB Financial, National Bank of Canada, and Shopify invest in groundbreaking digital payment initiative



TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tetra Digital Group, one of Canada's leading digital asset infrastructure providers; parent company of Tetra Trust and Tetra Unity, today announced the closing of an investment of approximately $10 million from leading Canadian fintechs and financial service providers, including Urbana Corporation, Wealthsimple, Purpose Unlimited, Shakepay, ATB Financial, National Bank and Shopify. As part of the investment, Tetra, with its partners, is aiming to be the first financial institution to launch a Canadian fiat-backed stablecoin in early 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.


This marks the first time in Canada that a regulated financial institution will work towards issuing a stablecoin and as part of a broader effort – we're inviting additional qualified institutions to join and help shape the future of Canadian digital payments. The approach will create a reliable, institutional-grade solution for Canadian dollar payments and remittances at scale; aligns with the approach taken by other G7 countries; and maintains the highest standards of Canadian regulatory compliance and consumer protection.




The new Tetra stablecoin will leverage Tetra Digital Group's institutional-grade custody infrastructure to provide businesses and consumers with a stable, secure, and fully compliant digital currency backed 1-for-1 by Canadian dollar reserves.




“Today marks a pivotal moment for Canadian financial innovation,” said Didier Lavallée, CEO of Tetra Digital Group. “By bringing together many of Canada's most trusted financial institutions and companies, we're not just launching a stablecoin – we're supporting homegrown solutions, built by Canadians, for Canadians and ensuring we maintain economic sovereignty.”




“Urbana Corporation, as a significant shareholder of Tetra Digital Group, is extremely optimistic about this exciting new initiative both for the company and Canada as a whole,” said Thomas S. Caldwell, C.M., Chairman, Urbana Corporation.




“This partnership represents a defining moment for Canada's digital economy,” said Blair Wiley, Chief Legal Officer at Wealthsimple. “Tetra has sparked nationwide enthusiasm across century-old institutions, tech leaders, traditional financial services and those at the forefront of financial innovation. It's rare for such a broad group of high-quality companies to work together on a project like this. The depth of experience at the table will create a truly Canadian stablecoin solution that will open up new opportunities for businesses, consumers and homegrown talent.”




The $10 million investment from these industry leaders demonstrates strong confidence in Tetra's positioning as a leading brand for digital assets infrastructure in Canada.




“This is a groundbreaking initiative for Canada's financial future, and we're thrilled to be part of it. Partnering with Tetra and other leading institutions to build a trusted Canadian dollar stablecoin is a natural extension of Purpose's mission to democratize access to financial innovation and strengthen Canada's role as a global leader in digital assets.” — Som Seif, CEO of Purpose Unlimited.




“At Shakepay, we've always believed in building trusted financial infrastructure that gives Canadians more choice in how they move, hold, and grow their money,” said Jean Amiouny, CEO of Shakepay. “This partnership reflects our commitment to pioneering technology that expands access to modern financial tools and doing so with the regulatory safeguards and user trust Canadians expect. We're proud to be part of a homegrown initiative that positions Canada at the forefront of digital financial innovation.”




Tetra Trust will act as issuer of the Canadian stablecoin, and will ensure full compliance with Canadian financial regulations while providing the stability and utility that businesses and consumers demand from digital asset solutions.




“As Canada's financial landscape evolves, ATB Financial is committed to supporting solutions that combine innovation with regulatory rigor,” said Daniel Ordibehesht, Head of Strategy, Corporate Development, & Ventures of ATB Financial. “We are proud to be part of the development of a regulated Canadian stablecoin, which will provide a secure and reliable foundation for digital payments and commerce, creating new opportunities for our clients and Canadian businesses.”




“National Bank is proud to join this stablecoin initiative with leading fintech partners,” said Joshuah Lebacq, Principal at NAventures. “Together, we will combine innovation with the safeguards needed to support Canadians and businesses in the future.”




Tetra Digital Group's institutional-grade digital asset solutions includes Tetra Trust, Canada's first regulated digital asset custodian, and Tetra Unity, a composable digital asset orchestration platform. This integrated approach enables the company to provide end-to-end digital asset solutions while maintaining the regulatory excellence that institutional clients require.

 Forward Industry's $1.6 billion SOL corporate treasury would be nearly triple the size of the largest existing Solana reserve. 

Nasdaq-listed design and manufacturing company Forward Industries secured $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoin commitments to launch a Solana-focused crypto treasury strategy. 

The company said Monday that it raised the largest Solana (SOL) treasury to date, led by crypto-native companies Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital. Other participants included C/M Capital Partners, which is one of Forward Industries' existing shareholders. 

This follows a Bloomberg report in late August saying the three crypto giants were planning to raise $1 billion and take over a publicly-traded company to create the biggest crypto treasury dedicated to Solana.

According to the announcement, Forward plans to position itself as a publicly traded institutional vehicle. It plans to generate onchain returns and long-term value by participating in the Solana ecosystem.

Forward said Galaxy Digital will provide treasury management, trading, lending and staking services. Jump Crypto will support infrastructure through projects such as Firedancer and DoubleZero, while Multicoin Capital will offer strategic guidance and governance.

Multicoin co-founder and managing partner Kyle Samani is expected to be chair of Forward Industries' board of directors. 

Samani said the move reflects conviction in Solana's resilience and growth potential, arguing that an institutional-scale treasury can “increase SOL per share at a faster rate than simply being a passive holder.”

He also said SOL is still misunderstood and discounted by market participants despite being resilient. “I believe this asymmetry creates tremendous opportunity for a Solana treasury strategy,” Samani added.

Forward's $1.6 billion Solana reserve would nearly triple the size of the largest existing Solana treasury. At the time of writing, supply chain management brand Upexi holds the largest SOL holdings with 2 million SOL tokens, worth about $430 million at current market prices. 

Following this, the DeFi Development Corporation said on Aug. 4 that it held 1.29 million SOL, worth about $280 million. In July, Bitcoin mining firm Bit Mining announced plans to raise between $200 and $300 million to build a SOL token treasury.

Pump.fun's native token PUMP has recovered its ICO level, trading close to $0.005. The token drew attention in the past week with strong growth, as whales returned. 

Pump.fun is drawing the attention of whales, both on the spot market and on Hyperliquid. After an initial round of selling, PUMP is now interesting again, with 110% growth from its local lows. 

PUMP recovered to $0.0048, with a growing share of activity on Hyperliquid, surpassing even the Bybit trading pairs. The expanded open interest and spot trades revived PUMP, which initially was considered a token at risk of failing. 

In the past months, Pump.fun itself acquired more than 5.84% of the supply, using most of its daily fees to re-acquire the token and reimburse creators. 

High-profile whales are shifting the narrative on PUMP. However, the recent market moves are trying to challenge the predominant bearish position. 

On Hyperliquid, over 51% of whales still hold short positions, putting the token among the less bullish assets. Recently, one large-scale trader started opening leveraged long positions, getting exposed to risk on the narrative change. 

One of the closely watched whales holds three positions with varied levels of unrealized profit and loss. 

A whale created 3 wallets to go long on $PUMP with 5x leverage in the past 8 hours, with a total position of 1.31B $PUMP($6.3M).https://t.co/mp5FUivNwfhttps://t.co/SzSkzVZW9ahttps://t.co/Nn04wAu49x pic.twitter.com/BvHbs15cu0

The whale opened up to $6.3M in long positions. Currently, PUMP still has a skew toward short trading, much more bearish than overall assets on Hyperliquid. 

While Hyperliquid still has a relatively small market share, the public positions of whales are used as a signal for conviction. PUMP is still seen as potentially undervalued and pressured by sellers. 

The Pump.fun ICO happened at a relatively weak moment for the platform. The token was sold at record speed, placing $500M in just 12 minutes. However, in the days after the token unlock, PUMP was sold quickly, while the meme platform noted slower activity. 

Since the ICO token launch, most metrics for Pump.fun have improved. In August, the platform habitually carried 16K to 24K daily token launches. 

Since the beginning of August, Pump.fun also saw a robust fee recovery. At one point, fees fell as low as $500K daily.

Recently, the platform logged over $5.7M in daily fees, a level not seen since February. The platform is capable of producing $1B in daily fees, which is seen as a favorable metric compared to the PUMP market value of $4B. Compared to other networks, PUMP is considered undervalued, especially if selling stops and Pump.fun buys back more tokens. 

PUMP may also rally during another SOL season. SOL already expanded to $213.37, breaking out in the new week. 

For Pump.fun, however, the trenches are not back as during previous launches. Most of the new tokens are still made by a handful of top creator wallets, currently competing for rewards. Token creation picked up after Project Ascend boosted compensations by 10X. 

On-chain data, however, shows that some of the new token projects are still at risk of rug pulls, crashing soon after reaching peak valuation. Pump.fun has also attempted to create more sustainable projects by paying early token startups for marketing and social media presence.

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

When Arianna Simpson was 22 years old, she plowed her savings into Bitcoin. She had left her college job and traveled with a friend through Zimbabwe, witnessing firsthand the consequences of hyperinflation. When she returned, she became enamored with the idea of crypto as a potential salve. 

Aside from investing the contents of her bank account, Simpson started a blockchain lunch meetup at her next post, Facebook. She wrote a blog post on multisignature wallets that landed her a job at the infrastructure startup BitGo, where she became the third employee. (More than 10 years later, BitGo is set to go public, though Simpson sadly left before her shares vested.) 





Instead of sticking it out in the early crypto startup trenches, Simpson moved into venture, first working at a friend's generalist firm before starting her own crypto fund, Autonomous Partners, which raised from Brian Armstrong, David Sacks' Craft Ventures, and Steve Cohen's family office. This was 2017, when crypto was beginning to explode into the mainstream, and Simpson invested in companies like Talos and Mythical Games. Through Armstrong, she also met Katie Haun, a Department of Justice prosecutor-turned-a16z investor, who convinced Simpson to come on board. 





Simpson joined a16z crypto as a deal partner in 2020. She liked that the firm had stayed in blockchain during the quiet times, which isn't the case for many of the larger venture operations (even today, blue-chip names like Accel and Bessemer have mostly stayed away since the 2022 collapse). “I had a lot of respect and appreciation for the fact that the firm, despite being like an institution, had taken this category seriously,” Simpson says. 





It turned out to be a prudent decision. Simpson came on right at the start of the boom years, which included a16z crypto's landmark $2.2 billion third fund in 2021 and $4.5 billion fourth fund in 2022. And amid power players like Chris Dixon and Haun, she made a name for herself investing early in companies like Blackbird, the dining rewards startup created by Resy cofounder Ben Leventhal, and Phantom, the crypto wallet recently valued at $3 billion. 




Now a general partner, Simpson's approach has been to target founders, rather than just thematic areas, understanding that the best builders will be drawn to the most promising technology at the moment, whether it's stablecoins or the intersection of crypto and AI. “It's more about following the trends of entrepreneurs than it is unilaterally trying to decide what's interesting,” she says. “As an investor, your job is to shift your attention to find it.”

BitMine Crypto + Cash Holdings Exceed $9.211 billion, including 2.069 million ETH Tokens

BitMine announces $20 million strategic investment into Eightco Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: OCTO) as first "Moonshot" investment for BitMine

BitMine remains supported by a premier group of institutional investors including ARK's Cathie Wood, MOZAYYX, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital to support BitMine's goal of acquiring 5% of ETH

LAS VEGAS, Sept. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) BitMine Immersion Technologies ("BitMine" or the "Company") today announced crypto + cash holdings exceeding $9.21 billion. As of September 7th at 8:30pm ET, the Company's crypto holdings are comprised of 2,069,443 ETH at $4,312 per ETH (Bloomberg), 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and unencumbered cash of $266 million.

BitMine crypto holdings reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc (MSTR), which owns 636,505 BTC valued at $71 billion. BitMine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. 

"BitMine has surpassed the 2 million ETH milestone this past week. As we mentioned in our August Chairman's message, the convergence of both Wall Street moving onto the blockchain and AI/ agentic-AI creating a token economy is creating a supercycle for ethereum. And the power law benefits large holders of ETH, hence, we pursue the 'alchemy of 5%' of ETH," said Thomas "Tom" Lee of Fundstrat, Chairman of BitMine. "At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock."

Additionally, BitMine is today announcing it has made a $20 million strategic investment into Eightco Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: OCTO) as part of OCTO's $270 million PIPE. OCTO announced it is adopting a first-of-its-kind strategy to acquire the Worldcoin (WLD) token as its primary treasury asset. Worldcoin, an ERC-20 token, captures a zero-knowledge proof of a person's humanity, a critical asset in an increasingly agentic-AI world.

This strategic investment into OCTO marks the start of BMNR's "Moonshot" strategy to back bold ideas that strengthen Ethereum's vast ecosystem. As previously discussed in BitMine's corporate presentation, BitMine allocates around 1% of its balance into investments to strengthen the ethereum ecosystem and to create value for BitMine equity shareholders.

"BitMine wants to support and back innovative projects that create value for the Ethereum ecosystem. As an ERC-20 native token, World is aligned with Ethereum. World's unique zero-knowledge Proof of Human credential could be essential to future trust and safety between technology platforms and the billions of human users," said Lee.

The GENIUS Act and SEC's Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold.

"We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years," continued Lee. "Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today's financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum."

BitMine is now one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $1.7 billion (5-day average, as of September 5, 2025), ranking #30 in the US, behind Bank of America Corp (rank #29) and ahead of Exxon Mobil Corp (rank #31) and Costco Wholesale Corp (rank #32) among 5,704 US-listed stocks (statista.com and Fundstrat research).

With 10+ years of writing experience, I am a Crypto Journalist by chance, exploring, and learning all the dynamics of the sci-fi action-filled crypto world. Currently, focusing on cryptocurrency news and price data. With a passion for research and challenging my capabilities, I am slowly getting into the crypto arena to bring new insights every day.

Bitcoin price today stays strong around $110K while analysts debate long-term forecasts from $250K to $13M.

Ethereum eyes $10K, Solana and XRP attract institutional interest, and Chainlink expands adoption.

With supply tightening and demand rising, the next 3 weeks could bring major moves in both Bitcoin and leading altcoins.

Bitcoin is holding strong around $110,000, showing resilience after recent volatility. At the center of discussions is Michael Saylor's bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $13 million per coin by 2045. While the figure sounds extreme, many note that previous milestones like $10,000 or even $100,000 once seemed impossible until they became reality.

Saylor believes Bitcoin's network effect will continue to drive adoption and price growth, creating a cycle where higher demand leads to higher prices, and vice versa.

According to Dr. Jeff Ross, a macro strategist, Bitcoin is actually undervalued today. He estimates its fair value above $140,000 based on global liquidity. He argues that broader economic uncertainty has delayed growth, but once conditions improve, Bitcoin could climb rapidly.

Meanwhile, Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, believes this market cycle may stretch into 2026, with Bitcoin potentially hitting $250,000 before cooling down.

The case for Bitcoin remains tied to its limited supply. With ETFs, sovereign funds, and institutions buying aggressively, analysts warn there isn't enough Bitcoin to meet demand. However, they caution that market peaks often come when hype is at its highest, making timing critical for investors.

While Bitcoin dominates headlines, Ethereum is quietly strengthening its Wall Street presence. With exchange balances at a nine-year low and no downtime in over a decade, some analysts expect a supply squeeze that could push Ethereum well beyond $10,000.

Other altcoins are also gaining attention:

Institutions are diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, giving altcoins a growing spotlight in the next phase of the market.

Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

Strong institutional accumulation, significant exchange outflows reducing sell pressure, and positive sentiment around Bitcoin's long-term value are driving the market upward.

Some altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are gaining momentum due to unique catalysts, though Bitcoin remains the dominant force in terms of institutional inflows.

Ethereum (low exchange balances), Solana (developer activity), XRP (regulatory clarity), and Chainlink (real-world data use) are displaying strong bullish trends.

Key events include potential Fed rate decisions, regulatory developments, and broader macroeconomic data that influence investor sentiment and liquidity.

Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by institutional accumulation and long-term bullish predictions, though short-term volatility remains a concern.

When XRP launched, its pitch was bold—become the digital rail for banks, the SWIFT killer for cross-border settlements. More than a decade later though, the banking world hasn't quite signed on. Instead, giants are tinkering with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and building their own internal rails. Some critics, especially folks from the Chainlink community, have even called this a loss for XRP. But that's not the whole story. The token has carved out new paths—smaller maybe, but meaningful—that keep it relevant and growing.

One of XRP's strongest lanes now is retail remittances. In countries like Mexico, the Philippines, Nigeria, and India, millions of workers rely on cross-border transfers to support families. Every second saved and every fee cut matters. Platforms like goLance, led by Michael Brooks, are already using XRP to pay freelancers instantly and cheaply. For workers earning around $50 a week, waiting days or losing 10% to bank fees isn't an option. XRP fixes that. With the global remittance market near $860 billion, this “people's rail” narrative could quietly become XRP's new backbone.

Small and mid-sized businesses are another opportunity. They don't need to overthrow banks—they just want faster, cheaper ways to pay suppliers, freelancers, or teams abroad. XRP offers that. Take SBI Japan in 2023: they launched an XRP-based service for remittances into the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Using XRP as a bridge currency, funds move quickly and land in local currency with minimal cost. This shows adoption can grow steadily outside traditional finance, especially in high-volume corridors across Asia.

The future isn't only about remittances or payrolls. XRP could play a role in the online economy too. Think micropayments for gaming, streaming, IoT devices, or even automated API calls. Bitcoin's Lightning Network and stablecoins are popular here, but XRP's speed and low fees make it a natural contender. On top of that, the XRP Ledger itself is expanding—decentralized exchanges, tokenized assets, automated market makers, even NFT projects are springing up. As stablecoin issuers join the XRPL, XRP's value as a bridge and liquidity asset grows stronger.

Looking further ahead, XRP might also find a niche as a reserve-like asset. With transaction fees gradually burning XRP supply, scarcity could make it attractive as a hedge in a CBDC-heavy world. It doesn't need to replace the dollar or euro. Just being an alternative allocation in portfolios could support long-term value.

The idea that XRP's success depends entirely on banks is outdated. Instead, XRP has found new legs—from remittances and SME payments to IoT micropayments and tokenized assets. Each use case may be smaller than the original “bank rail” dream, but together they create a diverse foundation that keeps XRP alive and kicking. Banks may hesitate, but XRP still has plenty of ways to win.

Christian Catalini, who created Meta's Libra, believes Stripe's Tempo could be doomed since permissionless networks are the future.

Christian Catalini, co-creator of Meta's now-defunct Libra project, took to X to explain how Stripe's Tempo blockchain fails one of the basic tenets of the crypto movement: decentralization.

In fact, Catalini believes that if Stripe's Tempo succeeds commercially, it would mean that early crypto idealists will have to embrace a future where the original ethos of decentralization is lost. Catalini used the example of Libra's failure to demonstrate his point.

Catalini noted that in the tech and finance industry, being too early to the market is almost the same as being wrong. In his post, Catalini wrote:

“Looking back on Libra, the stablecoin project I helped design inside Meta, I can confirm we weren't just early; we were also comically, spectacularly wrong.”

Besides the unfortunate timing, several other factors contributed to Libra's ultimate failure. This included the “Silicon Valley hubris—the belief that elegant code can simply wish away centuries of financial regulation,” Catalini wrote.

Additionally, Facebook's aggressive marketing of Libra not only drew more attention, but also provided ammunition to its opponents.

According to Catalini, there is a prevalent misconception that Libra failed because it could not meet regulatory guidelines. However, the opposite is true, Catalini wrote, adding:

“The reality is that we were on the verge of becoming the most buttoned-up, regulator-friendly crypto project on the planet.”

Catalini wrote:

“The problem with corporate chains like Tempo isn't a matter of code—it's a matter of incentives. We already know the script.”

This is how corporate blockchains usually work: a tech firm creates a blockchain and promises fairness. But after capturing a substantial chunk of the market, the temptation to tilt the playing field in their favor becomes nearly irresistible.

And “crypto's purpose is to break this cycle of broken promises,” Catalini wrote, adding:

“It's the same fundamental economic truth we identified at MIT almost a decade ago: the only thing that truly separates crypto from the systems it aims to replace is that it's permissionless.”

Libra engineers decided to sacrifice the permissionless aspect of the network. Similarly, the network had to also scrap its plan of non-custodial wallets because regulators would not approve of it. Regulators needed to know who to call or fine when things go wrong, he explained.

“A world where users truly control their own money is messy, borderless, and doesn't fit that legacy blueprint. For them, killing self-custody wasn't a choice, it was an obvious necessity based on the tools they understood.”

According to Catalini, if corporate blockchains like Tempo and Circle's Arc succeed, it would indicate that “the crypto experiment was not a revolution, but a failed coup.” This is because while the backend technology will be different, the market structure will remain “eerily familiar,” he wrote.

In fact, Catalini described it as a change of kings while the throne remains the same—fintech giants will replace existing card networks and financial institutions. He further surmised that it is likely the markets in the West and the East will be controlled by at least two competing empires.

Catalini believes that if Libra's demise could be wholly chalked up to bad timing, then Tempo's success is nearly inevitable, given the change in regulatory stance. And in such a case, “the crypto world's original dreamers may finally have to accept a more pragmatic, centralized reality.”

However, he warned:

“But if Libra's ghost is a warning about a fundamental truth—that any system with a single architect is built on a fatal flaw—then Stripe is not writing a new story. It is merely staging an entertaining, and very expensive, sequel.”

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Bitcoin's price remains tightly range-bound around $110,000, reflecting a subdued market awaiting next week's highly anticipated U.S. interest rate decision.

According to The Block's crypto price page, bitcoin rose 0.44% in the past 24 hours to trade at $111,074 as of 12:22 a.m. on Monday. 

The prices came in sticky despite the fact that August's nonfarm payrolls in the U.S. rose by 22,000, significantly under the estimated 75,000. The weaker data indicates that the U.S. economy may be cooling down, which could give the Federal Reserve more reason to consider an interest rate cut.

As the Federal Reserve's rate decision on September 17 draws near, the CME FedWatch Tool indicates a 100% probability of a rate cut. While a 25 basis point reduction is widely expected, the tool shows a 10% chance that the Fed opts for a larger 50-basis-point cut.

"The soft U.S. jobs report did create expectations for a more dovish US Federal Reserve, which is normally supportive for risk assets like bitcoin," said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. "However, the market had already priced in some degree of policy easing. At the same time, we're seeing profit-taking by institutional desks, while ETF flows remain relatively flat."

Lucas said the combination of the two has currently capped bitcoin's upward momentum, keeping the cryptocurrency consolidating in a tight range.

Even if the Fed decides to lower rates, bitcoin prices could remain subdued, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu told The Block.

"A cut may reflect economic weakness, while sticky inflation and cautious risk sentiment limit risk appetite," Liu said. "Without stronger ETF inflows or real liquidity expansion, $120K+ remains a tough barrier."



Both bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds saw weaker flows in the first week of September compared to August or July, when inflows hit record highs. As the current market cycle has been largely driven by institutional capital, less robust ETF flows may reflect a cooling in overall market momentum.

Meanwhile, BTC Markets' Lucas said the current key support is at $110,000. 

"As long as Bitcoin holds that level, market structure remains constructive," Lucas said. "Resistance sits at $113,400, with further levels at $115,400 and $117,100. Breaking those barriers would suggest the market has absorbed recent selling pressure and is ready to retest the highs."

Beyond next week's FOMC meeting, analysts advised traders to watch for both on-chain and off-chain potential market catalysts.

"On-chain, stablecoin supply is near record highs, creating dry powder for potential rallies, while exchange balances for bitcoin and Ethereum continue to decline, easing near-term selling pressure," Lucas said. "Off-chain, regulatory developments such as the SEC and CFTC's push for harmonized frameworks, along with ETF flow data, remain key sentiment drivers."

Kronos' Liu also noted that the FOMC meeting's impact on prices could be amplified by the U.S. initial jobless claims report released the following day.

A crypto strategist known for his timely Bitcoin (BTC) calls says he has his eye on two large-cap altcoins.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 50,400 YouTube subscribers that he's bullish on Ethereum (ETH), despite failing to sustain a rally after printing a new all-time high.

According to the trader, Ethereum appears to be in the process of flipping a major resistance level into support, which would put ETH in a stronger position to reach new all-time high territory.

“Ethereum still looks incredibly good. We had the beautiful, the magnificent, nobody's ever seen it, this beautiful descending broadening right angle wedge – a breakout from that, and really the measured move, whether you go log or linear again [is] $6,500 and $9,000…

Ethereum even though we have this measured move $6,500 or $9,000, you have the prior all-time high resistance. [You] can't overlook it. 

So even though there's the measured move from the broadening wedge, it paused at all-time high [level], so that's resistance. You've got support here, and very simply, Ethereum is pretty easy to mark up here because you're going to zoom in and you're going to say, if I get a shot, if I get a bullish retest, a throwback, $3,950, $4,000, I'm jumping in, and you've got your overhead level. Very well described.”

At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $4,279.

Another coin on the trader's radar is Solana (SOL). According to Cheds, Solana appears to be working its way up above $200, but it's struggling to do so. However, Cheds says that Solana will likely continue to climb as long as bulls defend a key level.

“It's grinding higher. It doesn't have a straight-up breakout feel, and a lot of people keep getting these early [failed breakouts]. It's grinding. It's breaking out and pushing back into the range, but what's most notable is this rising demand trend. 

More aggressive buyers along the way. I think as long as that continues, despite the choppy breakout nature, I think it's likely to continue. It looks pretty good to me. For me… I'd love to buy back at $180. That's kind of the key level for me still.”

At time of writing, SOL is trading for $200.

Our brains seem to respond to specific colours in a similar way. Credit: Hispanolistic/Getty

Is the colour you see the same as what I see? It's a question that has puzzled both philosophers and neuroscientists for decades, but has proved notoriously difficult to answer.

Now, a study that recorded patterns of brain activity in 15 participants suggests that colours are represented and processed in the same way in the brains of different people. The findings were published in the Journal of Neuroscience on 8 September1.

“Now we know that when you see red or green or whatever colour, that it activates your brain very similarly to my brain,” says study co-author Andreas Bartels, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Tubingen and the Max Planck Institute, both in Tubingen, Germany. “Even at a very low level, things are represented similarly across different brains, and that is a fundamentally new discovery.”

Bartels and his colleague Michael Bannert wanted to explore how different colours are represented in parts of the brain associated with vision, and how consistent this is across different people.

The pair used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activity in the brains of a group of participants while they viewed different colours. This allowed them to create a map of brain activity that showed how each hue was represented neurologically. They then trained a machine learning model called a linear classifier on this data, and used it to predict which colours were being viewed by members of a second group of study participants, on the basis of their brain activity.

Extreme heat may affect added sugar consumption through the increased intake of drinks and frozen desserts, but such an impact is rarely quantified. Here, using individual transaction-level data for US households in 2004–2019, we find that added sugar consumption is positively related to temperature, notably within 12–30 °C at a rate of 0.70 g °C−1. This is primarily driven by the higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and frozen desserts. The magnitude of such impact is larger among households with lower income or educational levels. Our projections indicate a substantial nationwide increase in added sugar consumption of 2.99 g per day by 2095 (or equivalently 5 °C warming level), with vulnerable groups at an even higher risk. Our results highlight the critical need to mitigate health risks from the over-intake of added sugar and to explore dietary adaptation to climate change.

Climate affects food consumption and nutrition through multiple pathways. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns influence crop yields1,2, crop nutrient contents3,4, seafood abundance and distribution5,6, and livestock health and productivity1,2, which impact food prices7, nutrient adequacy8 and nutrition-associated diseases9. Extreme weather events can disrupt transportation and distribution networks, threatening food security10. Climate-related factors, such as changes in carbon dioxide levels, can lower the nutritional quality of crops4. Despite the large body of literature on the supply side, few studies have evaluated how climate affects dietary demand. Hot weather may increase the need for hydration as higher metabolism increases water loss11,12. High temperatures often drive individuals to consume chilled items such as frozen beverages and desserts13. As a result, climate change could exacerbate excessive added sugar consumption with critical health consequences, especially in countries and regions accustomed to consuming food and drinks with an intensive sugar content.

The socio-economic heterogeneity of climate impacts on the demand side calls for further exploration. Differences in sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, food choices and nutritional quality across socio-economic groups have been well documented, particularly in the USA and other high-income countries14,15,16. Lower income, lower educational attainment and certain ethnic groups are associated with a lower intake of nutrients and poorer dietary quality, mediated by socio-economic characteristics such as dietary knowledge, food affordability and accessibility, cultural norms and the food environment. How climate change interacts with socio-economic inequality to affect nutritional quality has been examined, although predominantly on undernutrition issues in developing countries, such as sufficient food supply and affordability17. A more nuanced examination of the moderating effect of socio-economic drivers is required for developing targeted interventions and policies aimed at promoting healthier dietary habits and reducing disparities in added sugar consumption across different population groups.

Excessive consumption of added sugar has substantially increased the risk of obesity, various metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other health complications18. Individuals aged 2 years and above consumed over 70 g (17 teaspoons) per day in 2017–2018, far surpassing the dietary guidelines of less than 10% of daily calories from added sugars, equivalent to about 60 g on a 2,400 calorie diet19. The American Heart Association recommends even lower limits of 24 g for women and 36 g for men20. In this study, we examine the impact of weather conditions on added sugar consumption in the USA during 2004–2019. Using household-level food purchase scanner data, we quantitatively estimate how meteorological factors affect added sugar consumption and investigate the sources of added sugar from various food groups. We further explore the socio-economic and geographical heterogeneity of the effect based on a rich set of consumer characteristics nationwide. Finally, future added sugar intakes are projected in climate scenarios to provide policy implications for food and nutrition interventions.

We first examined how monthly average temperature affects averaged daily added sugar consumption per person, adjusted to the calorie requirement of an adult male to exclude the effect of physical differences due to age and sex (Methods). Added sugar consumption increases with temperature (Fig. 1a), mildly below 10 °C and 12 °C (approximately 0.09 grams per degree celsius per capita-day), then steeply between 12 °C and 30 °C (approximately 0.70 grams per degree celsius per capita-day), before plateauing or even declining beyond 30 °C, which should be interpreted with caution as only 0.8% of observations go beyond 30 °C (Fig. 1a). The results are similar for unconverted, actual consumption (Fig. 1a). Wind speed shows a significant negative impact (−1.14 g m−1 s), precipitation has a positive impact (+0.06 g mm−1) and relative humidity has negligible impact (Supplementary Table 3).

a, The total effect of temperature on added food consumption. b, The effect of temperature on added food consumption by food groups. Food groups were identified using the WWEIA food categories (Methods and Supplementary Table 1), which provide an application to analyse foods and beverages as consumed in the American diet based on the FNDDS. The statistics are from two-sided t-tests based on regression analysis, and complete results are presented in Supplementary Tables 3 and 9. The shaded areas show the 95% confidence intervals (mean ± 1.96 s.e.m.).

The monthly average temperature may even out the possible impacts of extreme heat. We used the daily mean temperature to calculate the number of days within specific intervals per month for robustness checks (Supplementary Table 8), in 2 °C increments with separate categories for extreme cold (<0 °C) and extreme heat (>30 °C). The results confirm increasing added sugar consumption with rising temperatures, with the effect intensifying as temperatures increase. While the impact remains relatively modest and less statistically significant in lower temperature ranges (0–20 °C), a marked escalation in consumption occurs when temperatures exceed 20 °C, peaking in the 24–30 °C range. Notably, positive effects persist even above 30 °C. We also adopted a 5 °C interval classification (Supplementary Table 8). A 5 °C interval classification yields similar trends but with slightly weaker coefficients at high temperatures. These results imply that the potential impacts of extreme heat may be obscured, reinforcing the value of granular temperature stratification.

We further examined the temperature effects by breaking down the added sugar into different food groups (Fig. 1b). Sweetened beverages emerge as the main driver, with consumption rising sharply between 12 °C and 30 °C (added sugar, 0.73 g °C−1). The consumption of frozen desserts increases much slower (0.06 g °C−1). Sugar from bakery goods, oils and raw sugars slightly decreases, suggesting a potential substitution towards more chilled, hydrating items. Above 30 °C, consumption growth from beverage slows, but declines from bakery goods, oils and sugars persist, explaining the downwards trend in total added sugar intake at higher temperatures (Fig. 1a).

These effect probably stem from physiological and psychological demand for fluids and refrigerated products in warmer weather, or weather-based promotion strategies. To disentangle these factors, we controlled the average price per 100 g of the major food groups (Supplementary Table 10). Prices of sugar-added beverages and bakery goods negatively affect added sugar consumption, whereas price increases in added sugar-free drinks such as 100% juice (distinguished from the ‘fruit drinks' as the former does not contain added sugar while the latter belongs to the subcategory of SSBs), milk and diet beverages significantly increase the consumption of added sugar, indicating a possible substitution effect. However, price volatility was low (s.d. ~0.02) and temperature effects remained stable, indicating that this increase is more likely attributed to physiological and psychological factors. Still, temperature change does facilitate promotion, as the product price drops in hotter days (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. 3).

We also tested for heterogeneous responses using segmented linear regression to identify vulnerable groups (Methods). Compared with the binned approach, segmented regression reduces the number of parameters in a model, thereby allowing for more robust estimates when breaking down data further by ethnic or socio-economic groups. Added sugar consumption is less responsive to temperature among higher educational levels and higher income groups (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Table 14), with those earnings >US$100,000 or holding post-college education showing near indifference. The effects are consistent across male and female heads (Methods). Variations across ethnic groups are substantial: most ethnic groups exhibit similar positive marginal effects within the temperature range of 12–30 °C, whereas the Asian group shows a nonsignificant reaction.

We divided the household income into five income groups according to the data collection methodologies of Nielsen Company (annual income <US$24,999 (very low), US$25,000–49,999 (low), US$50,000–69,999 (medium), US$70,000–$99,999 (high) and >$100,000 (very high)) and categorized the work environment based on the occupation of male/female heads into indoor and outdoor settings. The statistics are from two-sided t-tests based on regression analysis and the complete results are presented in Supplementary Tables 14 and 15. The graphs on the right show the slopes of the linear model at 0–12 °C (n = 2,736,315) and 12–30 °C (n = 4,116,587) respectively, and the vertical lines show the 95% confidence interval (mean ± 1.96 s.e.m.). The analysis is based on a total sample size of n = 6,908,936.

The limited responsiveness of high socio-economic status groups to weather changes may stem from experience of different micro-environmental temperatures, particularly at workplaces. Stratification by working environment (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Table 15) shows significant differences for male heads but only minor differences for female heads. Correlation analysis also reveals a stronger income–education link among male heads (Supplementary Fig. 5). The higher income and/or higher education groups may also opt for healthier food and drink choices out of health concerns, reflected in their lower added sugar consumption (Supplementary Table 3), although they demonstrate a larger increase in juice, which is not necessarily healthy due to the free-sugar content (Supplementary Tables 19 and 20). Moreover, they are less responsive to product promotion in hot weather as their purchase prices remain steadier across categories (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 13), probably leading them to select lower-sugar beverages for hydration.

Since sugar-added beverages are the major contributors to the increased added sugar consumption, we examined how different beverages respond to temperature (Fig. 3). While plain water and SSB consumption rose markedly, shifts in other drinks were modest (100% juice and alcoholic beverages) to negligible (others). Higher socio-economic status showed smaller responses across all drink types regardless of whether they are healthy or not (Supplementary Fig. 9), possibly due to a higher consumption of tap water, which lowers purchase needs, though only differences in sugar-added beverages and plain water are not statistically significant (Supplementary Tables 21 and 22).

The statistics are from two-sided t-tests based on regression analysis and complete results are presented in Supplementary Tables 19–21. Household income was categorized as defined in Fig. 2.

Climate background may also affect behavioural responses. Residents in historically hotter areas may be acclimatized and less reactive to temperature rises, as seen in other behaviours such as air conditioner purchasing21. Analysis by climate zones classified by the US Department of Energy Building America Program22 indicates minimal response in the Hot–Humid Climate Zone in the southeast coastal area but largest responses come from the Marine Climate Zone in the northwest coastal area (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 16). Nevertheless, the differences are not statistically significant.

Drinking habits may also play a role, with heavier drinkers of SSBs being more responsive as found in the previous studies23,24. Our examination shows that the heavier drinkers (SSBs ≥150 g with added sugar consumption ≥45 g, above the recommendations of 36 g added sugar for male adults20, with statistics indicating that US adults consumed 145 kcal day−1 from sugary drinks in 2011–2014 from the USA25) do have a significantly larger response compared with other groups (Supplementary Table 18 and Supplementary Fig. 8).

We projected added sugar consumption changes using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations from 25 models under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-85 (SSP5-8.5) scenario. As we found no significant difference in the effect of temperature across regions with distinct background climate, either in terms of cooling degree days (CDDs) (Supplementary Table 17 and Supplementary Fig. 7) or climate zones (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 16), we used the nationwide segmented linear regression model (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4) to void small-sample bias above 30 °C. Based on an overall temperature increase of 5 °C from 2019 to 2095 and other changes in meteorological data, we project a daily added sugar consumption of 2.99 (1.40–4.62) grams per person per day on average by the end of this century. This increase has a clear seasonal cycle, with up to 3.81 grams per person per day in summer, 3.83 grams per person per day in autumn and only 1.26 grams per person per day (Fig. 4a). Although the mid-latitude continent experiences the greatest warming during winter, we find consistent warming rates (4.6–5.4 °C) over the USA throughout the year. Hence, the increased added sugar consumption from seasonality is primarily due to different sensitivity associated with distinct baseline seasonal temperatures (3.3 °C on average in winter, but between 12 °C and 30 °C in other seasons; Supplementary Table 23). Geographically, the northern USA sees the largest projected increase (Fig. 4b), probably due to temperature increase and sensitivity of added sugar intake. Despite the higher temperatures in southern counties, summer temperatures frequently exceed 30 °C (Supplementary Fig. 10) with climate change, resulting in a slower growth in the annual average added sugar consumption growth compared with northern states.

Spring: March, April and May; summer: June, July and August; autumn: September, October and November; winter: December, January and February. The distribution in a shows the temperature distribution for 2019 and 2095 for all climate models, with an average temperature increase of approximately 5 °C. The annual line and shaded area in a and the dots and vertical lines in c show the annual mean and the lowest and highest predictions of the n = 25 models in 2095, respectively. Household income was categorized as defined in Fig. 2.

The socio-economic breakdown show the highest increase is up to 6.2 (3.9–9.3) grams per person per day for households that have a male head with a graduate school education. The increase reaches 3.5 (2.3–4.8) grams per person per day and 4.9 (2.4–7.2) grams per person per day for households that have a female head without a high school degree or household income less than US$25,000, respectively. The change in consumption is about 3.4 g for white people and exceeds 2.6 g for black people and other races, while the change in consumption of the Asian group is not significant (Fig. 4c(i–iv)).

We also project added sugar consumption changes using 16 models under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, which represents some intervention in human activities and results in a temperature rise of about 2.3 °C in 2095 relative to 2019. The results based on the degree of climate change under this scenario are about half of those under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Tables 25 and 26).

This study explores the impact of weather on added sugar consumption in the USA from 2004 to 2019 using household-level food purchase scanner data. We find that added sugar consumption increases with temperature, especially between 12 °C and 30 °C, which slows down above 30 °C, possibly due to physiological responses such as appetite suppression. The increase is mainly driven by SSBs such as soda and juice, and frozen desserts such as ice creams and gelato. Lower-income and lower-education groups exhibit stronger responses, indicating heightened vulnerability. Projections show that future climate change will aggravate health risks related to added sugar intake, particularly for socio-economically disadvantaged populations whose average daily intake already exceeds 10% of the recommendations from the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans26 and almost 20% of the recommendations from the American Heart Association20.

Our analysis provides empirical evidence on the impacts of weather conditions on added sugar consumption for cost-effectiveness analyses of sugar reduction programmes and policies under climate change. The results also highlight the urgent need to tackle nutrition and health inequalities exacerbated by climate change, identifying key populations for targeted interventions. Considering fine-tuned food policy in adapting to climate change, our analysis provides implications for achieving several Sustainable Development Goals, including No Hunger, Good Health and Well-being, Climate Action and Reduced Inequality. As the over-intake of added sugar and climate-related risks have both become pressing global concerns27,28, our analysis informs food policy and climate change adaptation strategies, not only in the USA but also in other countries with increasing nutritional and health challenges.

Several limitations should be noted. The Nielsen data cover retail purchases but exclude restaurant meals and food received without purchase. Nevertheless, our main results still hold unless weather significantly affects the added sugar consumed via different channels. Moreover, our analysis reflects household-level purchases rather than individual intakes as data on post-purchase food storage, food waste and intra-household food allocation are not available. This discrepancy may be more pronounced for bulk-purchased or long shelf-life items (for example, granulated sugar and coffee/tea), raising potential issues if high-sugar items in such categories are stored for extended periods rather than consumed within a month and/or if temperature changes influence the allocation of sugar between presweetened products and sugar added manually (for example, blending the granulated sugar with coffee and tea). However, these effects are probably minimal as SSBs, as the main driver, are typically consumed immediately rather than stored for long time, and both granulated sugar and coffee/tea show relatively low sensitivity to temperature variation. Shifts in intake or waste ratios at higher temperatures are probably secondary as well. Furthermore, nutritional content is approximated by linking product labels with the USDA food content table. While the match considered the labelling information of products with low sugar or no sugar available in the Nielsen dataset, some mismatches may still exist as the variety of food products consumed in the real market can be different from that available from food content tables. In this way, the dependent variable may incur a random measurement error, which does not introduce bias but can lead to larger standard deviations of estimates. This leads to only minimal impacts on our findings as the significance of the regression analysis remains robust in various tests. The Nielsen data remains as the only dataset, to our knowledge, with high temporal resolution that allows us to capture the fluctuation of food consumption along with weather changes. Nevertheless, trackable intake records at the individual level should be addressed in future data infrastructure construction for more accurate estimates for the USA, as well as for other countries and regions.

These findings underscore the urgent public health implications of climate-induced dietary changes, especially for low socio-economic groups and particularly during warmer temperatures. The USA needs to further strengthen its policies aimed at reducing the intake of added sugars, especially from SSBs, in the context of climate change. While SSB taxation has been effective in reducing purchases in certain US cities and around the world29,30, the nationwide implementation of such taxes could face crucial challenges and delays. Additionally, proposals to modify the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to encourage the purchase of healthier items face considerable debate and are slow to implement31. Continuous nutritional education programmes and nutrition warning labels on SSBs32 should also be considered and prioritized moving forwards. As consumers become increasingly health conscious, there is a potential for the industry to respond by reformulating products to reduce the sugar content in beverages.

Our findings also provide important implications for public health in the context of climate change adaptation. The results demonstrate potential adverse health impacts associated with weather-induced shifts in dietary behaviours, emphasizing the need for potential policy interventions for added sugar intake in the context of climate change. This is particularly crucial in minimizing the additional disease burden and mitigating escalating medical costs for conditions attributed to excessive sugar consumption. Moreover, our research stresses the importance of targeting disadvantaged groups in interventions under climate change who exhibit a more substantial response to temperature-induced changes, potentially due to less mindful choices or constrained options with budget limitations33,34 and less control of the occupational/living environmental temperature.

Our results and policy implications offer insights not only for the USA. Given that the USA encompasses a diverse range of climate types found across many countries and regions, the conclusions of our study have broad applicability and relevance on a global scale. Therefore, these findings apply both to other developed countries and to nations in the global south27, such as Brazil35, South Africa36 and Mexico37,38, owing to changes in the food environment and increased purchase power that raises the accessibility and affordability of added sugar39. While progressive public health measures, such as soda taxes and front-of-pack labelling, have been implemented in some countries in both the global north and global south, dietary challenges persist due to the learning process of policy intervention lagging behind the rapid changes faced by consumers40. In developed countries where regulations have been put in place, sugar intakes have only begun to decline in recent years and it remains at high levels causing considerable health challenges41,42. Additionally, climate-related factors pose shared challenges: rising global temperatures are expected to exacerbate health risks, particularly for populations in both developed and developing nations with a high proportion of individuals working in nonclimate-controlled settings. Together, these factors intensify the health risks associated with dietary shifts driven by climate change27. Future research could add more on-the-ground evidence of how weather and climate affect the physical and psychological demand for food in various geographical and socio-economic backgrounds to address the urgency for strategies for safeguarding nutrition and health.

We used the food purchase data from the Nielsen Homescan Consumer Panel dataset as a proxy of food consumption of the households in the sample. The dataset tracks the product purchase records from 40,000–60,000 US households, with sample sizes varying by year. The same households are tracked for multiple years before replacement and thus constitute a longitudinal panel. The purchase records contain detailed transaction information including the Universal Product Code, product name, quantity, price and promotions of each product purchased, as well as the date of the trip and the county of the store. The food items cover all retail outlets across the USA except Alaska and Hawaii, though consumption data at restaurants are not included. The dataset also collects the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the households such as the income, education and occupation of male and female heads; as well as the age, sex and ethnic group of each member; the county of the residence and so on. The panel is nationally representative with a sampling weight applied. The dataset is available from 2004 to 2023, and we excluded the data after 2019 to avoid the confounding effects from COVID-19. Although the purchased foods can be stored rather than consumed in a short period, this issue is partially relieved in our analysis since (1) we focus on monthly food consumption, (2) most products with high added sugar content such as sweetened beverage are typically consumed within a short period following purchase, unlike items that are often stored for extended durations before use such as flour and (3) even for the items that are likely to be stored such as sugar, our analysis provides conservative estimates (in which the purchase of sugar is less immediately responsive to changes in the temperature).

We focus on all the food items to retrieve the consumption of added sugar for each household. Unfortunately, the nutrition facts are not directly available from the Nielsen dataset, and a direct search to obtain these nutrition facts using the product name is not feasible as only the abbreviation of the name is available other than the 716 product modules, which describe the nature of the products (sweetened beverage, cake, ice cream and so on) and special characteristics (low sugar, zero sugar and so on) in the Nielsen dataset. Therefore, we match the products with the items in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS)43, which is updated every 2 years and describes the amounts of nutrients/food components in the most common foods and beverages consumed by Americans. Since the majority of food items stay the same, we adopted the 2017–2018 version for matching. We conducted multiple rounds of manual matching with the description of more than 6,000 food items in the FNDDS, after which a manual check was conducted to randomly sample the Nielsen products and inspect their matchings to ensure that the matches best reflect the nutrition facts of the products. For some food ingredients that are not included in FNDDS, such as cake flour and beverage powders, we used the Food Patterns Equivalents Ingredients Database (FPID) to complete the matching, which is an equivalent ingredient database developed based on multi-ingredient foods in FNDDS. To demonstrate the response by product categories, we used the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) categories, which provide a concise division of food items with nutritional implications and are directly available for every food item in FNDDS. For the FPID-matched items, we manually assigned the WWEIA category. A full relation between Nielsen products and WWEIA categories is available in Supplementary Table 1. Note that such method can only quantify the added sugar consumption rather than the actual intake, the limitation of which is examined in ‘Discussion' section.

The ground-station level meteorological records are from Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)44, which provides daily meteorological records, including atmospheric temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity and so on. We matched each household with all the climate stations within a 100 km buffer of the county where it is located, similar to previous research21. The spatial distributions of the stations and the counties in which data are available are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The records of the matched climate stations were then averaged to indicate the meteorological condition that the household was experiencing during a specific day.

The specification was constructed as

where \({y}_{{irt}}\) is the indicator related to added sugar consumption per capita per day in household i in month r of year \(t\). Despite the consumption data being available from every trip that the households make, the location of the destination stores and the date for making the trip can be affected by the weather16. Particularly, unpleasant weather would lower the shopping frequencies since people tend to avoid outdoor travelling45. As a result, regression at the trip level may show a smaller correlation between high temperatures and added sugar consumption, potentially leading to an underestimation issue. Therefore, we aggregated the data at the monthly level to avoid the capture of such confounding effects with the change of product type and quantity sustained. \(f\left({\mathrm{temp}}_{{irt}}\right)\) is a response function of temperature, describing how each household reacts to a particular temperature level in consuming added sugar and other food and nutrient components. The vector \({\bf{W}}_{{irt}}\) contains other meteorological variables including precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity and its squared terms. \({\bf{H}}_{{irt}}\) is the vector of household characteristics including the household income, household size, educational level and age of male and female head, presence and age of children, marital status and ethnic group. Among them, the original income is a categorical variable representing nominal annual income ranges. It is converted to a continuous variable by assigning mid-point values, simplifying high-income categories to 150,000, adjusting for inflation (2010 as base year) and standardizing by dividing by 10,000 to reflect real purchasing power in 10,000 units for regression analysis (Supplementary Table 2). Notably, the Nielsen survey employed a stratified sampling design to ensure sample representativeness, balancing nine key household characteristics including household income, which was categorized into six distinct levels for stratification purposes. Based on this framework, we combine two adjacent middle-income tiers (US$25,000–34,999 and US$35,000–49,999) to create a five-category structure for subsequent heterogeneity analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 2c. We also include fixed effects for household (\({\alpha }_{i}\)), the interaction between month of year and climate zone (\({\gamma }_{{rc}}\)) and the interaction between year and climate zone (\({\lambda }_{{tc}}\)). The classification of climate zones are classified by the US Department of Energy Building America Program in determining the standards of building construction22. This classification provides a concise way in separating the background climate. The error term \({\varepsilon }_{{irt}}\) is clustered at the county level.

Multiple indicators related to added sugar consumption are examined as \({y}_{{irt}}\). We first adopted the actual per-capita added sugar consumption, which distorts the discrepancy between the age–gender distribution of average energy requirements and that of sugar consumption thresholds. We thus converted the per-capita consumption to adult male equivalents to allow for better standardization and comparison of consumption across different age and gender groups46. Since the Nielsen data provide consumption data for the entire household rather than each member, we standardized sugar consumption using the total energy requirement ratio between all the true household members and the adult equivalent members. Here, we first defined adult males as men aged 18–29 years, and for infants under 1 year old, we calculated them as 11 months. We then calculated the conversion ratio using the average energy requirement (AER) for energy of a specific age and gender with physical activity level values of 1.6 (replaced with 1.4 when children aged 1–3 years) provided by European Food Safety Authority using the following equation:

The adult male equivalent per-capita consumption of added sugar can then be adjusted by dividing the actual per-capita added sugar consumption by this conversion ratio.

Multiple forms of \(f\left({\mathrm{temp}}_{{irt}}\right)\) are included in our analysis. We ran the binned model for the main results with \(f\left({\mathrm{temp}}_{{irt}}\right)={\sum }_{j}{\beta }_{1j}{\mathrm{temp}}_{{ijrt}}\), in which \({\beta }_{1j}{\mathrm{temp}}_{{ijrt}}\) are a set of bins indicating whether the monthly average temperature falls into a specific interval. We set 2 °C for each interval to allow a high resolution in detecting the possible nonlinear effect of temperature. The results show that all the outcome variables are monotonically increasing with temperature (Fig. 1). The default group in the final regression was set as the lowest temperature level (≤0 °C). We also conducted robustness checks, replacing \({\sum }_{j}{\beta }_{1j}{\mathrm{temp}}_{{ijrt}}\) by the CDDs and heating degree days (HDDs) aggregated to the monthly level (Supplementary Table 5). These two measures are used to estimate energy demand for heating or cooling buildings as a proxy of how much the atmosphere temperature is beyond the thermal comfort of human being. The CDD is calculated when the outdoor temperature exceeds a base temperature (for example, 18 °C or 65 °F), indicating a need for cooling, while the HDD is calculated when the temperature falls below the base, indicating a need for heating. In addition, we completed a robustness check using interactions of education (male head and female head) with month and year as fixed effects in the model and find that there is no critical change in the results (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). We also reran the regression analysis including food price as a control to explore whether the weather fluctuation covariates with price changes. To include food category prices in the regression analysis and eliminate the impact of price changes, we calculated the monthly average price of each food category based on the purchase data of each household trip. To exclude outlier influence, we remove the top 5% of all purchase prices, and then averaged the monthly average price of each food category in each county according to the county where the household was located. We also checked the results by removing the top and bottom 5% price outliers (the low price is probably due to the discount and redeem of vouchers, but can also be due to misrecording, and the regression results do not change, as shown in Supplementary Table 10). However, some counties may have missing prices because no households purchased them. We first tried to replace them with the annual average price of the same county. In the case of missing values, we used the national average price of the same month. Furthermore, we used 2010 as the benchmark and used the food inflation index to eliminate the impact of inflation. We evaluated multicollinearity in the price model using variance inflation factor tests. The results show that, except for relative humidity and its squared term, all other variables had adjusted generalized variance inflation factor values within acceptable thresholds (<2), indicating no severe multicollinearity issues in the model (Supplementary Table 11).

We then conducted a spline regression, which exhibits higher sensitivity to changes in the independent variables compared with the binned model but provides more flexibility in capturing the potential nonlinearities of temperature compared with the CDD and HDD method. Based on the results of the binned model, the spline model divides the temperature range into three segments: 0–12 °C, 12–30 °C and above 30 °C, which allows us to better capture the growth rate of added sugars in different temperature ranges. The spline model also provides a smaller number of temperature variables to facilitate the tests on heterogeneous effects that require interaction terms between temperature indicators and the socio-economic characteristics of the households, which could otherwise involve too many regressors in the binned model. Note that we do not use the interaction above 30 °C in the heterogeneity analysis due to the insufficient number of observations so that the slope is same for all groups in this temperature interval.

Meteorological variables for projected climates are from the CMIP6. Here, we used monthly surface temperature (tas), rainfall (pr), wind (sfcWind) and relative humidity (hurs) from the r1i1p1f1 run of SSP5-8.5 (2015–2100) experiments from 25 models (ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, AWI-CM-1-1-MR, CanESM5, CanESM5-1, CAS-ESM2-0, CESM2-WACCM, CMCC-CM2-SR5, CMCC-ESM2, EC-Earth3, EC-Earth3-CC, EC-Earth3-Veg, EC-Earth3-Veg-LR, FGOALS-f3-L, FGOALS-g3, FIO-ESM-2-0, INM-CM4-8, INM-CM5-0, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-LM and NorESM2-MM). We subsampled model outputs at the grid box in each county with the 100 km buffers for spatial join. Although other SSP scenarios are available, we used the highest emission scenario (SSP5-8.5) to test the widest possible warming range, and results are also reported as a function of the global warming level47.

When a county covers more than one grid box, we used the averaged value. To account for possible model biases in climatology, we calculated anomalies relative to simulated 2015–2023 monthly climatology and added observed climatology over the same time interval48. Bias-corrected simulations were further averaged using a 9-yr running smoother to dampen interannual variability. The projection of added sugar consumption was then calculated using equation (1). Multimodel mean results are shown in Fig. 4, and descriptive statistics for individual models are listed in Supplementary Table 24.

The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is Earth's most abundant photosynthetic organism and crucial to oceanic ecosystems. However, its sensitivity to a changing climate remains unclear. Here we analysed decade-long field measurements using continuous-flow cytometry from our SeaFlow instrument, collecting per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence and size data for ~800 billion phytoplankton cells across the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean to quantify the temperature dependence of cell division. Prochlorococcus division rates appear primarily determined by temperature, increasing exponentially to 28 °C, then sharply declining. Regional surface water temperatures may exceed this range by the end of the century under both moderate and high warming scenarios. Under these future conditions, our global ocean ecosystem model suggests a possible 17–51% reduction in Prochlorococcus production in tropical oceans. Even with the inclusion of hypothetical warm-adapted strains, models show significant production declines in the warmest regions, suggesting that thermal adaptation may not prevent negative impacts. These results highlight the potential vulnerability of Prochlorococcus-dependent marine ecosystems to future warming.

Global warming is pushing sea surface temperatures and ocean stratifications to record levels1, with predictions that by 2100, much of the tropical and subtropical surface oceans will regularly exceed 30 °C (ref. 2). Such changes in ocean conditions threaten marine ecosystems, potentially leading to the extinction of key species due to profound and complex impacts on the competition and distribution of organisms3. Microscopic, unicellular phytoplankton are fundamental to the function of marine ecosystems as their photosynthesis generates the organic carbon consumed by other organisms. However, as future oceans warm and become more stratified and circulation patterns change, the flow of deep-water nutrients essential for phytoplankton growth may decrease4,5, potentially favouring smaller phytoplankton species that are more efficient at nutrient uptake6,7. This shift towards communities dominated by small phytoplankton is expected to alter carbon cycling within ecosystems as their rapid turnover and slow sinking rates may lead to increased nutrient cycling in surface waters6, less efficient transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels and reduced sinking of organic carbon to the deep ocean8. And yet, our understanding of how small phytoplankton will respond to future ocean temperatures remains largely based on laboratory studies using model organisms9,10, which cannot recapitulate the complexity of interactions and genetic diversity found in natural populations. Here we document the in situ thermal sensitivity of natural populations of the keystone cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, revealing a decrease in division rate at high temperatures. Our numerical simulations predict that rising temperatures will decrease Prochlorococcus biomass production in future oceans, potentially triggering cascading effects throughout open ocean food webs.

The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the smallest (0.5–1 µm) and most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. It inhabits over 75% of the world's sunlit surface oceans, thriving in the nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical waters where it contributes nearly half of the phytoplankton biomass11. Due to its small size and ability to genetically adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions12, Prochlorococcus is predicted to reach even greater dominance in future warmer oceans owing to its potential range expansion towards the poles and an increased relative abundance under the low-nutrient conditions predicted for more stratified oceans13,14. The extent to which these predictions based on laboratory experiments reflect the true thermal sensitivity of Prochlorococcus in diverse, more complex communities remains uncertain, partly owing to the limited availability of cell division rate estimates for natural populations, a challenge compounded by the difficulties of conducting non-disruptive measurements at sea15.

Over the past decade, we have deployed our continuous-flow cytometer, SeaFlow16, on 90 research cruises, to collect per-cell fluorescence and light scatter data—optical measurements that reveal cell type and cell size, respectively—for approximately 800 billion phytoplankton cells less than 5 μm in size, including Prochlorococcus (Methods), across 200,000 km of surface ocean17. We generated 180 cell division rate estimates for Prochlorococcus populations using hourly binned size distributions in a size-structured matrix population model18, a mathematical approach that tracks how cell size distributions change over time as cells grow and divide (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Methods). These estimates are derived from changes in the relative cell size distribution rather than cell abundance, which avoids the confounding effects of mortality agents such as grazing. The model uses Bayesian inference and retains only estimates with strong model fit and convergence, excluding those with abrupt changes in size distributions that can arise when sampling across different water masses containing Prochlorococcus populations with distinct cell sizes. This non-disruptive approach requires no manipulations or incubations, providing in situ division rates comparable to estimates from dilution experiments and cell cycle analysis19,20,21,22. To broaden the spatial coverage of Prochlorococcus's distribution range, we complemented our data with publicly available data from cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 and dilution experiments that estimate Prochlorococcus division rates from shipboard incubations24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 (n = 114; Extended Data Fig. 1).

a, Geographic distribution of daily division rates derived from the matrix population model (n = 180 independent samples), along with publicly available data from dilution experiments24,26,27,28,29,30,31 (n = 103 independent samples) and cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 (n = 11 independent samples). The vertical bars represent methodological uncertainties associated with the matrix population model and cell cycle analysis; uncertainty estimates were not reported for dilution experiments. The inset map shows sampling locations coloured by methodology. b–e, Relationships between division rates and environmental variables: daily average seawater temperature (°C) (b), daily average photosynthetically active radiation (light, µmol E m−2 s−1) (c) and phosphate (d) and nitrate (e) concentrations (nmol l−1). Temperature and light were directly measured in situ for all methodologies. Nutrient data sources varied by methodology: for the matrix population model, 21 out of 180 measurements came from direct observations and 159 out of 180 came from the Mercator-PISCES biogeochemical model; for cell cycle and dilution experiments, 65 out of 114 included measured nutrient data while the remainder was omitted from the plot. Statistical relationships were assessed using ordinary least squares regression with two-sided tests (α = 0.01). The black line in b shows a second-order polynomial regression fit (P = 5.746 × 10−9), while the black lines in c–e show linear regression fits to the respective environmental factors. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were applied.

Our results reveal high variability in the division rates of Prochlorococcus across latitudes, highlighting the complex interactions of temperature, nutrient and light availability on its growth (Fig. 1a) and motivating evaluation of the individual effects of each of these parameters. We observed a notable nonlinear relationship between division rate and temperature (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2), with an initial increase in division rate followed by a decline at high temperatures, a pattern consistent across multiple cruises, locations and methodologies. A second-order polynomial regression fit to the data reveals a significant positive linear term (1.58 ± 0.28, P < 0.001), supporting the previously observed increase of division rate with temperature20, but also a significant negative quadratic term (−0.85 ± 0.28, P = 0.003). Light intensity and nutrient concentrations showed less pronounced effects within the observed ranges, with non-significant terms in their regressions (Fig. 1c–e and Supplementary Table 2). Across all environmental conditions, in situ division rates of Prochlorococcus never exceeded 1.6 d−1, equivalent to a population doubling time of about 10.5 h, with the highest values observed in tropical Atlantic24 and Indian Oceans23.

Given the apparent impact of temperature on Prochlorococcus division rates, we analysed the maximum division rates (top 80%) across various sea surface temperatures for each method (that is, the matrix population model, dilution experiments and cell cycle analysis) (Fig. 2a). This approach minimized potential confounding effects of the methodology and environmental conditions to better determine the upper limit of the division rate at a given temperature (Extended Data Fig. 2). The analysis revealed that maximum division rates increased exponentially with rising temperature up to an in situ threshold of approximately 28 °C. Above this temperature, maximum division rates declined sharply, with a nearly threefold reduction by 31 °C, comparable to rates observed at ~19 °C. This decline appeared primarily driven by temperature (generalized additive model: P < 0.001; generalized linear model: P < 0.004), while the effects of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were not statistically significant within the observed ranges (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). Importantly, we have not observed the high division rates predicted by exponential thermal curves (>2.5 d−1 at 30 °C; solid line in Fig. 2a) even in warmer regions such as the Indian Ocean, where nutrient conditions are more favourable (Extended Data Fig. 2), further supporting our findings of thermal limits in Prochlorococcus communities. Although environmental factors interact in complex ways and are difficult to disentangle in natural phytoplankton communities, the field-observed patterns mirrored the thermal responses of 13 Prochlorococcus culture isolates grown with sufficient light and nutrient-replete conditions37,38,39 (Fig. 2a). We should note that only 2 of these 13 isolates originated from regions where annual mean sea surface temperatures exceed 28 °C, indicating that our culture collection does not fully represent Prochlorococcus from the warmest waters (Extended Data Fig. 3). Similarly, most of our field measurements come from cooler subtropical waters rather than warmer tropical regions, so we might be missing important data on Prochlorococcus that live in the hottest parts of the ocean. Despite this geographical sampling bias, culture isolates often show broader temperature tolerances than their isolation environment would suggest40. The slightly lower division rates in cultures compared with natural populations further highlight the challenge of extrapolating laboratory findings to natural communities, as culture conditions cannot fully replicate the complex interactions with other marine microorganisms that influence Prochlorococcus growth in its natural environment. Notwithstanding these inherent limitations in both field sampling coverage of the warmest ocean regions and laboratory culture representation, the remarkable consistency between laboratory cultures and field observations across different methodologies and ocean regions indicates that Prochlorococcus growth rates probably do not increase exponentially beyond a temperature threshold of approximately 28 °C (solid line in Fig. 2a).

a, Maximum division rate (top 80%, d−1) of field populations, estimated from the matrix population model (n = 100 independent samples, blue circles) and from data compilations of dilution experiments24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 (n = 45 independent samples, orange circles), cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 (n = 9 independent samples, red circles) and culture isolates37,38,39 (n = 94 independent samples, white squares) grown under nutrient-replete conditions, plotted as a function of daily average seawater temperature (°C). The solid and dashed lines represent the 99th quantile regression fits using a standard exponential curve and a metabolic theory approach, respectively. Shading around the dashed line indicates the standard deviation of 1,000 bootstrap replicates. b, Cell abundance (106 cells l−1) as a function of temperature, where points represent the median values of the top 80% of abundance measurements observed at each temperature bin. Data combine hourly binned SeaFlow measurements and compiled datasets14,23,43, with colour coding representing the number of observations at each temperature. The error bars show the 5th and 95th percentiles within the top 80% subset. The red boxes highlight the observed detrimental effects of warm temperatures on the organism (>28 °C). The inset maps show the geographical distribution of sample locations, with samples collected in water above 28 °C indicated in red.

The thermal sensitivity observed in natural populations of Prochlorococcus can be captured using a metabolic reaction function (dashed line in Fig. 2a), which incorporates the thermal sensitivity of enzyme kinetics, directly linking temperature changes to changes in metabolic rates10. This unimodal thermal response better captures Prochlorococcus temperature dependence than the traditional exponential curve approach (mean squared error of 0.11 and 0.79, respectively) that uses a Q10 temperature coefficient—a measure of how much growth rate changes with a 10 °C increase (solid line in Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 4). However, this Q10 function fits better for Synechococcus, the second smallest phytoplankton, across many ecotypes (Extended Data Fig. 4). The Q10 formulation also fits better for species groups within other taxa (for example, diatoms, coccolithophores)41,42. By contrast, the exponential curve predicts unrealistically high maximum division rates for Prochlorococcus above 28 °C (solid line in Fig. 2a), overlooking its actual thermal sensitivity.

Building upon these observations, we investigated the relationship between slower division rates at higher temperatures and population abundances by combining our hourly average Prochlorococcus cell abundance data (n = 12,814) with those from compiled datasets14,23,43 (n = 5,386). We identified three distinct thermal responses: below 19 °C, Prochlorococcus abundance maxima (top 80%) increased exponentially with temperature; between 19 °C and 28 °C, abundance maxima leveled off despite exponentially increasing division rates, suggesting a proportional increase in mortality rates (Fig. 2a); and above 28 °C, maximum abundances began declining, with cell abundances reduced about twofold by 30 °C (Fig. 2b). Synechococcus abundances did not show a similar decline at high temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 5), maintaining populations in waters above 28 °C where Prochlorococcus abundances decrease. This differential response provides additional evidence against nutrient limitation as the primary driver of decline. If nutrient limitation at high temperatures were responsible, we would expect Synechococcus, with larger cell sizes and higher nutrient requirements, to be more severely affected than Prochlorococcus. This contrasting pattern supports our findings that direct temperature stress, rather than nutrient limitation, is the dominant factor causing the observed decline in both Prochlorococcus division rates and abundance at the warmest ocean regions.

We explored how our findings might affect future ocean ecosystems by integrating the observed Prochlorococcus thermal sensitivity into a comprehensive three-dimensional numerical ecosystem model within a global circulation framework42. The model simulates the distribution and fitness of many functional groups, including heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophs, mixotrophs and zooplankton types, linking physiological traits to biogeochemical function and cell size through size-dependent power laws (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Methods). Changes in population biomass are based on growth, grazing, mortality, sinking, and ocean fluid dynamics and mixing effects44. For all functional groups except Prochlorococcus, we incorporated exponential thermal response curves (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4) for both growth and grazing rates. This Q10 parameterization aligns with previous studies for all other autotroph functional groups, including Synechococcus45,46 (Extended Data Fig. 4). However, for Prochlorococcus specifically, we implemented the metabolic thermal response curve from our data, with decreased division rates above 28 °C (dashed line in Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). To project future impacts, we compared a baseline ocean derived from pre-industrial conditions (1860; Methods) with end-of-century conditions under two different climate scenarios (Supplementary Table 5). The first scenario projects stabilized greenhouse gas concentrations at ~650 ppm CO2 equivalent by 2100 (similar to the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 4.5), while the second assumes high emissions leading to CO2 equivalent concentrations of ~1,370 ppm by the end of the century (similar to RCP 8.5). These scenarios result in a 1.9 °C and 3.8 °C increase in average sea surface temperatures and a nearly 6% and 9% reduction in nutrient supply in the sunlit surface waters, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Methods).

Our model incorporating Prochlorococcus's upper thermal limit predicts a substantial decrease in both depth-integrated biomass (Extended Data Fig. 7) and production (Fig. 3a,b,g,i and Extended Data Fig. 8) in the tropical regions where future surface temperatures are projected to exceed 28 °C for much of the year (Extended Data Fig. 6). By 2090–2100, Prochlorococcus production in tropical regions will decline between 17% and 51% depending on whether moderate or high warming scenarios unfold (Supplementary Table 6). Regions such as the Western Pacific Warm Pool face particularly severe impacts, with our model predicting a near-complete collapse of Prochlorococcus populations (Fig. 3g,i). Thermal stress, not decreased nutrient supply, drives this decline (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 6), supporting our observations (Fig. 2b). Despite habitat expansion into warmer, higher latitudes, global Prochlorococcus production will decline by 10–37% depending on the climate scenario (Supplementary Table 6). These substantial changes exceed the interannual variability in model projections by an order of magnitude (Methods and Supplementary Table 6) and will occur even under a moderate warming scenario, highlighting the potential threat to these foundational organisms. These projections contrast sharply with simulations relying on the more typically used exponential thermal response curve (solid line in Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4), which instead forecasts moderate increases in annual Prochlorococcus production (18–30% under different scenarios) (Fig. 3a,b,h, j, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 6).

a–f, Latitudinal change (%) in depth-integrated biomass production for Prochlorococcus (a,b), Synechococcus (c,d) and all other phytoplankton (e,f) using either a standard exponential curve (grey) or a metabolic reaction approach (red) that relates the Prochlorococcus division rate to temperature, with shading representing longitudinal variation from the mean (s.d.). g–r, The corresponding maps illustrate the percentage change in depth-integrated annual biomass production for Prochlorococcus (g–j), Synechococcus (k–n) and all other phytoplankton (o–r) projected under the two thermal norm assumptions and two climate scenarios. The white areas in d–i indicate that the phytoplankton type does not exist in those regions either pre-industrially or by the end of the century. Values of 100% increase indicate an expansion in the geographical range.

As Prochlorococcus declines owing to the unimodal nature of its thermal norm, our model projects a compensatory increase from Synechococcus, seen in both increased biomass (Extended Data Fig. 7) and production (Fig. 3c,d,k,m). This compensation appears the strongest in tropical regions, where Prochlorococcus decline is most severe, resulting in an 11–34% increase in mean depth-integrated annual Synechococcus production across climate scenarios (Supplementary Table 6). Notably, this pattern of Synechococcus thriving in the very regions where Prochlorococcus populations collapse, such as in the Western Pacific Warm Pool, further supports that temperature stress, not nutrient limitation, is the primary driver of Prochlorococcus decline. As warming enables range expansion towards the poles, global Synechococcus production increases by 5–20% depending on the climate scenario (Fig. 3c,d,k,m and Supplementary Table 6). Larger phytoplankton, primarily picoeukaryotes, show modest changes with production decreasing 4–7% (Fig. 3e,f,o,q and Supplementary Table 6). These results contrast sharply with projections assuming exponential Prochlorococcus temperature response, with a 15–26% decrease in Synechococcus production and a 6–11% decrease for larger phytoplankton across climate scenarios (Fig. 3c–f,l,n,p,r and Supplementary Table 6).

We created an in silico warm-adapted strain with an increased thermal tolerance to evaluate the potential impacts of Prochlorococcus populations adapted to warmer temperatures that were not included in the current metabolic response model. We reasoned that these warm-adapted populations could come to dominate future oceans either because they currently exist within regions not covered in our current dataset or because they emerge over time through adaptation or mutation and selection in response to continued warming ocean conditions. We retained the metabolic response function for these warm-adapted strains, increasing the optimal temperature from 28 °C to 30 °C and the maximum division rates from 1.3 d−1 to 1.6 d−1 (Supplementary Fig. 4), a temperature shift comparable to that observed for Synechococcus following long-term thermal tolerance experiments47. Given that nutrient limitation has been shown to lower optimal temperature and reduce division rates in diverse species of phytoplankton, including cyanobacteria48, this thermal shift represents a reasonable upper bound on thermal adaption in Prochlorococcus. At the global scale, replacement of the observed thermal sensitivity (Fig. 2a) with the enhanced thermal adaptation into our global ecosystem model partially mitigates the negative impacts on Prochlorococcus production (Fig. 3), resulting in a projected 6% increase under moderate warming and a 7% decrease under high warming in global Prochlorococcus production (Fig. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 6). Under the high warming scenario, Synechococcus production increased by only 2% when competing with warm-adapted Prochlorococcus strains (Fig. 4c,d) and the larger phytoplankton groups showed moderate production decreases (7–9%) under the same conditions (Fig. 4e,f). Enhanced temperature adaptation proved effective in maintaining Prochlorococcus populations in tropical regions where temperatures remained below the warm-adapted strain's temperature threshold. However, even with increased thermal tolerance, significant production declines still occurred in the warmest tropical regions under the high warming scenario (15%; Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 6), suggesting that thermal adaptation may delay but not prevent the negative impacts of ocean warming on Prochlorococcus.

a–f, Latitudinal change (%) in depth-integrated biomass production for Prochlorococcus (a,b), Synechococcus (c,d) and all other phytoplankton (e,f) comparing the standard metabolic reaction model (blue) with a warm-adapted variant (red) for Prochlorococcus. The lines represent the mean across longitudes, and shading indicates longitudinal variation (±s.d.). Both projections use the same future climate scenario (2090–2100) and pre-industrial baseline (1860) as Fig. 3.

The thermal sensitivity observed in natural populations of Prochlorococcus suggests fundamental physiological constraints that distinguish it from larger phytoplankton. Our findings show that Prochlorococcus division rates increase exponentially with temperature up to approximately 28 °C, then decline sharply at higher temperatures. This thermal response differs markedly from that of Synechococcus and other phytoplankton groups, whose growth rates continue to increase at temperatures where Prochlorococcus begins to decline.

This differential thermal sensitivity probably reflects distinct evolutionary histories and habitat adaptations. Prochlorococcus evolved in relatively stable tropical and subtropical environments where temperature fluctuations are minimal, potentially favouring resource efficiency over thermal versatility. Unlike coastal and high-latitude phytoplankton that experience substantial temperature variations and maintain broader thermal tolerances, Prochlorococcus shows specific vulnerabilities at high temperatures. At 30 °C, Prochlorococcus isolates from warm regions such as the Sargasso Sea and Red Sea show suppressed photosystem gene expression49 and disrupted circadian regulation50, both critical for carbon fixation. By contrast, Synechococcus thrives at high temperatures, probably owing to proteomic adaptation that helps them minimize oxidative stress51 and resource reallocation strategies that maintain growth as temperature increases52. These physiological differences stem from divergent evolutionary trajectories: Prochlorococcus underwent genome streamlining, shedding many stress-response genes to minimize resource requirements while optimizing performance within a narrower environmental range. Synechococcus, however, maintains a more complex cellular machinery that, although costlier to maintain, provides greater resilience across variable conditions, including high temperatures. This evolutionary trade-off explains why Prochlorococcus, despite its dominance in stable nutrient-poor regions, may be more vulnerable to warming than Synechococcus.

These evolutionary trade-offs raise the critical question of whether Prochlorococcus can overcome its thermal limits in the near future. Despite its remarkable genetic diversity across ecotypes12, the streamlined genome that enabled Prochlorococcus to dominate nutrient-poor waters may now limit its capacity to adapt to rapid warming, as evidenced by its reduced abundance in the warmest ocean region (Fig. 2b). Our model incorporating a hypothetical warm-adapted strain (with a 2 °C increase in thermal optimum) shows that adaptive evolution could partially buffer Prochlorococcus populations against warming impacts. However, even with this adaptation, significant declines are still projected in tropical regions, highlighting the limitations of evolutionary rescue when faced with rapid environmental change. For approximately 150 Myr, Prochlorococcus has evolved to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, minimizing cell and genome sizes to reduce resource requirements, the very genomic streamlining that may now constrain its thermal adaptability. While Prochlorococcus probably persisted through past extreme climate events, such as the Early Eocene Climate Optimum when tropical seawater temperatures reached 35 °C (ref. 53), it probably did so by shifting polewards to cooler waters, a strategy that our ecosystem simulation also predicts for future warming (Fig. 3). Whether beneficial mutations could sweep through global populations within the timeframe of projected warming remains uncertain, especially given the unprecedented rate of anthropogenic warming and potential fitness trade-offs associated with thermal adaptation.

While our analysis provides evidence for thermal limits in Prochlorococcus, we must acknowledge several methodological limitations that complement the evolutionary considerations discussed above. Our field observations capture integrated responses of mixed communities rather than individual ecotypes, potentially masking the performance of rare, heat-tolerant variants. Strains with higher thermal tolerance may exist but remain uncommon owing to environmental trade-offs. Our sampling also presents geographic limitations. Laboratory studies disproportionately represent easily cultured ecotypes, with those from the warmest tropical regions remaining underrepresented (Extended Data Fig. 3). Similarly, while our field measurements spanned various ocean regions, many consistently high-temperature tropical areas remain unexplored. Despite these sampling limitations, our observations across the tropical Pacific consistently show reduced division rates at temperatures above 28 °C. The consistency of this pattern across diverse natural communities suggests a fundamental thermal limitation rather than an artefact of sampling bias. This thermal vulnerability demands serious consideration given Prochlorococcus's global significance.

Prochlorococcus's thermal limitation potentially has profound implications beyond the species itself. The predicted decline of Prochlorococcus could trigger cascading effects throughout marine food webs, particularly given the lack of functional redundancy within the Prochlorococcus ecological niche54. While our model predicts some compensatory response from Synechococcus, the overall community shift would be substantial. As warming oceans favour larger phytoplankton expanding into the ecological niche currently occupied by Prochlorococcus (Fig. 3e,f,o,q and Extended Data Fig. 7), this fundamental shift at the base of the food web could alter the composition and abundance of grazers, impacting predators higher in the food chain55, including fish populations56. In addition, a reduction in Prochlorococcus populations may disrupt mutualistic relationships with other organisms such as SAR11 (ref. 57), the ocean's most abundant heterotrophic bacteria, potentially destabilizing the microbial community58 and altering carbon cycling59. Ultimately, a decline in Prochlorococcus production could have far-reaching consequences beyond a simple shift in species abundance, revealing the complex and interconnected nature of microbial communities. These findings underscore the importance of considering thermal constraints when projecting marine ecosystem responses to climate change, as our results suggest that Prochlorococcus, despite its ecological success and numerical dominance, may be sensitive to the temperature increases projected for tropical oceans in coming decades.

We deployed the SeaFlow shipboard flow cytometer16 on 90 cruises from 2010 to 2023. The instrument continuously sampled seawater from the ship's underway intake, located at 3–8 m below the surface. Seawater was pumped through a 100-µm stainless steel mesh filter to prevent clogging of the 200-µm sampling nozzle. We continuously injected 1-µm yellow-green Fluoresbrite microspheres (Polysciences) into the flow stream for scattering and fluorescence signal normalization. Particle emission was detected using two position-sensitive detectors for optimal focus determination. We measured red fluorescence (692/40 nm bandpass filter), orange fluorescence (572/28 nm bandpass filter) and forward light scatter (457/50 nm bandpass filter). Data were stored in 3-min intervals, yielding a sampling resolution of approximately 1 km along the cruise track (based on a ship cruising at ~ 20 km h−1).

Raw data were processed to identify in-focus optimally positioned particles within the SeaFlow virtual core17. Optimally positioned particle analysis was performed using the R package Popcycle (version 4.7.3) available on GitHub. We defined five sets of gates based on forward light scatter, red fluorescence and orange fluorescence to identify 1-µm beads, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and small eukaryotic phytoplankton (<5 µm). Gate coordinates for each file were saved and stored in a structured query language (SQL) database. The equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) of each cell was estimated from forward scatter using the Mie light scatter theory. We then converted the ESD to carbon quotas using volume-to-carbon relationships for small phytoplankton17. Prochlorococcus size distributions were obtained by combining data collected every 3 min over each 1-h period (n = 12,814 hourly binned data points) to ensure robust statistical representation of the particle size distribution, with each hourly bin typically containing measurements from more than 10,000 individual cells.

Throughout our sampling campaigns, we validated SeaFlow cell abundance measurements against conventional flow cytometry (that is, BD Influx) for samples collected from both high- and low-temperature regions (n = 683; Supplementary Fig. 5). These validation efforts showed a good agreement between methods for Prochlorococcus abundance measurements across the temperature range, showing that dim Prochlorococcus cells in nutrient-poor warm waters were sufficiently resolved by our instrumentation for the purpose of this study.

SeaFlow data were complemented with underway sea surface temperature measurements from shipboard thermosalinographs. These measurements were either broadcast in real time over the ship's network or retrieved from the Rolling Deck to Repository. The temperature data recorded simultaneously with SeaFlow measurements are available along with the SeaFlow data on GitHub (https://github.com/seaflow-uw/seaflow-sfl/tree/master/curated).

We complemented cell abundances derived from SeaFlow data with the Global Cyanobacteria dataset hosted on the Simons Collaborative Marine Atlas Project60 (CMAP) database (that is, the tblFlombaum table), which contains global observations of Prochlorococcus abundance collected from 103 cruises14. As this dataset contains satellite-derived sea surface temperature data, we selected only samples from the upper 10 m to ensure appropriate temperature matching and excluded all zero values and empty entries (n = 5,125). We also incorporated two additional cruises in the Indian Ocean23,43 (n = 261) which included temperature data from the shipboard thermosalinograph. For these additional Indian Ocean datasets, we included all depth measurements with available temperature data.

We applied a size-structured matrix population model following the approach described in a previous study18, to estimate phytoplankton division rates. This category of model has shown its suitability for estimating in situ phytoplankton division rates for Prochlorococcus18,20, Synechocococus19,61 and mixed populations of small eukaryotic cells22,62 in a wide range of environmental conditions, from estuarine to coastal to open ocean environments, and validated using culture experiments18, cell cycle analysis20 and dilution experiments19. The latter indicates that the effects of size-specific mortality agents, if any, on the relative cell size distribution do not affect cell division estimation.

The size-structured matrix population model mechanistically simulates the evolution of the size distribution over a day–night cycle. The model discretizes cell counts across size classes and time using the parameter Δv and time using the parameter Δt. It quantifies the rates of the three key biological processes (cell division, carbon fixation and carbon loss), which are represented by the parameter vector θ = (θδ, θγ, θρ, ω0). These parameters, along with a concentration parameter σ (which allows for overdispersion in the data), determine the dynamics of the model. Below is a breakdown of the modelled processes:

Cell division (δ): Division rates are size dependent, reflecting the probability of cells transitioning to subsequent life-cycle stages. The model assumes a monotonically increasing division rate as a function of cell size.

Carbon fixation (γ): Carbon fixation rates are determined by light availability (PAR measurements) and cellular carbon content. This captures diel cycle dynamics and phytoplankton growth rates. The model incorporates a power–law relationship between carbon fixation and cell size.

Carbon loss (ρ): The model accounts for carbon loss through respiration and exudation, estimating rates separately for each size class. This reflects cell shrinkage due to metabolic processes other than division.

Prochlorococcus size distribution was obtained by combining data collected every 3 min over each 1-h period. These distributions were then discretized into 30 size classes based on the log of their carbon quotas, ranging from 80 fgC to 260 fgC per cell. This range was selected to fully encompass the variation in Prochlorococcus cell size observed in the SeaFlow dataset. We chose the volume bins and a time step of 10 min to ensure that cells would probably undergo only a single transition at a time within the model.

We used Bayesian inference, implemented through the Stan software package and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, to process the data. A total of 6 Hamiltonian Monte Carlo chains were run for 2,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations. This approach strikes a balance between computational efficiency and the complexity of our model. A list of model parameters and priors is available in Supplementary Table 1.

We implemented rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability of our model estimates. These measures included:

Model convergence: Samples with poor model convergence (R-hat > 1.1) were excluded, as this indicated potential unreliability of model-derived estimates63.

Sample adequacy: Samples with insufficient cell counts (total number of particles counted over 1 h <10,000) were excluded from analysis.

Data completeness: We excluded datasets with large gaps in temporal coverage (>4 h).

Data integrity: We excluded 24-h periods containing abrupt shifts in cell size distributions. As phytoplankton cells typically increase their size by no more than a factor of two during a complete day–night growth cycle (that is, cells divide when they reach a critical size), larger or sudden changes in mean population size strongly indicate that we were sampling different populations with inherently distinct cell size characteristics. We detected these shifts using a change point detection method specifically developed for environmental flow cytometry data64. While most of these shifts are usually filtered by our model convergence criteria, this additional step provided additional assurance that our estimates reflected genuine biological processes rather than sampling artefacts.

Biological consistency: We examined the correlation between carbon fixation patterns estimated by the model and division rates. As carbon fixation during daylight hours drives cell growth, which subsequently enables division, samples showing weak or absent correlations between these processes were flagged for potential anomalies, as this might indicate that factors other than normal physiological processes were affecting the size distributions.

Prochlorococcus division rates were complemented with dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations (nitrate plus nitrite and phosphate). For division rates obtained from the SeaFlow data, nutrient data were obtained mostly from Mercator-PISCES biogeochemical model forecasts (¼° resolution), with 21 out of 180 data points from in situ measurements collected during research cruises in which the SeaFlow instrument was deployed. The PISCES model is a widely used tool for simulating marine biological productivity and the biogeochemical cycles of key nutrients (carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, silicon and iron) in the global ocean, and has been extensively validated against a wide range of available observations, including in nutrient-poor regions65,66. Both in situ observations and model estimates are hosted in the CMAP database60. The specific CMAP datasets for measured nutrient values were the following:

tblKOK1606_Gradients1_Nutrients

tblMGL1704_Gradients2_Nutrients

tblKM1906_Gradients3_Organic_Inorganic_Nutrients

tblGradients5_TN412_NutrientsUW

tblTN398_nutr

and Mercator_Pisces_Biogeochemistry_Daily_Forecast_Nut for modelled data.

We extended our SeaFlow-derived Prochlorococcus division rates with a data compilation of in situ dilution experiments24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 and cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 (Extended Data Fig. 1). This dataset represents 114 estimates of Prochlorococcus division rates. For 65 out of 114 of these data points, measured environmental variables, including temperature, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, and PAR values, were provided directly within the compiled studies, based on field observations rather than model estimates or remote sensing data. These complementary datasets expand our geographic coverage beyond the North Pacific region where most SeaFlow deployments occurred, providing broader representation of different oceanic regimes.

We incorporated publicly available data on Prochlorococcus division rates derived from 13 different isolates cultured under nutrient-replete conditions37,38,39 (Extended Data Fig. 3). These isolates represent various ecotypes including both high-light- and low-light-adapted strains from different ocean regions. Of these 13 isolates, 2 originated from regions where annual mean sea surface temperatures exceed 28 °C, while others were isolated from cooler regions. This compiled dataset includes over 702 estimates of division rates under various temperature and light conditions. While isolate-based estimates are often lower than rates measured in situ, they provide valuable insights into physiological responses under controlled laboratory conditions and are used to test assumptions regarding how division rates respond to environmental variations.

The change in the cell division rate (μ) with temperature was characterized with either an exponential function (Eppley equation), an exponential function with mortality (Eppley–Norberg equation) or a metabolic theory of ecology (Hinshelwood equation), as described previously67:

where T represents the temperature and a represents the maximum division rates at T0 (typically 20 °C), b is the exponential change in division rate with increasing temperature, Tc corresponds to the maximum of the quadratic portion of the equation, w is the thermal niche width (that is, the range of temperatures over which the division rate is positive), R is the gas constant (8.315 J mol−1 K−1), A1 and A2 are related to entropy and E1 and E2 are related to enthalpy.

To parametrize the coefficients, we fitted the 99th quantile regression to capture the division rate maxima at a given temperature. The 99th quantile is commonly used studying phytoplankton response to temperature, as it helps identify the upper limits of its thermal tolerance41,68. Parameters were estimated using a least squared approach and a differential evolution algorithm for optimization, using the Deoptim package in R69. The Hinshelwood and Eppley–Norberg approaches yielded similar curves (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Our goal was to evaluate whether the observed decline in division rates at higher temperatures was primarily driven by temperature or by other covarying factors. The data were binned by 0.25 °C intervals of seawater temperature, and we analysed the 80th percentile division rate across each bin. The 80th percentile was chosen over the 99th percentile to increase the sample size for statistical analysis while still focusing on the upper range of division rates. We used two complementary statistical models:

A generalized linear model was constructed using the glm function in R, incorporating polynomial terms for temperature, PAR, nitrate and phosphate. This allowed us to capture potential nonlinear relationships between these factors and division rates within a linear framework. Before the model fitting, all environmental factors were rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to facilitate the comparison of their relative importance on division rates. To assess the robustness of model results, we applied a bootstrapping technique with 1,000 replicates, generating standard deviations for the model coefficients. Model fit was assessed using standard diagnostic plots and summary statistics.

A generalized additive model was constructed using the mgcv package in R, incorporating smooth terms (that is, estimated degree of freedom) for temperature, PAR, nitrogen (nitrate and nitrite) and phosphorus (phosphate) concentrations. A simulation-based test with 1,000 replicates indicated sufficient basis dimensions for all smooth terms, suggesting that the model adequately captured the complexity of the relationships. Model selection was performed using restricted maximum likelihood, and the basis dimension (k) was checked to ensure adequate model complexity.

We used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) marine ecosystem model (Darwin), including the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron and oxygen through inorganic, organic detritus and 50 plankton types, modified from previous studies45,70. The model includes 31 phytoplankton types, analogues of the pico-cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, 2 sizes of green algae (picoeukaryotes), 5 sizes of coccolithophores, 5 diazotrophs, 9 diatoms and 8 mixotrophic dinoflagellates (Supplementary Fig. 2). To represent the wide range of phytoplankton sizes, we defined 14 size classes ranging from 0.6 µm to 104 µm ESD, evenly distributed on a logarithmic scale. The model also captures trophic interactions through 3 size classes of heterotrophic bacteria (0.4 µm to 0.9 µm ESD) that remineralize the organic matter and 16 size classes of zooplankton (4.5 µm to 1,636 µm ESD) that graze on prey following a Holling type II function71.

Phytoplankton growth parameters are allometrically defined with functional group specifics72. Growth rates are influenced by multiple potentially limiting nutrients (dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, iron and silicic acid) using Liebig's law of the minimum (growth limited by the scarcest resource) and parameterized with a Monod function (a mathematical relationship describing nutrient-limited growth). Nutrient half-saturation coefficients are allometrically assigned, favouring smaller phytoplankton with the highest nutrient affinity. Phytoplankton growth is also a function of spectral light and photoacclimation72,73 with functional groups showing distinct absorption patterns based on their specific pigment composition. Temperature affects all biological rates, including phytoplankton growth rates, zooplankton grazing rates and other loss rates. While these rates incorporate Q10-based temperature dependencies, whose uncertainties and impacts on projections have been assessed in previous studies42,45, our analysis shows that the choice of thermal response functions (that is, with or without thermal limits) represents a more significant source of uncertainty. This is particularly evident for Prochlorococcus, in which we evaluated two distinct thermal response curves: a conventional exponential function (solid blue curve; Supplementary Fig. 3) and a metabolic function incorporating thermal limits (dashed blue curve; Supplementary Fig. 3), both derived from in situ and laboratory studies (Fig. 2a). For Synechococcus, we use an exponential thermal response curve (black curve; Supplementary Fig. 3) derived from in situ dilution experiments27 and laboratory studies42. For all non-pico-cyanobacteria, we use exponential thermal growth functions (Supplementary Fig. 3 and parameters in Supplementary Table 4) derived from laboratory observations45.

Our study integrates the biological and biogeochemical components of the Darwin ecosystem within an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM)74,75,76. The IGSM couples the MIT general circulation model77, a three-dimensional ocean circulation model at a coarse resolution configuration (2° by 2.5° horizontally, 22 vertical levels that range from 10 m at the surface to 500 m at depth)76, with a simplified representation of the atmospheric dynamics, physics and chemistry, terrestrial water, energy and biogeochemical processes78. The Darwin model is run in ‘offline' mode using physical ocean fields (for example, circulation, mixing, salinity and temperature) from representative members of an ensemble of IGSM simulations. The ocean component of the IGSM shows a realistic climatology and year-to-year variability (for example, El Niño-Southern Oscillation) with frequency, seasonality, magnitude and patterns in general agreement with observations75. As is typical with climate change studies, the IGSM performed a ‘control' simulation in which greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations were held constant at 1860 levels. This pre-industrial control shows interannual variability but lacks any long-term warming trends or circulation changes. In addition, the IGSM performed a transient simulation from 1860 to 2100 under observed pre-industrial changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations followed by two future greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenarios, a moderate and high scenario similar to Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change RCP 4.5 and 8.5. These simulations have been previously described and evaluated in detail75. Following the approach in a previous study45, we conducted paired ecosystem model experiments (20 years each) to contrast pre-industrial and projected future ocean conditions (Extended Data Fig. 6). This capitalized on the significant differences in ocean physics between the pre-industrial control run of the IGSM and its end-of-century moderate and high warming scenarios. We initialized each simulation with nutrient and detritus fields from previous transient simulations79, ensuring consistency with pre-industrial or future conditions. Plankton types were initialized at low abundances, and robust ecosystem structures were established within 3 years. Our results represent averages over the past 10 years of each simulation. This averaging mitigates the impact of interannual variability on the comparison between pre-industrial and future conditions.

We perform a series of simulations varying both physical conditions and the thermal response function used for Prochlorococcus (Supplementary Table 4). We refer to simulations with constant 1860 greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations (control run) as ‘pre-industrial' and those based on projected end-of-century physical conditions as ‘2090–2100'. Simulations in which Prochlorococcus maximum division rates follow an exponential temperature function are termed ‘exponential', while those using a metabolic function with an upper thermal limit are termed ‘metabolic'. Our initial set of six simulations (two paired experiments; Supplementary Table 5) are the ones discussed in the main text: ‘exponential' pre-industrial, moderate and warming scenarios, and ‘metabolic' pre-industrial, moderate and high warming scenarios. Phytoplankton distributions and production in pre-industrial simulations align well with real-world observations (Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8), as shown in previous studies45,70. While the computational demands of this global three-dimensional ecosystem model preclude comprehensive parameter sensitivity analyses, we note that the projected changes between ‘pre-industrial' and future climate simulations exceed the model's interannual variability by an order of magnitude (Supplementary Table 6). This, combined with the model's demonstrated skill in reproducing present-day distributions, provides confidence in the robustness of our key findings.

To isolate the direct impact of temperature change on Prochlorococcus, we conducted two additional simulations. In these experiment, we maintained pre-industrial circulation patterns and nutrient concentrations to control for changes in nutrient supply, while allowing biological rates (including Prochlorococcus growth rate) to respond to projected end-of-century warming for both climate scenarios (Supplementary Table 5). In the main text, we compare the results of the 2090–2100 simulations to their paired pre-industrial counterparts (Figs. 3 and 4 and Extended Data Figs. 7 and 10).

a, Geographic distribution of daily division rates derived from the matrix population model (n = 180 independent samples). b, Relationship between division rates derived from the matrix population model and seawater temperature (°C). c, Geographic distribution of daily division rates derived from data compilations of dilution experiments (circles, n = 103 independent samples)24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 and cell cycle analysis (triangles, n = 11 independent samples)20,23,24,25. d, Relationship between division rates derived from dilution experiments (circles) and cell cycle analysis (triangles) and seawater temperature (°C). The inset map in a and c shows the geographical distribution of sample locations. Statistical relationships in b and d were assessed using ordinary least squares regression with two-sided tests (α = 0.01). The black line in b shows a second-order polynomial regression model fit (P = 3.349 × 10−10); d shows a fourth-order polynomial regression fit (P = 0.014). No adjustments for multiple comparisons were applied. Error bars in a and b represent standard deviation of the 2000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations used to infer division rates with the matrix population model. Error bars in c and d represent standard deviation in estimating duration of S phase in cell cycle method. Uncertainty estimates were not reported for dilution experiments.

a, Data were binned by 0.25 °C intervals of seawater temperature, and the 80th percentile division rate was calculated for each bin. The lines represent a fitted generalized linear model (black) with standard error (grey shading) and generalized additive model (dotted red) (see Supplementary Table 3), illustrating the relationships between maximum division rates and seawater temperature (°C). b-d, Relationships between division rates derived from all three methods (matrix population model, dilution experiments, and cell cycle analysis) and phosphorus concentration (nmol L−1) (b), light (µmol photons m−2 s−1) (c), and nitrogen concentration (nmol L−1) (d). Error bars represent standard deviation of the 2000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations used to infer division rates with the matrix population model, and standard deviation in estimating duration of S phase in cell cycle method. Uncertainty estimates were not reported for dilution experiments. Red and green circles highlight division rates observed at the highest temperatures that fall below (red) or above (green) the regression line in panel a.

The colored region represent areas where the climatological annual mean sea surface temperature exceeds 28 °C. b, Temperature response curves (division rate vs. temperature) for each Prochlorococcus strain, grouped by isolation region. Points represent measured division rates under laboratory conditions from data compilations37,38,39.

a, Map of Synechococcus isolation locations, colored by strain. The black line represents the fit of an Eppley exponential thermal response model (as described in Grimaud et al.67) to the maxima division rates observed for a given temperature across all strains. b, Temperature response curves (division rate vs. temperature) for each strain, grouped by isolation region. Points represent measured division rates under laboratory conditions from data compilations42,46.

Synechococcus abundances measured by SeaFlow and compiled datasets14,23,43, as a function of temperature (°C), with color scale coding representing the number of observations. The data were binned by 0.25 °C intervals of seawater temperature, and the 80th percentile abundance was calculated for each bin. Error bars show the 5th and 95th percentiles within the top 80% subset. The red box highlights the observed detrimental effects of warm temperatures on Prochlorococcus (> 28 °C). The inset map shows the geographical distribution of sample locations, with samples collected in water above 28 °C indicted in red.

Temperature and nutrient supply to the sunlit layers of the ocean are two key environmental factors influencing phytoplankton division rates. a, c, e, g, i. Temperature (°C) in the upper 10 m for pre-industrial conditions (a) and the 10-year average from 2090-2100 under moderate (c) and high warming scenario (e), with a black contour indicating 28 °C, a critical temperature for Prochlorococcus. Change in temperature (°C) between these periods (positive = warming) (g, i). b, d, f, h, j. Physical supply rate of nitrate to the upper 50 m (mol N m−2 y−1) under pre-industrial conditions (b) and future scenarios (d, f). Change in supply rate between these periods (negative = decreasing supply rate in the future) (h, j). Nutrient supply rates include lateral and vertical advection and mixing (metabolic simulations). In the tropics and subtropics, macronutrient supply decreases due to increased stratification and circulation changes. In polar regions, reduced sea ice leads to deeper mixing and increased nutrient supply. In some temperate waters, increased biological rates and nutrient trapping allow for higher supply rates in the future.

Depth-integrated biomass of different phytoplankton types under pre-industrial conditions and percent difference from a high warming scenario for the period 2090-2100. Two different thermal response functions for Prochlorococcus are used: metabolic (columns 1 and 2) and exponential (columns 3 and 4). Pre-industrial biomass (10-year mean, mgC m2) for various phytoplankton types and total biomass, using the metabolic (column 1) and exponential (column 3) functions for Prochlorococcus. Percent change in biomass between pre-industrial and future conditions under a high warming scenario, using the metabolic (column 2) and exponential (column 4) functions. Positive values indicate an increase in biomass in the future scenario. Increases in biomass for specific phytoplankton types suggest niche shifts, with some groups outcompeting others.

We compare modelled biomass production (gC m−2 y−1) under pre-industrial conditions using either metabolic (left column) or exponential (right column) thermal response functions for Prochlorococcus. a, b, Prochlorococcus production, c, d, Synechococcus production, and e, f, production by all other phytoplankton. The color scale in panels e and f is supersaturated to enhance visibility of patterns in panels a-d. Note that maximum production rates in some region exceed 100 gC m−2 y−1. The percentage change in production between pre-industrial and future conditions is shown in Fig. 3.

Latitudinal change (%) in depth-integrated biomass production for Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and the combined total of all other phytoplankton. Results are based on the metabolic thermal response function for Prochlorococcus. Grey line (T + N-) represents changes due to the combination of temperature and nutrient shifts between pre-industrial and future conditions. Black line (T + ) represents changes due solely to temperature shifts, with circulation and nutrient concentrations held at pre-industrial levels (Methods and Supplementary Table 5). Shading represents the longitudinal variation from the mean (SD).

Percentage change in depth-integrated annual biomass production for Prochlorococcus (a-d), Synechococcus (e-h), and all other phytoplankton (i-l) comparing the standard metabolic reaction model (left column) with a warm-adapted variant (right column) for Prochlorococcus. Both projections use the same future climate scenarios (2090-2100) and pre-industrial baseline (1860) as Fig. 3. White areas indicate that the phytoplankton type does not exist in those regions in either pre-industrially or by end of century. Values of 100% increase indicates an expansion in the geographical range.

How burned artifacts offer a window into the dismantling of a dynasty.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Archaeologists discovered clues to a fire in Guatemala from between 733 and 881 AD that they say represents a key turning point in Maya rule—a very public turning point. 

The discovery at the Maya site of Ucanal in Guatemala “marked a public dismantling of an old regime”—a rather pivotal moment in the collapse of rulers and key point in political power that isn't often shown so clearly from an archeological find, the authors write in a study published in the journal Antiquity.

The event in question occurred at the capital of the K'anwitznal kingdom near a burial site. The bodies and their ornaments—items include a jewel-adorned stone mask, fragments of a greenstone diadem, and jade ornaments—were moved from a tomb to a public burning site, where fire engulfed some of the centuries-old items for all to see. 

“This event marked a moment of change in the kingdom and in the lowlands,” the authors write. “Rather than examine this fire-burning event as a bookend to Maya history, we view it as a pivot point around which the K'anwitznal polity reinvented itself and the city of Ucanal went on to a flourishing of activities.” 

The new leadership regime welcomed a non-royal leader called Papmalil, and there is little in the written record indicating how he came to power. “Papmalil's rule was not only seminal because of his possible foreign origins—perhaps breaking the succession of ruling dynasts at the site—but also because his rule shifted political dynamics in the southern Maya lowlands.” 

The study's authors, led by Christina Halperin at the University of Montreal, state that Papmalil appears to have ushered in an era of prosperity. Substantial construction occurred in both the civic-ceremonial core and outer residential zones of the city following the power shift. 

That new era may have had a dramatic beginning.

The team discovered the fire event during 2022 excavations in the construction fill of a temple-pyramid situated in a public plaza, and the evidence shows that there was no effort to protect the burial deposit. The team believes that at least four adults were part of the burn remains, and that the fire reached a temperature of over 800°C. Included with the bodies were 1,470 fragments of greenstone pendants, beads, plaques, and mosaics, along with large blades—all representing a “single burning event.” The quantity and quality of the burnt and broken ornaments indicate they came from a royal tomb, likely belonging to multiple individuals. 

The team said evidence indicates that the human bone and ornaments had once been part of the contents of a Late Classic royal tomb, and the deposit was part of a fire-entering rite that “marked the symbolic and literal destruction of an earlier K'anwitznal dynastic line.” 

The authors state that the event “appears to have bene an act of desecration: it was dumped at the edge of a crude wall used as a construction pen and no effort was made to protect the fragmented bones and ornaments from the tomb blocks deposited on top of them as construction fill.” It all likely made for a “dramatic public affair” meant to be charged with emotion. “It could dramatically mark,” they wrote, “the dismantling of an ancient regime.”

You probably walked by it a bunch of times today.

Here is what you'll learn in this story:

When we say “plastic is everywhere,” that isn't an exaggeration. 

Almost 30 years ago, a Japanese underwater ROV spotted a plastic bag floating along the depths of the Mariana Trench, the deepest point in all of the world's oceans. The oil-based product is now embedded in Earth's geologic layer as a new sedimentary rock known as “plastistone.” And the average adult human brain likely contains up to a spoon's worth of microplastic. The global scourge of plastic is so dire that the United Nations is currently developing a plastics treaty. 

Due to our ongoing failure to control the proliferation of this oil-based menace, some scientists—as well as the oil and plastics industries at large—have turned to a controversial method to help alleviate the problem: Converting the plastic back into usable oil. If it's scaled up efficiently, scientists say the “bio-oil” from plastic could feed directly into energy-hungry technologies that require fuel to produce heat and electricity, such as boilers, furnaces, and turbines, as well as diesel for trucks, trains, and ships. This is a global effort, and scientists working on the problem hope to create an innovative process that will satisfy multiple petroleum-based needs—and encourage less reliance on fossil fuels that are wrecking the environment. However, the current method is arguably inefficient and still needs to be proven. 

Recently, researchers from Yale University may have made a dent in that inefficiency. They successfully tested a novel way to produce more bio-oil at less cost. It shows promise for scaling up production in the future, which is a crucial step for making plastic trash a viable source of energy.

The chief method of pulling off this chemical wizardry starts with pyrolysis, which applies heat to a material in the absence of oxygen. When the dial is turned up to 900 degrees Celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit) plastic's polymer chains break down into hydrocarbon molecules. These are organic compounds made mainly of carbon and hydrogen atoms and are the basic molecule required for creating fuel energy. Results vary, but pyrolysis usually turns about 60 percent of plastic into bio-oil. 

Various bio-oil production methods exist, but they typically use a catalyst, such as the mineral zeolite, to enhance the breakdown of materials and increase yields. The new Yale study discovered a method that boosts the yield to roughly 66 percent—without the need for a catalyst at all. This could be a huge cost saver, said materials engineer Liangbing Hu, Ph.D., in a Yale University press statement. “Whenever you talk about catalysts, they're very expensive and you have a lifetime issue because catalysts will eventually die by different means,” he said. Hu co-authored a paper detailing the process in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering earlier this summer.

The key to this innovation was creating a three-section 3D-printed carbon column reactor, with each section containing a different pore size. As chemicals passed through the reactor, the differing pore sizes—1 millimeter, 500 micrometer, and 200 nanometer—could effectively control the progress of the reaction. Next, the researchers planned how to scale up the process. So they experimented with constructing their reactor using readily available carbon felt, a high-temperature resistant, flexible material. Even without determining ideal pore sizes, they still achieved a high yield, of around 56 percent. Their work so far shows that advanced recycling via pyrolsis still has room for sustainability and efficiency improvement.

While increasing yields of bio-oil and making pyrolysis cost effective is important, scaling up also comes with some problems of its own that scientists must overcome. The most obvious one is the immense amount of energy the current technology uses, which means more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as well as other waste products. Experts speaking with the independent, investigative nonprofit news organization ProPublica called the broader pyrolysis concept “a fairy tale,” a convenient story often touted by oil companies and plastic producers so they can keep relying on fossil fuels. At least for the foreseeable future, pyrolysis isn't a cure-all for our plastic problem.

However, as scientists continue to pursue creative innovations, like Hu and his team's, they could one day turn this “fairy tale” into a real solution to the world's ever-growing plastic crisis. With the world is producing more single-use plastic than ever before, it's clear that—at least for now—the best kind of plastic is still one that's never made in the first place.

The bear suffered a fracture to its frontal bone, and there were marks on its teeth from chewing at the bars of a cage.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Gladiatorial spectacles often involved some of the most fearsome creatures Romans could get a hold of, like lions and bulls. The Roman amphitheater at Viminacium, evidently, had at least one brown bear.

A new study published in Antiquity details the analysis of a skull fragment, initially dug up in the amphitheater located in present-day Serbia in 2016. The remains came from a 6-year-old male brown bear who lived a difficult life as a tool for Roman entertainment. He had suffered an “impact fracture to the frontal bone, the healing of which was impaired by a secondary infection.” And “excessive wear” to the canine teeth indicates that the bear was chewing on his cage—likely a sign of a prolonged period of captivity. 

The team determined that this bear “participated in more than one spectacle at the Viminacium amphitheater.”

“We cannot say with certainty whether the bear died directly in the arena, but the evidence suggests the trauma occurred during spectacles and the subsequent infection likely contributed significantly to its death,” Nemania Markovic, lead author on the study and senior research associate at the Institute of Archaeology in Belgrade, told Live Science. 

The Viminacium—an oval-shaped event center with high walls that could seat 7,000 spectators—was built in the second century A.D. The skull was found near the entrance, alongside a leopard bone and other animal remains. “Previous research suggests animals killed in the arena were butchered nearby, their meat distributed, and bones discarded close to the amphitheater—not buried in a formal animal graveyard,” Markovic said.

The Viminacium amphitheater was known for hosting a range of animal-based spectacles in the mornings, from animal fights to simple hunts. The animals were even sometimes used to execute convicts.

While gladiator events were known to introduce wild boars, bulls, panthers, dogs, and lions to events, according to a post by Antiquity, in the spectators' search for an increased level of blood and violence, the brown bear became one of the most prominent animals in the historical record of Roman gladiator stories. Bears were believed to have been brought in from Lucania, Caledonia, North Africa, and the Balkans for Roman pleasure. 

The Viminacium bear was a local bear from the Balkan region, and the authors speculate that  its capture could have been done by either civilians or professional hunters with the sole purpose of supplying animals for gladiator events. The bear's remains were dated to between 240 and 350 A.D.—a busy time for the Viminacium site. 

The lesions and injuries on the frontal bone—which showed signs of healing and subsequent infection that led to an inflammation of the bone (the probable cause of death)—likely created by a spear. “This indicates the bear was indeed captured for use in spectator fights, likely near to Viminacium, and sustained injuries fighting against armed venators, who fought wild animals for entertainment,” the authors wrote. 

Despite so much having been written about animal use—especially of bears—in Roman events, the authors said this is the first definitive fossil evidence of the capture and use of brown bears in a gladiator setting. “This is the first osteological evidence for the participation of brown bears in Roman spectacles,” the authors wrote. “It shows the significance of brown bears in spectacles across the wider empire and provides a fascinating insight into ancient relationships between humans and wild animals.”

Global social-media platform LinkedIn is used by scientists to make connections and advance their careers. Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty

“I'm not looking to go viral,” says Sharon Obasi of her use of LinkedIn. “I'm looking just to be authentic, make connections and see how other people are approaching similar topics.”

Obasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, started using the global professional social-networking site more in the past few years as she took on extra administrative responsibilities in her department. “It was really a chance for me to find people who are in similar roles, in small institutions — a way to find community. But once I started posting and interacting, I realized it was much more than that,” she says. “I call it my 24/7, 365 scientific conference. It's a really great way to engage in science and scholarship in a much more public way.”

Obasi is one of around one billion registered users of LinkedIn, which turned 22 years old in May. The platform is becoming increasingly popular, with some attributing its recent growth to the decline of the social-media platform X, which shed 11 million users in the European Union alone between October 2024 and March 2025.

Nature's Careers team spoke to Obasi and seven other researchers about why they love LinkedIn, and how other scientists can use it to their advantage.

Teaching researchers how to use LinkedIn is part of Hannah Roberts's role as a careers coach in Macclesfield, UK. She specializes in helping women who work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, many of whom have little time to focus on career-development activities, she says. Roberts, who completed a PhD in chemistry in 2011 at the University of Manchester, UK, surveyed 3,000 women about their careers and found that 85% could benefit from using LinkedIn more. To use it to its full potential, Roberts says, people should have more than 1,000 contacts, and to get there, they need to be “intentional about evolving their network”.

To do so, Roberts recommends that researchers devote an hour per week to career-development activities, and make a special effort on LinkedIn as part of this (see ‘Six LinkedIn lessons from those in the know'). She suggests: “Set a timer for 15 minutes and connect with ten relevant people for your next job step”, whether that be making partnerships, finding collaborators or raising your profile to help secure future roles.

Seasoned users offer their top tips for getting the best out of the professional-networking platform.

“Pick a strategy for the next six months,” advises science-careers coach Hannah Roberts, who is based in Macclesfield, UK. Maybe it's to get a job or to find collaborators. You don't have to stick with it forever, just choose what feels right for now.

Your personal page on LinkedIn is what potential collaborators and employers will see. “Ensure that all the sections of your LinkedIn profile are complete and up to date,” says Roberts.

Follow people who are relevant to your line of work, but be judicious about who you connect with, says Ruth Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Those connections determine what shows up in your feed, she says, “If I'm randomly connecting with people, that's a problem — because garbage in, garbage out.”

Investing time on the site will pay dividends. For some, this means scheduling posts to ensure a regular output. For Elena Hoffer, who runs a professional-resources business in Stockholm, it means wading into conversations on her posts. “Don't post and ghost,” she suggests. “When I post, I always comment in the first hour, just to get the discussion going.”

“Putting yourself out there” is key on LinkedIn, says Sharon Obasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney — although this is something scientists aren't always trained to do. Remember that your input is valuable, even in discussions with luminaries in your field. “You might have a perspective that is not amplified or not centred — you might have an unusual take.”

When connecting with someone you don't know, try to build a relationship before asking for anything. “I get a lot of direct messages from people who I have no rapport with. Nothing has been built up, and instantly they will ping me a message about something that's irrelevant, or ask me for a job,” says Roberts. “It's a bit like jumping to ‘will you marry me?' before we've even exchanged a word.”

She also suggests commenting on five posts each week, so that “people see your name, your picture and your LinkedIn headline”, adding: “If you're employing that strategy every time you go on LinkedIn, you can massively extend that network in a short space of time. Consistency of action makes a big change.”

Once you've built up a strong network of connections, Roberts says that more behind-the-scenes networking can begin, including informal conversations and making yourself known to organizations that interest you the most.

Some people take a less-formal approach. Elena Hoffer co-founded the firm Alma.Me, in Stockholm, to help early-career researchers to transition out of academia. Hoffer, who has a PhD in medical sciences from the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, and more than 100,000 LinkedIn followers says: “I always say, ‘do what fits you'. I never plan my content... I just need to feel it, you know?”

Ruth Gotian, whose 2022 book The Success Factor investigates how to achieve peak business performance based on her discussions with astronauts and Nobel laureates, doesn't recommend setting yourself targets for LinkedIn activity. Instead, she suggests fitting it in where you can around your existing work: “I tell people to definitely do it during their non-peak performance hours,” says Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.

“Networking is so weird, because it's awkward,” says Vanesa Ayala-Núñez, an oncology researcher at the St Gallen branch of Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. “It's not so easy to connect with someone who you don't know.” To get around this, Ayala-Núñez sought common ground. As a Mexican, she says, speaking to other Europe-based Latin American women at science conferences and networking events “opened a lot of doors for me, because immediately you create a connection with this person — we have a lot of things in common. We have gone through a lot of similar experiences”.

She mirrored this approach on LinkedIn, being guided by people's names, or where they studied. Writing messages to potential connections in Spanish and highlighting the things they had in common helped Ayala-Núñez to build a strong professional network. “You never know who can eventually help you,” she says.

Gotian's approach is similar. “To me, LinkedIn is like air,” she says. “I use it all the time. If I'm going to meet with someone, I need some background information, and the first place I go to is LinkedIn, because what I want to do immediately is establish a connection with someone.” She might find common ground on the basis of someone's education, hometown or work history, “and that just kicks the conversation off”.

Gotian emphasizes that developing personal connections is key to professional networking. When approaching people, “you don't want to sound like a salesperson, and you certainly don't want to sound transactional. You want to build a relationship. People like to work with those who they know, like and trust”.

Gotian recommends the ‘24/7/30 networking model': “Twenty-four hours after you meet someone, you connect with them, and you do it as a personal connection. ‘It was so great chatting with you. I hope you have a great time on that ski holiday you talked about.' Seven days later, you connect again with a thoughtful comment.” This could be sending an article about something you discussed when you met, for example.

“Then 30 days later, you're following up”, sending your new connection an article or a podcast or mentioning a discussion you had that made you think of them. “You're always circling back to that conversation. You have not asked for a thing. You're just building up the ‘know, like and trust' factor, and then obviously engaging with their content in a thoughtful way.”

This direct approach might make some researchers uncomfortable, but Gotian says it's just like building a friendship. “Remember you're not asking for anything. If anything, you're helping the other person.”

Gotian cautions against using an overly serious tone. “Because if you make it too formal and stuffy, transactional and get right to business, it's a real turn off.”

So now that you're using LinkedIn regularly, how should you act when you're there? “You want to come through as authentically as possible,” says Lucy Lawrence, who works in science communication in London. She advises researchers to adopt a confident attitude and not to copy others' approaches too closely. “Just because it's working well for someone else on LinkedIn, it doesn't mean it's going to translate for you.” For Lawrence, who switched to science communication after completing a biomedical science degree at Nottingham Trent University, UK, in 2015, her authenticity comes from a genuine enthusiasm for the science that she writes about.

“I'm a yapper and I just really like speaking to people,” she says. Posting on her blog and on LinkedIn gave her an opportunity to talk publicly about science that she found inspiring.

“I grew my account to about 14,000 followers in three years just by being me and talking about things that I think are really interesting. Almost as if I'm talking to one of my friends: ‘Oh my God, this is really cool. Have you heard about this?'”

Being passionate about his research area also helped electrochemist Jyotisman Rath to reap benefits on LinkedIn. Rath posted daily for 100 days on topics ranging from a battery trivia challenge to sustainability, climate change, energy and the broader field of electrochemistry during his master's degree at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Bhubaneswar, India, hoping that the daily target would help him stick to posting.

The task revealed to him just how many scientists are active on LinkedIn. “Perhaps they don't post a lot or comment a lot, but they do definitely read people's posts,” says Rath, who is now doing a PhD at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Daily posting enabled him to initiate conversations in comments and private messages, prompting discussion by asking others their opinions on the things he was posting about.

Rath communicated with senior figures in his research field, as well as raising his profile, which resulted in an internship with a start-up company working on innovative battery materials, something he attributes to his frequent posts. “I was able to contact them during my challenge, then they saw what I'm doing and my ideas,” he says.

Rath was also selected to join the Indian cohort of the ten-week LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Programme in 2022. It offers a small stipend and training on how to build engaged communities.

For some, being authentic means being open about your personal life, even on a platform that is considered more professional than, say, X or Instagram.

Siddharth Kankaria, a social-sciences researcher and science communicator in Kolkata, India, says LinkedIn is now his “primary social-media outlet”, making him inclined to share personal content there.

The northeastern U.S. is a brilliant melange of science and history.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

With days growing shorter and nights growing colder, it seems that fall is upon us. And for the many of the more northern regions of the U.S., “leaf peeping” season is just beginning. Although many other places throughout the U.S. and around the world are home to incredible displays of fall foliage, none quite rival the deciduous display that unfolds every year in the northeastern U.S.

But why, exactly, is this area of the country blessed with such stunning fall colors? Well, it turns out that it's actually a pretty fortunate mix of science and history. 

First, it helps to know exactly why the leaves of deciduous trees change colors. As days begin to get shorter, trees receive a kind of signal to start preparing for the winter ahead. While people typically think that leaf-peeping season starting in late September, this process can actually start as early as late July in the northern-most latitudes. 

Once trees “know” that summer time is coming to a close, cool, early autumn nights will stimulate cells at the base of each leaf stem, causing them to dry out. This essentially cuts off water to the leaf and puts a stop to the export of carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. This is when the show really begins. Although leaves appear green all summer, that's only due to food-producing chlorophyll molecules in the leaves. Once that production shuts down, the underlying pigments (which are always present in the leaves, but are hidden by chlorophyll production) become visible. These include pigments such as xanthophyll, carotene, and anthocyanin. 

That last pigment—anthocyanin—is the secret ingredient in New England's autumnal landscape because it manifests in a brilliant red color, especially in the leaves of the sugar maple. And this is where a bit of history comes in. Before the arrival of Europeans, the forests of the northeastern U.S. were chock-full of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). Although autumn seasons in pre-colonial America were still magnificent, the widespread presence of this conifer likely created a different autumnal impression. Eventually, European colonists began harvesting the white pine for building homes, furniture, and ships, and according to Harvard Forest, a mixture of broadleaf species (i.e. your colorful, fall trees) like maples, oaks, birches, and ashes took its place.

But that's not all. According to the U.S. National Park Service, by the 1870s, states like Vermont had 80 percent of their forests clear cut—except for the maple trees, due to the economic benefit they represented as a result of producing maple sugar and syrup. These mature trees then outcompeted other species' saplings, and the sugar maple flourished in the region. And because this tree contains all three aforementioned pigments, its leaves run the full spectrum of colors throughout the fall season. 

Of course, the piece that makes this all possible is the overall climate of the northeastern United States. Warm (but not too warm) and wet (but not too wet) summers combined with cool, dry winters provide the perfect setting for this colorful display. If the region experiences a “Goldilocks” year, where all these attributes work together perfectly, then autumn colors will be particularly spectacular. 

However, as you likely guessed, climate change complicates matters, as a more extreme climate and the introduction of pests and diseases means more stress on trees in general, meaning less colorful fall displays. The trees also need cool fall nights in order to produce vibrant colors, and places like Burlington, Vermont, are some 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer during these nights than they were in 1970. 

In 2025, leaf estimates are looking somewhat dour, as a deluge of May rains occurred just as leaves were budding, which led to fungus and mildew that impacted New England broadleafs, according to Boston.com.

“When trees are stressed, they just don't have the energy to allocate into like leaf production and like maintaining and, honestly, just being their best selves,” Stephanie Spera, a geographer from the University of Richmond, told Vermont Public last year. “A warm but not super hot summer. You had adequate rainfall. You don't have pests like the emerald ash borer decimating the leaves […]. It is all of these things working together to create this season.”

Although the hardwood forests of the northeastern U.S. have been around for thousands of years, history shows that the make-up (and therefore the autumnal brilliance) of those forests can change rapidly. As climate change progresses, those coveted “Goldilocks” years could become few and far between—if not disappearing entirely.

Anode-free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising candidates for high-performance energy storage applications. Nonetheless, their translation into practical applications has been hindered by the slow kinetics and reversibility of Li plating and stripping on copper foils. Here we report a two-dimensional polyamide (2DPA)/lithiated Nafion (LN) interphase layer for anode-free Li metal batteries. Through molecular engineering, we construct a 2DPA layer with a large conjugated structure and Li-ion adsorption groups that show efficient adsorption, distribution and nucleation of Li ions. 2DPA molecules assembled into two-dimensional sheets are further incorporated with LN to create an ultrathin interphase layer with high-rate, high-capacity Li plating/stripping. These 2DPA/LN layers have higher rate capabilities and maximal energy and power densities compared with alternative polymer interphase layers, enabling the fabrication of an anode-free pouch cell with high performance. Overall, our interphase engineering approach is a promising tool to push the translation of anode-free Li metal batteries based on two-dimensional polymer interphase layers into practical devices, and enable the fabrication of energy storage technologies with high energy and power densities.

Metrics details

Bacteria often encounter physico-chemical stresses that disrupt division, leading to filamentation, where cells elongate without dividing. Although this adaptive response improves survival, it also exposes filaments to significant mechanical strain, raising questions about the mechanochemical feedback in bacterial systems. In this study, we investigate how mechanical strain modifies the geometry of bacterial filaments and influences the Min oscillatory system, a reaction-diffusion network central to division in Escherichia coli. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining quantitative fluorescence microscopy, biophysical modeling, microfluidics, and patterned growth substrates, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli filaments undergo a growth-induced buckling instability. This phenomenon modulates the spatiotemporal patterning of the Min system. Moreover, we show that synergistic mechanochemical effects determine the location of the division site after stress relief, effectively creating a mechanical “memory” for cytokinesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of mechanical forces and geometric effects in bacterial filamentation and provide new insights into the functional implications of mechanobiology in microbial systems.

Bacterial division has been extensively studied, typically under favorable growth conditions1,2,3. However, bacteria frequently face environmental stresses of diverse kinds, both physical and chemical, that require phenotypic adaptation4,5,6. Filamentation, a phenomenon in which bacteria stop division, but neither genetic replication nor elongation (that is, growth), is a common adaptive response to various stressors, including antibiotic exposure7,8,9,10, nutrient depletion11, oxygen deficiency12, and temperature changes13. The filamentation phenotype provides bacteria with advantages, such as colonizing heterogeneous adhesive surfaces14 or facilitating cell-to-cell dissemination during host invasion15; but it also poses challenges to bacterial cells. Thus, cells must cope with sizes up to hundreds of micrometers16,17 (in contrast to a size of a few microns when cells do not filament). Consequently, bacterial filaments withstand significant mechanical stresses18, compared to those in regular-sized cells, leading to increased susceptibility to bending and buckling forces19,20.

The interplay between mechanical forces and signaling pathways, i.e., the mechanosensing properties, of bacteria during filamentation remains an unresolved question21. Notably, in filaments of rod-shaped bacteria, such as E. coli and B. subtilis, the cell wall growth rate has been shown to depend on mechanical stress, and evidence suggests that MreB (an actin homolog) acts as a membrane curvature sensor18,22,23. However, how mechanical stimuli and curvature modulate other key signaling processes at the core of the filamentation phenomenon, such as the division machinery, is unclear.

The regulation of cell division has been extensively studied in E. coli24,25,26. In particular, the positioning of prospective septa, i.e., the so-called Z-rings27,28, is controlled by the Min oscillatory system (MinC, MinD, and MinE proteins), which follows a reaction-diffusion scheme29,30. Thus, when E. coli undergoes filamentation, the Min system exhibits a standing-wave, multinode pattern, whose potential division sites are located at the minima of the time-averaged Min signal27,31,32. Interestingly, experiments in deformed spheroplasts33, in E. coli with aberrant shapes34,35, and on patterned substrates36, suggest that MinD localizes in regions of high curvature. While the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is, to the best of our knowledge, still under debate, a plausible reason is the reported positive feedback loop between the local membrane curvature and protein concentration37. This is supported by models in cocci-shaped bacteria, where slight deformations cause a micron-scale change in global membrane curvature during cell elongation, which may act as cues to select the plane of division38. These facts raise the intriguing question of whether or not, in bacterial filaments, prone to bend and buckle, Min patterning is influenced by mechanical stress and curvature (or the other way around). Moreover, given that Min patterning determines the prospective locations for cell cleavage, does mechanical stress and changes in the filament's geometry condition the division sites in filaments when environmental stress ends and cytokinesis resumes?

Herein, we address these questions using a multidisciplinary approach that combines quantitative fluorescent time-lapse microscopy, micro-patterning of growth substrates, biophysical models, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) analyses, and microfluidics. Our results reveal that bacterial filaments undergo growth-induced buckling instability that leads to a mechanochemical interplay between the Min oscillatory system and the curvature, preceded by the positioning of FtsZ rings. Further, we explore the post-stress consequences of such an interplay and conclude that it sets preferential division sites. Altogether, our study sheds light on the mechanobiology of bacterial filaments and their functional role.

In our experiments, we used the antibiotic aztreonam to induce E. coli filamentation. Antibiotic-induced filamentation is widely used as a model to study bacterial adaptation under stress39,40. In clinically relevant settings, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by pathogenic E. coli, antibiotic treatments trigger filamentation via SOS response activation and division inhibition by SulA17. Furthermore, during infection, filamentation may occur through alternative pathways to that of SulA, such as the DamX-mediated pathway41. In this work, we chose aztreonam, which specifically inhibits FtsI - the cell division protein responsible for catalyzing peptidoglycan cross-linking at the septum42. At sub-lethal concentrations, aztreonam maintains membrane integrity and allows Z-ring assembly while preventing cell division, thereby inducing filament formation9,43. In our case, E. coli cultures were grown in M9 minimal medium to an OD600 of 0.3 before inoculation onto 2% agarose pads containing 10 μg/ml of aztreonam (Methods). Under these conditions, time-lapse microscopy revealed cell filamentation (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Movie 1). Growing filaments exhibited a buckling instability, which became more likely for filaments longer than  ~10 μm (Supplementary Fig. 1). In our study, we utilized the DH5α strain, which exhibits a lower Young's modulus compared to K1244, thereby potentially facilitating the buckling phenomenon. This instability is, at first, counterintuitive, since cell elongation could be thought as a tensile stress, whereas buckling develops due to compressive stresses37. In that regard, our estimation of the critical load required to induce filament buckling is on the order of \({{\mathcal{O}}}\left(1{0}^{1}\right)\) nN (Methods). Buckling led to high curvature values with radii smaller than the characteristic length of non-filamentous E. coli cells: ∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1 (Fig. 1A). In this context, we used ∣κ∣ as a proxy for mechanical strain.

A Phase contrast images of a representative E. coli filament growing on 10 μg/ml aztreonam agarose pads. Following cell segmentation and tracking (Methods), the curvature of the filaments is computed along the midline. At a given location (e.g., yellow point) the curvature, ∣κ∣, is computed as the inverse of the radius of the circumference that is tangent to that point (green circle): ∣κ∣ = 1/R. As time progresses and the filament grows, the snapshots reveal a buckling instability where large values of ∣κ∣ are reached by the central region of the filament (see E). B Cartoon of the mechanical toy model. Forces are exerted by a chain of connected springs (black). Nodes (grey circles) are subjected to elastic and bending forces. Due to cellular growth, the elastic energy relies on the time-dependent distance, L(t), between consecutive nodes (Methods). Bending energy depends on the angle θ as determined by neighboring segments. C Snapshots of a simulated growing filament (initial length: 50 μm; doubling time: 50 min). Color scales for each time point indicate the elastic (top) and bending (bottom) energies using pair-wise moving average coordinates (Methods). As time progresses, elastic energy accumulates by the central region. Buckling leads to a relaxation of the elastic energy at the expense of an increase of the bending energy (black triangles). D Ratio of the total energy between soft and stiff filaments (soft: \(\widetilde{\Omega }=0.9\); stiff: \(\widetilde{\Omega }=2\); sample size: n = 100 simulations). As time progresses, the panel shows that stiff filaments that are not able to buckle increase their energy. E Density histograms of the curvature of filaments as a function of the relative position as obtained in experiments (left) and simulations (pair-wise moving average coordinates; right). Sample size: n = 22 (experiments) and n = 100 (simulations). The color scale represents probability. Larger curvatures (buckling) accumulate in the central region of the filament.

To understand this phenomenon, we developed a mechanical toy model. The model consists of a 2D chain of massless nodes connected by linear springs. Segments connecting nodes are also subjected to bending forces (Methods, Fig. 1B). The springs were assumed to be identical (i.e., same elastic and bending constants). In the model, we neglected inertial effects and included energy dissipation. Thus, the model comprises the minimal components required to mimic the filament mechanics at low Reynolds numbers by disregarding the 3D structure of the cells, the adhesion forces to a substrate, and plastic deformation effects (see Discussion).

The theoretical analysis and our simulations confirmed that, as expected, if the equilibrium length of the springs, l0, is kept constant, then the simulated filaments reach a straight configuration regardless of the initial condition (Methods). However, if growth is included such that the equilibrium length depends on time, i.e., \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)\), then buckling develops (Supplementary Movie 2). Consequently, our model argues in favor of cellular growth as the driving force underlying buckling in agreement with recent studies on bacterial chains45. On the one hand, the growth of the springs located at the middle of the chain is dampened by the growth of the surrounding springs that push back. On the other hand, springs located by the poles of the chain find less opposition to growth. As a result, elastic energy accumulates at the central region of filaments (compressive stress), and energy relaxation can only be achieved by buckling. This buckling dynamics is revealed in our model by bending events at different length scales. Thus, local stresses at a scale of few nodes cause zig-zag configurations in the chain of springs. In addition, at a larger length scale, there is macroscopic buckling as revealed by the changes of the local curvature of the midline as experimentally shown (e.g., Fig. 1A). In order to distinguish between these different, yet complementary, phenomena, and properly compare simulations and experiments, we implemented a moving average approach (Methods).

As shown in Fig. 1C, our model reproduces that the accumulation of elastic energy (compressive stresses) due to growth decreases at the expense of an increase of the bending energy. The total energy decrease due to the buckling instability can be observed in Fig. 1D by comparing filaments with different (dimensionless) bending moduli: \(\widetilde{\Omega }=0.9\) (soft filament) vs. \(\widetilde{\Omega }=2\) (stiff filament). Thus, as time progresses, the simulations show that stiff filaments that are not able to buckle heap up energy with respect to soft filaments. The model also predicts that since compressive stresses accumulate at the middle of the filament, buckling is more likely to develop at that location. In that regard, Fig. 1E shows that in both, experiments and simulations, the region of the filament with the largest curvature is the central one. The experimental Fig. 1E also allows us to estimate the onset of buckling for ∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1, as these values are reached only at the central region of the filament.

In summary, the mechanical model explains the buckling phenomenon observed in growing E. coli filaments. Buckling events are more likely by the central region because the filament ends are able to elongate freely, whereas the middle section must exert larger forces in order to push and displace the rest of the filament. This mismatch between the growing dynamics of different regions of the filament leads to an accumulation of compressive stresses that ultimately cause the filaments to buckle.

In order to study how buckling-induced mechanical stress affects signaling proteins related to the filamentation phenomenon, we focused on the Min system. The MinCDE oscillatory system prevents FtsZ polymerization and, consequently, plays an important role in the filamentation and cell division processes46,47,48. In particular, MinD protein localizes either at the cell membrane or in the cytosol, depending on its ATP activity and it is a proxy for the activity and localization of MinC and MinE (see Supplementary Fig. 2). In our study, we used an E. coli strain that expresses the recombinant fluorescent protein YFP:MinD (Methods).

We tracked and measured, simultaneously, MinD and the curvature of the middle cell axis of E. coli filaments by quantitative time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 2, see also Supplementary Movie 3). In our analyses, we focused on growing filaments exhibiting two key characteristics: (1) constant MinD concentration (intensity per unit area) over time, and (2) persistent standing wave patterns. As for (1), since our analyses rely on fluorescent microscopy data quantification, we assume that all MinD molecules fold correctly and are fluorescent-active. We note that constant MinD concentration indicates a constant MinD production as the body mass increases in agreement with recent results49 (see Supplementary Fig. 3 and Methods). Furthermore, the maintained standing wave oscillations (see below) suggest a stable MinE/MinD ratio during the observation period50. This standing wave pattern allowed us to pinpoint the location of the non-functional FtsZ septa during filamentation (regions with a sustained low concentration of MinD). Interestingly, we observed that MinD concentration (i.e., the amplitude of the pattern) was dependent on the level of curvature, Fig. 2A. In particular, the average intensity of the MinD signal seemed to increase in buckled regions and, concurrently, the imaging data suggested that the nodes of the MinD pattern (i.e., local minima) tallied with large curvature peaks.

Black solid lines represent the mean (Low: 0.22; High: −0.14). D Normalized MinD intensity (mean and standard deviation) as a function of the curvature in non-patterned agarose pads (same dataset as in (C)) and in micro-patterned growth substrates (n = 20 filaments). Solid lines are, in both cases, a logarithmic fit: Eqn. (1), Methods. Inset: Illustrative phase contrast image of an E. coli filament growing in a micro-patterned agarose pad (scale bar: 10 μm).

To quantitatively assess the interplay between MinD patterning and buckling, we computed kymographs and performed temporal averages of MinD and curvature profiles (Fig. 2B). As expected, the number of nodes of the standing wave increased as the filament grew. However, other properties of the pattern, such as the wavelength (at any given time) and the period (at any given location) were not affected by buckling (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Further, these values were fairly conserved among filaments: \({{\uplambda}}=\left(7.6\pm 1.0\right)\,\mu {{\rm{m}}}\) and \(T=\left(55\pm 10\right)\) s (Supplementary Fig. 4A), in agreement with previous studies27. Our analysis confirmed that MinD peaks avoided regions with high curvature (∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1). To deepen into this effect, we computed the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the averaged MinD and the curvature profiles (Methods) and differentiate between regions with high (∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1) and low (∣κ∣ < 0.5 μm−1) curvature values (Supplementary Fig. 4B). The results, Fig. 2C, revealed a significant anti-correlation in high-curvature regions and a positive correlation in low-curvature regions (Mann-Whitney U test: α = 5 ⋅ 10−2 significance level). As for the quantitative relationship between MinD concentration and buckling, we computed the value of the normalized intensity (per filament) of the wave envelope as a function of the curvature, Fig. 2D (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 4C). The analysis confirmed an increase in MinD as a function of the curvature, which reaches a plateau for curvature values above 0.5 μm−1 (Fig. 2D non-patterned agarose). In order to verify that the phenomenon of MinD correlation and accumulation as a function of the curvature is independent of MinD concentration, we performed experiments decreasing the plasmid induction 10 fold (Supplementary Fig. 5). Our results support that the phenomena observed for the previous plasmid induction are also valid at this MinD concentration. Likewise, we also tested whether the mechanical instability and its effects on MinD patterning are strain-dependent. For this, we replicated the experiment using a K12 strain (Supplementary Movie 4) that confirms the results obtained previously for Dh5α.

Given that our results indicate that buckling instability naturally develops in the central region of filaments (Fig. 1E), we further tested whether MinD accumulation preferentially occurs at regions of higher local curvature versus at locations by the middle (where growth-induced compressive stresses accumulate). To that end, we designed micro-patterned growth substrates (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 6), where we externally control the bending and curvature of the filaments along their body length (inset Fig. 2D and Supplementary Movie 5). Our analysis of MinD intensity as a function of the curvature revealed in this case a similar trend (Fig. 2D: patterned agarose). We notice that micro-patterned pads could not be used to perform a MinD-curvature correlation study (i.e., Fig. 2C). As mentioned above, that analysis requires to achieve local curvatures above 0.5 μm−1. However, we observed that E. coli filaments would escape the regions of the guiding growth patterns with curvatures larger than 0.4 μm−1. Therefore, our data support that MinD accumulation is driven by local curvature rather than by growth-induced mechanical strain, and, overall, the existence of a modulation of Min patterning due to curvature effects. These findings align with previous studies conducted on non-filamentous E. coli cells37 (Discussion).

Previous studies have shown that membrane curvature and mechanical stress alter the assembly dynamics of proteins as well as their diffusive properties37,51,52,53,54,55. In that regard, since local changes in protein dynamics lead to local modifications in protein concentration, we wondered whether the modulation of the MinD pattern in buckled regions is driven by this physical phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we performed Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) assays and numerical simulations. Given the oscillatory behavior of MinD, we devised a methodology of FRAP data that weights up the standing-wave patterning properties of the signal (Methods, Fig. 3A). Our analysis relies on the fact that a standing wave can be decomposed as the sum of two waves traveling in opposite directions with phase velocities c = λ/T. To characterize the effect of buckling in protein dynamics, we photobleached MinD and computed the dimensionless ratio between the fluorescence recovery speed, vr, and c. Here, vr is defined as vr = d/tr, where d is the distance from a MinD peak in the non-photobleached domain (emitter) to the location where the recovery (≥ 30%) of the MinD signal is observed (receiver), and tr is the recovery time following photobleaching (Methods, Fig. 3B). We note that the normalization of vr with respect to c accounts for possible differences (i.e., variability) among filaments with respect to their wave properties. Consequently, the larger vr/c, the faster the signal propagation due to the transport mechanism underlying patterning.

A Cartoon illustrating the FRAP experimental quantification (see text). B Top: Composite of bright-field and MinD fluorescence of a filament before photobleaching. The colored area highlights the photobleached region. The blue circle indicates the pulse for which the fluorescence recovery is analyzed (receiver). The orange circle highlights the non-photobleached pulse before the buckled region (emitter). Bottom: Kymograph of the FRAP experiment performed over the filament shown in the top. C Violin plots showing the dimensionless velocity recovery, vr/c, of the pulse's recovery for straight (n = 17) and buckled (n = 8) filaments. Black lines account for the mean (Straight: 1.40; Buckled: 1.18). Buckled filaments reveal a larger recovery, thus indicating a slower diffusive transport.

To test this approach, we performed several control experiments (Supplementary Fig. 7). In the case of non-filamentous bacteria showing one pole-to-pole MinD pulse, photobleaching the pulse precludes recovery within the temporal observation window (~2.5 × T, Supplementary Fig. 7A). However, photobleaching one cell pole while there was a signal outside the photobleached region led to MinD recovery within the observation window (Supplementary Fig. 7B). This hints that signal recovery requires MinD traveling from a non-photobleached region within the filament. To further investigate this, we conducted the same experiment using short filaments. Consistent with the previous results, when we photobleached all of the MinD (Supplementary Fig. 7C), we observed no signal recovery. However, when we photobleached one of the pulses, while leaving at least one other MinD pulse intact, recovery was detected (Supplementary Fig. 7D). We applied the aforementioned methodology to buckled (∣κ∣max > 0.5 μm−1) and straight (∣κ∣max < 0.5 μm−1) filaments. Our results, Fig. 3B, indicate that buckling slows down the velocity recovery vr/c, therefore suggesting either a decrease in protein diffusivity or a change in the attachment/detachment kinetics in curved regions, as previously shown53,54,55,56,57,58,59.

To further clarify our findings from the FRAP experiments, we conducted numerical simulations. In that regard, since the cross-sectional shape of the bacterial filaments remains unchanged due to bending/buckling, we do not expect that the transport properties of MinD in the cytoplasm are affected60. Consequently, we focus in our simulations on the effect of curvature on membrane diffusivity and on the binding kinetics of Min proteins. Our approach is based on a signaling model that accounts for the main molecular interactions of Min species, including oligomerization and the MinE-mediated hydrolysis of MinD-ATP (Fig. 4A and Methods)61.

Top: Kymograph of a filament with an initial length of 50 μm growing for its doubling time (50 min). For \(t\in \left(0,20\right)\) min (dashed purple line), no buckling is implemented. For \(t\in \left(20,50\right)\) min (solid purple line), the membrane diffusion coefficients of proteins are set to a 30% of their values within a 3 μm-wide band (Methods). Bottom: Temporal averages of MinD (arbitrary units) for a period of 20 minutes immediately before (dashed purple line) and a period of 30 minutes immediately after (solid purple line) the diffusion drop within the region delimited by the white dashed lines shown in the kymograph. The green line delimits the region where the simulated curvature reaches ∣κ∣ ~1μm−1 as represented in the inset.

In our simulations we implemented an exponential growth of the filaments (i.e., elongation) and the aforementioned changes in protein dynamics in a 3 μm region —approximately the width of a MinD peak— where ∣κ∣ ~1 μm−1 (Methods). As for the effect this has on membrane diffusivity on Min proteins, we estimated that such curvature implies a  ~30% decrease of its original value54. Under those conditions, the MinD accumulation pattern in buckled regions observed in our simulations resembled the experimental results (cf. Fig. 2B middle and Fig. 4B).

As for the effect on patterning caused by changes in the binding rate of Min proteins to the cell membrane, previous experiments in septins have shown that going from a flat filament to the simulated curvature implies an approximate 100% increase in the binding rate (see Fig. 2B in ref. 59). Under these conditions, our simulations indicate that Min patterning is disrupted (Supplementary Fig. 8A), which contrasts with our experimental observations (Fig. 2B, middle). In fact, the same experimental figure suggests that the binding rate remains constant for ∣κ∣ ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 μm−1, for which we already see MinD accumulation in our experiments (Fig. 2D). To investigate whether a specific range of binding rates could lead to accumulation, we tested values down to a 10% increase, finding this to be the minimum increase that does not disrupt MinD patterning and resembles the scenario we observe experimentally (Supplementary Fig. 8B).

In summary, FRAP experiments and numerical simulations support the idea that buckling modifies the membrane diffusivity of Min proteins, which in turn causes protein accumulation.

Herein we have shown that curvature peaks positively correlate with sustained MinD signal minima (i.e., as shown in Fig. 2C, high curvature —indicating large mechanical strain— and MinD maxima are anti-correlated). This observation prompted us to investigate whether Min patterning and mechanical effects might synergistically determine preferred division sites in post-stress conditions.

To verify this, we conducted microfluidic experiments adapting the protocol established by Wehrens et al.32 (Methods). Cells were initially cultured in M9 medium under normal growth conditions, then switched to stressor medium (M9 + aztreonam) for 3 − 5 hours to induce filamentation. During this period, we observed progressive cell elongation followed by buckling. Division was restored by returning cells to pure M9 medium, at which point the filamented bacteria resumed cytokinesis16,32,62 (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Movie 6).

After 1 h, aztreonam was added to the culture medium to induce filamentation. 5 h later, aztreonam was removed such that filaments resumed cytokinesis, and the curvature at the division locations was calculated.

E Probability density distribution of lag times between FtsZ ring appearance and a buckling event. On average, FtsZ precedes bending by 22 min, and the most probable value is 63 min. Each bin corresponds to 9 min (sample size n = 19). F 5 min average of fluorescent channel showing DNA distribution, avoiding curvature peaks (highlighted with white arrows) in a filament in the microfluidic device. G Violin plots showing the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the DNA signal and curvature. The correlation was calculated separating the buckled region (high) and the non-buckled regions (low) as done with MinD in Fig. 2C (sample size n = 47). Solid lines represent the means of the distributions (Low: 0.02; High: −0.20).

Under these conditions, we selected buckled filaments with a maximum curvature exceeding 0.5 μm−1 and characterized the curvature at the division sites, ∣κ∣div. (Fig. 5B). For the analysis, we included divisions in filaments longer than 8 μm (either the originally selected ones or those resulting from divisions of longer filaments), ensuring that at least two division rings (or 3 sustained MinD pulses) were assembled in the cell (Fig. 5B). We note that the morphological differences observed in filaments growing in microfluidic traps compared to those on agarose pads are primarily attributable to the substrate. Filaments within microfluidic chips appear wider due to slight compression between the two rigid surfaces of the trap. Furthermore, these filaments experience greater frictional forces with the substrate (the two “sandwiching” stiff surfaces) than those growing on softer agarose pads, which favors the development of curvature, resulting in a more wiggly appearance63. Fig. 5C shows the probability density function (PDF) of the curvature at the division points (blue), revealing that filament division is more likely to occur at sites with ∣κ∣div.≥ 0.5 μm−1 (mean division curvature: \(\langle | \kappa {| }_{div.}\rangle=\left(0.6\pm 0.4\right)\,\mu {{{\rm{m}}}}^{-1}\)). In contrast, the PDF of the curvature of filaments, ∣κ∣fil., just before cytokinesis (Fig. 5C, orange) shows a distribution shifted towards lower curvatures (\(\langle | \kappa {| }_{fil.}\rangle=\left(0.3\pm 0.3\right)\,\mu {{{\rm{m}}}}^{-1}\)). Given that the threshold curvature value to observe a negative correlation between curvature maxima and MinD sustained minima is 0.5 μm−1, we calculated the fraction of divisions occurring above this threshold. Our results, revealed that 60% of divisions were above the threshold. If we normalize the curvature at the division site by the mean curvature of the filament, the divisions above the mean curvature would account for 82% of the total.

In this context, we also analyzed Z-ring dynamics (Supplementary Movie 7). To this end, we employed the MG1655 strain expressing gfp::ftsZ (Methods). We then quantified the correlation between the FtsZ signal and the curvature profile, as depicted in Fig. 5D. Given that FtsZ forms a dynamic Z-ring that disassembles (FtsZ depolymerization) before the onset of buckling, we computed the lag time to account for a potential temporal delay, as shown in Fig. 5E. Our results indicate that regions of high curvature are preceded by Z-rings by an average of 22 minutes. Importantly, the findings from these experiments suggest that divisome dynamics contribute to an increase in curvature (see Discussion). The role of the Min oscillatory system in influencing chromosome positioning and segregation has been a topic of debate64,65. In that regard, we additionally checked whether DNA segregation within the filaments followed the pattern dictated by MinD pulses, i.e., whether the DNA avoided the curvature peaks in filaments. To that end, we labeled and tracked the DNA in living filaments using SYTOX Orange (Methods). We found that DNA was distributed in a discrete manner along the filament avoiding curvature peaks, Fig. 5D. This avoidance became more pronounced as curvature increased (see Supplementary Fig. 9). These locations putatively mark the positioning of division septa when cytokinesis resumes32,62. To quantitatively assess the relationship between DNA distribution and the curvature of filaments, we computed the correlation of their profiles (Fig. 5E). Our results revealed a significant anti-correlation (Mann-Whitney U test: α = 5 ⋅ 10−2 significance level). This demonstrates that either the absence of DNA facilitates bending or that curvature can influence chromosomal positioning, in line with previous studies showing that DNA can “sense” the curvature of the cell walls and adjust accordingly38,64. Consequently, these findings endorse the view that regions of high curvature, and thus mechanical strain, play a crucial, functional role in determining preferential division sites in post-stress filaments.

Previous investigations have studied E. coli filamentation and have established that Z-ring positioning is reallocated in response to the filament size32. Our study builds on this understanding by revealing how mechanical forces develop during E. coli filamentation resulting in an increase in curvature, which affects the Min system —the protein complex responsible for positioning the division ring. In particular, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for filament buckling, linking three key factors: (1) FtsZ ring positioning, (2) local DNA depletion, and (3) mechanical strain accumulation. This spatiotemporal relationship emerges naturally from energy minimization principles: as filaments grow, elastic energy accumulates, which is subsequently reduced through bending events. In this context, previous studies have shown that E. coli filaments exhibit elastic behavior when subjected to transient external forces. However, sustained external forces lead to significant cell wall synthesis, resulting in plastic deformations in which the localized activity of MreB plays a key role19,20,66. Additionally, hydrodynamic and adhesion forces have also been shown to influence filament shape43. A point warranting discussion is the role of the 2D constrained growth employed in our experiments in the observed buckling phenomenon. Confinement undoubtedly exacerbates buckling, as a 3D environment typically offers more space for stress redistribution, potentially leading to a more gradual dissipation of instabilities63. However, buckling has also been observed during 3D bacterial growth, as evidenced, for instance, in UTIs caused by pathogenic E. coli17. We also emphasize that 2D confined growth of bacteria occurs naturally in various settings, such as the early stages of biofilm development63. This evidence suggests that a comprehensive quantitative description of the mechanical properties of filaments would require incorporating mechanisms and processes that were excluded from our model, as we deemed them unnecessary given the convincing results achieved using only a linear elastic theory.

Regarding the impact of the buckling instability and curvature on Min signaling, we demonstrated that MinD can adjust in response to both naturally occurring curvatures and controlled curvatures induced by patterned growth substrates. Specifically, MinD accumulates in regions of increasing curvature, and for curvatures exceeding 0.5 μm−1, our data indicated that MinD maxima avoid curvature peaks. This phenomenon may be attributed to the increased surface-to-bulk ratio characteristic of high-curvature regions, which can induce geometry-dependent behavior in mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems27,67,68,69. In fact, previous studies suggested that increased protein binding leads to increased membrane occupancy, thereby reducing the diffusion of proteins across the membrane70 and that curvature changes the binding affinity of membrane proteins affecting their diffusion71. This, together with our simulations, points to a decrease in diffusion as the primarily responsible of the accumulation of MinD in regions of high curvature. Our FRAP experiments are consistent with this hypothesis. However, the observed differences in the FRAP results are not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test: α = 5 ⋅ 10−2 significance level), probably because despite having attempted to mitigate variations between filaments by normalizing the data considering each filament's wavelength and period, this approach required these parameters to remain consistent before and after photobleaching, which was not always the case. In that regard, it is worth mentioning that some studies have reported that cumulative light excitation slowed down GFP:MinD oscillations by about 10 s, potentially influencing FRAP results72. Due to these challenges, we got a low number of bona fide replicates among all the samples taken. Thus, given the limited statistics, the FRAP results should be considered as an indication, rather than as clear evidence, to support the modification of the membrane diffusion parameter in the signalling model. We also note that Min patterning modulation may be influenced by mechanisms beyond slower diffusion in buckled regions. In that regard, some studies have shown changes in the membrane association and dissociation kinetics of some proteins due to membrane curvature effects58,59. However, to the best of our knowledge, in the case of Min proteins the only documented changes of the binding affinity are related to membrane composition in the context of synthetic vesicles73. To further assess the role played by changes in the binding rate, we performed numerical simulations (Supplementary Fig. 8). We concluded that mild changes in the binding rate constant disrupts MinD patterning, further supporting the idea that the main contribution to MinD accumulation is caused by a diffusion drop due to an increase in curvature.

Our study also explored the implications of our findings in post-stress conditions that lead to the resumption of cytokinesis in filaments. Given MinD's role in inhibiting the divisome assembly in E. coli, and the observed tendency of Min to avoid curvature peaks, we hypothesized that Z-rings that assemble at these peaks would operate preferentially. Indeed, in our microfluidic experiments, when the stressor medium was removed —once the filaments reached high curvature values— the majority of division events occurred at curvatures exceeding the mean filament curvature. Additionally, the cross-correlation analysis between the FtsZ signal and the curvature profiles indicates that Z-ring formation preferentially precedes regions of high curvature, suggesting a contribution of the division machinery to the enhancement of curvature. Thus, mechanical buckling conditions Min patterning such that the standing wave nodes avoid regions of high curvature and favors Z-ring assembly, which in turn eventually contributes to increased curvature (arguably because the subsequent depolymerization of FtsZ and peptidoglycan remodeling softens the cell wall). Furthermore, this observation aligned with our characterization of DNA distribution within the filaments, which also avoided curvature peaks. Thus, in agreement with the current knowledge about the causality relationship among all the components mentioned in our work, the Min system acts first, the nucleoid occlusion then refines the permissive region from MinCDE by ensuring Z-ring formation happens only after chromosome segregation begins74. The absence of DNA in turn facilitates bending driven by compressive forces because the cell is “emptier” in those regions (i.e., softer). Ultimately, these results suggest the existence of a mechanical “memory” for cytokinesis, where the interplay between mechanical strain and signaling mechanisms defines the preferential division sites.

In a broader context, Min's sensitivity to the shape of its “container” is not unique to E. coli56,71. For example, in B. subtilis, an analogous complex to Fts, known as DivIVA, localizes to regions of highest curvature due to MinD's preference for flatter membrane regions67. In Staphylococcus aureus, a cocci-shaped bacterium, some models suggest that a modification in membrane curvature during elongation is used by DivIVA to recognize the next division plane38. Mechanical deformations in minimal systems, such as liposomes containing Min proteins, have also been shown to alter Min patterning68. Specifically, MinE has been observed to distribute asymmetrically in response to liposome deformation. Interestingly, MinE accumulation and liposome deformation appear to mutually promote one another, suggesting a positive mechanochemical feedback loop that may play a role in our system.

Finally, while our study focuses on Min, other components of the divisome could be affected by changes in cell geometry and mechanical stress in the membrane. In fact, a previous study has reported that MreB is correlated with the nucleoid position in E. coli unperturbed cells, but this correlation decreases when the cell geometry changes75. Thus, studying other components involved in the elongation, division, and regulation of the mechanical properties of cells is crucial for the complete understanding of the relationship between signaling, filamentation, and cytokinesis, and its implications for bacterial adaptation and antibiotic resistance76. Also, in this study, we have focused on antibiotic-induced filamentation mediated by activation of the SOS response, leading to division inhibition via SulA. However, during UTIs, other pathways, such as those involving DamX41, have been shown to regulate bacterial cell shape. This raises the intriguing question of how filamentation in certain clinical contexts, which do not necessarily involve alterations in membrane composition, differs from the phenomenon described here. Notably, our results demonstrate that the underlying physical mechanism driving buckling still applies when using bacterial strains with varying membrane stiffness. Nonetheless, in UTIs where filamentation is actively regulated by DamX or alternative mechanisms, the buckling process may also be subject to active control. Future studies could shed light on how these regulatory pathways influence buckling dynamics, potentially guiding the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat UTIs.

Experiments were conducted using the Escherichia coli strain DH5α (NZYTech), transformed with the plasmid pYLS68 (Plac-yfp::minD minE::cfp), generously provided by Dr. Shih77. Overnight cultures were initiated from a single colony and grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm.

After overnight growth, cultures were diluted to a final OD600 of  ~0.01 in minimal M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose, 1 mM thiamine hydrochloride, 0.2% casamino acids, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 100 μM IPTG for plasmid induction (except for Supplementary Fig. 5 where 10 μM IPTG was used). These cultures were incubated under the same conditions as the overnight cultures until they reached an OD600 of 0.2−0.3. Subsequently, they were further diluted to OD600 ~0.005 to prepare the working cell culture.

Low-melting-point agarose pads were prepared following the protocol described in ref. 78 using M9-supplemented medium and 10 μg/ml aztreonam to induce bacterial filamentation as previously described43. Subsequently, 2 μl of the working culture were inoculated onto the agarose pads. The pads were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then dried in a desiccator for 20 min. Once placed in the microscopy dish (IBIDI μ-Dish 35 mm, low), they were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow the cells to develop the filamentation phenotype.

To pattern the agarose growth substrates, master mold structures were fabricated on standard silicon samples. The fabrication process employed electron-beam direct writing on a Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist film. The electron-beam exposure, performed with a Jeol JBX-8100FS tool, was optimized to achieve the desired dimensions using an acceleration voltage of 100 keV and a beam current of 20 nA. After developing the PMMA resist using a conventional 1: 3 MIBK/IPA developer, the resist patterns were transferred onto the silicon samples using an optimized Inductively Coupled Plasma-Reactive Ion Etching process with fluoride gases (SF6, C4F8). The remaining resist was removed with oxygen plasma.

The etched silicon patterns were used as molds for fabricating complementary patterns on PDMS. The silicon structures were silanized in gas with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (97%, stabilized with copper) for approximately 27 h by placing a droplet of the silanizer near the sample in a vacuum desiccator. A mixture of silicone elastomer base and curing agent (in a mass ratio of 1: 10) was poured onto the silanized silicon pattern and cured in an oven at 90 °C for 1 h. The cured PDMS stamp was cooled for 20 min at room temperature before being carefully peeled off from the silicon mold. This PDMS stamp contained a pattern complementary to that of the silicon mold.

To prepare the patterned agarose substrates, 2.5% low melting point agarose in culture medium with 1 μg/ml aztreonam was poured onto the PDMS stamp and covered with a 2 × 2 cm coverglass. After refrigeration for 15 min, the coverglass was removed, and the PDMS was separated from the agarose. Finally, 2 μl of cell culture with an OD600 of 0.2–0.3 was inoculated on the agar pad. The agar pads were dried in a laminar flow hood for 15 min before being transferred to a glass-bottom dish (IBIDI μ-Dish 35 mm, low). The same PDMS mold could be reused after proper cleaning: it was immersed in 100% ethanol, sonicated for 15 min, rinsed thoroughly with DI water, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h.

The patterns were designed using the open-source mask design tool Nazca Design79. Four designs were created to control the curvature of the filaments (Supplementary Fig. 6): three based on curved channels and one based on a lattice of pillars. The “wave” pattern featured a sequence of “s” curves formed by connecting three half-circular bends, each with a different radius of curvature (Supplementary Fig. 6A). The “snake” pattern consisted of a sequence of “s” curves, where each “s” was formed by two half-circular bends, with the radius of curvature alternating every half rotation (Supplementary Fig. 6B). For both patterns, the radius of curvature ranged from 0.35 μm to 12 μm. The “spiral” pattern was composed of half-circular bends with a radius of curvature increasing from 0.8 μm to 10.4 μm in increments of 0.8 μm per half rotation (Supplementary Fig. 6C). The width of the channels for these three patterns ranged from 0.7 μm to 1.1 μm. The fourth design was a triangular lattice of circles, each equidistant from its neighbors, with connected spaces in between. The diameters of the circles ranged from 2 μm to 10 μm, in 1 μm increments, and the lattice constant ranged from 2.7 μm to 10.7 μm (Supplementary Fig. 6D).

Images were acquired using a Leica Thunder inverted microscope, equipped with a HC PL-APO CS2 63 × /1.40 oil objective and a CMOS camera (Leica DFC9000 GTC). Köhler illumination was applied to optimize image contrast in transmitted light mode (phase contrast). Fluorophore excitation was performed using the Spectra-X Light Engine LED lamp, which features 8 solid-state LEDs. For MinD observation, excitation was performed at 510 nm and YFP filter settings (Ex: 495/517 nm, Em: 527/551 nm) combined with an external filter wheel at 535 ± 35 nm; for FtsZ excitation at 475 nm and GFP filter settings (Ex: 450/490 nm, Em: 500/540 nm) and the external filter at 535 ± 35 nm; and for dyed DNA at 555 nm and SYTOX filter settings (Ex: 542/566 nm, Em: 578/610 nm) and the external filter at 590 ± 25 nm. The Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) software was used for microscope control and image acquisition. All experimental procedures were conducted at 37 °C with temperature regulation provided by the IBIDI heating system.

Unless otherwise specified, time-lapses were acquired with an interframe time of 10 s over a 30-min duration, using 20% light source power (Spectra-X nominal output power 500 mW), 30 ms exposure time, and 2 × 2 binning. While our plasmid produces upon induction MinE:CFP and YFP:MinD protein fusions, images were only taken in the YFP channel (MinD) due to the high photobleaching and phototoxicity when trying to get a signal in the CFP channel (MinE) at the desired image acquisition rate during our long-term experiments.

For MinD membrane localization, a Z-stack was acquired with a HC PL-APO 100 ×/1.40 oil objective. The Z-stack resolution was 0.27 μm for a total range of 2.43 μm. To remove out-of-plane light effects, a Leica Thunder Small-Volume Computational Clearing filter was applied to the stack. To characterize the fluorescence profile, a line was drawn with Fiji80, and the function “Plot profile” was used.

Using Fiji80, the background was removed from all images with a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels in the fluorescent channel. The brightness and contrast of the phase-contrast images were adjusted to maximize contrast based on the characteristics of each image. However, the levels of the fluorescence images were consistently adjusted between 200 and 5000 to ensure comparability. Segmentation was performed on the phase-contrast images using the WeKa plugin81. The resulting segmentation masks were then used to analyze both phase-contrast and fluorescence images with the MicrobeJ plugin82, allowing us to extract quantitative data.

The coordinates of the medial axis obtained from MicrobeJ were analyzed to calculate the local curvature of the filaments using Mathematica83 (Fig. 1A). The Mathematica code employs finite differences to estimate the first and second derivatives at each point of the medial axis of the filament. The output is a list of point pairs representing curvature and normalized length. To verify the curvature results, the known curvature of the agarose-patterned substrates was used as a control. To reduce noise, curvature data were smoothed using 5-min time-averages. Additionally, the curvature profile was further smoothed when the maximum filament curvature was  < 0.3 μm−1 to decrease noise. For filaments displaying buckling, this step was unnecessary as their curvatures typically reached  ~1 μm−1, with a noise level of ~0.1 μm−1.

To estimate MinD's concentration as a function of time, we quantified its cumulative fluorescent intensity in filaments (i.e., the total fluorescent signal of MinD in a filament) normalized by the area of the filament (Supplementary Fig. 3). The value of MinD concentration, ρMinD, results from a balance between different processes: the (unknown) MinD's production, \(f\left({\rho }_{MinD}\right)\), the degradation (exponential), μ ⋅ ρMinD, and the protein dilution due to the increasing body mass, (1/V)(dV/dt)ρMinD (where V is the filament volume). That is, in general terms, the rate of change in MinD concentration as a function of time reads, \(d{\rho }_{MinD}/dt=f\left({\rho }_{MinD}\right)-\mu \cdot {\rho }_{MinD}-\left(\log \left(2\right)/\tau \right){\rho }_{MinD}=f\left({\rho }_{MinD}\right)-\alpha {\rho }_{MinD}\) where α is a constant (τ being the replication time) and where we used the fact that filaments increase their body mass exponentially32. Consequently, since our data indicates that dρMinD/dt ~0, i.e, \({\rho }_{MinD} \sim {{\rm{const.}}}\) (see Supplementary Fig. 3), it results that \(f\left({\rho }_{MinD}\right) \sim \alpha {\rho }_{MinD} \sim {{\rm{const.}}}\): the production remains constant with the increasing body mass. We note that this methodological approach of using the fluorescent signal to measure protein concentration has been used in the past and confirmed with Western Blot analyses49.

MinD intensity profiles obtained from MicrobeJ were analyzed to perform Fourier analysis of MinD oscillations in both space and time. These profiles were also used to compute the Pearson correlation between MinD intensity and curvature profiles using Mathematica. High- and low-curvature regions were defined using a curvature threshold of 0.5 μm−1. High-curvature regions were defined from the left valley of the first peak, where curvature exceeded 0.5 μm−1 to the right valley of the last peak, exceeding this threshold (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Low-curvature regions were defined from the filament poles to these valleys. The correlation function was applied separately to each of these three regions (i.e., low curvature–high curvature–low curvature) for every filament.

To analyze the relationship between MinD intensity and filament curvature, MinD intensity profiles were processed to determine the MinD envelope (Supplementary Fig. 4C). This approach avoided the influence of MinD pulse valleys. The maxima of MinD pulses were identified using the ‘FindPeaks' function in Mathematica, followed by interpolation of these points and discretization to recover the original number of points. This process yielded a new MinD profile, representing the envelope of the original MinD signal. At each point along the filament's arc length, s, the MinD intensity was normalized as:

Curvature profiles were processed similarly, but without normalization. Curvature values were then grouped into the following bins:[0, 0.05), [0.05, 0.15), [0.15, 0.25), [0.25, 0.35), [0.35, 0.45), [0.45, 1), and [1, ∞). These bins, along with their corresponding MinDnorm. values, were fitted to the function:

where κ is the curvature. The last bin was excluded from the fit as MinDnorm. saturates and does not follow Eqn (1). From the fit, we obtained a = 0.69 ± 0.07 and b = 0.08 ± 0.04 with R2 = 0.9.

For agarose patterns, the last two bins were absent, as filaments did not reach those curvature values. Fitting the data to the same equation yielded apat. = 1.00 ± 0.98 and bpat. = 0.15 ± 0.13 with R2 = 0.99.

The bacterial strain was grown, and agarose pads were prepared as described in “Strain and growth conditions” and “Agarose pads and patterned growth substrates”, respectively. Images were acquired using a ZEISS LSM 980 super-resolution confocal microscope equipped with a PLAN-Apochromat 63x/1.4 DIC M27-Oil lens, an Airyscan detector, and ZEN software. All experiments were performed at 37 °C using the built-in incubation system.

Images were captured every 3 s for a total duration of 2.5 min. A 488 nm laser was used at 0.5% power (nominal output power 500 mW) with a 57 μm pinhole. A master gain of 738 V and 304 V and digital offsets of −24116 and 0 were applied for the fluorescent and bright-field channels, respectively. Photobleaching was initiated after the fifth frame (15 s) by increasing the 488 nm laser power to 50% for 10 ms. The photobleached area was manually drawn using the polygonal selection tool to ensure it encompassed an entire MinD pulse. Recovery of fluorescence was monitored for a duration of 2.5 min, as photobleaching from repeated imaging precluded longer observations.

Photobleaching was performed on regular-length cells and filaments under various conditions. For regular-length cells, two scenarios were considered (Supplementary Fig. 7): when MinD was fully concentrated at one bacterial pole, with no fluorescence at the opposite pole (Supplementary Fig. 7A), and when fluorescence was transitioning between the poles, with fluorescence visible at both poles (Supplementary Fig. 7B). For filaments showing three MinD pulses, photobleaching targeted the central pulse when MinD fluorescence was fully concentrated there, with no fluorescence at the poles (Supplementary Fig. 7C). For filaments showing more than three pulses, photobleaching was performed on a pulse located away from the poles (Supplementary Fig. 7D).

To assess MinD diffusion in filaments, photobleaching areas were drawn to cover approximately half of the filament. Filaments were categorized as either straight (maximum curvature  < 0.5 μm−1) or buckled (maximum curvature  > 0.5 μm−1). The coordinate origin was set at the edge of the photobleached area closest to the filament's midpoint. In straight filaments, the analyzed pulse was the second pulse from this origin, whereas in buckled filaments, it was the first pulse located after the buckling region. Typically, this pulse was the second photobleached pulse, but depending on the filament's geometry, it could also be the first or third pulse (Fig. 3 A & B, orange and blue dots).

The analysis of the selected pulse was conducted in Fiji by defining a circular region of interest (ROI) and plotting the Z-axis profile. Recovery time was defined as the first frame in which the fluorescence intensity of the photobleached pulse recovered to at least 30% of its pre-photobleaching intensity. The MinD oscillation period was measured by analyzing pulses in the non-photobleached regions of the filament and performing a Fourier transform to determine the oscillation period.

Recovery time (tr) was normalized by dividing it by the characteristic MinD oscillation period (T) for each filament, yielding a dimensionless recovery time. The distance (d) between the analyzed pulse and the first non-photobleached pulse (Fig. 3A, blue and orange dots) was measured using the segmented line tool in Fiji and normalized by the characteristic wavelength of each filament (λ). Recovery velocity was computed as the ratio of the dimensionless distance to the dimensionless recovery time, yielding a dimensionless velocity (vr/c). This methodology allowed for the comparison of MinD dynamics between straight and buckled filaments, highlighting how mechanical deformation influences protein diffusion and recovery behavior.

A microfluidic CellASIC ONIX2 BA04A03 system was used to study filament division after removal of the filamentation stressor. For each experiment, a single row of the device was utilized, pre-emptying wells 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. E. coli cells were grown as described in “Strain and growth conditions”, and 50 μl of culture was transferred to well 8 of the microfluidic device. Well 2 was filled with 200 μl of M9-supplemented media, while well 1 contained the same media supplemented with aztreonam at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μg/ml.

To operate the device, a custom sequence was used: 1. Media from well 2 was flowed at 5 psi for 5 min to pre-clean the device. 2. Cells were loaded by flowing E. coli (well 8) at 2 psi. 3. After loading, media from well 2 was flowed at 1 psi for 30 min to 1 h to stabilize the cells. 4. Media containing aztreonam (well 1) was then flowed at 1 psi for 3 to 5 h. 5. Finally, the flow was switched back to aztreonam-free media from well 2 for 3 h to observe filament division points under the microscopy system described in “Microscope settings”.

Division points were manually identified using the phase-contrast channel of microscopy time-lapses. Curvature at each division point was calculated for the frame immediately preceding division using the code described in ‘Image and data analysis'. The curvature value was averaged over the three nearest points along the filament to the division point. The probability density function (PDF) of curvatures at division points was obtained using MATLAB84 (‘histogram' function using the ‘pdf' normalization option). To compare this with the overall filament curvature, a second PDF was calculated for all curvatures of a filament. In this case, curvatures were smoothed using the MATLAB ‘smooth' function. For this analysis, only filaments with a maximum curvature  > 0.5 μm−1 and a minimum length of 8 μm were considered.

To characterize DNA distribution within the filaments, the same microfluidic setup and loading protocol were followed. After cell loading, just media was flowed at 1 psi for 30 min. Subsequently: 1. Media containing aztreonam was flowed at 1 psi for 3 h. 2. Aztreonam media supplemented with SYTOX Orange (Invitrogen) was flowed for 30 min to 1 h to stain DNA. 3. Same media without SYTOX was then flowed at 5 psi for 5 min to remove excess background fluorescence. 4. Time-lapses were acquired for 5 min (10 s interframe time) using phase-contrast and fluorescence channels with the microscopy set-up described in “Microscope settings”. Correlation between SYTOX intensity and filament curvature profiles was calculated using a customized MATLAB script, following the same protocol applied for MinD (see “Microscope settings”). The poles of filaments (1 μm from each end) were excluded from the analysis due to chromosome-free regions at the cell poles, consistent with previous findings62.

To characterize FtsZ distribution within the filaments, the same microfluidic setup and loading protocol were followed using E. coli MG1655 (Ptrc99A-mut2gfp::ftsZ). After cell loading: 1. Media was flowed at 1 psi for 30 min. 2. Aztreonam media was flowed for 3 h to promote filamentation. 3. Media without aztreonam was then flowed at 1 psi for 5 h. Time-lapses were acquired with 3 min interframe time using phase-contrast and fluorescence channels with the microscopy set-up described in “Microscope settings”. To characterize the temporal relationship between FtsZ and curvature, we calculated the cross-correlation between these two magnitudes for each point along the filament using the ‘xcorr' function in Matlab with the ‘coef' normalization. Prior to cross-correlation analysis, both the FtsZ and curvature signals were interpolated to have a common axis across the filament's body. Then, both signals were binarized. The FtsZ signal was binarized using the ‘findpeaks' function in Matlab. Peaks were identified by setting the ‘MinPeakHeight' parameter to the mean fluorescent signal intensity of the entire filament at a given time point and the ‘MinPeakProminence' parameter to 200. The values corresponding to these identified peaks were set to 1, while all other fluorescent values were set to 0. For the curvature signal, values greater than or equal to 0.5 were set to 1, and values below 0.5 were set to 0. Following binarization, the ‘xcorr' function with ‘coef' normalization was applied to determine the lag time between the appearance of an FtsZ ring (represented by a value of 1 in the binarized signal) and the occurrence of a curvature value ≥ 0.5 (also represented by a value of 1 in the binarized signal) for every spatial point along each filament. Since the delay difficults the direct correlation between Z-ring location and curvature value due to filament growth during that period, the position along the filament was normalized by its length at a given time (Fig. 5D).

The same filaments used to analyze the DNA distribution in the microfluidic device were also employed to determine the critical buckling length. Time-lapse movies were acquired at 5 min intervals with an interframe time of 10 s. These time-lapses were projected into a single image that represents the average intensity of the signal of all frames using the ‘z project function' in Fiji, using the average intensity option. Then, this projected image was thresholded to isolate the filaments, resulting in a binary mask. The MicrobeJ plugin was used to process this mask and obtain the medial axis, as described in “Image and data analysis”.

Using the medial axis data, custom-written Mathematica code was employed to calculate the maximum curvature of each filament profile. These curvature values were then compared to the corresponding filament lengths, which were also obtained using MicrobeJ. The critical buckling load was calculated using the Euler formula:

where k = 0.25 is the effective length factor for the filament85. The length of the filaments at which buckling started, \(\hat{L}\), was chosen to be 10 μm (see Supplementary Fig. 1). EI represents the flexural rigidity of the filament, where E is the Young's modulus and I is the second moment of inertia. The Young's modulus, E, depends on the bacterial strain used. For the Dh5α strain used in our experiments, E is reported to range between 2 and 3 MPa44. For a thin hollow cylinder with radius r and wall thickness b, the second moment of inertia, I, can be expressed as I = πr3b86. Previous studies have reported a wall thickness of b = 4 nm for E. coli19,87. Using a radius of r = 0.5 μm88, we calculate a flexural rigidity of EI = 4.7 ⋅ 10−21 N ⋅ m2. Substituting these values into Eqn. (2), we obtain a critical loading force of F = 7.4 nN.

E. coli filaments were modeled as a 2D chain of initial length L0 = 50 μm, defined by N = 161 nodes. Each node, i, was represented by Cartesian coordinates ri = (xi, yi) using a custom code written in R89. The characteristic distance between consecutive nodes was \({l}_{c}=\frac{{L}_{0}}{N-1}=0.31\) μm. This resolution was chosen to ensure approximately six nodes per 0.3 μm radius, corresponding to a maximum curvature of 3 μm−1. The chain length L was selected to match the filament lengths observed in the experimental data. The initial coordinates for the chain were set as \({{{\bf{r}}}}_{i}=\left(i-1,i-1\right)\), with i ranging from 0 to N − 1. A random perturbation was applied to the yi coordinates, such that \({{{\bf{r}}}}_{i}=\left(i-1,i-1+{{\mathcal{N}}}\left(0,0.5\right)\right)\), where \({{\mathcal{N}}}\left(0,0.5\right)\) denotes a normal distribution with 0 mean and 0.5 variance.

Two active forces were incorporated into the model: elastic and bending. For the elastic term, nodes were connected by linear springs with an elastic constant K and an equilibrium length \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)\) that depends on time to simulate filament growth. The elastic energy for a node i, \({E}_{{{{\rm{elastic}}}}_{i}}\), is given by:

where Ri−1 = ri−1 − ri and Ri+1 = ri+1 − ri.

The bending energy, which promotes filament flattening, depends on the angle formed by three consecutive nodes. Normalized vectors \({\hat{{{\bf{R}}}}}_{j}={{{\bf{R}}}}_{j}/| {{{\bf{R}}}}_{j}|\) were used to ensure that the bending energy remains independent of the distances between nodes:

Thus, the bending energy reaches a minimum when the angle formed by three consecutive nodes is 180° and its maximum when the angle is 0°. To perform the simulations we implemented a dimensionless form of the energy, \(\tilde{{E}_{i}}={E}_{i}/{E}_{c}\), defined as a function of the characteristic energy \({E}_{c}=K{l}_{c}^{2}\):

where \(\tilde{\Omega }=\frac{\Omega }{K{l}_{c}^{2}}\).

The equation for the dynamics of a node reads \(m{\ddot{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{i}=-\nabla {E}_{i}-\gamma {\dot{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{i}\), m being the “mass” of a node and γ a friction coefficient (energy dissipation). Disregarding the inertia term (low Reynolds number) we finally obtain that \({\dot{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{i}=-\frac{1}{\gamma }\nabla {E}_{i}\) or, as a function of dimensionless units: \({\dot{\tilde{{{\bf{r}}}}}}_{i}=-\tilde{\nabla }\tilde{{E}_{i}}\); where a characteristic time tc = γ/K, linked to the dissipation of the elastic energy, was defined. Filament growth was implemented by increasing the preferred length between nodes, \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)\), as a function of time exponentially: \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)={l}_{0}\cdot {2}^{t/\tau }\), τ being the doubling time. In our simulations, the parameters shown in Table 1 were used.

The curvature at node i was defined as the inverse of the radius of the circle passing through nodes i −1, i, and i + 1, resulting in N − 2 curvature points. Statistics were generated by conducting 100 simulations with random seeds to initialize the perturbation of the y-coordinates. Simulation results were registered every 10 s to align with the experimental time-lapse interval. In simulations, to properly compare with the experiments, we implemented a pair-wise moving average that connects the middle points of adjacent springs connecting a node. That is, given a set of M coordinates of a filament, \({{\mathcal{C}}}=\left({{{\bf{r}}}}_{1},{{{\bf{r}}}}_{2},{{{\bf{r}}}}_{3},\ldots ,,{{{\bf{r}}}}_{M-1},{{{\bf{r}}}}_{M}\right)\) we generate the set of M coordinates \(\hat{{{\mathcal{C}}}}=\left(\frac{{{{\bf{r}}}}_{1}+{{{\bf{r}}}}_{2}}{2},\frac{{{{\bf{r}}}}_{2}+{{{\bf{r}}}}_{3}}{2}, \ldots ,\frac{{{{\bf{r}}}}_{M-1}+{{{\bf{r}}}}_{M}}{2}\right)\).

Let us consider a chain of N (even) nodes as described in the previous section. For simplicity, the nodes are constrained to move along the x-axis, and only elastic energy is considered. Initially, the nodes are symmetrically positioned with respect to x = 0, such that: \({x}_{1}\left(t=0\right)=-{l}_{0}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(N-1\right)}{2}\), \({x}_{2}\left(t=0\right)=-{l}_{0}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(N-3\right)}{2}\), \({x}_{3}\left(t=0\right)=-{l}_{0}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(N-5\right)}{2}\), …, \({x}_{N}\left(t=0\right)=-{l}_{0}\left(0\right)\frac{\left(1-N\right)}{2}\). Consequently, \({\left\vert {x}_{i+1}-{x}_{i}\right\vert }_{t=0}={l}_{0}\left(0\right),\) indicating that the system is initially in mechanical equilibrium. The dynamics of the nodes is then described by \(\frac{d{{\bf{x}}}}{dt}=\frac{K}{\gamma }\left[{\mathbb{A}}\cdot {{\bf{x}}}+{\mathbb{B}}\right]\) with \({{\bf{x}}}={\left({x}_{1},{x}_{2}, \ldots ,{x}_{N-1},{x}_{N}\right)}^{T}\) and \({\mathbb{A}}\) and \({\mathbb{B}}\) read,

Due to the symmetry of the problem, the dimensionality of the system can be reduced to N/2, as \({x}_{1}\left(t\right)=-{x}_{N}\left(t\right)\), \({x}_{2}\left(t\right)=-{x}_{N-1}\left(t\right)\), and so on. This linear system can be solved, and it can be shown that \({\left\vert {x}_{i+1}-{x}_{i}\right\vert }_{t} > 0\,\forall \,t\). As expected, the exponential growth of the equilibrium length, \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)={l}_{0}{2}^{\frac{t}{\tau }}\), leads to increasing separation of the nodes over time.

Furthermore, elastic energy accumulates in the central springs compared to the springs at the ends of the chain. For instance, in the simplest case of N = 4 (one central spring surrounded by two springs at the ends), the ratio of the lengths between the end spring and the central spring over short times is given by:

This implies that, regardless of the spring constant K, the dissipation coefficient γ, or the doubling time τ, elastic energy preferentially accumulates in the central spring due to growth.

A signaling model based on that of Walsh et al.61 was used for the simulations presented in Figs. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 8. The model captures the most fundamental processes about the biochemistry of MinD and MinE species (including olygomerization of species and the MinE-mediated hydrolysis of MinD-ATP) and their transport properties. The model considers that proteins can be in different cellular interacting compartments (cytoplasm bulk, cytoplasm vicinity of the membrane, and the membrane) of exponentially growing filaments. The equations describing the model read:

In these equations Dz and \({E}_{{2}_{z}}\) represent MinD and MinE species either in the bulk of the cytoplasm (z = b) or in the vicinity of the cell membrane (z = m), whereas d, d2, e2, and d2e2 represent species in the membrane (see61 for details). This model differs from that of Walsh and coworkers by explicitly defining different regions in the cell cytoplasm. The model equations are integrated in a one-dimensional exponentially growing spatial domain (doubling time td) using a custom-made Mathematica83 code. The parameter values used in our simulations are (see61):

The parameter ωbm is defined by the diffusivity properties of species in the cytoplasm and determines the rate to travel among different cytoplasmic regions as follows (see Table 2). The characteristic time related to a diffusive transport process is given by \(\tau={l}_{c}^{2}/{{\mathcal{D}}}\), where lc is a characteristic length scale and \({{\mathcal{D}}}\) is the diffusion constant. In our case, \({l}_{c} \sim (1{0}^{-1})\mu m\) (i.e., E. coli cell radius) and \({{\mathcal{D}}} \sim {{\mathcal{O}}}(1{0}^{1})\mu {m}^{2}\cdot {s}^{-1}\) (i.e., the cytoplasmic diffusivities of MinD and MinE). Thus, \(\tau \sim {{\mathcal{O}}}(1{0}^{-3})s\) and, consequently, we estimated the rate as ωbm ~1/τ ~103 s−1.

To simulate a specific degree of curvature in our in silico filaments within an experimentally observed arc-length of s = 3 μm, we used the fact that s = θ ⋅ R = θ/∣κ∣, where θ and R are the angle and the radius of curvature, respectively. By imposing that ∣κ∣ = 1 μm−1, it follows that the simulated bending angle is θ ≃ 172° (see inset of Fig. 4B). To determine how the membrane diffusivity of species changes due to this simulated bending, we used a logarithmic dependency. This relationship dates back to the foundational work by Saffman and Delbrück and has been experimentally and numerically validated by posterior studies that also linked curvature with protein accumulation in agreement with our data54. The theory states that in the low Reynolds number regime, the membrane diffusivity \({{{\mathcal{D}}}}_{m}\propto \log \left(R/a\right)\), where a is the characteristic protein size (\(a \sim {{\mathcal{O}}}(1{0}^{-3})\mu m\) in the case of Min proteins90,91). Consequently, the diffusivity if ∣κ∣ = 1 μm−1 compared to the diffusivity at ∣κ∣ = 10−1 μm−1 (a value experimentally determined to be residual and indistinguishable from zero) reads \({{{\mathcal{D}}}}_{m}{| }_{| \kappa |=1}\simeq 0.7\times {{{\mathcal{D}}}}_{m}{| }_{| \kappa |=0.1}\) (i.e., ~30% decrease).

As for how the MinD membrane binding rate, ωbd, changes as the curvature increases (∣κ∣ = 10−1 μm−1 ⟶ ∣κ∣ = 1 μm−1) we use values obtained from septins (membrane-binding nanoscopic proteins), see Fig. 2B of59. Following that study, in our case we implemented a two-fold change (i.e., 100% increase): ωbd∣∣κ∣=1 ≃ 2 × ωbd∣∣κ∣=0.1 (Supplementary Fig. 8A). We then tested different values of ωbd down to 10%, the minimum increase which did not disrupt MinD patterning (Supplementary Fig. 8B).

In our simulations we integrated the equations for 10 min in a non-growing filament until a steady standing-wave formed. From this point, we integrated the equations for td = 50 min in a growing filament. Membrane diffusion drops or MinD binding increases due to curvature (i.e., filament bending) were implemented after 20 min of growth. In the in silico kymographs shown in this study, MinD accounts for the total concentration of MinD regardless of its cellular localization (i.e., both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound) or the olygomerization state (i.e., monomeric, multimeric, or MinE bound)54,55,92,93.

Statistical analyses were performed using Mathematica and no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Filaments in contact with each other were discarded for the analysis of Fig. 1E (left) to analyze only those whose curvature appears naturally. For Figs. 2 and 5, only filaments that grow and present a standing wave MinD pattern were selected. For Fig. 3, those filaments whose MinD pattern was altered (or disrupted) after photobleaching were discarded.

Representative images of filaments (Fig. 1A, Fig. 2A, Fig. 2D insert, Fig. 3B, Fig. 5A, B, and Fig. 5F) are examples of the sample size indicated in their corresponding analyzed plots.

Low-curvature and high-curvature correlation data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test in Fig. 2 (p  = 0.002) and Fig. 5 (p  = 0.001) with statistically significant results. Straight and buckled filaments in Fig. 3 (p  = 0.5) were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test with no statistically significant results. p  < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Marsquakes, Vaccine Politics and Mammoth Microbiomes

A common nasal spray shows promise in reducing COVID risk, but vaccine access remains tangled in policy in the U.S.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some of the latest news.

First, let's talk about Mars and its surprisingly lumpy interior. Late last month NASA shared what its now-defunct InSight lander found out about the Red Planet's insides. In a study published in Science researchers reported on data from the seismometer that InSight placed on Mars's surface in 2018. By 2022, when the mission ended, the seismometer had recorded more than 1,300 “marsquakes.” Because a quake's seismic waves behave differently based on what kinds of material they're passing through, the shake-ups allowed scientists to study the planet's core, mantle and crust. According to the new study the Martian mantle is full of large lumps, some as big as 2.5 miles across. The researchers think they're seeing the rocky remains of ancient collisions between Mars and errant space objects. They say some of those impacts generated enough energy to melt huge spans of the planet's surface and mantle into oceans of magma, providing an opportunity for chunks of rock to push deep inside the Martian planet.

Now for some health news. According to a study published last Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine a common nasal spray could provide some protection against COVID. In a study of 450 adults who used either a nasal spray containing the antihistamine azelastine or a placebo three times a day for 56 days, the over-the-counter medication was associated with a 67 percent lower risk of catching COVID. The five folks who caught COVID while using the allergy spray tested positive for less time on average. In general, azelastine users had fewer confirmed respiratory infections during the course of the study.

Now, this study was fairly small, and it's also important to note that the research was funded by a German pharmaceutical company that made the azelastine spray used in the study. So for now the best way to prevent a COVID infection is still vaccination, including getting an annual booster to maintain your protection. Unfortunately, there's currently a lot of mixed messaging about who's eligible to receive a fresh COVID shot in the U.S. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his FDA commissioner have stated that anyone who wants a shot will be able to get one, many Americans might now only be able to access COVID boosters as an off-label medication, which would likely mean insurance wouldn't cover the vaccination. And potential confusion over who's paying for the jab and how would surely make it harder to just stroll into a pharmacy for one.

Speaking of vaccines: Here is Florida State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo speaking at a news conference last Wednesday.

[CLIP:Joseph Ladapo speaking at a news conference: “The Florida Department of Health, in partnership with the governor, is going to be working to end all vaccine mandates in Florida law.”

The audience cheers.]

Feltman: That means children in Florida would be able to attend public school without receiving any immunizations.

While all states currently allow exemptions from school vaccine mandates for medical reasons and most offer religious or personal exemptions, if not both, Florida would be the first state to do away with mandates entirely.

Meanwhile, the governors of Oregon, Washington and California have announced a joint partnership between the three states called the Western Health Alliance. In a press release published last Wednesday, the trio cited concerns that the CDC now “peddles ideology instead of science” and pledged to work together to develop immunization guidelines based on the advice of medical experts.

We'll be talking more about fall vaccinations and how to get them in a future episode, so let us know if you have any questions. You can email us about COVID vaccines (or anything else) at ScienceQuickly@sciam.com. And if you are looking for more information on recent shakeups in public health leadership in the U.S., check out last Friday's episode.

In other perhaps more personal health news your phone habits could turn into a literal pain in the butt. A study published last Wednesday found that people who used smartphones while on the toilet had a 46 percent higher risk of hemorrhoids. That's after the study authors controlled for other possible risk factors such as age and fiber intake. And you didn't have to dig too deep into the study to figure out a plausible explanation: 37 percent of the bathroom phone users studied spent more than five minutes on the toilet at a time, on average, while just 7.1 percent of the no-phone group reported the same length of stay. According to the Mayo Clinic, sitting for prolonged periods of time, and especially doing so on the toilet, is associated with developing hemorrhoids.

The new study only surveyed 125 adults, but this isn't the first research that's come out linking scrolling with anal and rectal ailments. A study published in the Turkish Journal of Colorectal Disease back in 2021 looked at 882 people admitted to an outpatient clinic with hemorrhoids and compared them with a control group of 802, asking both to report on their bathroom and cell phone habits. The researchers found that every additional minute spent scrolling on the toilet made a study subject more likely to fall into the hemorrhoid category. Other studies have found that cell phones are often bacterial hotbeds, at least in part because of our tendency to surf the Web while pooping. So if you're looking to do something simple to improve your health, consider going screen-free the next time you've gotta, you know, go.

Speaking of bacteria: a study published last week in Cell sheds new light on mammoth microbiomes. Researchers analyzed microbial DNA found on the bones and teeth of 483 specimens. The studied mammoth remains come from various parts of the world and range in age from more than one million years ago to just a few thousand. Once the researchers filtered out microbial species that would plausibly move in on the tooth and bone samples after an animal's death, they identified six microbial groups that likely paired up with mammoths in life. The researchers say some bacterial lineages seem to have co-existed with the animals for hundreds of thousands of years. One genus they found is closely related to a pathogen that recently plagued African elephants. Another strain was reportedly determined to be a distant relative of a microbe that causes tooth decay in humans today.

We'll wrap things up with one more animal story. Have you ever noticed that squirrels have thumbnails? Me neither, but apparently, it's important.

A study published last Thursday in Science investigates how having thumbnails—as opposed to claws or hands with no thumbs at all—gives some rodents an evolutionary advantage when it comes to acquiring food that could help explain how these mammals spread all over the world in so many different varieties. Thumbs that feature short nails instead of claws simplify the process of handling and eating nuts. Most primates and some rodents are the only mammals to have gone the thumbnail route, and the two lineages seem to have developed this trait independently. By studying 433 rodent genus groups using specimens from Chicago's Field Museum, the researchers found that modern rodents can likely trace their short, nut-friendly thumbnails to a single common ancestor.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday to talk about the infamous red meat allergy that's spreading via tick bite.

Achieving mono-selectivity in C–H activation reactions is a considerable challenge when multiple identical C–H bonds coexist. Despite recent rapid advances in site-selective and enantioselective C–H activation, a large number of C–H activation reactions still suffer from poor mono-selectivity. Here we report the use of commercial enzymes as ligands for palladium catalysts, enabling enhanced reactivity and exceptionally high mono-selectivity (up to 99%) in both ortho- and meta-C–H activation of arenes, which originally used bifunctional mono-N-protected amino acid ligands but with poor mono-selectivity. Notably, the Pd–enzyme complex was identified as the active catalyst species. Mechanistic investigations and structural analyses of the enzymes suggest that the enzyme primary structure, the sequence length and the percentage of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains are critical for achieving mono-selectivity. By leveraging these findings, we further developed a glycine-containing oligopeptide capable of achieving similarly high mono-selectivity.

Cognition AI, the startup behind AI coding agent Devin, has hit a $10.2 billion valuation after raising $400 million, marking a jump from the company's $4 billion valuation earlier this year, reports Bloomberg. 

Founders Fund, the Peter Thiel-backed VC, led Cognition's latest round, with participation from existing investors like Lux Capital, Joe Lonsdale's 8VC, Elad Gil, Definition Capital and Swish Ventures.

In July, Cognition acquired AI coding startup Windsurf, just days after Google poached the startup's CEO, co-founder, and research leads.

The raise comes after serious growth for Cognition's core product. The startup's annual recurring revenue from Devin has climbed to $73 million in June, up from $1 million in September 2024. Net burn has remained under $20 million since its founding two years ago, per Bloomberg. 

At the same time, the company has built a reputation for placing strict demands on its workers. Last month, Cognition laid off 30 staffers and offered buyouts to the remaining 200 employees, offering them a way out of the expectation to work 80-hour, six-day weeks.

Microsoft is laying off another 42 workers at its Redmond headquarters, according to a filing Monday, continuing a series of workforce reductions that have collectively impacted thousands of employees in recent months.

The ongoing trickle of smaller layoffs marks a departure from the traditional corporate mantra of “cut once, cut deep” — leaving some employees feeling nervous about whether their job will be next.

We've contacted Microsoft for information about the types of jobs impacted by the latest cuts, among other details, and we'll update this post depending on the company's response. 

The notice brings the total number of Microsoft jobs cut in Washington state to more than 3,200 since May. It follows much larger rounds of 1,985 and 830 that took place in the state May and July, respectively. Globally, the company has laid off more than 15,000 people in the same period.

The cuts come as Microsoft spends record amounts on AI. CEO Satya Nadella addressed this conflict in a July 24 memo, calling the layoffs “among the most difficult we have to make” while acknowledging the “uncertainty and seeming incongruence” of the situation.

Despite the layoffs, the company is not shrinking. Microsoft's global headcount held steady at 228,000 in its 2025 fiscal year, ending in June, according to its 10-K filing. The company continues to hire in key areas like AI while making targeted cuts elsewhere.

Across the tech sector, companies including Amazon, Google, and Meta have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs, citing pandemic-era over-hiring and a renewed focus on efficiency and strategic priorities like AI.

Salesloft said a breach of its GitHub account in March allowed hackers to steal authentication tokens that were later used in a mass-hack targeting several of its big tech customers. 

Citing an investigation by Google's incident response unit Mandiant, Salesloft said on its data breach page that the as-yet-unnamed hackers accessed Salesloft's GitHub account and performed reconnaissance activities from March until June, which allowed them to download “content from multiple repositories, add a guest user and establish workflows.” 

The timeline raises fresh questions about the company's security posture, including why it took Salesloft some six months to detect the intrusion.

Salesloft said that the incident is now “contained.”

After the hackers broke into its GitHub account, the company said the hackers accessed the Amazon Web Services cloud environment of Salesloft's AI and chatbot-powered marketing platform Drift, which allowed them to steal OAuth tokens for Drift's customers. OAuth is a standard that allows users to authorize one app or service to connect to another. By relying on OAuth, Drift can integrate with platforms like Salesforce and others to interact with website visitors. 

In stealing these tokens, the threat actors breached several Salesloft's customers, such as Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Palo Alto Networks, and Tenable, among others, many of which are likely still unknown. 

Google's Threat Intelligence Group revealed the supply chain breach late in August, attributing it to a hacking group it calls UNC6395. 

Cybersecurity publications DataBreaches.net and Bleeping Computer previously reported that the hackers behind the breach are the prolific hacking group known as ShinyHunters. The hackers are believed to be trying to extort victims by contacting them privately.

By accessing Salesloft tokens, the hackers then access Salesforce instances, where they stole sensitive data contained in support tickets. “The actor's primary objective was to steal credentials, specifically focusing on sensitive information like AWS access keys, passwords, and Snowflake-related access tokens,” Salesloft said on August 26.

Salesloft said on Sunday that its integration with Salesforce is now restored.

Two current and two former Meta employees disclosed documents to Congress alleging that the company may have suppressed research on children's safety, according to a report from The Washington Post.

According to their claims, Meta changed its policies around researching sensitive topics — like politics, children, gender, race, and harassment — six weeks after whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that showed how Meta's own research found that Instagram can damage teen girls' mental health. These revelations, which were made public in 2021, kicked off years of hearings in Congress over child safety on the internet, an issue that remains a hot topic in global governments today.

As part of these policy changes, the report says, Meta proposed two ways that researchers could limit the risk of conducting sensitive research. One suggestion was to loop lawyers into their research, protecting their communications from “adverse parties” due to attorney-client privilege. Researchers could also write about their findings more vaguely, avoiding terms like “not compliant” or “illegal.”

Jason Sattizahn, a former Meta researcher specializing in virtual reality, told The Washington Post that his boss made him delete recordings of an interview in which a teen claimed that his ten-year-old brother had been sexually propositioned on Meta's VR platform, Horizon Worlds.

“Global privacy regulations make clear that if information from minors under 13 years of age is collected without verifiable parental or guardian consent, it has to be deleted,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.

But the whistleblowers claim that the documents they submitted to Congress show a pattern of employees being discouraged from discussing and researching their concerns around how children under 13 were using Meta's social virtual reality apps.

“These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative; in reality, since the start of 2022, Meta has approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well-being,” Meta told TechCrunch.

In a lawsuit filed in February, Kelly Stonelake — a former Meta employee of fifteen years — raised similar concerns to these four whistleblowers. She told TechCrunch earlier this year that she led “go-to-market” strategies to bring Horizon Worlds to teenagers, international markets, and mobile users, but she felt that the app did not have adequate ways to keep out users under 13; she also flagged that the app had persistent issues with racism.

“The leadership team was aware that in one test, it took an average of 34 seconds of entering the platform before users with Black avatars were called racial slurs, including the ‘N-word' and ‘monkey,'” the suit alleges.

Stonelake has separately sued Meta for alleged sexual harassment and gender discrimination.

While these whistleblowers' allegations center on Meta's VR products, the company is also facing criticism for how other products, like AI chatbots, affect minors. Reuters reported last month that Meta's AI rules previously allowed chatbots to have “romantic or sensual” conversations with children.

— Deborah (Deb) Gracio is taking over next month as director of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). 

Gracio has been with the U.S. Department of Energy lab for 35 years, currently in the role of associate laboratory director for national security. Her research includes the study of computational capabilities and developing methodologies, algorithms and technologies to address scientific challenges with big data.

PNNL, which is based in Richland, Wash., and has additional offices across the region, conducts research in clean energy, the power grid, environmental cleanup and other cutting-edge fields. Gracio succeeds Steven Ashby, who led PNNL for a decade and was with DOE for more than four decades.

— Four months after joining Redmond, Wash.-based automotive tech company MicroVision, Glen De Vos has been promoted from chief technologist to president and CEO. The move takes effect Sept. 30. De Vos succeeds Sumit Sharma, who has been with MicroVision for more than a decade and led the company for five of those years.

Prior to joining MicroVision, which has operations in Redmond, Detroit and Hamburg, Germany, De Vos was at automotive components company Delphi for 25 years. That business later became Aptiv, and DeVos held leadership roles at both companies.

MicroVision builds automotive lidar sensors for automotive safety systems, autonomous vehicles and non-automotive applications. The board of directors has not named a new CTO. 

— Rajeev Singh has joined the board of directors for Basalt Health, a Nashville-based startup developing technology that provides healthcare providers with easier access to patient data. 

“This is exactly the kind of problem AI was meant to solve. It's not about replacing the human touch in healthcare — it's about amplifying it, creating the infrastructure that will scale quality care across our entire healthcare system,” Singh said on LinkedIn. 

Singh is a longtime Seattle-area leader who was CEO of Accolade for nine years and president of Concur Technologies for two decades. He worked with Ben Hackett, Basalt Health's founder, while both were at Accolade. Singh disclosed that he is an investor in the startup. 

— Zones, an Auburn-based IT company, named Yehia Maaty Omar as its new CEO. Omar has served on the company's board for three years. He was with Xerox for more than 25 years and has held leadership roles with Megalos Consulting and the IT company Curvature.

Firoz Lalji stepped down as Zones' leader after 27 years with the company, and most of those as CEO. Lalji will remain with Zones as chair of its board of directors and will continue to be involved with its “long-term vision and strategic direction,” according to a release. 

— Seattle techies Dunni Abiodun and Eric Neuman have launched Dotted, a startup building a platform to boost the efficiency of product managers.

Neuman was most recently a principal product manager at law enforcement tech company Axon, and has worked as a PM for Amazon and Microsoft. Abiodun took the entrepreneurial leap after nearly a decade at Microsoft as a software engineer.

“PMs are the force multipliers for every product team,” Neuman said on LinkedIn. “When their time is wasted, the whole team slows down. When you give them time back, you unlock speed, creativity, and results for everyone. That's not just good for companies — that's good for progress, period.”

— Roger Nyhus, a longtime communications leaders in the Pacific Northwest, is founder and CEO of newly launched international consultancy AMBO Strategy.

Seattle-based AMBO aims to serve CEOs and leaders in delivering “candid counsel, discreet support and independent perspective to help leaders cut through chaos, sharpen strategy and simplify high-stakes decision-making,” according to LinkedIn.

Prior to AMBO, Nyhus was U.S. ambassador to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean for a year during the Biden administration. He was founder and CEO of Nyhus Communications for nearly three decades.

— Sana Biotechnology, a Seattle-based cell and gene therapy company, shared via an SEC filing that Aaron Grossman is joining the company as executive vice president and chief legal officer on Oct. 20. 

Bernard Cassidy is retiring from his role as executive VP and general counsel after three years. Cassidy provided legal counsel for Juno Therapeutics earlier in his career.

— Margaret Dawson is now chief marketing officer of the German software company SUSE. Dawson has held PR leadership roles at Seattle-area companies including Microsoft, Amazon, Apptio and others. She was most recently CMO of Chronosphere.

— Law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner named Erin Ehlert as the office managing partner of its Seattle office. Ehlert was a prosecutor in King County, Wash., for more than 20 years. Her subsequent private practice focused on medical malpractice, product liability and tort law.

Glowforge is closing its Seattle manufacturing facility and laying off workers, less than a year after moving production of some of its laser engraver machines to the city.

Dan Shapiro, co-founder and CEO of the 10-year-old startup, told GeekWire that production at the site on Occidental Avenue South in the SoDo neighborhood will wrap up in the next two months. The space also served as headquarters for Glowforge, and Shapiro said the company will find a new office location in Seattle.

When GeekWire visited the facility in April, Glowforge employed 15 workers to assemble its highest-end machines — the $7,000 Glowforge Pro HD and the $5,000 Plus HD. Shapiro declined to say how many workers were impacted by Monday's decision or how many Glowforge still employed.

In April, Shapiro said that Glowforge employed just over 90 full-time and contract employees. But the company was hit by a round of layoffs in August that impacted its sales and marketing teams as well as senior executives at the company.

Shapiro previously said the goal in moving some production back to the U.S. was to get in front of ongoing uncertainties around President Donald Trump's tariff policies and better control how the startup innovates around manufacturing, including through the use of AI. 

On Monday he said that Glowforge “achieved quality rates that were more than 50% better than what we had at our old factory in Mexico.” Technicians hired in Seattle previously built airplanes, satellites, medical equipment and other products.

Shapiro cited an expiring lease as one reason for the production closure. The Seattle City Council voted in March to approve new housing in the industrial neighborhood south of the city's baseball and football stadiums. Shapiro said the redevelopment would not allow Glowforge to make a permanent home for its factory.

Economic headwinds also impacted the decision.

“The expected federal incentives and support for manufacturing here didn't materialize,” Shapiro said. “Instead, we saw massive tariffs on components that we needed to build our products here.”

Glowforge was keen to experiment with how artificial intelligence could be implemented into its production process in Seattle. The company said in April that in order to innovate with speed and ease, it had to be a process owned by the company rather than one being facilitated elsewhere. The SoDo facility was outfitted with cameras and microphones to harness generative AI to improve efficiency and safety.

While the company's lower-priced Aura and Spark machines are still made in Mexico, Shapiro declined to say where production of the machines being made in Seattle will move.

Laid off workers will get severance, continued health coverage, and outplacement support, according to Shapiro.

Glowforge, which has raised $183 million to date and is No. 125 on the GeekWire 200 startup index, also went through a rough patch in 2023 and 2024, laying off employees after a funding round fell through.

Shapiro founded the company in 2015 with fellow startup veterans Mark Gosselin, the current CTO, and Tony Wright, who left the company in 2017. Shapiro previously sold the startup Sparkbuy to Google, and he created Robot Turtles, a coding board game for kids that was one of the most successful campaigns ever on Kickstarter.

My fear is that we are continuing to accelerate the younger generation toward that by doubling, tripling down on a system that isn't working for people and punting on fixing it. We are continuing to deregulate, allow companies to union bust and remove any balance of power between businesses and workers.In the minds of many, it seems like we need a revolution and not a reformation. And to the people charged with decision making, we need nothing at all. I would prefer we fix the system we have, but I'm increasingly worried that is becoming infeasible.

If reformation fails then we are headed towards a dark place anyway.

Its ironic that they promote the titled narrative when we have neither a free market, nor effective price discovery (due to dark pools and other actors). The lack of those things in fact point to the dominant economic model being closer to Socialism than Capitalism.I never understood how people can think that the answer to the failures of socialism is more socialism.

reply

I don't think socialism is failing that much, not much more than capitalism in the US.

reply

In the name of "capitalism", our government has allowed big business to grow ever larger, become ever more inescapable, and often even delegates/cedes governmental power to big business. So really if anyone is reading this, getting angry at the rise of "socialism", and wanting to save capitalism - it's really incumbent upon you to be loudly criticizing both the foundational and emergent problems of capitalism as currently conceived. Because otherwise this frustration is just going to continue building, and we are going to lose what we do have, for good.

If you ask me what the common factor across MAGAs, flat earther, crypto bros or esotheric nut cases is, my answer would be that.

U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may be setting his sights on acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, as a root trigger of autism spectrum disorder. HHS is purportedly planning to list acetaminophen use during pregnancy as a risk factor for autism in its much-awaited report later this month.

The Wall Street Journal first broke the news of HHS planning to link acetaminophen to autism over the weekend, citing “people familiar with the matter.” The report will reportedly also lay blame on low levels of folate (vitamin B9) as a potential cause of the developmental disorder. While some studies have suggested a possible connection between acetaminophen and autism, others haven't, and many experts have argued there's not enough evidence at this time to definitively promote such a link.

Though similar medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have their advantages, acetaminophen remains the most widely used over-the-counter painkiller and fever reducer in the world.

Like every drug, though, acetaminophen has its side effects. Chronic use or excessively high doses can potentially trigger acute liver or kidney damage, and acetaminophen is known to be the most common cause of acute liver failure from drug overdose in the U.S. Overall, however, acetaminophen is thought to be safer and more tolerable to take than aspirin or NSAIDs, making it an appealing pain and fever treatment for women during pregnancy.

That said, some studies over the years have pointed to possible complications from taking acetaminophen during pregnancy. Just last month, a review published by Mount Sinai researchers found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen could increase the risk of several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The researchers also noted that acetaminophen can cross the placental barrier, and they speculated that its presence may harm fetal brain development by causing oxidative stress or the disruption of certain key hormones.

RFK Jr. Says He Doesn't Know How Many Americans Died From Covid During Heated Senate Hearing

It's not at all clear yet that Tylenol can cause autism, however, and there's reason to believe that many positive studies have failed to account for the noise in the data.

Last year, for instance, researchers in Sweden and the U.S. conducted a sweeping analysis of all children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019. They initially found a slightly increased risk of autism in children whose mothers reported acetaminophen use during pregnancy in the raw data. However, when they only compared siblings to each other, they failed to find any increased autism risk linked to the drug.

Autism is likely caused by a mix of genetic and environmental influences. And since siblings share many of these influences, these sorts of studies are better able to analyze risk factors that differ between one pregnancy and the next (in this case, acetaminophen use). Since women who use acetaminophen could have an increased risk of health conditions or other factors that make their children more vulnerable to autism, acetaminophen may simply be a red herring, the researchers noted.

“Results of this study indicate that the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders is a noncausal association,” the study authors wrote in their paper, published April 2024 in JAMA. “Birthing parents with higher acetaminophen use differed in many aspects from those with lower use or no use.”

Though it's possible some external factors may be helping increase the prevalence of autism, many experts believe that reported cases have largely increased due to better detection and expanded criteria for diagnosing autism. And given the shaky evidence supporting a link between acetaminophen and autism, plenty of researchers are already voicing their skepticism of the HHS report's expected conclusions (in a statement to the WSJ, HHS declined to confirm the report's contents until publication).

RFK Jr. Promises to Reveal the ‘Cause' of Autism Next Month

The Coalition of Autism Scientists is a group that formed in the wake of RFK Jr.'s announcement earlier this April to examine the causes of autism. The coalition currently includes more than 200 researchers in the field from across the country. It's unsurprisingly not on board with Kennedy.

“It is highly irresponsible and potentially dangerous to claim links between potential exposures and autism when the science is far more nuanced and uncertain,” the coalition explained in a statement released Monday. “Secretary Kennedy's announcement will cause confusion and fear. He seems to be cherry-picking old data rather than looking at the body of research as a whole.”

The WSJ could not confirm whether vaccines—which RFK Jr. and antivaccination proponents have long blamed for causing autism—will also be included in the HHS report. As things stand already, though, it seems unlikely that the HHS report will offer any real clarity of the complex causes of autism, as RFK Jr. has promised.

We may never get another season of Hannibal, but there's some comfort to be found in Dust Bunny, Hannibal creator Bryan Fuller‘s feature directorial debut—which just so happens to star Dr. Lecter himself, Mads Mikkelsen. He plays a hired killer who befriends his young neighbor after she loses her family; she believes a monster did it, but he's got an equally scary, more real-world idea of the culprit.

Check out the first trailer for Dust Bunny here:

Written and directed by Fuller, Dust Bunny also stars Sigourney Weaver and David Dastmalchian. Here's the official synopsis:

“Ten-year-old Aurora has a mysterious neighbor (Mads Mikkelsen) who kills real-life monsters. He's a hit man for hire. So, when Aurora needs help killing the monster she believes ate her entire family, she procures his services. Suspecting that her parents may have fallen victim to assassins gunning for him, Aurora's neighbor guiltily takes the job. Now, to protect her, he'll need to battle an onslaught of assassins—and accept that some monsters are real.”

Dust Bunny casts Mikkelsen as a good guy who's done some very bad things; complicated villains are his specialty and this reunion with Fuller will hopefully capture some of that old Hannibal magic—with what look like some fantastical fight scenes to boot.

Dust Bunny hits theaters December 5.

Intel CFO Zinser made the comment at Citi's 2025 Global TMT Conference

Intel's 14A manufacturing technology (1.4nm-class) technology — the company's first fabrication process that was designed both for Intel and its foundry customers from the ground up — will be more expensive to use than the company's upcoming 18A production node according to Intel. The reason for that will be use of ASML's next-generation Twinscan EXE:5200B High-NA lithography machine with a 0.55 numerical aperture optics.

"14A is more expensive than 18A," said David Zinsner, chief financial officer of Intel, at the Citi's 2025 Global TMT Conference. "It is not significantly [more expensive] in terms of investment. [But] it is a higher wafer cost, for sure and partly that is because we, we are expecting to use High-NA EUV tools in 14A, which was not the case in 18A."

Intel expects its 14A fabrication process to offer 15% – 20% better performance-per-watt or 25% – 35% lower power consumption compared to 18A. The new manufacturing technology features RibbonFET 2, an upgraded gate-all-around transistor structure, and PowerDirect, a backside power delivery network that connects power wires directly to source and drain of transistors. A key innovation of 14A is Turbo Cells, which enhance CPU and GPU frequency by optimizing critical timing paths using high-drive, double-height cells within dense standard cell libraries, which boosts speed without major area or power compromises. However, to enable 18A production, Intel needs to use next-generation lithography systems that offer better resolution and therefore does not need to rely on multi-patterning.

ASML's Twinscan EXE High-NA EUV systems achieve a 8nm resolution in a single exposure, a notable leap from the 13.5nm resolution of current Low-NA EUV tools. Although Low-NA systems can also reach 8nm using double patterning, this approach increases process complexity and can impact yield. However, High-NA EUV reduces the exposure field by 50%, requiring chipmakers to adjust their design strategies. Moreover, the new systems are more expensive than existing litho machines.

ASML's current-generation Low-NA EUV Twinscan NXE:3800E tool costs around $235 million per unit, whereas its upcoming High-NA EUV Twinscan EXE:5200B (or more advanced) tools are expected to cost $380 million per unit. Due to the high cost and unique challenges posed by the technology, adoption of High-NA EUV vary: Intel is pushing for early deployment with 14A several years down the road from now, while TSMC is taking a more cautious approach.

Modern fabs designed to produce chips on leading-edge process technologies currently cost from $20 billion to $30 billion depending on capacity, so adding four High-NA tools at $1.52 billion will hardly increase fab cost significantly. Meanwhile, 14A R&D costs billions of dollars. As a result, once all the extra costs are added, they really make 14A process technology more expensive than 14A, which is why Intel Foundry needs external customers to justify extra costs.

"I think what [Intel chief executive officer Lip-Bu Tan is] saying is if we do not get 14A customers externally, it is going to be hard to justify that node," said Zinsner. "So yes, Intel Products will be a big customer on 14A, but it is, it is the totality of that demand, and we need to make sure it is to the level that we can generate a, a reasonable ROI for shareholders."

Earlier this year Intel announced that if it does not land a single significant customer for 14A, it would either slowdown its development, or will abandon it completely as developing and ramping up of a leading-edge process technology is a too expensive endeavor for a single company these days. However, Intel may no longer have a choice, but to finish development of 14A and then start production of chips on this technology as Intel Foundry is an indispensable part of Intel that cannot be spun off. Under the terms of the deal with the U.S. government, under which Intel converted its grants into equity, Intel should control at least 51% of Intel Foundry over the next five years as otherwise it will breach its contract with the U.S. government.

YouTube announced on Monday that its first-ever exclusive global broadcast of an NFL game broke a record for the company, achieving the most concurrent viewers of a livestream on the platform. Over 17.3 million viewers from more than 230 countries and territories worldwide tuned in for the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo.

This figure represents the average minute audience (AMA) that watched the game last Friday. In the U.S., there were 16.2 million AMA across YouTube and other platforms, according to Nielsen data, while YouTube's own numbers indicated 1.1 million AMA outside the U.S.

This exclusive broadcast is part of YouTube's expanded partnership with the NFL, which was announced in May during the company's annual Upfront event. The deal is aimed at attracting more ad revenue, and the company likely hopes that this new achievement will be well-received by advertisers.

However, in comparison to other NFL broadcasts on streaming platforms, the viewership numbers are slightly lower than those of Netflix. Netflix's 2024 Christmas doubleheader averaged over 24 million viewers.

While the numbers may seem underwhelming, YouTube believes its creator-driven viewing experience sets it apart from rivals. The broadcast showcased a lineup of popular YouTubers, including Deestroying, MrBeast, Haley Kalil, and Marques Brownlee, among others. Karol G also performed the halftime show.

As for how people felt about having these creators involved in the broadcast, reactions were mixed. While some fans enjoyed seeing their favorite YouTubers, others thought the sports commentary was a bit “cringe.”

Find Ventures is closing due to funding challenges, six years after the startup program launched to support early stage tech companies and underrepresented entrepreneurs in Washington state.

The organization was not able to secure enough capital to support a second batch of founders, said Elizabeth Scallon, a Seattle tech ecosystem leader who co-founded Find Ventures in 2019.

“Over the past years, I've sought additional funders and partners to sustain this mission,” Scallon wrote on LinkedIn. “But with the shifting macro environment, from lawsuits against equity-focused funds to rollbacks on DEI, donors grew hesitant.”

“Rather than compete with other nonprofits for scarce resources, we made the difficult decision to close Find Ventures,” Scallon added. “We notified our founders, donors, mentors and advisors back in May, and it has taken till now to finish the paperwork and final tasks.”

The organization's remaining funds will go to the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Washington.

Find Ventures previously raised $700,000 from more than 30 donors to support ten startups in 2022 as part of its inaugural Equitable Innovation Accelerator, run in partnership with the Washington state Department of Commerce. 

Companies received non-dilutive funding and were not required to give up equity or ownership. Founders were encouraged to support Find Ventures when they reached sustainable revenue or a Series B funding round. 

The cohort included several Seattle-area startups that went on to raise future rounds, such as legal tech company Clearbrief and observability startup WhyLabs.

Scallon co-founded Find Ventures with Justin Brotman, son of Costco co-founder Jeffrey Brotman. The Brotman Family Foundation helped support Find Ventures. 

Find Ventures also partnered with the Port of Seattle on its business accelerator supporting small businesses. 

Scallon, who is currently director of incubation at HP and an adjunct teacher at the UW's business school, said supporting underrepresented entrepreneurs — including women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ founders — is more important than ever as innovation accelerates at a rapid pace.

“In times like these, entrepreneurship must be accessible to all,” Scallon told GeekWire via email. “We need broad participation so that innovation is distributed widely, not concentrated in the hands of only a few.”

She added: “Expanding access to entrepreneurship isn't just about opportunity, it's about ensuring the future is shaped by diverse voices and ideas that truly represent humanity, leading to stronger and more meaningful solutions for us all.”

Scallon also shared some lessons learned from the Find Ventures journey:

Happy Star Trek Day! While September 8 is a fun holiday for Trek fans any year, 2026 is going to be a big one, marking 60 years since the very first episode of the very first series hit the airwaves in 1966, changing sci-fi's place in pop culture forever. Paramount is getting the party started early with a bunch of announcements today, including Trek‘s first-ever Lego collaboration as well as a YouTube series aimed at kids that drops today.

While we're most excited about the Lego news, the collab doesn't come with any details as of yet. A Paramount press release promises we'll learn more “soon” (the possibilities for sets are virtually endless; just look at how much Star Wars Lego is out there) with a teaser video to further whip fans into a frenzy:

Other announcements today include Star Trek: Scouts, an animated YouTube series that aims to hook in new Trek fans at the preschool age. Here's a little more detail from the release:

“Developed and produced by Nickelodeon Digital Studio in association with CBS Studios, Star Trek: Scouts follows three 8-year-old friends, JR, Sprocket, and Roo, as they train to become future Starfleet Explorers by going on epic, out-of-this-world missions that push them to ‘discover, grow, and boldly go!”

Check out the trailer here, and if you like what you see or you have some sci-fi-minded small fry running around, you can watch the first two episodes (they run three to four minutes each) on Nickelodeon's Blaze and the Monster Machines YouTube channel. The remaining 18 episodes arrive next year.

Star Trek will also be getting a float in the annual Rose Parade—held on New Year's Day in Pasadena, CA—bringing the attention of college football fans worldwide to Star Trek's 60th anniversary as well as the imminent arrival of the new live-action series Starfleet Academy.

Still no firm launch date for Starfleet Academy, by the way, beyond “early 2026.” Strange New Worlds will wrap up its current third season this week, on September 11, with seasons four and five still to come.

As was teased from the Hall H stage at San Diego Comic-Con this year, the scripted podcast Star Trek: Khan launches today; as previously announced, it's a prequel to the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, with Naveen Andrews voicing the title character. The rest of the cast includes Star Trek: Voyager‘s Tim Russ as Ensign Tuvok, and TOS‘ George Takei as Captain Sulu. You can listen to new episodes Mondays through November 3 on all the big podcasting platforms, as well as the Star Trek YouTube channel.

Elsewhere online, Star Trek will launch a Webtoon digital comic initiative to celebrate the big 6-0, aiming to connect “with new audiences “by launching original stories that touch on universal genres and themes based in the world of Star Trek.”

To help you keep track of all this celebratory Star Trek information—apparently this is just the first wave of announcements for what's planned; we're hoping for some movie news!—there's now a special 60th anniversary web hub for fans, which you can check out here.

A former Microsoft AI strategist is running for Congress in Illinois, positioning himself as a much-needed technology expert for a federal government he views as unprepared for the future.

Nick Pyati is a Democratic candidate for Illinois' 9th Congressional District. He's part of a crowded primary field that features 14 Democrats and two Republicans vying for the seat of retiring Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.

In Pyati's view, in order for Democrats to start winning elections, it's not just about fighting President Trump. The party needs to have a bolder, more inspiring vision to attract people.

“One of the areas Democrats have lost touch with is technology and innovation, and how those are really critical to the progress we want to make,” Pyati told GeekWire. “That's really why we started talking more and more about my background in technology, about how that will help inform the policies we should bring to the table, and how few people in Congress right now have any kind of relevant background in the industry, and certainly not since AI has become its focus.”

Pyati wants to reframe the conversation about artificial intelligence for voters who might only associate the technology with chatbots. He argues that AI has the potential to fundamentally transform society and he wants to show that informed policy is essential to harness this “revolution” for the public good, and to ensure the U.S. doesn't fall behind.

Born and raised in the Chicago area, Pyati's background includes a range of experience across public and private sectors.

He started his career as a public school teacher in New York City. After graduating from Yale Law School, he was a federal prosecutor in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Justice Department during the Obama administration. From there he joined Boston Consulting Group, specializing in energy and public sector work.

Pyati joined Microsoft in 2016 and spent just over nine years working in corporate strategy for the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant. The last three years he was the strategy leader for the Windows and Devices team, with a major focus on AI.

Pyati moved back to Illinois last year, settling with his wife and two sons in Evanston, north of Chicago. He had no plans to run for office, but then Donald Trump won again.

Pyati, who will be in Seattle this week for a campaign fundraiser, rejects what he calls a false choice between acceleration and responsibility in AI development. 

“I don't think we can choose between rapid progress and safety. We have to have both,” he said, adding that many current proposals out of Washington, D.C., are “not realistic ways to regulate or guide AI” and are so difficult to follow they're only “going to slow us down.”

Pyati leans on his expertise across academia and business, bridging research and real-world application — a background that he thinks uniquely positions him to shape effective policy.

“I try to avoid getting sucked in by hype on any technology,” Pyati said. “But I think there's a fundamental value in AI. It's going to be as ubiquitous as electricity, in terms of how it gets used. It's going to be part of every policy area.”

Spotify is giving users more ways to personalize what they hear. The company is launching a new feature that allows users to filter their library by specific activities, moods, or genres. These filters can also be used to find playlists, or, to some extent, audiobooks and podcasts, and can even kick off a new session on Spotify's AI DJ.

The smart filters, which began rolling out on Friday, will first be made available to Premium subscribers on mobile devices and tablets in select markets, including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa. Spotify estimates the rollout will be completed over the next few weeks.

The feature arrives as the company has been focused on adding more personalization tools and features to its app in recent months. These types of tools, while seemingly small additions, can help differentiate Spotify further from competitors while also making it harder for existing users to leave. 

In April, for example, Spotify began offering tools to create personalized playlists using AI prompts, and in May, it added new playlist management tools and a way to create your own custom cover art. You can also now talk to its AI DJ to personalize your music selection and can take advantage of a revamped version of Spotify's flagship personalized playlist, Discover Weekly.

Despite these changes, some users are finding Spotify's interface is becoming too crowded, especially as the company wades into social networking territory by adding messages, comments on podcasts, polls and Q&As, stories, and a design that feels more like TikTok or YouTube following the introduction of music videos and video podcasts within the app.

The company has often faced complaints about an overly busy user interface, and the continual addition of new features has left some users feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. That, combined with the company's heavy focus on algorithmic suggestions, has even pushed some users to abandon Spotify entirely.

However, Spotify continues to report more users and subscribers — its user base swelled 11% to 696 million in the last quarter from a year earlier, and subscribers reached 276 million, up 12%.

The consensus is clear. Regular folk and gamers alike couldn't give a hoot for yet another Meta Quest-like VR headset. Hell, even the “metaverse is the future” company Meta seems more interested in smart glasses than headsets nowadays. That may change if Valve has anything to say about it. Even if you're not a VR gaming enthusiast, there's more than one reason you should pay attention to Valve's long-rumored wireless XR headset. The company behind Steam could be crafting a device whose closest description is “a Steam Deck for your face.”

Microsoft and Meta—strange bedfellows indeed—recently teamed up to sell an Xbox-ified version of the Meta Quest 3S. Despite the name “Xbox Edition,” the mixed reality headset could not play your Xbox games without relying on streaming. Valve could be cooking up something purpose-built for Steam gaming that's not the rumored “Fremont” console or a Steam Deck 2. VR and Valve rumormonger Brad Lynch spent last week posting about all the developments surrounding “Deckard,” which was reportedly the internal name given to the Half-Life maker's upcoming VR headset.

Last week, records showed Valve recently applied to trademark “Steam Frame”—a name akin to the Steam Deck handheld PC. That could be an indicator of how Valve plans to push this new device. It's a means of sticking your Steam library right in front of your eyes. Lynch suggested each game could be played in a separate “frame,” à la the Apple Vision Pro with its floating windows for your apps.

Unlike the Valve Index from 2019, this headset won't require Base Stations or wires hooked up to your TV. Based on the leaked documents and other rumors, the headset should be able to play VR games natively. What's more important is how it will handle all those games that don't support the chip microarchitecture that will supposedly power the new hardware. Most games run on x86-based microarchitecture. Rumors suggest that Valve could stick with an ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 or something equivalent. It's the same chip inside the Meta Quest 3. To make them compatible, Valve would need to create a compatibility layer from x86 to ARM.

Valve already has experience with compatibility layers. Its Proton software takes a Windows game and makes it compatible with Linux for the Steam Deck. In the few years since the release of Steam Deck and Proton, the share of gamers on Linux has trended up based on Valve's Steam Hardware Survey. The ARM layer could prove much, much more significant. The huge number of ARM-based mobile devices, and now a selection of Qualcomm ARM chips for laptops, means players could have more options to take their Steam games everywhere without needing to rely on streaming. Valve has reportedly been testing this ARM compatibility layer since at least 2024.

 

Those who play VR games on the Quest 2, Quest 3, or Quest 3S are already well aware of Steam Link or other streaming apps that help you connect to a PC for playing PC VR-exclusive titles. So why bother? In an interview with Gamertag VR, Lynch said the headset will have pancake lenses rather than the cheaper Fresnel lenses of the Quest 3S and odd devices like the HTC Vive Focus Vision.

Lynch claimed the new controllers, dubbed “Roy,” are no longer in the prototype phase. Lynch's 3D mockups—which he says are the final render model for the controllers—seem very close to Meta's Touch Plus controllers, though with all the face buttons located on the right-hand controller. Valve's original Index controllers were packed with 87 individual sensors to identify the location of your hand and each individual finger. The Quest manages to do more with less thanks to more advanced hand-tracking from the headset itself. None of that matters if the available software doesn't take any of the more specific hand-tracking into account.

If Valve releasing Half-Life: Alyx, the first Half-Life game in more than a decade, couldn't bring VR gaming into the mainstream, then how would a sequel headset—even one that won't have you tangled up in wires—possibly perform better? You have to remember why Valve makes hardware in the first place. So long as it funnels players toward Steam, then it's worth the company iterating on VR. Even if the new headset doesn't succeed, its software compatibility layer will increase the number of devices that can run the company's game launcher.

Nothing's Ear wireless earbuds are on their way back for a new iteration. According to Nothing, the Ear 3 (which is actually its sixth pair of wireless earbuds if we're counting) will officially launch on Sept. 18, and we even have our first real look. Based on this official image, the Ear 3 doesn't seem to break the mold of Nothing's previous wireless earbuds entirely, but it does come with some interesting design shifts.

First, there's the cylindrical piece of opaque plastic on the outside of the stem, which is notable for a few reasons—some potentially good and some bad, in my opinion. On the potentially good side: this looks like it could be an interface for some kind of fine-tuned touch/swipe controls, which I prefer over the traditional squeeze and pinch functionality on Nothing's current Ear A and Ear buds. My pleasure (or displeasure) with that shift will depend entirely on how well it's implemented. I generally like swipe and tap controls like on AirPods Pro 2 more in theory, but sometimes, if the sensitivity is off in either direction, they can be a real pain in the ass.

On the potentially bad side of things, it does kind of feel like Nothing is slowly making its wireless earbuds less transparent. I know the look of gadgets should shift over time, but I still appreciate the core of Nothing's aesthetic, which is a transparent shell that allows you to get a look at the internal components. Previous iterations weren't completely transparent by any means, but this definitely feels like Nothing might be cranking the volume down on its calling card look.

Most of this is conjecture, to be clear. I don't know what the rest of the wireless earbud looks like yet (Nothing will definitely slowly tease it out until Sept. 18 like it does every new product), and I'm not sure if touch controls are coming, but based on what I can see in this picture, I assume it will be a departure. And as long as we're hypothesizing, the Ear 3 also looks notably a little more squat in this picture, which sounds like a bad thing but may equate to better sound. Maybe (hopefully) we're getting better drivers that require more room or a new earbud design to allow for better airflow and less distortion. I've been feeling recently (as someone who uses the Nothing Ear frequently) that active noise cancellation (ANC) and general fidelity are in need of an update, especially when compared to recent competitors like the OnePlus Buds 4. Whether the Ear 3 are the update that I've been waiting for remains to be seen, but it looks like we'll know soon enough.

Elon Musk's SpaceX has agreed to acquire 50MHz of wireless spectrum and Mobile Satellite Service spectrum licenses from EchoStar, for use in the Starlink satellite network.

EchoStar will sell its AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses in exchange for $8.5 billion in cash and $8.5 billion SpaceX stock. SpaceX said the deal would let it develop and deploy its “Direct to Cell” constellation, which it claims can provide broadband-speed internet access to mobile phones across the world. Of the cash, $2 billion will be made as a direct cash interest payments on debt held by Echostar.

SpaceX last year received the Federal Communication Commission's approval to go forward with plans to offer a direct-to-phone version of its Starlink satellite internet service, with T-Mobile as a provider. This spectrum purchase gives SpaceX more freedom to operate, without having to depend on other network providers as much.

In particular, SpaceX said the new spectrum will enable “optimized 5G protocols” in its direct to phone service, once the next line of satellites is operational. The deal also gives customers of EchoStar's Boost Mobile service access to Starlink's direct to phone service.

The deal was conducted under significant pressure from the FCC, which launched an inquiry into EchoStar's utilization of its spectrum holdings in May, after public encouragement from SpaceX. According to Bloomberg, President Trump personally urged EchoStar CEO Charlie Ergen to sell the spectrum licenses in the weeks that followed. On August 26, EchoStar sold $23 billion worth of spectrum licenses to AT&T.

In a statement, EchoStar said it believes that, together with the AT&T deal, today's spectrum sale to SpaceX will resolve the FCC inquiry.

The spectrum deal effectively ends EchoStar's own ambitions to build a direct-to-device satellite constellation. As part of the move, EchoStar simultaneously canceled a $1.3 billion contract with Canadian satellite maker MDA Space that was announced just five weeks earlier in August for 100 satellites.

SpaceX said Monday that the new spectrum will enable upgraded satellites with “more than 100 times” the capacity of first-generation Starlink Direct to Cell satellites.

Orlando Bloom may-or-may-not return as Legolas in The Hunt for Gollum, Macon Blair may-or-may-not direct a sequel to The Toxic Avenger starring Melanie Lynskey, and the stars of KPOP Demon Hunters may-or-may-not return for a sequel. Mondays, right? Morning Spoilers, ahoy!

Orlando Blood told the Today Show that he'd “hate to see anyone else play Legolas,” but hasn't “heard a peep” if the character will appear in The Hunt for Gollum.

I have not heard a peep, actually. I don't know. I know it's focusing on Gollum, so anything's possible. It's such an amazing part. I'm so grateful to have been a part of those movies. But I haven't heard. Listen, I'd hate to see anyone else play Legolas, you know what I mean? What are they going to do? Are they going to put somebody else in as Legolas?

Speaking with Deadline, director Macon Blair said he'd “love to” continue making Toxic Avenger movies, and that he already has Melanie Lynskey in mind for a potential villain.

I would love to do that, and I had been sort of thinking about if somebody were to ask me, what would be cool for adventures to go on with Toxie, but I think we have to see how this one lands first and see if anybody has an appetite for that and see what happens. But to answer your question, I would love it if that were the case…if there were a way that I could have gotten Melanie [Lynskey] in this movie, I would have tried to do that too. But maybe she's the villain in part two or something like that. I don't know.

David Harbour told Screen Rant how “incredible” it feels being on the set of Avengers: Doomsday and to bare witness to “what's his face doing that speech”.

I was not even convinced when we started, and this movie's gonna be really good. They have a special sauce. I don't even really understand, but they [the Russos] just know how to do these things. And I think that as evidenced in Civil War, as evidenced in Infinity War, there's something about the layers in which they put the comedy and the drama and the surprises and the scale and the epicness and all that stuff. It's incredible.

I will say I've never been on a set like this in my life. I've never seen anything like this. You saw those chairs. So it's like, every one of those guys and girls has a trailer. It's just insane to look around the room and be like, “Oh my god, I'm in the movie. There's what's his face doing that speech”. It's just enormous.

According to Deadline, the upcoming Cliffhanger remake starring Lily James and Pierce Brosnan already has a sequel on the way.

In conversation with E! at the MTV Music Video Awards, KPOP Demon Hunters‘ star EJAE answered “Who knows, you know?” when asked about a potential sequel, prompting Audrey Nuna to add “we're waiting for he call as well.” Rei Ami echoed their statements, adding, “As soon as we know, we'll let you know.”

Variety reports that Media Capital Technologies and the Horror Section “are on board to fully finance and produce” a feature film based on Eli Roth and Snoop Dogg's concept trailer, Don't Go in That House, Bitch!

Josh Gad confirmed to Collider that filming is about to begin on Spaceballs 2 in Australia.

I can't believe it's actually happening. I pitched it to Mel Brooks three years ago. The fact that we are at the end of pre-production… You're the first person I'm telling this to: I'm leaving TIFF to fly to Australia to start shooting the movie.

We're always hypersensitive to [leaks] and aware of it. We're going to do, I would say, an even mix that would probably represent what Mel did on the first film. Because it is a Star Wars-esque film, it requires some Vista shots, which we're doing, and it requires some spaceship shots, which we're doing.

Bloody-Disgusting has a new Shelby Oaks poster that appears heavily indebted to Christian Death's Catastrophe Ballet album cover.

Bloody-Disgusting also has a new poster for the nonsecular possession horror movie, Traumatika.

A group of strangers prepare for a siege battle with the titular monster in a clip from The Yeti, starring Brittany Allen, Eric Nelsen, Corbin Bernsen, Jim Cummings, Christina Bennett Lind, and William Sadler.

After voicing character Beast Boy for nearly 25 years, Deadline reports that Greg Cipes will no longer play the part after he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

The actor took to social media, saying he was “fired” from the role mere hours after publicly revealing his diagnosis. However, Deadline reported that “a source close to the animated series” suggested that “the role of Beast Boy in Teen Titans Go! was [already] in the process of being recast due to creative differences,” and that the long-running series apparently offered Cipes a different character to play, instead.

Finally, Adult Swim has released a trailer for the third season of Smiling Friends premiering this October 5.

Typically, the best ultrabooks don't rock the boat too much. They might have lighter designs than previous years or improve performance with new chips. But the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is a unique device, with a rolling screen that turns a “short” 14-inch display into a very tall 16-inch diagonal experience.

It's the type of device you would expect to see shown off at a trade show like CES (where it debuted) and then never seen again — except that for $3,299.99, you can actually own it.

It isn't the most performance-focused computer for the money. You can buy powerful gaming laptops for the same price. But no other computer yet offers this functionality, even if there are a few first-generation hiccups. It's surely the most interesting laptop I've used all year, if not longer.

Out of the box, the ThinkBook looks like a pretty standard (if not dull) laptop, with a two-toned silver design. The screen has some odd bezels, wider on the sides than on the top and the bottom. The power button, which also features the fingerprint reader, is on the right side.

The aluminum deck is sturdy and features a backlit keyboard. The left side of the notebook features the laptop's sole trio of ports: a pair of Thunderbolt 4/USB Type-C ports and a headphone jack. That's not a lot of ports for any laptop, especially one seemingly meant for productivity, but I suppose something had to go in order to make room for the display.The laptop is 11.95 x 9.08 x 0.78 inches and weighs 3.72 pounds, which is hefty for a 14-inch PC. But this laptop is also a 16-inch PC, thanks to its rollable display, which makes the ThinkBook far more interesting than it looks at first.

The system comes with a 65W GaN charger. It's rare the charger gets a mention in our reviews, but it's great to see the latest charger technology, including a removable USB Type-C cable, in a premium machine. Other laptop vendors should do this more often, and Lenovo should bring it to more of its own machines.

With the ThinkBook's screen rolled up, you get a 14-inch, 2000 x 1600 screen with a 5:4 aspect ratio. Unrolled, you get a far taller display, measuring 16.7 inches diagonally with a resolution of 2000 x 2350 and an 8:9 aspect ratio. The screen is a POLED (plastic OLED) display with a 120 Hz refresh rate.

To let the screen unroll, you push a button on the keyboard. And the first time you try it, it feels absolutely awesome. Unfolding a foldable the first time feels futuristic. Having a motor do it for you feels magical.



The motor isn't terribly loud, but it does take time to roll and unroll — about 9 seconds from button press to full extension or contraction. I'd like to see that cut in half, though I don't know what that would do to durability. When Lenovo announced the laptop at CES, it claimed 30,000 hinge openings and closings and 20,000 screen rolls up and down. That's a lot of rolls and openings, but it's also a number you basically never have to think about with a traditional laptop design.

 




The plastic OLED screen looks really nice, and performs pretty well, too. The screen measured 150% of DCI-P3 coverage by volume, and 211.7% of SRGB, easily surpassing the Yoga Book 9i Gen 10's impressive dual panels. At 381.4 nits of brightness, however, it falls behind the Yoga Book and the MacBook Pro.

 




The thing is, though, it's not really great for multimedia. Even at 14-inches, the trailer for Superman had thick black bars on the top and bottom. Those increased to obscene amounts with the taller 16-inch screen unrolled.

What these aspect ratios do allow for is strong multitasking. Having the homepage of New York Magazine or Tom's Hardware showed an almost overwhelming amount of text. But with the screen extended, I could use the top half for a Google Doc while using the bottom of the screen to keep an eye on Slack, or have the Tom's Hardware's morning meeting up at the top of the screen while still getting some work done on the bottom. And there are uses for tall displays; some coders love a desktop display turned vertical to show more text. This does that in a laptop.

I even used it to try playing Ikragua, an old bullet-hell game designed to be played vertically. Unfortunately, in much of my gaming, parts of the game were cut off despite the fact that it should have fit on the screen. This is no gaming device, simply because of that issue. Of course, it also doesn't have dedicated graphics.And for all its impressive unfurling, there are limitations to the screen. For one, it's not a touchscreen, despite the many foldables that use similar technology, all featuring touch capabilities. I don't feel that all clamshell laptops inherently need touchscreens, but there's something about a screen this tall that feels like it invites it. Additionally, the hinge only goes just past a 90-degree angle. This seemingly supports the display and rolling mechanism, ensuring it rolls and unrolls at ideal angles, but it feels quite limiting. It's not good for lying back on the couch with the system in your lap. (The system also can tell if you have the angle below 90 degrees and won't make adjustments.)

You have to be careful with the screen. If you attempt to shut the laptop with the 16-inch display unrolled, you'll be greeted with a faint but annoying alarm until you open the system again.

You also can't change the resolution or screen orientation in Windows 11 on this laptop. While I doubt many people would actually change it, it's surprising to get a pop-up that says "The current model does not support resolution adjustment" as Windows reverts to the native resolution whether you tell it to or not. (You can still change scaling, though Lenovo warns it could cause problems with the ThinkBook Workspace app).

The other issue is that at certain angles, you can see where the screen bends to fit in the laptop. This isn't terribly different from the way you can sometimes see the crease on foldable phones, but it doesn't feel terribly premium.

Besides pushing the button on the keyboard, Lenovo has an opt-in feature that lets you use your hand and the time-of-flight sensor to raise and lower the screen. It sounds like a magic trick, but in practice it's extremely finicky. You need your hand in the perfect spot, then the sensor needs to recognize your hand, and only then do you move it up or down. The keyboard button, on the other hand, is foolproof.

There's only one configuration of the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable. The fancy screen is backed by an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. If you're buying this, it's mostly for the display.

The bump to 32GB of RAM is nice, but otherwise the specs are all pretty similar to what you can get in cheaper ultraportables. This price can get you a big, gaming-ready GPUs. With this laptop, you're getting ultrabook internals and an innovative screen, and you'll have to live with integrated graphics. Here, we're comparing the ThinkBook Plus to Lenovo's own Yoga Book 9i (Intel Core Ultra 7 255H), with dual screens that also lets you work tall, as well as the 14-inch MacBook Pro and HP OmniBook X Flip 14, both of which are more typical laptops with Apple's M4 and AMD's Ryzen AI 7 350, respectively, and cost far less.

On Geekbench 6, the Rollable earned a single-core score of 2,694 and a multi-core score of 10,847 – the lowest of the bunch, including Lenovo's dual-screen foldable, which uses an H-series chip. The Rollable copied 25GB of files at a rate of 1,075.92 MBps, just about in line with the Yoga Book, though the HP OmniBook was far faster.It took the Rollable 7 minutes and 13 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p, more than 2 minutes slower than the OmniBook (the M4 won here at 4:27).We stress-tested the system using Cinebench 2024. The PC was largely stable, with scores settling in the high 490s, without signs of throttling. The CPU's P-cores averaged 2.62 GHz during this test, while the E-cores measured 2.99 GHz.

The Rollable's scallop-shaped keys are great to type on. While I've seen some snappier keys on some of Lenovo's ThinkPad lineup, this keyboard was comfortable and balanced, letting me hit 110 words per minute on the monkeytype typing test with my standard 2% error rate.

 




I have no complaints about the haptic touchpad — a computer with a rolling screen doesn't need more moving parts. It's responsive to gestures and to clicks.

Maybe it's the extra bit of thickness the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 needs to fit a screen, but it also allows for surprisingly powerful speakers in an ultrabook. As I worked, Linkin Park's "Two Faced" screamed through my apartment with clear vocals, clashing drums, strong guitars, and even a hint of bass on the low end. You rarely find that on a business machine. The song's rapping and yelling were prioritized over sung vocals, but a quick change to the "balanced" mode in Dolby Access helped account for that, though it did lessen the bass.

 




Given the complexity of this device, I was shocked that there were any user-replaceable parts.

The base of the notebook is held on with eight Torx screws (a T5 bit fits just right). Removing them, I was able to pull the bottom off from a well-placed space near the chassis' palm rest.

The inside of the system is packed around the surprisingly wide 66 WHr battery. That cell is removable, though Lenovo recommends disconnecting the Wi-Fi antenna before taking it out, as the cables go right around the top of it (and over the ones that connect the battery to the motherboard). The SSD is also user-replaceable if you want to add more storage. The RAM is soldered.Be careful while working inside this system, though. You can see some of the springs and rails that power the motorized display. I'd hate to lose a screw in there.

An extra two inches of screen real estate (and the accompanying pixels) affects battery life. Rolled up to 14 inches, the ThinkBook ran for 9 hours and 28 minutes on our battery test, which includes web browsing, light WebGL testing, and video streaming with the screen set to 150 nits. With the screen unrolled out to 16 inches it ran for 8:43.

 




Both are longer than the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i Gen 10, with two screens, and the HP OmniBook X Flip 14, a convertible with one display. Apple's M4 and a mini-LED display, however, won out by far at 18 hours and 31 minutes.

To measure skin temperatures under load, we took heat readings while running our Cinebench 2024 stress test. The center of the keyboard measured 98 degrees Fahrenheit, while the touchpad was cooler at 92.3 F. The hottest point on the bottom of the notebook was near a vent at 113.5 F.

Internally, the CPU measured an average of 70.01 degrees Celsius during the same test.

The webcam on the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, despite having a 5MP lens, is just OK. In video calls, I saw some grainy artifacts despite the high-resolution image.But the tall screen on the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable adds a benefit: making it very easy to look at the camera. The angle changes slightly between 14 and 16-inch modes, but with the screen unrolled, you can look right at the camera.

The webcam features a shutter switch directly on top of the camera bump. I'd prefer a button on the keyboard, but this works fine.

Lenovo has several pieces of software designed specifically for the rollable, though I'll be frank — I don't think any of them are strictly necessary. The big one is ThinkBook Workspace, which lets you add mini apps like your reminders, to-do-list, and calendar from your Microsoft account. The app also features a user guide, an awkward secondary virtual display, and access to Smart Copy, a clipboard manager. You can also pin your own apps to Workspace's thick title bar. Personally, I preferred using Windows 11's Snap Layouts to put apps where I wanted them on the screen. One of the first things I did with Workspace was prevent it from launching every single time I extended the screen (there's an easy enough keyboard button for it).

ThinkBook Workspace has a ton of buried settings, many of them turned off by default. If you want a fun animation to play while you extend the screen (which I wouldn't recommend, as it covers your work), or to try enabling the feature to raise the screen with your hand, you'll have to dig.There's also Lenovo AI Now, a local AI app that lets you feed documents into your "personal knowledge base" to find or easily digest information without using the cloud. Lenovo requires an account for this app, which is a shame, since the point of it is that it uses local computing.

Just like Lenovo's other devices, Vantage is on board for warranty information, easy access to your serial number, battery, and device settings, system updates, and an advertisement for McAfee Secure VPN.There's also Lenovo Smart Meeting, which makes adjustments to your camera, background, or replaces you with a temporary avatar if you have to leave a meeting. There's also Smart Connect to add Lenovo or Motorola phones and tablets to your PC. Lenovo Now attempts to foist upsells and partner offers on you, and I think for a $3,300 laptop, you shouldn't have to deal with that.

Lenovo sells the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 with a one-year courier or carry-in warranty, which can be increased for a longer duration or to include more services for additional charges.

When my colleagues and I see futuristic concepts at trade shows like CES, they tend to stay concepts. But Lenovo made the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable real, and it's by far the most interesting laptop I've reviewed in a long time.

 




It's a good enough performer for typical productivity tasks like writing, spreadsheets, video conferencing, and basic coding. But with the $3,299.99 price tag, you're really paying for that rolling screen and all of the engineering behind it.In truth, there's nothing like it. Perhaps the closest options – the initial slate of foldable laptops that included the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold 16 – are either no longer available or are several generations of chips behind. This device also offers a traditional laptop keyboard and touchpad, unlike the more powerful Yoga Book 9i with dual screens.You could buy any number of traditional laptops with similar specs and add in one of the best portable monitors on top of it for a lot less money. But if you're OK with more moving parts in your laptop and you want more screen when you need it, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable sure is easier to carry. If that's worth the considerable extra expense (and extra weight) for you, then the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is worth considering.

Optimizing is a way of life for some folks.

Software engineer Makerinator has shared the details of a project which he light heartedly claims “saved my marriage.” The Decisioninator was designed and produced to “optimize and automate” navigating the often tricky question ‘What do you want for dinner tonight?' However, as with any good project, its design meant that it could be expanded to cover similarly tricky decisions covering the allocation of chores, date night venues, and movie night video stream choices.

Makerinator, says that his personal philosophy as a software engineer means that spending 40 hours to optimize a task and shave 3ms off is always “worth it.” And it is with this spirit that the creation of the Decisioninator began.

Having learned lessons from a prior abandoned Decisioninator project, Makerinator drafted a new and improved plan based on Raspberry Pi 4. The Pi runs a lite version of Raspberry Pi OS, and the Flame Engine, built on top of Flutter UI would be used with Flutter's reactive UI framework apps to run the application.

Makerinator mentions the use of the Flame Engine for this project. This is a modular Flutter game engine for 2D development. It seemed perfect for the linear but Wheel of Fortune style Decisioninator UI, and it made animation and collision detection easy, says the project maker.

To power the Pi, Makerinator used a 12V to 5V converter. Another detail shared was the use of the Pi's GPIO to get input from the two user buttons that form the Decisioninator's controls.

Makerinator is the first to admit he isn't a time served woodworking craftsman. However, he still managed to laser cut all the required ply sheeting and then construct a serviceable mini-arcade style kiosk to house the Decisioninator. Any woodworking sins were covered up by liberal sanding, spray-painting, and printed sublimated wraps.

Extra epoxy was used here and there, and a rotary tool used on the case and connector was described as “basically a get out of jail free card for my poor planning.”

In the end, everything looked cool in a retro-arcade way. To me, the finished machine looks like a shrunken 80s video game cabinet, with influences of Tempest, or Tron.

As mentioned above, there are two buttons on this device's control deck to help “optimize and automate” your relationship-sensitive decisions. On the left, the larger red button sets the spinner in motion.

The smaller blue button to the right selects Decisioninator modes. These are: restaurants, chores, date night outings, and streaming services. In this way the Decisioninator has become “a Swiss army knife for indecision,” explains the Makerinator. And thus, his marriage was saved, “thanks to Flutter, a laser, and a gallon of five-minute epoxy.” Owners of Raspberry Pi shares (disclosure: not I) would also like to highlight the plucky little SBC's role, too.

Allegedly powered by a custom PCB and prototype GDDR7 memory


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We've seen our fair share of modified GPUs from China — a region restricted from receiving most high-end cards. These export controls imposed by the The White House have created an underground market where gaming-grade graphics cards are stripped of their internals and put onto custom PCBs designed for AI workloads. AI requires a lot of memory, and despite former flagship GPUs like the RTX 4090 already coming with large memory buffers, it's still not enough for tasks such as running LLMs locally.

The latest to join the line of modded GPUs is the RTX 5090 with a whopping 128 GB of VRAM. Yes, this graphics card most likely has more memory than your entire PC. It's described as a prototype because the modder is using GDDR7X memory that is not yet available on a larger scale, but there's still a "super limited" quantity associated with this, which suggests that more units could be made.

Another fun 5090 128G prototype 😂 super limited with ~13.2k USD price 😂 pic.twitter.com/d0ypVglfIISeptember 7, 2025

By default, the RTX 5090 comes with 32GB of GDDR7 memory, which might seem plenty, but clearly there's room for improvement. What's interesting is this mod is a tier above anything we've seen before, or thought was possible. Previously, an RTX 4090 was upgraded with 96 GB of VRAM by using the best GDDR7 modules available in a dual-sided config. That was an anomaly, too, as the usual modded 4090s top out at about 48GB VRAM. The reason behind which is the complexity of the custom PCBs that are needed to support such tampering.

Currently, the highest-density GDDR7 chips are 24Gb (or 3 GB) per module, which can allow for up to 48 GB of VRAM. To reach higher capacities like 96 GB, dual-sided PCBs are used with memory modules on top and bottom, as seen on Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000. Therefore, for an RTX 5090 to feature 128 GB of VRAM, the factory would either need access to unreleased 32 Gbit GDDR7 chips — which no vendor has announced yet — or design a Frankenstein custom PCB with far more memory chips than usual; 64 GB on either side, totaling 128 GB in a dual-sided config.

Not only that, but custom firmware and BIOS are also required for said VRAM to be properly recognized and utilized by your system. The screenshot in the source tweet is from Nvidia-SMI which clearly shows the full 128GB memory being detected, meaning the mod works and is not just proof-of-concept. Moreover, the fact that there's pricing for this card is even more evidence that it's a potentially commercially-viable product ready to be sold.

According to I_Leak_VN, the 128 GB 5090 is priced at roughly $13,200 which is more than 4x the street pricing of a regular 5090. Shockingly, it almost makes sense considering the 96 GB RTX 6000 Pro sells for $10,000. If you do the math, it's 33% more memory for 33% more price with the souped-up 5090. Also, none of that accounts for the actual "craftsmanship" of performing the mod by hand. Regardless of the illicit nature of these GPUs, someone has to work diligently to make them possible, and it's not easy to casually swap GPU cores and VRAM chips.

Unfortunately, after the core and memory is extracted from a normal 5090, they often make their way onto secondhand marketplaces where they're sold as real 5090s to scam buyers. It's important to stay vigilant, especially now that the AI boom has created this new precedent where various hollow 4090s and 5090s have flooded the market for cheap, so if anything looks to good to be true, it likely is.

In a move that blurs the lines between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. like never before, the United States government has acquired a nearly 10% equity stake in Intel Corporation.

This historic transaction, valued at approximately $8.9 billion, effectively converts previously allocated CHIPS and Science Act grants into a direct ownership position, creating a de facto U.S. sovereign wealth fund with one of America's most iconic technology companies as its cornerstone asset.

The deal is a high-stakes gamble, born from a confluence of geopolitical anxiety, corporate vulnerability, and raw political pressure. It's a move that could either secure America's technological future or become a cautionary tale of industrial policy gone wrong.

Let's talk about this radical bet this week, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: a new 16-inch business laptop from HP.

To understand how this happened, one must appreciate the immense pressure Intel and its leadership have been under. The company, once the undisputed king of silicon, has spent the better part of a decade watching rivals like TSMC and Samsung pull ahead in advanced manufacturing.

This decline culminated in a period of intense public scrutiny, including from the White House itself. President Donald Trump had publicly called for the resignation of Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, citing alleged conflicts of interest related to China, creating a politically charged environment.

Against this backdrop, the CHIPS Act was meant to be a lifeline — a bipartisan effort to reshore critical semiconductor manufacturing. However, the Trump Administration's decision to pivot from straightforward grants to an equity stake changed the game entirely.

For Intel's leadership, refusing the deal was likely not a viable option. Turning down the government's offer would have meant forfeiting billions in essential funding and risking the appearance of being uncooperative with a national security imperative. It would have been corporate suicide.

The administration leveraged Intel's precarious position and the national security narrative to secure a deal that transforms a subsidy program into a national investment vehicle.

The concept of a government owning stakes in key industries is not new. Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are common globally, with varying degrees of success. The paragons are funds like the Norway Government Pension Fund Global, which has expertly managed the country's oil wealth to become the world's largest SWF, and Singapore's Temasek Holdings, known for its savvy, long-term investments in global companies.

These successful funds are characterized by professional management, a clear mandate to maximize long-term returns, and a strong firewall insulating them from short-term political interference.

However, the history of government intervention is also littered with failures. State-owned enterprises in many countries have been plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and political cronyism, becoming a drain on public resources rather than a source of national wealth.

Even in the U.S., direct government investments have a checkered past. The 2008 bailout of General Motors, for example, saw the Treasury take a significant equity stake to save the automaker, but ultimately resulted in an estimated $10 billion loss for taxpayers upon the sale of the shares.

The risk is that political objectives — like preserving jobs in a specific district or favoring certain suppliers — can override sound business strategy, dooming the investment to fail.

For Intel, successfully navigating this new reality will require a delicate balancing act. The first priority must be to establish a rigid governance framework that clearly defines the government's role as a passive, non-voting shareholder. The terms of the deal stipulate as much, but the informal pressure to align with political winds will be immense. Intel must continue to make decisions based on market dynamics, technological roadmaps, and competitive pressures, not on the four-year election cycle.

Second, transparency is paramount. Intel must over-communicate its strategy, milestones, and financial performance to the public and its new government shareholder. This will be crucial to building trust and demonstrating that the capital is being deployed effectively to achieve the shared goal of technological leadership.

Finally, Intel has to execute. The company is in the middle of a monumental turnaround plan, investing over $100 billion to build advanced fabrication plants (fabs) in Arizona, Ohio, and beyond. This government capital injection de-risks that colossal undertaking, but it doesn't guarantee success. Intel must hit its process technology goals, win back major customers from competitors, and make its foundry services a viable alternative to TSMC.

If the turnaround succeeds, the government's 10% stake will look like a stroke of genius. If it falters, it will become a symbol of a failed industrial policy.

Despite the risks, the strategic rationale for this move is compelling. Semiconductors are the bedrock of the modern economy and national security, powering everything from iPhones and AI data centers to F-35 fighter jets. For decades, the U.S. has watched its leadership in manufacturing this critical technology erode, creating a dangerous dependency on East Asia, particularly Taiwan.

This investment is a direct, muscular intervention to reverse that trend. By taking a stake in Intel, the government isn't just a funder; it's a committed partner. The government's direct partnership with Intel sends a powerful signal to the global market that the U.S. is serious about rebuilding its industrial commons.

It also includes a clever provision: a warrant allowing the government to acquire another 5% stake if Intel's ownership of its foundry business falls below 51%. This clause acts as a poison pill to prevent a future sale of the manufacturing assets, ensuring that the taxpayer-funded fabs remain under American control.

If successful, this model could be replicated, creating a portfolio of strategic national assets designed to secure America's supply chains and technological edge for generations.

The U.S. government's investment in Intel is a watershed moment for American industrial policy. It represents a departure from the laissez-faire orthodoxy of the past several decades and a bold, if risky, bet on the nation's ability to direct its economic destiny.

Intel was cornered into this deal, but it also provides the company with a historic opportunity to complete its turnaround and reclaim its position at the apex of the tech world. The success or failure of this venture will hinge on execution, discipline, and the ability of both parties to keep politics from poisoning the well of innovation.

For the United States, it's more than just an investment; it's a declaration that when it comes to the foundational technologies of the 21st century, America is determined to be the master of its own house.

For those who follow my work, you'll know I have a strong preference for 16-inch notebooks. While 14-inch laptops are great for portability, the larger display on a 16-inch machine provides screen real estate that comes tantalizingly close to a desktop experience, dramatically improving productivity without being tethered to an external monitor.

This week's standout product, the HP EliteBook 8 G1i series 16-inch, is a masterclass in this form factor, blending performance, security, and intelligent design into a compelling package for the modern professional.

HP wisely offers two distinct flavors of this machine, allowing buyers to choose based on their core priorities. For those seeking maximum multi-threaded performance for demanding applications like data analysis or compiling code, the AMD Ryzen Pro-powered EliteBook 8 G1i is the clear winner, offering a raw power advantage.

Conversely, if your organization is standardized on Intel's vPro platform for deep remote management and compliance, the Intel Core Ultra-equipped EliteBook 8 G1i is the purpose-built choice. It's less about which is “better” and more about which is right for your specific use case: raw performance or enterprise compliance.

What enables this impressive output is something unusual for this class: a dual-fan cooling system. Most competitors in the thin-and-light segment use a single fan, which often forces the processor to throttle under sustained load. HP's more robust thermal solution allows either the AMD or Intel chip to maintain peak performance longer, giving it a real, measurable advantage.

The display options are equally well-thought-out. While a stunning OLED panel is available, the better choice for many is the high color gamut WUXGA (1920×1200) LCD. It delivers crisp details and beautifully accurate colors, ideal for everything from spreadsheets to creative work, without the higher cost and potential longevity concerns of OLED technology.

Connectivity is top-tier, with a full suite of modern ports and options for Wi-Fi 7 and 5G capabilities, ensuring you can stay productive anywhere. But what truly elevates this notebook into an “AI PC” is HP's software suite.

Unlike the vague marketing from competitors, HP delivers tangible AI-powered features. HP Wolf Security uses machine learning for next-generation threat detection, while applications like AI-based noise reduction and automatic framing for the 5MP webcam create a superior collaboration experience.

The sleek aluminum chassis is both durable and professional, and the battery life is solid enough to get you through a demanding workday. For any professional seeking a do-it-all machine that feels like a desktop but travels like a pro, the HP EliteBook 8 G1i series is an outstanding choice and my Product of the Week.

A wave of homegrown talent arrives just as TSMC's 4nm ramp-up in Arizona turns into a three-fab silicon supercluster.

TSMC has more than doubled its Arizona internship program, pulling in over 200 students from around 60 colleges this summer as it races to staff its advanced-node fabs just outside Phoenix. Just a year ago, that figure stood at 130. In 2023, it was only 16. Speaking to Phoenix Business Journal, TSMC Arizona president Rose Castanares said “we're really scaling up,” noting that about 30 of this year's interns came from Arizona State University alone.

TSMC began producing 4nm chips at its first Phoenix fab in early 2025, a milestone confirmed by both the company and the U.S. Commerce Department in April. That same announcement outlined $6.6 billion in CHIPS Act subsidies and the plan for a third Arizona fab — one that will eventually support TSMC's upcoming 2nm process. Combined, the three fabs are expected to support over 6,000 direct jobs and produce some of the world's most advanced silicon on U.S. soil.

More than just a summer job, these internships sat alongside technical apprenticeships, accelerated certificate tracks, and a growing slate of university partnerships, all of which are part of a wider talent pipeline that's being pushed hard by state and federal officials. In April, the Arizona Commerce Authority trumpeted the expansion alongside Governor Katie Hobbs, and ASU has since launched new undergrad research and workforce development programs focused entirely on semiconductors.

TSMC is also using Amkor's new $2 billion advanced packaging facility in nearby Peoria, which will handle CoWoS and InFO: Two essential technologies for stacking high-performance chips like GPUs, AI accelerators, and Apple's multi-die SoCs. That move keeps a larger share of the chip supply chain in the U.S., especially for components built for the likes of Nvidia and AMD.

To keep these fabs and packaging lines running, TSMC is leaning heavily on local partnerships. Not only has ASU created new undergraduate and workforce training programs, but it's also offering graduate funding, while the state of Arizona itself launched a registered apprenticeship program with TSMC in January. This aims to certify fab technicians through a 15-week intensive course.

All this begs the question of whether Arizona can deliver the talent needed to support a long-term domestic supply chain? The 200 interns from this summer are just one part of the answer. The bigger test will be how many of them return, and how quickly they can step into roles at the leading edge of silicon production.

Historically, making a thin phone meant trading the usual battery for one that's slimmer and less robust. And what good is a thin phone with poor battery life? Up-and-coming silicon-carbon battery technology may be the answer.

The technology has been creeping into view. It has been in research for decades, and it's already in use with notable products. The Whoop fitness trackers have had a silicon-carbon battery since 2021. Chinese phone brands Xiaomi and Honor have more recently used the tech in their phones; OnePlus employs it in the OnePlus 13, and even Nothing embraced it in its new Phone (3). So far, the technology's application has been split by form factor, with folding phones enjoying thinner designs and candy bar phones earning bigger battery capacities

Apple is expected to debut the iPhone 17 Air this week, and it's rumored to be a mere 5.5 mm thick, making it the slimmest iPhone ever. The company may be using a silicon-carbon battery to ensure it can get close to or match the battery life you'd expect from a modern-day iPhone.

Most phones are somewhere between 8 to 9 millimeters thick. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is 8.2 mm, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is 8.25 mm, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is 8.5 mm. But phone makers have been shedding millimeters like it's nobody's business, and 2025 has seen a blossoming of super-slim devices.

This past spring, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S25 Edge, merely 5.8 mm. The even more recent Galaxy Z Fold7 is impressively 4.2 mm when unfolded, but Huawei's tri-folding phone, the Mate XT Ultimate, beats it at 3.6 mm unfolded. Smaller brands like Tecno are getting in on the action, teasing a super-thin phone at MWC 2025, and subsequently announcing a 5.93-mm handset.

It's not the first time that phone makers have chased thinness as a feature. The early 2010s saw a similar race from the same players; at Apple's 2012 September event, the first words about the iPhone 5 were that it was "the thinnest phone we have ever made,” and at 7.6 mm thick, Apple went so far as to call it the world's thinnest smartphone at the time. We've even seen thinner since: the Oppo R5 from 2014 was 4.85 mm.

With the new thinness wars, only a select few of these companies are utilizing silicon-carbon batteries so far, like Huawei and Honor. Samsung seems to be more cautious, opting to use a standard lithium-ion battery and finding ways to make its display more power-efficient to make up for the smaller battery capacity. (Given the company's history with batteries, it's understandable.) But these tweaks weren't enough—the Edge's battery life is still lackluster.

So what exactly is a silicon-carbon battery, and how could it impact the iPhone 17 Air?

In a lithium-ion battery, lithium ions travel from the anode to the cathode as your phone discharges during use. When you charge your device, those ions travel from the cathode back to the anode, and rinse and repeat. The anode is usually made of graphite.

A “silicon-carbon battery” is actually a misnomer. These batteries are still lithium-ion batteries; however, the graphite anode has been replaced with a silicon-carbon anode. Silicon can store approximately 10 times the number of lithium ions by weight than graphite, according to Rick Luebbe. He's the CEO of Group14, one of the top companies in the silicon battery space. Other players include Enovix, Sila Nanotechnologies, and Nexeon.

The graphite anode takes up a large amount of space in a typical lithium-ion battery—around 60 percent, Luebbe says, depending on the battery design. A silicon anode takes up less space in the battery, resulting in the ability for a higher energy density by expanding the cathode.

It's worth noting that a company like Group14 or Sila isn't actually making the battery; these silicon anodes are what is known as a drop-in product. “We are powder makers—magic black powder,” Luebbe says. The powdered silicon-carbon anode is sent to battery manufacturers like ATL, which produces batteries for smartphones and laptops. A company like ATL can simply replace its graphite powder with the silicon-carbon mixture without disruption.

A phone maker can take one of two approaches. You can make your smartphone roughly the same thickness as before, but now increase the energy capacity of the battery, like the OnePlus 13. That could ensure longer battery runtime. Or, since the battery doesn't need to be as large anymore, you can keep roughly the same energy capacity as prior models and take advantage of the space savings to slim the phone down.

Manufacturers like Honor, OnePlus, and Nothing use silicon-carbon in their latest candy bar phones. These devices maintain their standard thickness for the most part and feature increased battery capacities. For example, the OnePlus 13 has a bigger 6,000-mAh battery and is thinner than its predecessor, but its 8.5 mm thickness is on par with most traditional phones.

Apple has taken the second approach with caveats. Rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air's battery capacity will sit around 2,900 mAh, a steep drop from prior iPhone models, especially at the 6.6-inch screen size. But the company is supposedly making up for it with power-saving tricks to make sure battery life remains similar to other iPhones, including Apple's more efficient C1 modem that debuted on the iPhone 16e earlier this year.

Luebbe declined to comment on whether Group14's silicon-carbon composite is being used in the iPhone 17 Air's batteries; Sila Nanotechnologies and Enovix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The problem with silicon batteries is that they expand. When you lithiate raw silicon, Luebbe says it can expand up to three times its initial volume. Lithium-ion batteries also swell; you've probably heard of or maybe even experienced this, as it can happen for a myriad of reasons. It means something has gone wrong, and the battery is now a safety risk.

It's this problem that researchers and companies have spent decades trying to solve, and the solution lies in the carbon part of the name. It starts to get a bit technical here—and each silicon anode company has its own proprietary process—but Luebbe says Group14's approach is to start with a porous carbon material.

“Imagine a carbon sponge, but the pores of that sponge are on the single-digit molecule wide, we're talking less than 10 nanometers wide,” he says. These pores are filled with silane gas (the silicon), but only about halfway. The particle you're left with is made up of silicon, carbon, and void space. When the lithium ions head over from the cathode to the anode and the silicon lithiates, it expands to fill the void spaces of the particle.

“It mitigates the expansion at the particle level, so the battery doesn't see the expansion, so it stabilizes the battery, and you get excellent cycle life," Luebbe says. "That's the critical insight in the invention: really learning how to internalize that expansion, so that it's insulated from the battery chemistry and mechanical operations.”

Vincent Chevrier has been a researcher in the silicon field for 15 years and is a partner at battery consulting firm Cyclikal. He says while silicon is here to stay as a material to be used in lithium-ion batteries, there are still a few challenges for broader adoption, namely cost.

Companies like Group14 use silane gas instead of solid silicon, which yields better battery performance, but could be 10 times the cost. That could make it harder to sell their composite to battery makers, and it could drive up the prices of consumer electronics. The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to cost around $1,099, a potential $200 bump from the iPhone 16 Plus it's expected to replace, though there could be other factors affecting its price, like tariffs.

Chevrier also says he often sees silicon-carbon makers inflate the energy density claims. Group14, for example, says on its website that its silicon batteries can deliver up to 50 percent more energy density than conventional lithium-ion batteries. But if the material is just dropped in to replace graphite and not much else is changed with the battery, you're more likely going to see a 10 percent boost in energy density with a switch to a silicon-carbon anode. Redesign the battery cell, and then it'd be possible to see an increase of up to 30 percent.

Silicon-carbon batteries also have worse cycle life than graphite. That's how many full charge to discharge cycles (zero to 100 percent) a battery goes through before its capacity degrades below 80 percent. In terms of the energy efficiency of silicon—how much of the energy put in the battery ends up as heat and how much is stored as energy—Chevrier says “more energy is lost to heat than graphite.”

Graphite could have the potential to achieve 5,000 charge cycles, whereas Group14's composite sits at 1,000 cycles, or about 3 years, depending on how often you fully charge the phone. However, Chevrier points out that current batteries with graphite anodes do not hit 5,000 charge cycles because companies like Apple cram higher energy density, which stresses the battery but keeps the phone operating throughout the day. That's why the iPhone's battery doesn't last as long as it did after two years of use. iPhone 16 batteries can retain 80 percent of their capacity at 1,000 charge cycles. Switching to silicon-carbon may not necessarily make much of a difference in the lifecycle of the battery, despite claims otherwise.

The crucial thing to remember is that despite the advances in batteries over the years, including silicon-carbon anodes, new technologies arrive at the same time to claim a slice of that excess power. The growing list of artificial intelligence features running locally on phones is increasing, and they'll happily sip up more power if they can get it. That means you may not enjoy longer battery life even if a device maker stuffs in a silicon-carbon anode and expands battery capacity.

In the case of the iPhone 17 Air, Apple is taking the space-saving advantage of silicon-carbon anodes and experimenting with a thin and lightweight design to see if consumers will bite, without resorting to a smaller screen. It could also prove to be a testing ground for a future folding iPhone—Apple would ensure it won't be dramatically thicker than a traditional iPhone.

Whether or not the company will succeed in delivering just the right amount of battery life in this design will have to wait until we can finally take the Air out for a spin.

Every year, we recognize extraordinary young researchers on our Innovators Under 35 list. Recent honorees told us how they're faring under the new administration.

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's "America Undone” series, examining how the foundations of US success in science and innovation are currently under threat. You can read the rest here.

Every year MIT Technology Review celebrates accomplished young scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors from around the world in our Innovators Under 35 list. We've just published the 2025 edition. This year, though, the context is pointedly different: The US scientific community finds itself in an unprecedented position, with the very foundation of its work under attack. 

Since Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has fired top government scientists, targeted universities individually and academia more broadly, and made substantial funding cuts to the country's science and technology infrastructure. It has also upended longstanding rights and norms related to free speech, civil rights, and immigration—all of which further affects the overall environment for research and innovation in science and technology. 

We wanted to understand how these changes are affecting the careers and work of our most recent classes of innovators. The US government is the largest source of research funding at US colleges and universities, and many of our honorees are new professors and current or recent graduate or PhD students, while others work with government-funded entities in other ways. Meanwhile, about 16% of those in US graduate programs are international students. 

We sent surveys to the six most recent cohorts, which include 210 people. We asked people about both positive and negative impacts of the administration's new policies and invited them to tell us more in an optional interview. Thirty-seven completed our survey, and we spoke with 14 of them in follow-up calls. Most respondents are academic researchers (about two-thirds) and are based in the US (81%); 11 work in the private sector (six of whom are entrepreneurs). Their responses provide a glimpse into the complexities of building their labs, companies, and careers in today's political climate. 

Twenty-six people told us that their work has been affected by the Trump administration's changes; only one of them described those effects as “mostly positive.” The other 25 reported primarily negative effects. While a few agreed to be named in this story, most asked to be identified only by their job titles and general areas of work, or wished to remain anonymous, for fear of retaliation. “I would not want to flag the ire of the US government,” one interviewee told us. 

Across interviews and surveys, certain themes appeared repeatedly: the loss of jobs, funding, or opportunities; restrictions on speech and research topics; and limits on who can carry out that research. These shifts have left many respondents deeply concerned about the “long-term implications in IP generation, new scientists, and spinout companies in the US,” as one respondent put it. 

Federal scientists warn that Americans could feel the effects of the new administration's devastating cuts for decades to come.

One of the things we heard most consistently is that the uncertainty of the current moment is pushing people to take a more risk-averse approach to their scientific work—either by selecting projects that require fewer resources or that seem more in line with the administration's priorities, or by erring on the side of hiring fewer people. “We're not thinking so much about building and enabling … we're thinking about surviving,” said one respondent. 

Ultimately, many are worried that all the lost opportunities will result in less innovation overall—and caution that it will take time to grasp the full impact. 

“We're not going to feel it right now, but in like two to three years from now, you will feel it,” said one entrepreneur with a PhD who started his company directly from his area of study. “There are just going to be fewer people that should have been inventing things.”

The most immediate impact has been financial. Already, the Trump administration has pulled back support for many areas of science—ending more than a thousand awards by the National Institutes of Health and over 100 grants for climate-related projects by the National Science Foundation. The rate of new awards granted by both agencies has slowed, and the NSF has cut the number of graduate fellowships it's funding by half for this school year. 

The administration has also cut or threatened to cut funding from a growing number of universities, including Harvard, Columbia, Brown, and UCLA, for supposedly not doing enough to combat antisemitism.

As a result, our honorees said that finding funding to support their work has gotten much harder—and it was already a big challenge before. 

A biochemist at a public university told us she'd lost a major NIH grant. Since it was terminated earlier this year, she's been spending less time in the lab and more on fundraising. 

Others described uncertainty about the status of grants from a wide range of agencies, including NSF, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, the Department of Energy, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which collectively could pay out more than $44 million to the researchers we've recognized. Several had waited months for news on an application's status or updates on when funds they had already won would be disbursed. One AI researcher who studies climate-related issues is concerned that her multiyear grant may not be renewed, even though renewal would have been “fairly standard” in the past.

Two individuals lamented the cancellation of 24 awards in May by the DOE's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, including grants for carbon capture projects and a clean cement plant. One said the decision had “severely disrupted the funding environment for climate-tech startups” by creating “widespread uncertainty,” “undermining investor confidence,” and “complicating strategic planning.” 

Tens of millions of dollars in NSF grants have been slashed, and scientists fear the US is about to lose a generation of climate researchers.

Climate research and technologies have been a favorite target of the Trump administration: The recently passed tax and spending bill put stricter timelines in place that make it harder for wind and solar installations to qualify for tax credits via the Inflation Reduction Act. Already, at least 35 major commercial climate-tech projects have been canceled or downsized this year. 

In response to a detailed list of questions, a DOE spokesperson said, “Secretary [Chris] Wright and President Trump have made it clear that unleashing American scientific innovation is a top priority.” They pointed to “robust investments in science” in the president's proposed budget and the spending bill and cited special areas of focus “to maintain America's global competitiveness,” including nuclear fusion, high-performance computing, quantum computing, and AI. 

Other respondents cited tighter budgets brought on by a change in how the government calculates indirect costs, which are funds included in research grants to cover equipment, institutional overhead, and in some cases graduate students' salaries. In February, the NIH instituted a 15% cap on indirect costs—which ran closer to 28% of the research funds the NIH awarded in 2023. The DOE, DOD, and NSF all soon proposed similar caps. This collective action has sparked lawsuits, and indirect costs remain in limbo. (MIT, which owns MIT Technology Review, is involved in several of these lawsuits; MIT Technology Review is editorially independent from the university.) 

Looking ahead, an academic at a public university in Texas, where the money granted for indirect costs funds student salaries, said he plans to hire fewer students for his own lab. “It's very sad that I cannot promise [positions] at this point because of this,” he told us, adding that the cap could also affect the competitiveness of public universities in Texas, since schools elsewhere may fund their student researchers differently. 

At the same time, two people with funding through the Defense Department—which could see a surge of investment under the president's proposed budget—said their projects were moving forward as planned. A biomedical engineer at a public university in the Midwest expressed excitement about what he perceives as a fresh surge of federal interest in industrial and defense applications of synthetic biology. Still, he acknowledged colleagues working on different projects don't feel as optimistic: “Folks are definitely feeling the pressure.”

Many who are affected by cuts or delays are now looking for new funding sources in a bid to become less reliant on the federal government. Eleven people said they are pursuing or plan to pursue philanthropic and foundation funding or to seek out industry support. However, the amount of private funding available can't begin to make up the difference in federal funds lost, and investors often focus more on low-risk, short-term applications than on open scientific questions. 

The NIH responded to a detailed list of questions with a statement pointing to unspecified investments in early-career researchers. “Recent updates to our priorities and processes are designed to broaden scientific opportunity rather than restrict it, ensuring that taxpayer-funded research is rigorous, reproducible, and relevant to all Americans,” it reads. The NSF declined a request for comment from MIT Technology Review. 

Further complicating this financial picture are tariffs—some of which are already in effect, and many more of which have been threatened. Nine people who responded to our survey said their work is already being affected by these taxes imposed on goods imported into the US. For some scientists, this has meant higher operating costs for their labs: An AI researcher said tariffs are making computational equipment more expensive, while the Texas academic said the cost of buying microscopes from a German firm had gone up by thousands of dollars since he first budgeted for them. (Neither the White House press office nor the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy responded to requests for comment.) 

One cleantech entrepreneur saw a positive impact on his business as more US companies reevaluated their supply chains and sought to incorporate more domestic suppliers. The entrepreneur's firm, which is based in the US, has seen more interest for its services from potential customers seeking “tariff-proof vendors.”  

“Everybody is proactive on tariffs and we're one of these solutions—we're made in America,” he said. 

Another person, who works for a European firm, is factoring potential tariffs into decisions about where to open new production facilities. Though the Trump administration has said the taxes are meant to reinvigorate US manufacturing, she's now less inclined to build out a significant presence in the US because, she said, tariffs may drive up the costs of importing raw materials that are required to make the company's product. 

What's more, financial backers have encouraged her company to stay rooted abroad because of the potential impact of tariffs for US-based facilities: “People who invest worldwide—they are saying it's reassuring for them right now to consider investing in Europe,” she said.

Innovators working in both academia and the private sector described new concerns about speech and the politicization of science. Many have changed how they describe their work in order to better align with the administration's priorities—fearing funding cuts, job terminations, immigration action, and other potential retaliation. 

This is particularly true for those who work at universities. The Trump administration has reached deals with some institutions, including Columbia and Brown, that would restore part of the funding it slashed—but only after the universities agreed to pay hefty fines and abide by terms that, critics say, hand over an unprecedented level of oversight to administration officials. 

Some respondents had received guidance on what they could or couldn't say from program managers at their funding agencies or their universities or investors; others had not received any official guidance but made personal decisions on what to say and share publicly based on recent news of grant cancellations.

Both on and off campus, there is substantial pressure on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which have been hit particularly hard as the administration seeks to eliminate what it called “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” in one of the first executive orders of President Trump's second term.  

One respondent, whose work focuses on fighting child sexual abuse materials, recalled rewriting a grant abstract “3x to remove words banned” by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, an administration ally; back in February, Cruz identified 3,400 NSF grants as “woke DEI” research advancing “neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda.” (His list includes grants to research self-driving cars and solar eclipses. His office did not respond to a request for comment.) 

Many other researchers we spoke with are also taking steps to avoid being put in the DEI bucket. A technologist at a Big Tech firm whose work used to include efforts to provide more opportunities for marginalized communities to get into computing has stopped talking about those recruiting efforts. One biologist described hearing that grant applications for the NIH now have to avoid words like “cell type diversity” for “DEI reasons”—no matter that “cell type diversity" is, she said, a common and “neutral” scientific term in microbiology. (In its statement, the NIH said: “To be clear, no scientific terms are banned, and commonly used terms like ‘cell type diversity' are fully acceptable in applications and research proposals.”) 

Plenty of other research has also gotten caught up in the storm. 

We'll announce our 2025 class on September 8. Here's the process we follow each year to decide which young scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors to recognize.

One person who works in climate technology said that she now talks about “critical minerals,” “sovereignty,” and “energy independence” or “dominance” rather than “climate” or “industrial decarbonization.” (Trump's Energy Department has boosted investment in critical minerals, pledging nearly $1 billion to support related projects.) Another individual working in AI said she has been instructed to talk less about “regulation,” “safety,” or “ethics” as they relate to her work. One survey respondent described the language shift as “definitely more red-themed.”

Some said that shifts in language won't change the substance of their work, but others feared they will indeed affect the research itself. 

Emma Pierson, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, worried that AI companies may kowtow to the administration, which could in turn “influence model development.” While she noted that this fear is speculative, the Trump administration's AI Action Plan contains language that directs the federal government to purchase large language models that generate “truthful responses” (by the administration's definition), with a goal of “preventing woke AI in the federal government.” 

And one biomedical researcher fears that the administration's effective ban on DEI will force an end to outreach “favoring any one community” and hurt efforts to improve the representation of women and people of color in clinical trials. The NIH and the Food and Drug Administration had been working for years to address the historic underrepresentation of these groups through approaches including specific funding opportunities to address health disparities; many of these efforts have recently been cut. 

Respondents from both academia and the private sector told us they're aware of the high stakes of speaking out. 

“As an academic, we have to be very careful about how we voice our personal opinion because it will impact the entire university if there is retaliation,” one engineering professor told us. 

“I don't want to be a target,” said one cleantech entrepreneur, who worries not only about reprisals from the current administration but also about potential blowback from Democrats if he cooperates with it. 

“I'm not a Trumper!” he said. “I'm just trying not to get fined by the EPA.” 

Immigrants are crucial to American science, but what one respondent called a broad “persecution of immigrants,” and an increasing climate of racism and xenophobia, are matters of growing concern. 

Some people we spoke with feel vulnerable, particularly those who are immigrants themselves. The Trump administration has revoked 6,000 international student visas (causing federal judges to intervene in some cases) and threatened to “aggressively” revoke the visas of Chinese students in particular. In recent months, the Justice Department has prioritized efforts to denaturalize certain citizens, while similar efforts to revoke green cards granted decades ago were shut down by court order. One entrepreneur who holds a green card told us, “I find myself definitely being more cognizant of what I'm saying in public and certainly try to stay away from anything political as a result of what's going on, not just in science but in the rest of the administration's policies.” 

On top of all this, federal immigration raids and other enforcement actions—authorities have turned away foreign academics upon arrival to the US and detained others with valid academic visas, sometimes because of their support for Palestine—have created a broad climate of fear.  

Four respondents said they were worried about their own immigration status, while 16 expressed concerns about their ability to attract or retain talent, including international students. More than a million international students studied in the US last year, with nearly half of those enrolling in graduate programs, according to the Institute of International Education. 

“The adversarial attitude against immigrants, especially those from politically sensitive countries, is posing a brain drain,” an AI researcher at a large public university on the West Coast told us. 

This attack on immigration in the US can be compounded by state-level restrictions. Texas and Florida both restrict international collaborations with and recruitment of scientists from countries including China, even though researchers told us that international collaborations could help mitigate the impacts of decreased domestic funding. “I cannot collaborate at this point because there's too many restrictions and Texas also can limit us from visiting some countries,” the Texas academic said. “We cannot share results. We cannot visit other institutions … and we cannot give talks.”

All this is leading to more interest in positions outside the United States. One entrepreneur, whose business is multinational, said that their company has received a much higher share of applications from US-based candidates to openings in Europe than it did a year ago, despite the lower salaries offered there. 

“It is becoming easier to hire good people in the UK,” confirmed Karen Sarkisyan, a synthetic biologist based in London. 

At least one US-based respondent, an academic in climate technology, accepted a tenured position in the United Kingdom. Another said that she was looking for positions in other countries, despite her current job security and “very good” salary. “I can tell more layoffs are coming, and the work I do is massively devalued. I can't stand to be in a country that treats their scientists and researchers and educated people like this,” she told us. 

Some professors reported in our survey and interviews that their current students are less interested in pursuing academic careers because graduate and PhD students are losing offers and opportunities as a result of grant cancellations. So even as the number of international students dwindles, there may also be “shortages in domestic grad students,” one mechanical engineer at a public university said, and “research will fall behind.”

In the end, this will affect not just academic research but also private-sector innovation. One biomedical entrepreneur told us that academic collaborators frequently help his company generate lots of ideas: “We hope that some of them will pan out and become very compelling areas for us to invest in.” Particularly for small startups without large research budgets, having fewer academics to work with will mean that “we just invest less, we just have fewer options to innovate,” he said. “The level of risk that industry is willing to take is generally lower than academia, and you can't really bridge that gap.” 

Despite it all, a number of researchers and entrepreneurs who generally expressed frustration about the current political climate said they still consider the US the best place to do science. 

Pierson, the AI researcher at Berkeley, described staying committed to her research into social inequities despite the political backlash: “I'm an optimist. I do believe this will pass, and these problems are not going to pass unless we work on them.” 

And a biotech entrepreneur pointed out that US-based scientists can still command more resources than those in most other countries. “I think the US still has so much going for it. Like, there isn't a comparable place to be if you're trying to be on the forefront of innovation—trying to build a company or find opportunities,” he said.

Several academics and founders who came to the US to pursue scientific careers spoke about still being drawn to America's spirit of invention and the chance to advance on their own merits. “For me, I've always been like, the American dream is something real,” said one. They said they're holding fast to those ideals—for now.

Spiritual care and technology are converging across the country, reshaping the theology of trust.

The hearing aid features first available on Apple's AirPods Pro 2 are a good start to democratizing a crucial technology.

Elon Musk's satellite internet service has been absolutely critical to the country's defense. But staying connected through war relies on innovation and rehab work from “The People's Starlink.”

After growing up without reliable power at home, Iwnetim Abate is working to develop a steady supply of sustainable energy.

Iwnetim Abate is one of MIT Technology Review's 2025 Innovators Under 35. Meet the rest of this year's honorees. 

“I'm the only one who wears glasses and has eye problems in the family,” Iwnetim Abate says with a smile as sun streams in through the windows of his MIT office. “I think it's because of the candles.”

In the small town in Ethiopia where he grew up, Abate's family had electricity, but it was unreliable. So, for several days each week when they were without power, Abate would finish his homework by candlelight.

Today, Abate, 32, is an assistant professor at MIT in the department of materials science and engineering. Part of his research focuses on sodium-ion batteries, which could be cheaper than the lithium-based ones that typically power electric vehicles and grid installations. He's also pursuing a new research path, examining how to harness the heat and pressure under the Earth's surface to make ammonia, a chemical used in fertilizer and as a green fuel.

Growing up without the ubiquitous access to electricity that many people take for granted shaped the way Abate thinks about energy issues, he says. He recalls rushing to dry out his school uniform over a fire before he left in the morning. One of his chores was preparing cow dung to burn as fuel—the key is strategically placing holes to ensure proper drying, he says.

Can the vast and sparsely populated African country translate its renewable power potential into national development?

Abate's desire to devote his attention to energy crystallized in a high school chemistry class on fuel cells. “It was like magic,” he says, to learn it's possible to basically convert water into energy. “Sometimes science is magic, right?”

Abate scored the highest of any student in Ethiopia on the national exam the year he took it, and he knew he wanted to go to the US to further his education. But actually getting there proved to be a challenge. 

Abate applied to US colleges for three years before he was granted admission to Concordia College Moorhead, a small liberal arts college, with a partial scholarship. To raise the remaining money, he reached out to various companies and wealthy people across Ethiopia. He received countless rejections but didn't let that phase him. He laughs recalling how guards would chase him off when he dropped by prospects' homes in person. Eventually, a family friend agreed to help.

When Abate finally made it to the Minnesota college, he walked into a room in his dorm building and the lights turned on automatically. “I both felt happy to have all this privilege and I felt guilty at the same time,” he says.

His college wasn't a research institute, so Abate quickly set out to get into a laboratory. He reached out to Sossina Haile, then at the California Institute of Technology, to ask about a summer research position.

Haile, now at Northwestern University, recalls thinking that Abate was particularly eager. As a visible Ethiopian scientist, she gets a lot of email requests, but his stood out. “No obstacle was going to stand in his way,” she says. It was risky to take on a young student with no research experience who'd only been in the US for a year, but she offered him a spot in her lab.

Abate spent the summer working on materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells. He returned for the following summer, then held a string of positions in energy-materials research, including at IBM and Los Alamos National Lab, before completing his graduate degree at Stanford and postdoctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley.

Meet the rest of this year's Innovators Under 35.

He joined the MIT faculty in 2023 and set out to build a research group of his own. Today, there are two major focuses of his lab. One is sodium-ion batteries, which are a popular alternative to the lithium-based cells used in EVs and grid storage installations. Sodium-ion batteries don't require the kinds of critical minerals lithium-ion batteries do, which can be both expensive and tied up by geopolitics.  

One major stumbling block for sodium-ion batteries is their energy density. It's possible to improve energy density by operating at higher voltages, but some of the materials used tend to degrade quickly at high voltages. That limits the total energy density of the battery, so it's a problem for applications like electric vehicles, where a low energy density would restrict range.

Abate's team is developing materials that could extend the lifetime of sodium-ion batteries while avoiding the need for nickel, which is considered a critical mineral in the US. The team is examining additives and testing materials-engineering techniques to help the batteries compete with lithium-ion cells.

Another vein of Abate's work is in some ways a departure from his history in batteries and fuel cells. In January, his team published research describing a process to make ammonia underground, using naturally-occurring heat and pressure to drive the necessary chemical reactions.  

Once you get over the ick factor, new technologies are efficiently transforming human waste into agricultural solutions.

Today, making ammonia generates between 1% and 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It's primarily used to fertilize crops, but it's also being considered as a fuel for sectors like long-distance shipping.

Abate cofounded a company called Addis Energy to commercialize the research, alongside MIT serial entrepreneur Yet-Ming Chiang and a pair of oil industry experts. (Addis means “new” in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.) For an upcoming pilot, the company aims to build an underground reactor that can produce ammonia. 

When he's not tied up in research or the new startup, Abate runs programs for African students. In 2017, he cofounded an organization called Scifro, which runs summer school programs in Ethiopia and plans to expand to other countries, including Rwanda. The programs focus on providing mentorship and educating students about energy and medical devices, which is the specialty of his cofounder. 

While Abate holds a position at one of the world's most prestigious universities and serves as chief science officer of a buzzy startup, he's quick to give credit to those around him. “It takes a village to build something, and it's not just me,” he says.

Abate often thinks about his friends, family, and former neighbors in Ethiopia as he works on new energy solutions. “Of course, science is beautiful, and we want to make an impact,” he says. “Being good at what you do is important, but ultimately, it's about people.”

The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators.

The country is installing solar, building EVs, and investing across energy at a rapid clip.

A recent test shows that Quidnet's technology can store energy in pressurized water underground for months at a time.

Why air-conditioning is the wrong climate villain.

Her computations allow physicians to more quickly diagnose and treat life-threatening genetic diseases.

Sneha Goenka is one of MIT Technology Review's 2025 Innovators Under 35. Meet the rest of this year's honorees. 

Up to a quarter of children entering intensive care have undiagnosed genetic conditions. To be treated properly, they must first get diagnoses—which means having their genomes sequenced. This process typically takes up to seven weeks. Sadly, that's often too slow to save a critically ill child.

Hospitals may soon have a faster option, thanks to a groundbreaking system built in part by Sneha Goenka, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton—and MIT Technology Review's 2025 Innovator of the Year. 

Five years ago, Goenka and her colleagues designed a rapid-sequencing pipeline that can provide a genetic diagnosis in less than eight hours. Goenka's software computations and hardware architectures were critical to speeding up each stage of the process. 

“Her work made everyone realize that genome sequencing is not only for research and medical application in the future but can have immediate impact on patient care,” says Jeroen de Ridder, a professor at UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, who has developed an ultrafast sequencing tool for cancer diagnosis. 

Ancient DNA is telling us more and more about humans and environments long past. Could it also help rescue the future?

Now, as cofounder and scientific lead of a new company, she is working to make that technology widely available to patients around the world.

Goenka grew up in Mumbai, India. Her mother was an advocate for women's education, but as a child, Goenka had to fight to persuade other family members to let her continue her studies. She moved away from home at 15 to attend her final two years of school and enroll in a premier test-­preparation academy in Kota, Rajasthan. Thanks to that education, she passed what she describes as “one of the most competitive exams in the world,” to get into the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. 

Once admitted to a combined bachelor's and master's program in electrical engineering, she found that “it was a real boys' club.” But Goenka excelled in developing computer architecture systems that accelerate computation. As an undergraduate, she began applying those skills to medicine, driven by her desire to “have real-world impact”—in part because she had seen her family struggle with painful uncertainty after her brother was born prematurely when she was eight years old. 

While working on a PhD in electrical engineering at Stanford, she turned her focus to evolutionary and clinical genomics. One day a senior colleague, Euan Ashley, presented her with a problem. He said, “We want to see how fast we can make a genetic diagnosis. If you had unlimited funds and resources, just how fast do you think you could make the compute?”

A genetic diagnosis starts with a blood sample, which is prepped to extract the DNA—a process that takes about three hours. Next that DNA needs to be “read.” One of the world's leading long-read sequencing technologies, developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, can generate highly detailed raw data of an individual's genetic code in about an hour and a half. Unfortunately, processing all this data to identify mutations can take another 21 hours. Shipping samples to a central lab and figuring out which mutations are of interest often leads the process to stretch out to weeks. 

Goenka saw a better way: Build a real-time system that could “stream” the sequencing data, analyzing it as it was being generated, like streaming a film on Netflix rather than downloading it to watch later.

To do this, she designed a cloud computing architecture to pull in more processing power. Goenka's first challenge was to increase the speed at which her team could upload the raw data for processing, by streamlining the requests between the sequencer and the cloud to avoid unnecessary “chatter.” She worked out the exact number of communication channels needed—and created algorithms that allowed those channels to be reused in the most efficient way.

The next challenge was “base calling”—converting the raw signal from the sequencing machine into the nucleotide bases A, C, T, and G, the language that makes up our DNA. Rather than using a central node to orchestrate this process, which is an inefficient, error-prone approach, Goenka wrote software to automatically assign dozens of data streams directly from the sequencer to dedicated nodes in the cloud.

Meet the rest of this year's Innovators Under 35.

Then, to identify mutations, the sequences were aligned for comparison with a reference genome. She coded a custom program that triggers alignment as soon as base calling finishes for one batch of sequences while simultaneously initiating base calling for the next batch, thus ensuring that the system's computational resources are used efficiently.

Add all these im­­prove­­ments together, and Goenka's approach reduced the total time required to analyze a genome for mutations from around 20 hours to 1.5 hours. Finally, the team worked with genetic counselors and physicians to create a filter that identified which mutations were most critical to a person's health, and that set was then given a final manual curation by a genetic specialist. These final stages take up to three hours. The technology was close to being fully operational when, suddenly, the first patient arrived. 

When 13-year-old Matthew was flown to Stanford's children's hospital in 2021, he was struggling to breathe and his heart was failing. Doctors needed to know whether the inflammation in his heart was due to a virus or to a genetic mutation that would necessitate a transplant.  

His blood was drawn on a Thursday. The transplant committee made its decisions on Fridays. “It meant we had a small window of time,” says Goenka.

Goenka was in Mumbai when the sequencing began. She stayed up all night, monitoring the computations. That was when the project stopped being about getting faster for the sake of it, she says: “It became about ‘How fast can we get this result to save this person's life?'”

The results revealed a genetic mutation that explained Matthew's condition, and he was placed on the transplant list the next day. Three weeks later, he received a new heart. “He's doing great now,” Goenka says.

Shan built Glaze and Nightshade, two tools that help artists protect their copyright.

So far, Goenka's technology has been tested on 26 patients, including Matthew. Her pipeline is “directly affecting the medical care of newborns in the Stanford intensive care units,” Ashley says.

Now she's aiming for even broader impact—Goenka and her colleagues are laying the groundwork for a startup that they hope will bring the technology to market and make sure it reaches as many patients as possible. Meanwhile, she has been refining the computational pipeline, reducing the time to diagnosis to about six hours.

The demand is clear, she says: “In an in-depth study involving more than a dozen laboratory directors and neonatologists, every respondent stressed urgency. One director put it succinctly: ‘I need this platform today—preferably yesterday.'”

Goenka is also developing software to make the technology more inclusive. The reference genome is skewed toward people of European descent. The Human Pangenome Project is an international collaboration to create reference genomes from more diverse populations, which Goenka aims to use to personalize her team's filters, allowing them to flag mutations that may be more prevalent in the population to which a patient belongs.

Since seeing her work, Goenka's extended family has become more appreciative of her education and career. “The entire family is very proud about the impact I've made,” she says.

When it comes to cutting out annoying outside noise, there is no brand in history that has denatured more decibels than Bose. The pioneers of noise-canceling haven't been without challengers in recent years, including Sony, Apple, and others, but Bose has maintained the crown for generation after generation. Perhaps no product showcases this iterative talent more than its latest earbuds, the QuietComfort Ultra 2.

There wasn't anything wrong with the first pair. I liked their ergonomic fit, excellent noise reduction, and bold low end, not to mention their excellent microphones, angled toward your mouth in an homage to Apple's popular AirPods Pro.

With the new QC Ultra 2, we get wireless charging, more customizable sound, better immersive audio, and improved noise reduction. As far as I'm concerned, if you're a business traveler or someone who wants a compact pair of headphones that truly removes the sound of the world around you, these are—once again—the best you can buy.

I find it very hard to fault Bose for its rubber-stamped design approach; the previous pair were very comfortable and functioned extremely well. The slight changes that appear on the new model are welcome, and I'm not mad at the lack of physical changes.

You now get wireless charging in the clamshell case and a guard to prevent earwax buildup, and you can toggle the included touch controls in the app, which is very helpful when doing activities where you might brush your ear.

Places I don't find improvements include the weight (the new buds are about a gram heavier but still perfectly fine in your ears) and battery life (the new buds have the same six hours with ANC on, 24 hours in the case as the old model). Bose has even opted for the same drivers in this new generation of buds, with slight tuning adjustments that I'll get into in a bit.

If you're new to the world of wireless earbuds or are coming from a more basic pair, the amount of customization that you can do with Bose's latest buds can feel daunting. You can choose various “modern traditional” adjustments like EQ and noise canceling/transparency modes, but the buds also allow you to dial in two kinds of immersive 3D upscaling (one for staying in place, one for while you move around), among other wild and fantastical new settings that take advantage of modern processors and machine learning tech.

When you put on the new QC Ultra 2, Bose uses a welcome chime as a sort of calibration tool, listening to the chirps and adjusting the sound profile and ANC response to the actual shape of your ear canals.

That's wild technology to just implement without end users even noticing, and it's a testament to Bose engineers' commitment to delivering the best noise reduction and sound quality possible, flashy physical changes or not.

One other favorite was the Aware mode, which lets you hear the outside world but with loud spikes in sound smoothed out; great for folks who get jumpy at loud noises.

The new buds may not get new drivers, but improved processing and adjustments to tuning make them stand out as immersive and excellent when listening with noise canceling on or off (or any of the myriad in-between settings Bose offers).

They don't overcompress content like some modern earbuds can—they don't make quiet sounds too loud, they're good enough to reveal them at the right volume. The subtle count-in on Charlotte Cornfield's cover of “You Can Have It All,” for example, sneaks in at an appropriate whisper just before a round kick-drum punch and the wide guitars, keyboards, bongos, and cymbal swells of the song take over.

Lower-quality recordings like Cleveland Francis' powerful “Hot Sun” gain gravitas and focus, with the opaque tape-y midrange feeling more like a blessing than a curse, and doing the iconic performance a clear service.

I recently discovered Chicago cosmic country band Tobacco City and have been really enjoying the way songs like “Autumn” mix guitars. There aren't a pair of buds that reveal the wide stereo acoustic and electric guitars as well as the QC Ultra 2. The strings feel like they're hanging out of my ears like some heavy '70s earrings.

This type of detail is best when noise canceling is engaged, but they remain pretty well balanced with ambient sound piped in, or with noise canceling disengaged entirely, which speaks highly of Bose's commitment to consistency across extremely varied listening conditions.

The sound reduction itself is wildly good for a pair of earbuds, slightly besting the previous pair all around. You can barely hear even tough-to-tame high frequencies like keyboard clicks or the high-pitched overtones of a Weedwacker, and HVAC sounds and other low-frequency noises all but disappear completely. The Sony WF-1000XM5 model, which is probably the closest direct competitor, sounds slightly better overall, but these best them on sound reduction. Add that to the other features and excellent sound quality, and I found the QC Ultra 2s to basically be perfect everyday buds. The only reason I'd choose the Sony model over these is if I had smaller ears or wanted a slightly smaller charging case.

As far as cutting noise, the QC Ultra 2 act as the perfect foil to my toddler's enthusiastic background screams while I'm working on a draft, and they also let me listen for her and her mom when they pull in from day care. I use them when I mow the lawn and also when I go to the grocery store and might want to chat with a random neighbor. On calls, they're as good or better than the last pair, with mics that pick up my voice but seem to magically reject unwanted background noise like some kind of anti-HVAC Gandalf.

That's Bose for you. The brand is owned by MIT and has a very smart CEO, and lately it shows. I am sure it will have its fair share of faulty products in the future—frankly, I hope that it remains bold enough to do so. There are excellent pairs from Sony, Apple, and others, but these new earbuds are the top of the noise-reduction pile.

New research indicates that many patients who undergo surgery with the intent to cure early-stage cancer continue or start opioid prescriptions in the year following surgery. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Pain management is essential during cancer care, but prescription opioid practices associated with cancer treatment may lead to unsafe long-term opioid use and adverse outcomes such as opioid use disorder and opioid overdose. To assess the situation, investigators examined rates of new persistent opioid use in the year following surgery for stage 0 to 3 cancers among 9,213 U.S. Veterans who were opioid-naïve (not on prescribed opioids the year prior to their cancer diagnosis).

The team found that potentially dangerous co-prescription of opioid and benzodiazepine (a central nervous system depressant that treats anxiety, insomnia, and seizures and should not be combined with opioids) medications occurred in 366 (4.0%) Veterans during follow-up. Persistent opioid use occurred in 981 (10.6%). A higher intensity of exposure to opioid prescriptions during treatment was associated with these outcomes. People with a prior history of chronic pain, greater comorbidities, lower socioeconomic status, and who received adjuvant chemotherapy were at especially high risk of opioid use in the year after surgery.

Minimizing opioid exposure associated with cancer treatment while providing effective pain control will decrease long-term health risks among cancer survivors. This is important as many patients are living longer after a cancer diagnosis and treatment."

Clinical data presented today demonstrates the combination of tarlatamab with anti-PD-L1 therapy as first-line maintenance has an acceptable safety profile and resulted in unprecedented overall survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).

K.G. Paulson, MD, Providence-Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, Wash., presented new safety and efficacy data from the phase 1b DeLLphi-303 trial evaluating tarlatamab in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy as first-line maintenance treatment for ES-SCLC at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in Barcelona, Spain.

Tarlatamab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®) immunotherapy designed to direct cytotoxic T cells to target and destroy cancer cells expressing delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3). Previous studies have shown tarlatamab prolongs overall survival in the second-line SCLC setting. In the DeLLphi-303 trial, investigators evaluated tarlatamab's safety and efficacy in the first-line maintenance setting in combination with either atezolizumab or durvalumab.

The phase 1b trial enrolled 88 patients with ES-SCLC who had completed 4–6 cycles of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy and anti-PD-L1 (unless unavailable) without disease progression. Within 8 weeks of the start of their last chemo-immunotherapy cycle, patients began maintenance treatment with tarlatamab (10 mg IV every two weeks) in combination with either atezolizumab (1680 mg IV every four weeks) or durvalumab (1500 mg IV every four weeks) until disease progression.

After a median follow-up of 18.4 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 25.3 months (95% CI, 20.3–not reached), and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.5–9.0). The most common tarlatamab-related adverse event was cytokine release syndrome, occurring in 56% of patients-predominantly grade 1 in severity. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 6% of patients. Importantly, treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events decreased over time, demonstrating long-term tolerability.

The combination of tarlatamab with anti-PD-L1 therapy as first-line maintenance demonstrates a manageable safety profile and unprecedented overall survival in this patient population. These results support further evaluation of this combination in the active phase 3 DeLLphi-305 trial (NCT06211036) as a promising therapeutic strategy in first-line ES-SCLC."

A multi-center, randomized phase III trial has found that a three-week hypofractionated radiotherapy (HypoRT) schedule with concurrent chemotherapy provides similar survival outcomes and reduced toxicity compared to the standard six-week conventional fractionated radiotherapy (ConvRT) schedule for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC).

The results were presented today at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC).

In hypofractionated radiotherapy for lung cancer treatment, clinicians deliver fewer radiation treatments (fractions) at higher doses per session compared to standard radiotherapy schedules.

The study, conducted across 16 hospitals in China, randomized 530 patients to receive either HypoRT (45 Gy in 15 daily fractions over 3 weeks) or ConvRT (60 Gy in 30 daily fractions over 6 weeks), both given with concurrent cisplatin/carboplatin-etoposide chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 43.4 months, median overall survival (OS) was 40.2 months in the HypoRT arm and 47.9 months in the ConvRT arm (HR=1.04; 95% CI, 0.81–1.33). Progression-free survival was also similar between the groups.

Patients receiving HypoRT experienced significantly fewer severe treatment-related adverse events including lower rates of hematologic toxicity, lymphopenia, and radiation pneumonitis. Acute grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 48.7% of HypoRT patients compared to 67.7% in the ConvRT group.

Our findings suggest that hypofractionated radiotherapy can provide a shorter, more convenient treatment course with fewer side effects while maintaining comparable survival outcomes to conventional radiotherapy. This approach could be an important option for patients, especially in settings where reducing treatment time and toxicity is a priority."

Nan Bi, MD, The National Cancer Center of China/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing

The investigators note that further research is warranted to explore HypoRT in combination with immunotherapy given its potential immune-sparing benefits.

In a landmark study of Hispanic and Latino adults, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have identified a link between self-reported cognitive decline and blood-based biomarkers, which could pave the way for a simple blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This approach could be faster, less-invasive and more affordable than existing screening tools. The results are published in JAMA Network Open.

We need ways to identify underlying neurodegenerative diseases earlier in patients with cognitive symptoms. This study highlights the promise of blood-based biomarkers as a more accessible and scalable tool for understanding cognitive decline, particularly in populations that have been underserved by traditional methods."

Freddie Márquez, Ph.D., corresponding author, postdoctoral scholar, Department of Neurosciences, UC San Diego School of Medicine

There is currently only one blood test approved by the Food and Drug Administration to assist in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. While this test, the Lumipulse G pTau217/Aβ42 plasma ratio, can detect proteins associated with Alzheimer's in the blood, it is currently very expensive and only available in specialized care settings. Whether or not blood can be reliably used for early Alzheimer's detection on a larger scale is still unknown.

To help answer this question, the researchers used data from the Study of Latinos–Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging. This clinical study assessed neurocognition in a subset of participants from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, the largest, most comprehensive long-term study of Hispanic and Latino health and disease in the United States.

"Hispanic and Latino adults are thought to be more likely to get Alzheimer's and related dementias, and this group is projected to have the largest increases in disease prevalence over the coming decades," said senior author Hector M. González, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine. "Despite this, they're still significantly underrepresented in Alzheimer's and dementia research, which is something our study aimed to address."

The researchers tested the blood of 5,712 Hispanic and/or Latino adults between the ages of 50 and 86, looking for proteins that are present in the brain in people with Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid beta and tau proteins. They also assessed participants for subjective cognitive decline, which refers to a decline in cognitive status that the individual themself perceives.

The researchers found:

In addition to providing evidence that blood-based biomarkers can be used to detect Alzheimer's and related dementias early, the researchers also note that a strength of their study is its diverse population.

"By including participants from underrepresented communities, we're able to better understand how social determinants of health and comorbidities may influence cognitive trajectories and dementia risk," added Márquez. "This makes our findings especially relevant for real-world settings."

However, the researchers also caution that it will take further research for this approach to make its way into widespread clinical practice, and that even when this happens, the test will still be just one tool in a clinician's diagnostic arsenal.

It's important to note that there's still a lot we don't know about the utility of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's detection," said Márquez. "These tests have tremendous potential, but they should complement existing approaches, not replace them."

Additional coauthors of the study include Kevin Gonzalez, Deisha F. Valencia and Natasha Z. Anita at UC San Diego, Wassim Tarraf at Wayne State University, Ariana M. Stickel and Linda C. Gallo at San Diego State University, Daniela Sotres-Alvarez and Haibo Zhou at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Bonnie E. Levin and Zachary T. Goodman at University of Miami, Michael A. Yassa at UC Irvine, Martha Daviglus and Amber Pirzada at University of Illinois at Chicago and Bharat Thyagarajan at University of Minnesota.

This study was funded, in part, by grants from the National Institute on Aging (R01AG075758). The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is a collaborative study supported by contracts from the NHLBI to the University of North Carolina (grant Nos.

Interim results from the NADIM ADJUVANT Phase III trial, led by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (GECP), suggest that adjuvant chemo-immunotherapy may reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with completely resected stage IB–IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.

Despite complete surgical resection (R0), early-stage NSCLC carries a substantial risk of recurrence and remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality.

The study, presented today at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC), is the first randomized Phase III trial to examine chemo-immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting, building on perioperative evidence from the earlier NADIM and NADIM II studies.

Between January 2021 and December 2022, 206 patients from 30 hospitals across Spain were randomized 1:1 to receive either adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC5 plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m² every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) followed by observation (control arm) or the same chemotherapy plus nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (experimental arm). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and safety. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed using circulating tumor DNA (Guardant Reveal).

Mariano Provencio, MD, PhD, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, reported that median DFS was not reached in either arm after a median follow-up of 34 months and the DFS first quartile was 30.98 months (experimental) vs. 17.01 months (control). The three-year relapse rate was 26.7% (experimental) vs. 40.1% (control).

Dr. Provencio also reported that the postoperative MRD associated with significantly worse DFS in the experimental arm (HR = 5.7, p = 0.045) and grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events: 26.2% (experimental) vs. 14.5% (control) during adjuvant phase.

The interim results of NADIM ADJUVANT suggest that adding nivolumab to adjuvant chemotherapy can reduce recurrence risk and may offer meaningful clinical benefit for patients with completely resected stage IB–IIIA NSCLC. Further follow-up will be essential to confirm long-term efficacy."

Patients diagnosed with recurrent or progressive extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) may benefit from treatment with ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7-H3–directed antibody–drug conjugate, according to data presented today at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in Barcelona, Spain.

New data from the Phase 2 IDeate-Lung01 trial in 137 patients who had received ≥1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy showed a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 48.2% and a disease control rate of 87.6%, according to results presented by Myung-Ju Ahn, MD, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Patients with ES-SCLC face poor prognoses and have limited treatment options. B7-H3 is overexpressed in all subtypes of SCLC, and its overexpression is associated with worse clinical outcomes, making it an attractive target for novel therapies. This analysis of IDeate-Lung01 included patients treated with I-DXd 12 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks during the dose optimization and extension parts of the study.

At the March 3, 2025 data cutoff, 137 patients had received I-DXd after one (23.4%), two (54.7%), or three (21.9%) prior lines of systemic therapy. After a median duration of follow-up of 12.8 months, median duration of response was 5.3 months, and median time to response was 1.4 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.9 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 10.3 months. Clinical benefit was observed regardless of platinum sensitivity or number of prior treatments. For example, among the second-line subgroup (n=32), ORR was 56.3% and PFS and OS were numerically longer than in the overall population.

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 89.8% of patients, with 36.5% of patients experiencing a TRAE of grade 3 or higher, and 4.4% of patients experiencing grade 5 TRAEs. Adjudicated treatment-related interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis occurred in 17 patients, of which 6 cases were grade ≥3 severity. Safety findings were consistent with prior reports, with no new safety signals observed.

These results demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of ifinatamab deruxtecan in patients with ES-SCLC population who have a substantial unmet need. The manageable safety profile and high response rates support further investigation of I-DXd[RL1] in small cell lung cancer."

Uric acid builds up in the blood when the body cannot excrete it efficiently, leading to painful gout attacks, kidney stones, and other complications. Current treatments often rely on drugs that block uric acid production, but these can have side effects and do not work for everyone.

For many years, uric acid degradation is known as occurring mainly through an oxidative pathway, in which uricase enzymes use oxygen to break the purine ring and convert uric acid into allantoin. Humans and higher primates lack functional uricase, which is why they are particularly prone to uric acid accumulation and gout.A new study published in Life Metabolism reports an alternative "reductive pathway" that functions without oxygen. In this route, uric acid is first reduced to a newly identified metabolite, "yanthine", and then further broken down by a sequence of reductive dearomatization and ring-cleaving reactions, ultimately yielding small molecules such as pyruvate and ammonia. This discovery revises the long-standing view of purine catabolism and highlights the metabolic versatility of gut bacteria in anaerobic environments.Importantly, the study also detected "yanthine" circulating in human blood, with significantly higher levels in patients with gout compared with healthy individuals. This suggests that "yanthine" could serve as a biomarker for diagnosing or monitoring uric acid-related disorders. To explore therapeutic potential, the team engineered a probiotic strain of Escherichia coli to constitutively activate the reductive pathway. In a uricase-deficient mouse model of hyperuricemia, oral administration of this engineered strain significantly lowered blood uric acid levels, alleviated kidney injury, and remained stably colonized in the gut.Together, these findings establish the reductive uric acid pathway as a major addition to the known repertoire of microbial metabolism. The work not only advances fundamental understanding of purine degradation but also points towards practical applications in biomarker discovery and the development of probiotic-based strategies to help control gout.

A novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), iza-bren (BL-B01D1), demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy results in previously treated patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to findings presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC).

Iza-bren is a first-in-class EGFR x HER3 bispecific ADC linked to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (Ed-04). The drug was evaluated in two Phase I/II studies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Patients received a range of doses on different schedules, including day 1 and day 8 every 3-week cycle (D1D8 Q3W) and day 1 every 3-week cycle (D1 Q3W).

Among the 171 EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients, 50 patients who received prior TKI and chemo-naïve were treated at 2.5 mg/kg D1D8 Q3W. In this subgroup, the objective response rate (ORR) was 66.0%, the confirmed ORR (cORR) was 56.0%, the median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 12.5 months, the median duration of response (mDOR) was 13.7 months, and the median overall survival (mOS) was not reached with a 12-mo OS rate of 80.3%.

According to the lead investigator Dr. Wenfeng Fang from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China, the safety profile was manageable. The most frequent hematologic treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were anemia (90.6%), leukopenia (80.7%), neutropenia (78.4%), and thrombocytopenia (74.3%). The most frequent non-hematologic TRAEs included nausea, alopecia, and asthenia. Only 1.2% of patients were discontinued due to TRAEs, and no treatment-related death was observed.

This early data suggests iza-bren may offer a promising treatment option for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Phase III registrational study of iza-bren as monotherapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC after progression on a third generation TKI is ongoing in China."

Adding ivonescimab, a first-in-class bispecific antibody targeting both PD-1 and VEGF, to chemotherapy significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations whose disease progressed on third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Results from the global Phase 3 HARMONi trial were presented today by Jonathan Goldman, UCLA Health, Los Angeles at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC).

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 438 patients worldwide, including 38% from North America and Europe, with a median age of 62 years. Nearly one-quarter (24.7%) had brain metastases at study entry. Patients received ivonescimab (20 mg/kg) or placebo in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin for four cycles, followed by maintenance therapy.

At the primary analysis (N=345; median follow-up 22.3 months), ivonescimab plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 48% compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.41–0.66; P<0.001). Median PFS was 6.8 months (95% CI: 5.7–7.1) versus 4.4 months (95% CI: 4.1–5.5). The PFS benefit was consistent across all predefined subgroups, including patients with brain metastases (HR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.20–0.57) and Western patients.

At final overall survival (OS) analysis (median follow-up 29.7 months), median OS was 16.8 months with ivonescimab versus 14.0 months with chemotherapy alone (HR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.62–1.01; P=0.0570). The overall response rate was higher in the ivonescimab group (44.7% vs. 34.2%), and intracranial PFS was also improved.

Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 50.0% of patients receiving ivonescimab and 42.2% in the control arm, most commonly laboratory abnormalities. VEGF-related events, including reversible hypertension and proteinuria, were more frequent with ivonescimab but generally manageable. Treatment-related deaths were rare (1.8% vs. 2.3%).

Ivonescimab plus chemotherapy provided a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival while maintaining a favorable safety profile in this difficult-to-treat patient population. The benefits were seen regardless of brain metastases status or geographic region and were supported by a positive overall survival trend."

A new study presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) validates the use of Sybil, a deep learning artificial intelligence model, for predicting future lung cancer risk in a predominantly Black population.

The study, conducted by the University of Illinois Hospital & Clinics, (UI Health), the academic health enterprise of the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), highlights Sybil's strong performance in a real-world clinical setting with racially and socioeconomically diverse patients. The Sybil Implementation Consortium comprises UIC, Mass General Brigham, Baptist Memorial Health Care, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and WellStar Health System.

While prior United States Sybil validations were conducted in cohorts that were more than 90% White, this new analysis focused on a population where 62% of participants identified as Non-Hispanic Black, 13% Hispanic, and 4% Asian. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for lung cancer risk up to six years after a single low-dose CT (LDCT) scan.

This study confirms that Sybil performs well in a racially and socioeconomically diverse setting, supporting its broader utility for lung cancer screening. It shows promise as a tool for improving early detection and addressing disparities in lung cancer outcomes."

Mary Pasquinelli, lead author, nurse practitionerand the Director of the Lung Screening Program at UI Health and member of the University of Illinois Cancer Center

Pasquinelli and her colleagues evaluated 2,092 baseline LDCTs from UI Health's lung screening program between 2014 and 2024. Of these, 68 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer, with follow-up times ranging from 0 to 10.2 years, she reported

The study found that Sybil's Area Under the Curve (AUC) performance for years one through six were as follows:

- 0.94 (1-year)

- 0.90 (2-year)

- 0.86 (3-year)

- 0.85 (4-year)

- 0.80 (5-year)

- 0.79 (6-year)

If a lung cancer screening model has an AUC of 0.94, that means there's a 94% chance the model will correctly rank a randomly chosen patient who develops cancer in the future as higher risk than a randomly chosen patient who does not develop cancer in the near future.

She reported that the results remained strong when restricted to Black participants and after excluding cancers diagnosed within three months of screening.

According to Pasquinelli, the study affirms Sybil's clinical generalizability and suggests that the model may be unbiased with respect to factors like race and ethnicity, demonstrating strong performance in underrepresented communities. The Sybil Implementation Consortium will now proceed with prospective clinical trials to integrate Sybil into real-world clinical workflows, she said.

Blood pressure matters at all ages. Children with higher blood pressure at age 7 may be at an increased risk of dying of cardiovascular disease by their mid-50s, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association's Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting is in Baltimore, September 4-7, 2025, and is the premier scientific exchange focused on recent advances in basic and clinical research on high blood pressure and its relationship to cardiac and kidney disease, stroke, obesity and genetics. The study is simultaneously published today in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.

We were surprised to find that high blood pressure in childhood was linked to serious health conditions many years later. Specifically, having hypertension or elevated blood pressure as a child may increase the risk of death by 40% to 50% over the next five decades of an individual's life. Our results highlight the importance of screening for blood pressure in childhood and focusing on strategies to promote optimal cardiovascular health beginning in childhood."

Alexa Freedman, Ph.D., lead author of the study and assistant professor, department of preventive medicine, Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago

Previous research has shown that childhood blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood, and a 2022 study found that elevated blood pressure in older children (average age of 12 years) increased the risk of cardiovascular death by middle age (average age of 46 years). The current study is the first to investigate the impact of both systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure in childhood on long-term cardiovascular death risk in a diverse group of children. Clinical practice guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend checking blood pressure at annual well-child pediatric appointments starting at age 3 years.

"The results of this study support monitoring blood pressure as an important metric of cardiovascular health in childhood," said Bonita Falkner, M.D., FAHA, an American Heart Association volunteer expert. "Moreover, the results of this study and other older child cohort studies with potential follow-up in adulthood will contribute to a more accurate definition of abnormal blood pressure and hypertension in childhood." Falkner, who was not involved in this study, is emeritus professor of pediatrics and medicine at Thomas Jefferson University.

The researchers used the National Death Index to follow up on the survival or cause of death as of 2016 for approximately 38,000 children who had their blood pressures taken at age 7 years as part of the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP), the largest U.S. study to document the influence of pregnancy and post-natal factors on the health of children. Blood pressure measured in the children at age 7 years were converted to age-, sex-, and height-specific percentiles according to the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guidelines. The analysis accounted for demographic factors as well as for childhood body mass index, to ensure that the findings were related to childhood blood pressure itself rather than a reflection of children who were overweight or had obesity.

After follow-up through an average age of 54 years, the analysis found: 

"Even in childhood, blood pressure numbers are important because high blood pressure in children can have serious consequences throughout their lives. It is crucial to be aware of your child's blood pressure readings," Freedman said.

The study has several limitations, primarily that the analysis included one, single blood pressure measurement for the children at age seven, which may not capture variability or long-term patterns in childhood blood pressure. In addition, participants in the CPP were primarily Black or white, therefore the study's findings may not be generalizable to children of other racial or ethnic groups. Also, children today are likely to have different lifestyles and environmental exposures than the children who participated in the CPP in the 1960s and 1970s.

Patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) compared to open lobectomy had a significantly improved overall survival rate, according to a meta-analysis presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC).

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is currently the most common approach to perform pulmonary lobectomy in early-stage lung cancer. Advantages include reduced pain, fewer complications, faster recovery and improved quality-of-life. The adoption of VATS lobectomy is based on proven non-oncological benefits.

According to Dr. Jacie Jiaqi Law, Royal Brompton Hospital, United Kingdom, none of the three largest contemporary randomized trials completed have been powered to detect a difference in overall or disease-free survival. Several meta-analyses of predominantly non-randomized studies have suggested a VATS approach leads to improved patient survival compared to thoracotomy, however findings are limited due to selection bias and confounding, Dr. Law reported.

To answer this important question, Dr. Law and fellow researchers sought to identify randomized trials comparing VATS and open lobectomy in early-stage lung cancer and obtain individual patient data from these trials to conduct a meta-analysis.

Of the 556 potential studies identified, only three were randomized trials that met the eligibility criteria: Bendixen et al. from Denmark (NCT01278888), Long et al. from China (NCT01102517) and Lim et al. from the United Kingdom (NCT03521375). Data on 1185 patients (586 randomized to VATS and 599 randomized to open lobectomy) was provided from the three trials.

The primary analysis indicated significantly improved overall survival for patients randomized to VATS compared to open lobectomy, pooled hazard ratio (HR) 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.96), representing a 21% reduction in the risk of death in the VATS lobectomy group. There was no difference in disease-free survival, pooled HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.75-1.12).

For the first time, we provide evidence that a simple change in surgical access to VATS reduces the overall risk of death by 21% without any compromise to disease-free survival. These results underscore the importance of prioritizing VATS when technically feasible as the access of choice for surgical resection of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer."

Rebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan's capital city that she never would have expected.

"It's a very weird time in our lives," said Kasen, executive director of the Women's Center of Greater Lansing.

Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a "Black Lives Matter" sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women's Center staff reported being harassed.

A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by "First Amendment auditors" outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said.

In many cases, extremist activities and conduct throughout the U.S. over the past few years have been driven by the deepening chasm of political partisanship and disinformation-driven rebellion against responses to the covid-19 pandemic. More recently, backlash against immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has heightened tensions.

Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Over the last several years, the group writes, the political right has increasingly shifted toward "an authoritarian, patriarchal Christian supremacy dedicated to eroding the value of inclusive democracy and public institutions."

Researchers at American University's Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, "hate is intersectional." (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL's director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of "A Minecraft Movie" prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people.

The continued escalations drove staffers at PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center to approach the problem from a different angle: Treat extremism as a public health problem. Community Advisory, Resource, and Education Centers are now operating in Lansing, Michigan, and Athens, Georgia, offering training, support, referrals, and resources to communities affected by hate, discrimination, and supremacist ideologies and to people susceptible to radicalization, with a focus on young people.

The team defines extremism as the belief that one's group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination.

Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they're on their own. (CARE receives no federal funding.)

Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center's deputy director of prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that's rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust?

They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. The objective is to equip "all levels of civil society with the skills and knowledge to recognize extremism" and to engage in conversations about addressing it, Dashtgard said.

"We're not about, 'How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?'" Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL's deputy director of regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. "Rather, 'How do you respond when your son or a member of your congregation expresses some of these extremist ideas?'"

Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted of the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, were associated with a militia group in the state. Some of the men charged in 2020 in the plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen.

The state's capital city and adjacent East Lansing, where Michigan State University is, are relatively progressive but have seen conflict.

Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer's covid lockdown directives.

Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about "how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible."

The CARE initiative reinforces such efforts. The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Among them are a parent and caregiver guide to online radicalization, a community guide to youth radicalization, and "Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- & Sexuality-Based Bigotry."

Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved.

The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one.

Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flood the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. She's a proponent of the public health approach. It's "providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward," she said. It's a way to channel energy "and feel like you can actually create change with community."

Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities.

In the small town of Howell, 40 miles southeast of Lansing, protesters waived Nazi flags outside a production of the play "The Diary of Anne Frank" at an American Legion post.

In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book "They She He Me: Free to Be!" Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. Since then, the CARE team has helped provide support to teachers there in holding conversations on contentious topics in classrooms and in dealing with skeptical parents.

"It's really important that rural communities not be left behind," Flanagan said. "They persistently are in America, and then they're often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges."

The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children's Hospital's Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City's Citizens Crime Commission.

And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism.

Pete Simi, a professor of sociology at Chapman University and a leading expert on extremism, sees a daunting task ahead, with extremism's having become more mainstream over the past 25 years. "It's just devastating," he said. "It's really startling."

Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, "I would say now it has been completely shattered." Violent extremists now feel "unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back."

"We are in a more dangerous time now than any other in my lifetime," Simi said.

The Rev. Pippin Whitaker ministers the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens in Georgia, which last year received a package of ammunition in the mail with no note included. She embraces framing extremism, and people's lack of awareness of it, as a public health issue.

"If you have a germ out there," Whitaker said, "and people aren't aware that if you wash your hands you can protect yourself, and that it's an actual problem, you won't enact basic protective behavior."

Long-term use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs may help older adults fall asleep, but new research shows they alter sleep architecture and brain activity in ways that could undermine memory and next-day functioning.

Study: Effect of chronic benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use on sleep architecture and brain oscillations in older adults with chronic insomnia. Image credit: Ground Picture/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in Sleep, a group of researchers tested whether chronic benzodiazepine (BZD) and benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use alters sleep architecture and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) oscillations in older adults with insomnia.

Insomnia affects approximately one-third of older adults, and benzodiazepines (BZDs) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs, or “Z-drugs”) are frequently prescribed. These medications can reduce sleep onset latency and improve sleep continuity, but their long-term use is associated with risks such as falls, cognitive impairment, and residual daytime sedation.

Slow-wave sleep and its associated neural oscillations are central to memory consolidation and cognitive function. Chronic sedative use may disrupt these processes, highlighting the need for further research on how specific drugs and doses affect sleep architecture and brain activity in aging populations.

Older adults aged 55-80 years were classified as good sleepers (GS), individuals with insomnia disorder (INS), or individuals with insomnia plus chronic sedative use (MED). All provided consent and completed polysomnography (PSG). Participants in MED continued their prescribed medication (BZDs or BZRAs). Sleep architecture was scored using American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) rules.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 13 scalp electrodes. Derived indices included total sleep period (TSP), total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), time in bed (TIB), sleep efficiency (SE), arousal density, and sleep fragmentation index (SFI). Spectral power was estimated with fast Fourier transformation and Welch's method and summarized as relative power in slow oscillation (SO), delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands. Spindles were detected with an algorithm; slow spindles at frontal (Fz) and fast spindles at parietal (Pz).

Slow oscillations were detected using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter; coupling between SO and spindles was quantified with phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), modulation index (MI), and preferred coupling phase (CP). Group differences were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non-parametric tests with false discovery rate control. Exploratory analyses related to medication dose (diazepam equivalents) and duration to sleep metrics were performed, and BZD versus BZRA users were compared.

The study analyzed 101 participants (mean age 66 years; 73% women): GS n=28, INS n=26, and MED n=47 taking nightly sedative-hypnotics for more than three nights per week. Compared with GS, both INS and MED showed lower sleep efficiency, more wake after sleep onset, and altered stage distribution.

Chronic medication use was linked to lighter, less restorative sleep. The MED group spent more time in stage N1 (the lightest stage of NREM sleep) and less in stage N3 (deep slow-wave NREM sleep) than both GS and INS, with stage N2 (intermediate NREM sleep) also prolonged versus INS. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration did not differ across groups, although REM latency (trend; not significant after multiple-comparison correction) tended to be longer in MED.

Fragmentation patterns differed across groups. Arousal density was higher in INS than in GS and MED, while the SFI was higher in MED than in INS, indicating more frequent transitions to lighter sleep stages.

In the spectral analysis, the MED group showed lower NREM theta power compared with GS, and lower REM theta power than GS and INS. During NREM sleep, frontal sigma power was higher and frontal low-beta power lower in MED relative to GS. The delta-to-beta ratio, an index of cortical arousal, was reduced in MED compared with both GS and INS. Analysis of discrete oscillations revealed selective changes: frontal spindle density was higher in MED than in INS, while SO density and amplitude did not differ across groups.

Critically, the temporal alignment of rhythms was altered in MED. MI was lower in MED compared with GS, and the preferred CP occurred later in MED compared with GS and INS, a profile unfavorable for memory consolidation. Within MED, higher diazepam-equivalent dose per use correlated with longer SOL and longer latencies to stages N2 and N3, and with higher NREM sigma and beta power. Longer cumulative duration of use was related to shorter parietal spindle duration.

Despite lower SE, TST was higher in MED than in GS, consistent with more time in bed. However, restorative deep sleep was reduced. After adjusting for dose, outcomes did not differ between BZDs and BZRAs.

Age was regressed out of all sleep measures, and insomnia severity scores were higher in INS and MED than in GS, with MED slightly lower than INS. No group differences were observed for SO delta or alpha power; the coupling metrics did not scale with dose. Together, the macro- and micro-level signatures indicate that chronic sedative-hypnotic use is associated with poorer sleep regulation in late life and may help to explain, though the study did not directly test, reports of next-day grogginess and cognitive decline by disrupted oscillatory coupling.

Medicine-assisted sleep is not the same as restorative sleep. In older adults with insomnia, chronic BZD and BZRA use is associated with more light sleep, less deep sleep, reduced theta activity, altered spindle dynamics, and weaker, delayed coupling between slow oscillations and spindles, mechanisms linked to memory.

These objective changes may help explain reports of next-day grogginess and cognitive decline in long-term users and support cautious, dose-aware prescribing. Expanding access to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and developing alternatives that preserve brain rhythms could improve sleep and protect cognition today.

A simple EEG scan can reveal hidden memory problems in just three minutes, giving doctors a powerful new tool to detect dementia earlier and more accurately.

Study: A passive and objective measure of recognition memory in mild cognitive impairment using Fastball memory assessment. Image credit: Svitlana Hulko/Shutterstock.com

Dementia is a contributor to disability and a leading cause of mortality. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause, accounting for 32 million cases globally. A recent paper in Brain Communications presents Fastball, a new electroencephalography (EEG) method that aims to measure recognition memory and diagnose mild cognitive impairment, an interim stage between normal cognition and dementia that is often an early manifestation of AD.

Up to 75% of dementia is caused by AD, indicating the urgent need for better and earlier diagnostic tools. These would facilitate earlier treatment and enable patients to make proper arrangements for future care once the disease progresses. Amnesia is a risk marker for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to progress to dementia.

Amnestic MCI patients mainly suffer memory loss, while non-amnestic MCI patients have standard memory despite issues with attention or visuospatial processing. The former progress to dementia at 10%-17% a year, with 38% showing signs of dementia at 2.5 years and up to 60% after four years.

Neuropsychological testing provides subjective and objective measures of general cognitive function, attention, visual recognition, and visual acuity. Biomarkers like amyloid and tau protein deposition are used for biological AD testing, but they are expensive, invasive, and restricted in availability. Unfortunately, amyloid deposition is not inevitably a sign of cognitive decline, and vice versa.

Blood biomarkers promise earlier detection of these abnormal proteins and could help predict changes in brain structure. Researchers seek reliable methods to judge cognitive function based on these brain markers.

Cognitive impairment symptoms appear only 10-20 years after amyloid-tau deposition begins to occur. Cognitive testing helps assign clinical stages, but various demographic and cultural characteristics, including education and culture, can bias the results. Language impairments make these tests even less reliable and more complicated to apply.

A sensitive and unbiased measure of cognitive function is needed, one that can be combined with amyloid-tau biomarkers to improve both early diagnosis and accurate staging of the disease. EEG directly measures brain activity during tasks that involve thought. It records alterations in AD patients compared with controls, most often in the P300 response. This brainwave signal typically appears about 300 milliseconds after a stimulus and reflects attention and memory updating processes.

Still, it is not widely adopted to diagnose or screen individual patients because of the long duration of the test and variability between subjects.

Fastball (fast periodic visual stimulation, FPVS) is an EEG method that can potentially be a sensitive, easily administered, inexpensive test for AD. The authors have previously shown its ability to identify AD patients compared to controls based on cognitive dysfunction. Fastball benefits include the short recording time, a high signal-to-noise ratio, and a wide range of data capture. It measures recognition memory passively, without needing behavioral memory responses or task comprehension.

Healthy older adults typically show impaired recollection of details but preserve familiarity, meaning they often cannot recall exact information yet still recognize a stimulus as previously encountered. Both AD and MCI patients have impaired recollection, while familiarity trends are more variable.

Subjective behavioral tests of familiarity are complex because language and related areas of cognition heavily influence them. However, amnestic MCI is more consistently associated with familiarity deficits. This area is selectively impacted in amnestic MCI patients who are developing dementia. Hence, it is vital to validate Fastball, which promises to assess recognition memory reliably.

The researchers tested amnestic dysfunction (failure of memory recall) in MCI patients. The study included 54 healthy older people and 53 MCI patients.

All participants completed a three-minute task consisting of watching images flashing by as Fastball monitored them. The EEG recorded how well they could automatically differentiate previously seen images from new, unfamiliar ones.  

For comparison, various neuropsychological tests were performed to examine whether Fastball responses were selective for memory (versus attention). All tests, including Fastball, were repeated after a year to validate Fastball's reproducibility and capture its sensitivity to reduced cognitive function after one year.

Amnestic MCI patients had reduced Fastball responses compared with non-amnestic patients and healthy older adults. Analysis of their responses showed that the alterations in Fastball responses selectively identified patients at risk of losing recognition memory.

In contrast, behavioral accuracy predicted both memory and attention performance, showing it was less selective than the EEG-based Fastball measure.  

While amnestic MCI patients had less accurate recognition responses than healthy older people, the latter were comparable to non-amnestic MCI participants. For reaction times, amnestic MCI patients were slower than both groups. In comparison, non-amnestic patients were slower than controls only in some tasks (e.g., fixation cross detection) but not in oddball recognition.

The results showed moderate-to-good test-retest reliability, with Fastball outperforming the ACE-III memory subscale in healthy controls. Fastball also picked up a trend towards lower Fastball recordings at baseline in the MCI patients who developed dementia over the follow-up year (n=6). However, the authors caution that numbers were small and too low for meaningful statistical comparison, so this cannot yet be taken as predictive, pending further follow-up.

This pilot study thus established Fastball as a method to test recognition memory in patients with cognitive impairment.

“Fastball is a viable functional biomarker that can help to advance cognitive assessment in MCI.” It is convenient, non-invasive, easy to use, inexpensive, and scalable, not requiring the patient's cooperation. The responses are reliable, with little variability across sessions.    

The authors say, “We do not propose that Fastball could, or even should, replace standard pen and paper cognitive testing. Rather we propose that an implicit neural measure has many potential practical advantages and with sufficient technological development could be delivered and interpreted as easily as an electrocardiogram, which is routinely delivered economically, at scale, with minimal training required.”      

Further follow-up is planned to establish the prognostic value for AD when Fastball is used as a baseline measure.

BioDlink announced that its self-developed bevacizumab injection biosimilar has received marketing approval from Colombia's National Institute for Surveillance of Medicines and Foods (INVIMA) and Pakistan's Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP). This development underscores its mission to improve access to critical cancer therapies worldwide.

Following GMP certification in China, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan, Kexing BioPharm, the global licensee for bevacizumab injection in emerging markets, has initiated regulatory filings in 35 countries in close collaboration with BioDlink. GMP certification in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina covers the top three most populous countries in South America, representing 71.4 % of the continent's population.

BioDlink's manufacturing facilities span 50,000 square meters and have passed antibody drug and ADC EU-QP inspection (including zero-defect) five times in the past four years. BioDlink's global-quality system is robust, delivering over 100 clinical projects with development, clinical filings, and manufacturing services worldwide, including Europe and the U.S.

Colombia and Pakistan are key pharmaceutical markets in South America and South Asia respectively. Both nations see a trend toward an increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer. The launch of bevacizumab injection seeks to lower the cost of treatment for both public health systems and patients, while maintaining rigorous global quality standards.

Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is widely used in the treatment of various cancers, including metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC). According to industry estimates, bevacizumab injection achieved global sales of USD 8.5 billion in 2023. 

Cancer incidence is rising sharply, especially colorectal cancer, which has seen a global increase in early-onset cases in middle- and low‑income countries.

With our partnership with Kexing BioPharm, we are committed to serving South American and other emerging markets and combat colorectal and lung cancers, the top two leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.”

Dr. Jun Liu, CEO and Executive Director, BioDlink

Since BioDlink signed an international commercialization agreement with Kexing BioPharm in early 2022, both parties have achieved an efficient closed-loop “R&D-manufacturing-access” model. BioDlink focuses on ensuring international manufacturing and supply chain robustness, while Kexing BioPharm leverages its global channels to drive localized market access efficiently.

BioDlink and Kexing BioPharm share an operational philosophy of “leading with quality and building on compliance” to focus on emerging markets such as South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa. Both companies look forward to deepening their global collaboration to fulfill a shared mission of advancing global healthcare.

Kyle Bonn

As the 2026 FIFA World Cup nears and the USMNT continues to stumble with preparation time running out fast, head coach Mauricio Pochettino has remained calm and confident.

That does not, however, mean Pochettino's approach lacks fight.

Ahead of the team's second September friendly against Japan on Tuesday, the 53-year-old went to war with critics who have increased in size and volume as the adverse results stack up.

Fans and media have expressed frustration with the recent run of poor results, the latest a 2-0 friendly defeat to South Korea. Despite the limited preparation time ahead of next summer's massive tournament on home soil, the head man has left many of the national team's most prominent players off the roster in consecutive international windows, preferring to call up fringe players with little chance of making the World Cup squad.

Buried within praise of the upcoming game's setting in Columbus, Pochettino hinted early in his press conference that he was aware of the recent noise about his approach. "We know how the fans are here [in Columbus], and because I listen and I hear a lot of things."

That was a foreshadow of what would come over the next 20 minutes, as Pochettino would repeatedly field unrelated questions and spin his answer into repeated offensives on his warpath against the recent criticism.

When asked for an update on the fitness of defender Chris Richards, who came off the bench against South Korea on the weekend, Pochettino began his assault. "People sometimes create debate and talk with no sense," Pochettino said. "This national team and this country has qualified already for the World Cup, so the important thing is to apply common sense. If people want to talk about bullsh*t, they can talk about bullsh*t, but we feel the responsibility to provide the whole group of players ... we need to give the priority for how he feels. Because if not, if we take a risk in a friendly game, we maybe create a big problem.

"I think the same people that debate about why he's not playing [also debate] why he's playing. The important thing is that we have a plan, we know what we are doing, we have experience. The important thing is to provide the players the possibility to arrive at the World Cup in the best condition.

"If we only work with a few players, but the moment after they arrive some guy arrives with an injury and cannot play at the World Cup, it's not the moment to make tests or give the opportunity to get experience. That is why you cannot be surprised if tomorrow I do some changes.

"Sometimes people want to talk only to analyze the result and want to be negative, and I think it's a little bit shameful. We need to be positive, because we need to be all together, because the country deserves to be on one side to arrive at the World Cup in the best condition to be a team competitive to make proud our fans. That is the most important thing."

At this point, Pochettino had the attention of the room, but he was far from done making his point. After fielding a question about when decisions will be made regarding trimming the roster, he continued.

"We are not amateurs, we are professional people who are looking at all types of situations," Pochettino insisted. "You need to bring some players with the possibility to give game time. You ask me 'why?' Because if [Malik] Tillman is injured...who is going to replace him? That is why now is the moment.

"Of course I want to win, I want to win against South Korea, and I want to win tomorrow against Japan. But at the same time, we need to provide time to players who maybe have no experience. And maybe we can struggle and make mistakes and compromise the result. Of course I want to win, but also we need to think in the process and give the possibility to players to perform in a difficult situation, because Tillman needs to know there's another guy behind him pushing.

"We are in a place now in USA that I think we need help. We need help because we don't have official games. You saw in the Gold Cup how competitive the team is when we are together 40 days working together. That is why we were happy, that was the plan, that is the plan, and we delivered the plan. We played with players maybe you didn't think one day could perform in the national team, but we are here because something needs to change. That is why less than one year ago they come and offered me in charge of the national team, because we are different."

"We are here because we want to share with you, we want to learn from you, we don't want to teach anyone, only that we have our plan, and that is the process. Of course I want to win all the games, but if we cannot win, we need to be positive in knowing that we are doing things very important for arriving to the World Cup in the best condition."

Phew. Take a breath, because there's a whole lot more. Pochettino, nearly always a calm and collected figure, was clearly agitated by the recent criticism. While maintaining a calm overall demeanor at the stand, the USMNT boss had palpable frustration in his words.

When asked about what progress he's seen from the team, he took it as a springboard to continue his rant. To illustrate his next point, he recalled the woeful disappointment in the CONCACAF Nations League finals earlier this year. "You remember March, no? I think we all remember March. And I think you were all in agreement with me with the roster, with everything. But I think that was a wakeup call because we needed to start a different process and different approach.

"That is why all that happened helped to realize that the most important thing is the national team, the federation, and this one —" Pochettino said as he pointed to the USA crest on his shirt, "is more important than any single name. We are all important, but that is the most important thing, and we need to work all for this. And I think why we are progressing, is because that is the mentality shown in the players.

"The players that we call all want to come and make the effort. We are intentional enough to call the players not to take the risks — like we were talking about, Malik Tillman — we talked to him and said 'you need to understand.' Malik is disappointed that he is not coming, and that is a signal that we are doing something good. That is, for me, the most important thing. The players that are not playing need to push to play, they need to keep pushing so they can have the possibility to come again. That competition will be very healthy for the organization. That is the plan."

Pochettino then said something interesting. Something very different from how he portrayed the plan in the past.

When asked about their preparation for the Japan match, Pochettino said they are trialing a number of different tactical approaches to see which works the best.

"We have not too much time to work, and I think it's important to use these games like a training session. That is important for you to know, it's like a training session. We need to put into practice things that will be important for the future of the team."

That is a very different tune from the narrative Pochettino had pushed in the recent past. In his introductory press conference, for example, the U.S. coach said that it was instilled in him during his playing days that there was no such thing as a friendly. "For me, it's not a friendly game. For me, it's official. When I was a player with Argentina, Copa America, the World Cup, or a friendly it was the same, to show that you are the best and win the game for your country."

Veteran players have since repeated that mantra on multiple occasions, as Tim Ream did during January camp earlier this year ahead of a friendly against Costa Rica. "Listen, these games against CONCACAF opponents are always tough, they're always physical and are never straightforward and easy games," Ream said. "So we're expecting a...there's friendlies but there's no such thing as friendlies."

Yet only months later, Pochettino had reversed course, talking about upcoming friendlies like they are little more than practice for the real thing on the horizon. The idea that it was acceptable to "compromise the result" to achieve a greater good was a complete 180 from his previous narrative, presenting a highly confusing and contradictory message.

Yet still, Pochettino was not done just yet. In fact, he was only just getting started, next taking aim at those who have criticized his and the federation's approach.

"We are a very strong group now," Pochettino said. "People who talk need to think a little bit, there always can be another way to assess and analyze things, not only being negative.

"Being critical is one thing, because I like the critiques when you say things that are right, you know? But when it's critiques for critiques, it's not damaging me, you are damaging your country. We need to be all in behind them to provide the best platform for them to perform."

Pochettino would ultimately wrap up his point when asked about his experience in the 2002 World Cup as a player for Argentina.

"I want to win because I am competitive. I know how we are moving in this work, if you win it's easy to say 'oh very good, very nice, good decision' how good we are. But if you lose but you play well, yes, no, this, criticize everything. If you come from a long time and say ok, that process, enough that you are not getting results, ok maybe you can say it's wrong the plan or the process is not doing well. But when it's a very short space of time, with all the circumstances that happen, it's important to translate the idea that of course we want to win, it is the process that will sustain in 10 months to arrive with the possibility to win at the World Cup."

That's all fine and dandy for now. Whether Pochettino likes it or not, the results at the World Cup will be judged not on the process but the result, and only the result. Results which will take place in a very short space of time.

The process will be judged on the results, not the other way around — will they have sufficient time to shift their mindset from process-oriented to results-oriented? Or will they arrive at the World Cup lacking the necessary knowledge of how to dig deep and just get a result?

Until then, fans are resigned to accept his process as the way forward. Next summer's achievements will anoint or condemn that process, and Pochettino has put himself squarely behind that judgement.

Despite being the favorites to win the 2025 Leagues Cup, Inter Miami were soundly defeated by the Seattle Sounders. This marked Javier Mascherano's first defeat in a final in his career as head coach. In addition, he faces a tough challenge ahead, as Luis Suarez will not only receive the Leagues Cup sanction after his altercate with Sounders assistant Steven Lenhart, but the MLS has also taken strong action due to his behavior.

According to Tom Bogert, MLS has suspended Luis Suarez for an additional three games following his altercation with Steven Lenhart. The Inter Miami star will miss matches against Charlotte FC, Seattle Sounders, and DC United, creating further challenges for his team in the Eastern Conference.

Inter Miami stars Sergio Busquets and Tomas Aviles received suspensions of two and three games in the Leagues Cup, respectively. However, MLS chose not to extend these suspensions to league play, allowing Lionel Messi's team to breathe a sigh of relief regarding their potential absences.

Following a stringent sanction by the Leagues Cup, Luis Suarez could miss up to nine games with Inter Miami. However, the veteran's future with the team remains uncertain as his contract, expiring in December 2025, has not been renewed. In case he chooses to retire, he may not serve the full suspension since he wouldn't participate in next edition Leagues Cup, where the sanction applies.

Luis Suarez complains after a foul.

Luis Suarez has consistently ranked among the most influential players in modern soccer. Over his impressive 16-year professional career, he has netted 565 goals, cementing his status as a Barcelona legend and a pivotal figure in Liverpool's storied history. Yet, his legacy also carries the weight of numerous absences owing to sporting sanctions.

Remarkably, Suarez has missed 67 games due to suspensions, as reported by Transfermarkt. This statistic is noteworthy, surpassing the number of matches he has missed because of injuries, which have increasingly hindered him in recent years, totaling 62 games.

Hello! The international break will come to a close with another round of matches at the beginning of this week, offering, among other things, a chance for the U.S. men's national team to bounce back after yet another disappointing outing on Saturday. I'm Pardeep Cattry with the latest.

The U.S. men's national team marked their return to play with a 2-0 loss to South Korea on Saturday, with Mauricio Pochettino notching his seventh defeat in 17 matches since taking the job roughly a year ago.

As has frequently been the case, Pochettino went with a lineup that featured a mix of established players and fresh faces in the hopes of learning something new about the player pool, but Saturday's loss was the latest in a familiar stretch of unexciting results. The USMNT were doomed by defensive disorganization on both goals, thanks in part to a rough outing for center back Tristan Blackmon on his debut and right back Sergino Dest in his first international game since sustaining an ACL injury last year.

The game also offered a stark reminder that some of the issues predate Pochettino, who has just one win in seven games against opponents ranked in FIFA's top 30. His predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, had only five wins against top 20 opponents, and four of them came against Mexico, while the USMNT have been outscored 11-2 in their last seven matches against top 25 teams. It raises questions about whether or not the team have gotten better under Pochettino and has landed them in 26th place in James Benge's latest World Cup power rankings, one spot below fellow World Cup co-hosts Canada.

Pochettino's experimental version of the USMNT will get one final run out on Tuesday in Columbus against Japan, the head coach deeming next month's matches as his deadline to select a core group of players – even if that means going down to the wire.

Mauricio Pochettino may have given a handful of fringe USMNT players a chance to impress on Saturday, but like several before them, few really made a case for themselves against South Korea. Tuesday's friendly against Japan marks one final opportunity to pull off that feat, even if it means long-lasting lineup questions – some of which existed well before Pochettino showed up – are up in the air for another few weeks.

Considering the defensive issues that led the USMNT to concede two first-half goals against South Korea, personnel changes may not be the only thing in store. Pochettino opted for a back three midway through the second half, bringing on Chris Richards to join starters Tim Ream and Blackmon, a tactic that the head coach teased could come back in the future.

Who starts in those defensive positions, though, is another question entirely. The USMNT's backline always looks its best when Richards is on the field, the Crystal Palace defender missing out on a starting role with a small issue he had before arriving to camp. The lineup, in all honesty, might be full of question marks – Dest is skilled with the ball at his feet and in attack but has defensive lapses, while no one has convincingly stepped in while fellow wingback Antonee Robinson is out of the group.

That's all without discussing the No. 9 role, which has perhaps been the greatest of all question marks in the USMNT's lineup. Josh Sargent had another go at the role on Saturday after starting the Championship season with five goals in four games. Once again, it did not go according to plan – Sargent took zero shots and had just 17 touches in 62 minutes, still yet to break an international goalless drought that stretches back to November 2019. Balogun came on in Sargent's place for his first game under Pochettino after an injury-plagued year and was much more present – he had four shots and 22 touches in 28 minutes, the shot tally on that day equal to Sargent's shot count in his last six games for the national team. Balogun may have quickly reasserted himself as the USMNT's first choice in that role, and a strong outing on Tuesday may finally bring an end to a years-long search for the team's starting striker.

Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane sent Tunisia to the World Cup with a goal in the fourth minute of injury time that secured a 1-0 win over Equatorial Guinea on Monday in qualifying.

Romdhane was teed up by fellow substitute Firas Chaouat to slot home the late winner and spark wild celebrations for the visitors on the track behind the goal.

Tunisia needed a win to secure a spot at next year's tournament in North America with two games to spare. It tops Group H with 22 points from eight games, 10 points ahead of second-place Namibia, which has a game in hand. Tunisia has yet to concede a goal in qualifying.

It is the seventh time that Tunisia has qualified for the World Cup, and third in a row. It went out in the group stage in 2018 and 2022.

8 September 2025 – Nyon, Switzerland: European Club Association (ECA) today concluded its first Board Meeting of the 2025/26 European football season. Senior leaders from across ECA's Member Clubs met virtually to discuss a range of strategic matters impacting clubs and the football landscape.

Clubs Praise New UCC Competition Formats; Debrief on FIFA Club World Cup 

The Board was provided with a review of the new men's UEFA Club Competitions (UCCs) formats introduced in 2024/25, which have met with an overwhelmingly positive response from clubs. ECA Member Clubs have provided a range of specific feedback, including many highlighting that the introductions of the League Phase, a single league table and simultaneous final matchdays collectively added more competitiveness, unpredictability and excitement. 

Additionally, the Board was provided with a debrief on the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, including key competition performance and supporter engagement indicators including 2.5m aggregate attendance across the tournament, delivering average crowds of 40,000.  

ECA and its Clubs Steadfastly Committed to Solidarity for Non-Participating Clubs 

The Board commended ECA's ongoing commitment together with UEFA to ensuring the success of men's UCCs provides financial benefits for all clubs. In 2024/25, a record €448m (over 10% of UCC revenue) was distributed in solidarity, including €308m to non-participating clubs and €140m to clubs who only played qualifiers.  

The Board agreed on a series of next steps in the ongoing development of ECA's strong partnership with FIFA. This included a mandate to finalise with FIFA the mechanism for distributing the significant FIFA Club World Cup solidarity funding to non-participating clubs. The Board also reaffirmed ECA's commitment to collaborating with FIFA on the continued development of the inaugural FIFA Women's Club World Cup, scheduled to take place in 2028. 

Upcoming New Competitions and Media Partnerships Drive Women's European Football 

ECA has worked closely with UEFA to help deliver a hugely significant step forward for women's European club football. Starting this season, the UEFA Women's Champions League (UWCL) has been reshaped with an 18-team league phase, driving competition at the highest level and providing access to more clubs. Furthermore, ECA supported UEFA in the development of the new UEFA Women's Europa Cup, delivering European club football to more clubs and providing a second pathway for clubs exiting UWCL qualifying. These reforms were developed in close consultation with clubs to strengthen competition, visibility and sustainability. 

The Board was provided with a commercial update from UC3, the joint venture between ECA and UEFA, on the landmark media partnerships secured to support the reach and growth of the new women's club formats and competitions. Disney+ will stream every UWCL match across Europe from 2025/26 to 2029/30, complemented by extensive free-to-air coverage via the European Broadcasting Union's network of major European broadcasters. In the United States, CBS Sports/Paramount+ will carry the competition through 2029/30. These agreements will ensure clubs are given excellent visibility across Europe and beyond. 

Clubs and National Teams Working Together to Support Players 

Following a presentation on the ongoing cooperation between clubs and national associations, the Board endorsed the work taking place between ECA and UEFA on the development of a Collaboration Charter to further strengthen working relationships in the area of player release for National Team matches. 

This will bring clubs and national teams closer together and will benefit international players as well as National Teams. Next steps will include ECA, UEFA and national associations enhancing communications and better facilitating the exchange of player call-up related travel, training and medical information. 

Enhancing Away Fan Experience; Supporting Ongoing Development of Supporter Liaison Officers 

The Board formally approved the priorities of the new ECA Fans Working Group, which includes representation from clubs in all ECA subdivisions. This Working Group will focus on the sharing of knowledge and best practice between clubs, especially in the area of away fan attendance, and on identifying opportunities to further support the development and professionalisation of club Supporter Liaison Officers. 

ECA Member Benefits Providing Opportunities for All Clubs and Stakeholders 

The Board was provided with an update on the new ECA Executive Leadership Programme in partnership with Harvard Business School Executive Education. The first intake of 50+ senior executives from member clubs and stakeholders visited the campus of the world-renowned university's business school in Massachusetts, USA, in early September to kick-start a course to support the development of senior football leaders. Each intake will benefit from a seven-month course including online learning and in-person gatherings at Harvard University in Massachusetts, USA, and at PSG Campus in Paris, France.   

ECA General Assembly Will Convene in Rome in October 

ECA's Board will join all member clubs at the ECA General Assembly in Rome, Italy, from 7 to 9 October 2025. The event will bring together senior leaders from many hundreds of ECA members, strategic partners and global football stakeholders to share ideas, discuss current challenges and explore opportunities to drive the game forward.

ISRAEL AT WAR - DAY 703

DEBRECEN, Hungary — The coach of Israel's national soccer team says he is “standing behind my country” amid calls for the team to be suspended from international competition because of the war in Gaza, adding that “we are in a very complicated situation.”

Israel “hosts” Italy in neutral Hungary in a World Cup qualifier today, and the Italian Soccer Coaches' Association said last month that it had written a formal letter calling for Israel to be suspended.

“We have a super morale and amazing country,” Israel coach Ran Ben-Shimon says. “I trust my people. We are trusting our army and soldiers. And I'm standing behind my country.”

Ben-Shimon adds that he wasn't paying attention to the criticism “in front of me,” because “I'm looking who is standing behind me, and this is our people. We are playing for them, to make them joyful, to make them a few moments of happy.”

Israel's players were to wear black armbands for the game, UEFA confirms, after Palestinian attackers opened fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem this morning. Six people were killed and another 11 were wounded in the attack.

If so, we have a request.

Argentina national team coach Lionel Scaloni commented on if he thinks Lionel Messi will play at the World Cup

Lionel Scaloni spoke at a press conference on Monday about young players against Ecuador and he also confirmed that Nicolás Otamendi will captain Argentina against Ecuador on Tuesday. In the same press conference, Scaloni spoke about Lionel Messi and if he will play at the World Cup with Argentina.

Messi had commented on if he will play at the World Cup following Argentina's 3-0 win against Venezuela. When asked about Messi's comments, here is what Scaloni had to say:

“Will Messi play in the World Cup? I haven't spoken to him about it, I only know what he has said publicly, and I know that he is going to take his time to decide.

“We have to leave him alone, and whatever he decides will be fine.”

Bayern Munich chief Uli Hoeness has admitted the club were priced out of a deal for Florian Wirtz after Liverpool sealed a £116 million ($157m) swoop for the Germany star. Hoeness claimed Der Rekordmeister would never pay such a fee for a player, insisting that the Reds' spending spree showed a transfer market resembling 'Monopoly' this summer.

Zambia needs to increase the pace and improve the quality a little in the final third of the field.

Suddenly, Zambia looks dangerous and is looking to get back into the game.

The visitors wanted to score their third goal of the match, but the final pass was not well  executed.

A brilliant move down the left and Hamza Igmane finishes well under pressure from the opposition to score. The lead grows and there is still plenty of time left.

Here, we will find out who wins this World Cup  qualifying match.

Morocco has been the more productive team in attack in this match, but they fail to score the second goal of the game.

Despite the heated atmosphere in the stands, the match has yet to come to life on the pitch.

The goalkeeper jumps to deflect it backward, but the assistant referee decides that it has gone out of bounds anyway.

Zambia are still unable to score 0-1 wins Morocco.

The game is stopped due to an injury to Emmanuel Banda in Zambia. Hope he's well.

Zambia is offside. Fashion Sakala attempted a through ball, but a teammate was in an offside  position.

Who will come out on top in this World Cup qualifying match?

Morocco has scored a total of 8 goals in its last 2 games.

Morocco qualified for the World Cup, finishing top of Group E in the African qualifiers.

Zambia has gone 7 games without a win.

As for Zambia, uncertainty is growing due to their recent results, which have been truly lackluster: in fact, the team has lost six of its last seven games, showing enormous defensive problems.

Morocco: Bono, Hakimi, Aguerd, Masina, Belamri, Amrabat, Díaz, El Ainaoui, Saibari, Ben Seghir, El Kaabi.

The team's form is also impressive: Morocco has won seven of its last eight games. In the last qualifying match, the team crushed Niger 5-0, confirming its dominance. In the African Cup of Nations, Morocco even lifted the trophy after beating Madagascar in the final, and did so without several of its main stars who play in Europe.

In World Cup qualifying, Zambia is in third place in the group with six points, four behind Tanzania, which is in second place. Theoretically, it still has a chance to fight for second place, but the remaining schedule is very demanding: first Morocco, then Tanzania, and finally Niger.

Who will win this 2026 World Cup qualifier?

Women's Soccer

Read between the lines of countless articles on Alyssa Thompson's move from Angel City FC to Chelsea and you will get a clear sense that Angel City FC really didn't want to let her go. And as Chelsea closed in on the U.S. women's national team forward, it was clear neither did the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).

The romantic stories of a loyal player dragging a team from mediocrity to a title are increasingly categorized as works of fiction. This is the era of the superteam. The best-backed clubs, such as Chelsea with its six consecutive Women's Super League (WSL) titles, can stockpile players, while the rest of the landscape aspires to develop a talent who can tug at these giants' heartstrings and pursestrings alike.

Players are still the main drivers of interest in the sport. As the longtime superpower in women's soccer, one would think that the United States should have a leg up on building the best league in the world, thanks to that deep pool of talent. But while world-class players of all nationalities still make moves to the NWSL, the ongoing trend of WSL teams plucking the top U.S. players from their domestic league is an understandable concern.

Thompson is neither the first nor the last USWNT star to leave NWSL and take her career elsewhere. And while that wanderlust is inevitable in some cases, the league likely won't want to see it become a habit.

With marquee players such as Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson nearing the end of their contracts with NWSL clubs, and a salary cap in place, it's a growing predicament—one of the NWSL's own design.

Salary caps are an American invention.

The first unofficial salary cap was enacted by the NHL during the Great Depression, which says a lot about the rationale for having one.

While theirs and a makeshift mid-1940s trial in the NBA were quickly packed away when the economy recovered, the mechanism returned in the 1980s as athletes commanded higher salaries than even the richest owners could stomach paying across their roster. They were seen as a necessary makeweight for wealthy owners to maintain leverage with their star employees.

The salary cap, in all of its forms, has been part of the American sports landscape for over four decades. Some leagues have strict caps; others opt for luxury taxes on high spenders. A few have a hybrid structure somewhere in between.

The mechanism has been crucial to Major League Soccer's framework since the United States launched the men's league as a condition of hosting the 1994 World Cup. It has allowed MLS to foster a rare level of annual parity, giving 30 fanbases reason to hope they could challenge for a title in any three-year window. It has also kept MLS from reaching the absolute pinnacle of the men's game, as teams simply can't spend to match the talent of rival circuits in Europe, South America and Mexico.

When the NWSL launched in 2012, with U.S. Soccer playing a major role in its construction, a cap was included from launch. The nation with the world's deepest pool of women's soccer players was confident it could be the home of most national team stars, especially given how poorly women's leagues were supported around the world.

Even as expansion fees skyrocketed to hundreds of millions of dollars, the salary cap was an assurance of sorts for investors. Their spending on sports can only get so high, and there was a mechanism to use as a shield against criticism of finance-guided decisions.

The problem for NWSL is that the rest of the world is now investing without the same self-inflicted restrictions.

The latest NWSL collective bargaining agreement, which runs through 2030, determined that teams must compile squads of 22 to 26 players within the salary cap. The maximum is $3.3 million in 2025 and will rise gradually until it hits $5.1 million in 2030. The minimum player salary for 2025 is $48,500 and will rise to $82,500 by 2030; there is no maximum salary. So while it's possible that a club could pay 25 players identical $132,000 salaries for a balanced squad, it does not work out that way.

This was a key factor when Naomi Girma made the move from San Diego Wave to Chelsea earlier this year, a realization that her departure (partly) came down to the realities of her being a defender. Soccer teams often invest more in attackers — who generally command higher transfer fees and salaries because goals are how you win games and their jerseys are in demand — than defenders. As such, even a world-class defender such as Girma could struggle to be a team's top earner.

In that sense, Thompson is exactly who a team like Angel City FC should be built around: a 20-year-old USWNT star leading her local team's attack in between international windows.

But no player is immune to cap considerations. When NWSL teams can no longer guarantee the best salaries in the landscape, players will have to consider additional factors to a greater degree. While many other factors led to Thompson's departure, cap space is a factor all NWSL teams have to consider when negotiating.

Would Angel City rather commit more of its budget to Thompson's wages or use that money on her replacement and two other starting-level players? We have our answer.

“There's a salary cap in NWSL and I think that's an ongoing issue there that hopefully can be changed or increased,” USWNT captain Lindsey Heaps said in April, herself having spent six seasons with the Portland Thorns in between stints with Paris Saint-Germain and OL Lyonnes. “It's a factor in the NWSL and for players coming overseas.

“It wasn't anything against the NWSL, but I wanted to come play in the Champions League again. I wanted to play for a big club like (Lyonnnes). I think I just needed a different kind of challenge. Maybe that's also what these players felt.”

A greater number of NWSL clubs are spending more ambitiously on players and facilities, and may be ready to lift the cap restrictions, too. Michelle Kang, who owns a multi-club organization that includes Washington Spirit, OL Lyonnes, and the London City Lionesses, said owners were discussing the concern well before Girma and Thompson went to Kingsmeadow.

“Free agency doesn't mean much to us if the salary cap doesn't go up because we're gonna lose our players to Europe, right?” Kang said in March 2023. “We as a group, 12 owners, soon to be 14 owners, we have all those issues on the table and working very hard.”

The salary cap was raised the following year, with escalators to continue to increase it, but it remains in place.

Unfortunately, it might be too late for total cap abolishment to be the solution. The NWSL's cautious approach helped stabilize the league, as it did for MLS. It also allowed the powerful pull of UEFA to translate to the women's game over the past decade, making it a continental behemoth that the NWSL may not be able to overcome.

The combining factors have left NWSL with an identity crisis. Are they the best league in the world? A selling league? A bit of both?

The fan perspective of the selling club is driven home in a two-comment exchange below The Athletic's initial newsbreak of Chelsea's pursuit: “So ACFC is a feeder club? Brighton for the women's game?” and “It looks like ACFC is now the Triple A team for Chelsea. Whoopee!”

There's a different spice blend to this reaction compared to what followed Girma's winter move. Factors beyond Girma's own career made it reasonable to leave a club that was undergoing a wholesale transformation — working out from the aftermath of the fraught Jill Ellis era, dealing with Alex Morgan's retirement, and navigating a coaching search. For the league's best defender to depart for a then-record fee felt like part of the reinvention.

Despite launching together in 2022, Angel City has never hit the same sporting heights as San Diego. While the Wave has an NWSL Shield and an NWSL Challenge Cup, Angel City's landmark achievement is arguably being the NWSL team with the highest valuation — $280 million, as of May.

A well-balanced budget sheet does not build a club; players do.

For a while, Thompson was the face of the most valuable NWSL team. Now, just three years into her time with the club, she's gone.

Unless or until there's more financial freedom, these pain points will recur with increasing frequency.

While WSL's lack of a salary cap might not be the answer to keeping players and maintaining the league's competitive nature, as only a few teams in England are currently spending big, one possible solution for a NWSL willingly beholden to American sports customs is to take another page from MLS's book.

The designated player allows teams to spend as much as they would like — in transfer fees and wages — on up to three star players, who each hit the cap at a fixed rate ($743,750 in 2025, or 12.5 percent of the cap). Teams could then determine how much it's worth keeping their USWNT stars, for sporting and marketing reasons alike, knowing there's a limit on their salary cap hit. It is a concept that will not be enacted before this winter, but would have definitely come in handy.

An even sterner test of the NWSL's pull awaits this offseason, with Rodman and Wilson (pending her 2026 player option) set to hit free agency this winter. In this case, neither the Spirit nor the Portland Thorns could parry away transfer offers once they hit the open market.

Will they, or an NWSL rival, be able to make an offer that could withstand any options among the UEFA Women's Champions League class?

It's a gamble that could halt the longtime upward trajectory of team valuations if it's no longer seen as the premier destination for the nation's most famous players. After all, they're the ones who make and break fans' interest in any team.

World Cup

FIFA has made millions of dollars selling fans the “right to buy” 2026 World Cup tickets before putting the actual tickets on sale.

Soccer's global governing body withheld nearly all World Cup ticketing details until last week, when it announced timelines, lottery phases and some prices.

Over the past year, though, on its FIFA Collect platform, it has sold tens of thousands of digital tokens that promise buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets at a to-be-determined later date. The tokens themselves cost hundreds of dollars. The buyers will get guaranteed access to ticket(s) for a specific match, in an unknown section, but still must pay full price for those tickets — a price that FIFA hasn't yet set.

According to spinoff websites that track FIFA Collect sales, and according to data sent by users to The Athletic, the platform has sold over 30,000 of these so-called “Right To Buys” for a total of well over $10 million. One dataset pegged the total take related to the “RTBs” at more than $20 million. Another said they've yielded more than $14.3 million in direct sales, and more than $25 million including sales that might feature an RTB or could indirectly lead to one.

An exact figure is impossible to calculate, because some of the RTB tokens were bundled with tickets to 2025 Club World Cup matches or other digital collectibles, and some were obtained via promotions or as rewards. But the profits tied to RTBs very likely exceed $15 million. All sales on FIFA Collect, of the RTBs and other items, have yielded nearly $29 million on the primary market, according to the spinoff site FIFA Collect Info, whose developer told The Athletic that he built the database using publicly-available blockchain data and FIFA's API.

The RTB tokens are essentially, and solely, a costly shortcut to 2026 tickets, allowing purchasers to bypass lotteries or first-come-first-served digital queues.

“Owning an RTB does not include the cost of the ticket(s) itself,” FIFA Collect clarifies on an FAQ page. “It only gives you access to purchase the ticket(s).”

The tokens have not always been advertised on FIFA's main website. But FIFA Collect is the governing body's “digital collectibles platform,” and “a collaboration between FIFA and Modex,” a blockchain service provider. It is operated by Modex but owned by FIFA. On a Discord call with users in April, a FIFA Collect administrator said: “We work in very close contact with FIFA. We're part of FIFA. … We work in very close contact with FIFA Ticketing on everything, and also with FIFA management on everything.” All payments on the site go through the FIFA Blockchain.

And FIFA itself, in emails and on social media, has promoted the platform as a route to 2026 tickets.

“Get the right-to-buy tickets to the USA's opening match at #WeAre26 only on @fifapluscollect!” its World Cup account said in a May 2024 Instagram post.

The subject line of a January 2025 email from FIFA read: “Unlock FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets with FIFA Collect latest drop.”

And visitors to fifa.com on Monday were greeted by a pop-up: “Will you be there when history is made? Get priority access to FIFA World Cup 26 tickets with FIFA Collect.”

When the platform launched in 2022 as “FIFA+ Collect,” FIFA promised that it would be “affordable, inclusive and accessible to all football fans.” In its early days, it served a small community of avid collectors. It sold relatively cheap packs of NFTs. It was “promoted as a trustworthy and innovative digital collectibles ecosystem backed by FIFA,” Alann Diaz, an early user, told The Athletic via email.

But in 2023, its appeal faded. In 2024, it rebounded with a new approach. First, there were “challenges” that encouraged users to buy pack after pack and try to complete an entire set of certain cards, which could be converted into a “Right To Buy” for 2026 World Cup tickets. Then, FIFA Collect began selling RTBs as single items, or within packs that were guaranteed to include one.

The May 2024 release was the first. There were more that fall. You could, for example, pay $699 for “a limited edition collectible that can be converted into a Right to Buy two tickets for a group phase match” at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. The “Terms & Conditions” clarified: “Actual ticket prices and purchase process will be communicated separately. … The card does not provide free tickets; it only allows the right to purchase two tickets for the specified match.”

Then, in the spring and summer of 2025, FIFA Collect began to release new “drops” with increased frequency. In April, May and June, new batches hit the market every week. In June alone, the platform sold over 5,000 packs containing a “right to buy” one or two World Cup tickets. Prices ranged from $279 (for the right to buy tickets to a random game in Philadelphia, Atlanta or Boston) to $3,000 (for “Double Opening Glory,” a “bundle” that included the right to buy one ticket to the 2026 World Cup opener in Mexico City, plus two upper-deck tickets to the Club World Cup opener in Miami).

In April, May and June combined, according to FIFA Collect Info, users paid around $13 million on the platform's primary market, with the vast majority of those sales tied to RTBs.

In July and August, the regular releases continued, with new batches of city-specific “Glory” packs available as recently as last week.

In addition to city-specific tokens, there were other promotions as well. There was, for example, a “Right to Final” option, where you could pick a team (say, the U.S. men's national team), pay $999, and be guaranteed the right to purchase a ticket to the final if the USMNT makes it. (The U.S. is currently the 48th best team in the world, per the Elo Ratings, and an extreme longshot to win the World Cup.)

There were also “Road to Final Glory – Double Edition” packs. You could pay $1,499, and get an RTB for two matches randomly selected from the following supply: Round of 16 (46 RTBs), quarterfinals (20), semifinals (10), third-place match (5), final (1).

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked who was in charge of packaging and pricing the RTBs, did not directly answer most questions, but said in a statement: “By allowing fans worldwide to own digital elements of the global game and take part in initiatives that offer once-in-a-lifetime experiences, FIFA Collect is democratising access to football and making the sport available for all.

“The Right To Buy concept is central to this vision. It rewards collectors on the platform with the option of purchasing FIFA World Cup tickets from a dedicated allocation. Right To Buy is also used to test demand, identify market trends and inform fair pricing strategies, ensuring fans benefit from a more transparent ticketing process.”

In each of these “Right To Buy” promotions, there was no given timeline for eventually purchasing tickets. There were no hints about how much the owner of an RTB would have to pay for the actual tickets. There was, in most or all cases, no information about the type or category of ticket that would be made available.

When FIFA Collect offered similar tokens for the “right to buy” Club World Cup tickets — which, ultimately, were widely available at reduced prices — the redemption process was “an absolute disaster,” Jon Heath, a FIFA Collect user, wrote in an email. RTB holders complained that they were only allowed to purchase Category 1 tickets, the most expensive tickets, despite FIFA Collect telling them in a December 2024 email that “tickets will be available across different categories, providing options to suit various preferences and needs.” (FIFA Collect administrators, on the April Discord call, apologized and explained that they'd gone back on their word due to “updated guidance from FIFA Ticketing.” FIFA, when asked why this happened, did not say.)

In Discord channels where avid collectors interact with the admins, there were flurries of frustrated messages, and questions that the admins said they couldn't definitively answer.

“This isn't just about RTB conversion,” one user wrote to moderators. “This is about a pattern of vague answers, shifting promises, and last minute shocks that keeps repeating.”

Many Club World Cup RTB buyers ended up paying more to get their tickets than they would have if they'd waited and gone straight to Ticketmaster on the eve of the tournament.

Some also worried about what these concerns portended for the following year. One wrote on Discord: “What makes us think we won't get the same issue for WC 26???”

Blok, a user who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his online alias, told The Athletic: “A lot of people felt burnt on [Club World Cup]. And my biggest fear is they're going to do the same thing with the World Cup, where the prices are astronomical and the Right To Buy tickets are literally worthless.”

Last Wednesday, when FIFA released some basic ticketing details without mention of RTB holders, hundreds of anxious messages flooded the Discord channel. “It's ridiculous how little we know,” one user wrote. “[Thousands of dollars] spent, and no answers.”

The increasingly frequent releases of World Cup RTBs also seemed to be “attracting scalpers and resellers into the ecosystem,” Diaz, the longtime user, wrote to The Athletic. He pointed to FIFA Collect accounts holding over 100 RTBs in total. Those RTBs could be converted to tickets, which could then be re-sold for profit; or, the RTBs themselves could be resold on the FIFA Collect “marketplace,” essentially an internal secondary market, where users sell to and buy from one another. (Modex takes a 5% fee from those secondary-market sales, per FIFA Collect's terms of service.)

In interviews with The Athletic, multiple users confidently stated that a significant majority of people now on the platform had come specifically for RTBs. Demand seemed especially strong in Mexico, prompting FIFA Collect to hike prices for potential access to Mexican national team games. Earlier this summer, the “right to buy” two tickets to El Tri's match in Guadalajara went for $2,799, then $2,999. (Modex executives did not respond to emails seeking clarity on how prices were determined and other topics.)

Advertisement

Other listings played up the possibility of El Tri's potential appearance. For example, within the description of a $449 “City Glory: Miami” pack, there was a bold-lettered paragraph: “In this pack you may find an RTB for 1 of 5 different random matches, including M99, a Quarter-final match that could be played by the Mexico national team depending on its path in the tournament.”

Multiple users told The Athletic that FIFA Collect had been “targeting” and “taking advantage of the Mexican community.”

It's unclear what percentage of the revenue from these sales has gone directly to FIFA, as opposed to Modex or to charity. In mid-July, new packs began including a note that said “20% of all proceeds” would go to the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund and “help provide education access to the world's most marginalized children, build safe learning environments, and accelerate progress toward every child's right to quality education across more than 200 countries.” FIFA Collect's website says that $1.4 million has so far been raised for the fund.

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked about revenue breakdowns, wrote that the governing body “does not disclose the specifics of commercial and financial agreements or strategies.”

But he did say: “As with all of FIFA's commercial activities, revenues go directly back into football development and social projects worldwide, with Modex taking a commission to scale operations and cover technical costs. FIFA Collect therefore provides life-changing opportunities for fans, new digital ecosystems for stakeholders, and additional revenue to grow the game globally.”

Whatever FIFA's cut, it represents a small fraction of the more than $3 billion that FIFA expects to make in 2026 from hospitality and ticket sales.

The roughly 70,000 tickets that have been promised via RTBs (according to FIFA Collect Info) represent around 1% of the roughly 6 million tickets FIFA expects to sell for the 2026 World Cup's 104 matches.

World Cup

FIFA has made millions of dollars selling fans the “right to buy” 2026 World Cup tickets before putting the actual tickets on sale.

Soccer's global governing body withheld nearly all World Cup ticketing details until last week, when it announced timelines, lottery phases and some prices.

Over the past year, though, on its FIFA Collect platform, it has sold tens of thousands of digital tokens that promise buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets at a to-be-determined later date. The tokens themselves cost hundreds of dollars. The buyers will get guaranteed access to ticket(s) for a specific match, in an unknown section, but still must pay full price for those tickets — a price that FIFA hasn't yet set.

According to spinoff websites that track FIFA Collect sales, and according to data sent by users to The Athletic, the platform has sold over 30,000 of these so-called “Right To Buys” for a total of well over $10 million. One dataset pegged the total take related to the “RTBs” at more than $20 million. Another said they've yielded more than $14.3 million in direct sales, and more than $25 million including sales that might feature an RTB or could indirectly lead to one.

An exact figure is impossible to calculate, because some of the RTB tokens were bundled with tickets to 2025 Club World Cup matches or other digital collectibles, and some were obtained via promotions or as rewards. But the profits tied to RTBs very likely exceed $15 million. All sales on FIFA Collect, of the RTBs and other items, have yielded nearly $29 million on the primary market, according to the spinoff site FIFA Collect Info, whose developer told The Athletic that he built the database using publicly-available blockchain data and FIFA's API.

The RTB tokens are essentially, and solely, a costly shortcut to 2026 tickets, allowing purchasers to bypass lotteries or first-come-first-served digital queues.

“Owning an RTB does not include the cost of the ticket(s) itself,” FIFA Collect clarifies on an FAQ page. “It only gives you access to purchase the ticket(s).”

The tokens have not always been advertised on FIFA's main website. But FIFA Collect is the governing body's “digital collectibles platform,” and “a collaboration between FIFA and Modex,” a blockchain service provider. It is operated by Modex but owned by FIFA. On a Discord call with users in April, a FIFA Collect administrator said: “We work in very close contact with FIFA. We're part of FIFA. … We work in very close contact with FIFA Ticketing on everything, and also with FIFA management on everything.” All payments on the site go through the FIFA Blockchain.

And FIFA itself, in emails and on social media, has promoted the platform as a route to 2026 tickets.

“Get the right-to-buy tickets to the USA's opening match at #WeAre26 only on @fifapluscollect!” its World Cup account said in a May 2024 Instagram post.

The subject line of a January 2025 email from FIFA read: “Unlock FIFA World Cup 26™ tickets with FIFA Collect latest drop.”

And visitors to fifa.com on Monday were greeted by a pop-up: “Will you be there when history is made? Get priority access to FIFA World Cup 26 tickets with FIFA Collect.”

When the platform launched in 2022 as “FIFA+ Collect,” FIFA promised that it would be “affordable, inclusive and accessible to all football fans.” In its early days, it served a small community of avid collectors. It sold relatively cheap packs of NFTs. It was “promoted as a trustworthy and innovative digital collectibles ecosystem backed by FIFA,” Alann Diaz, an early user, told The Athletic via email.

But in 2023, its appeal faded. In 2024, it rebounded with a new approach. First, there were “challenges” that encouraged users to buy pack after pack and try to complete an entire set of certain cards, which could be converted into a “Right To Buy” for 2026 World Cup tickets. Then, FIFA Collect began selling RTBs as single items, or within packs that were guaranteed to include one.

The May 2024 release was the first. There were more that fall. You could, for example, pay $699 for “a limited edition collectible that can be converted into a Right to Buy two tickets for a group phase match” at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. The “Terms & Conditions” clarified: “Actual ticket prices and purchase process will be communicated separately. … The card does not provide free tickets; it only allows the right to purchase two tickets for the specified match.”

Then, in the spring and summer of 2025, FIFA Collect began to release new “drops” with increased frequency. In April, May and June, new batches hit the market every week. In June alone, the platform sold over 5,000 packs containing a “right to buy” one or two World Cup tickets. Prices ranged from $279 (for the right to buy tickets to a random game in Philadelphia, Atlanta or Boston) to $3,000 (for “Double Opening Glory,” a “bundle” that included the right to buy one ticket to the 2026 World Cup opener in Mexico City, plus two upper-deck tickets to the Club World Cup opener in Miami).

In April, May and June combined, according to FIFA Collect Info, users paid around $13 million on the platform's primary market, with the vast majority of those sales tied to RTBs.

In July and August, the regular releases continued, with new batches of city-specific “Glory” packs available as recently as last week.

In addition to city-specific tokens, there were other promotions as well. There was, for example, a “Right to Final” option, where you could pick a team (say, the U.S. men's national team), pay $999, and be guaranteed the right to purchase a ticket to the final if the USMNT makes it. (The U.S. is currently the 48th best team in the world, per the Elo Ratings, and an extreme longshot to win the World Cup.)

There were also “Road to Final Glory – Double Edition” packs. You could pay $1,499, and get an RTB for two matches randomly selected from the following supply: Round of 16 (46 RTBs), quarterfinals (20), semifinals (10), third-place match (5), final (1).

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked who was in charge of packaging and pricing the RTBs, did not directly answer most questions, but said in a statement: “By allowing fans worldwide to own digital elements of the global game and take part in initiatives that offer once-in-a-lifetime experiences, FIFA Collect is democratising access to football and making the sport available for all.

“The Right To Buy concept is central to this vision. It rewards collectors on the platform with the option of purchasing FIFA World Cup tickets from a dedicated allocation. Right To Buy is also used to test demand, identify market trends and inform fair pricing strategies, ensuring fans benefit from a more transparent ticketing process.”

In each of these “Right To Buy” promotions, there was no given timeline for eventually purchasing tickets. There were no hints about how much the owner of an RTB would have to pay for the actual tickets. There was, in most or all cases, no information about the type or category of ticket that would be made available.

When FIFA Collect offered similar tokens for the “right to buy” Club World Cup tickets — which, ultimately, were widely available at reduced prices — the redemption process was “an absolute disaster,” Jon Heath, a FIFA Collect user, wrote in an email. RTB holders complained that they were only allowed to purchase Category 1 tickets, the most expensive tickets, despite FIFA Collect telling them in a December 2024 email that “tickets will be available across different categories, providing options to suit various preferences and needs.” (FIFA Collect administrators, on the April Discord call, apologized and explained that they'd gone back on their word due to “updated guidance from FIFA Ticketing.” FIFA, when asked why this happened, did not say.)

In Discord channels where avid collectors interact with the admins, there were flurries of frustrated messages, and questions that the admins said they couldn't definitively answer.

“This isn't just about RTB conversion,” one user wrote to moderators. “This is about a pattern of vague answers, shifting promises, and last minute shocks that keeps repeating.”

Many Club World Cup RTB buyers ended up paying more to get their tickets than they would have if they'd waited and gone straight to Ticketmaster on the eve of the tournament.

Some also worried about what these concerns portended for the following year. One wrote on Discord: “What makes us think we won't get the same issue for WC 26???”

Blok, a user who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his online alias, told The Athletic: “A lot of people felt burnt on [Club World Cup]. And my biggest fear is they're going to do the same thing with the World Cup, where the prices are astronomical and the Right To Buy tickets are literally worthless.”

Last Wednesday, when FIFA released some basic ticketing details without mention of RTB holders, hundreds of anxious messages flooded the Discord channel. “It's ridiculous how little we know,” one user wrote. “[Thousands of dollars] spent, and no answers.”

The increasingly frequent releases of World Cup RTBs also seemed to be “attracting scalpers and resellers into the ecosystem,” Diaz, the longtime user, wrote to The Athletic. He pointed to FIFA Collect accounts holding over 100 RTBs in total. Those RTBs could be converted to tickets, which could then be re-sold for profit; or, the RTBs themselves could be resold on the FIFA Collect “marketplace,” essentially an internal secondary market, where users sell to and buy from one another. (Modex takes a 5% fee from those secondary-market sales, per FIFA Collect's terms of service.)

In interviews with The Athletic, multiple users confidently stated that a significant majority of people now on the platform had come specifically for RTBs. Demand seemed especially strong in Mexico, prompting FIFA Collect to hike prices for potential access to Mexican national team games. Earlier this summer, the “right to buy” two tickets to El Tri's match in Guadalajara went for $2,799, then $2,999. (Modex executives did not respond to emails seeking clarity on how prices were determined and other topics.)

Other listings played up the possibility of El Tri's potential appearance. For example, within the description of a $449 “City Glory: Miami” pack, there was a bold-lettered paragraph: “In this pack you may find an RTB for 1 of 5 different random matches, including M99, a Quarter-final match that could be played by the Mexico national team depending on its path in the tournament.”

Multiple users told The Athletic that FIFA Collect had been “targeting” and “taking advantage of the Mexican community.”

It's unclear what percentage of the revenue from these sales has gone directly to FIFA, as opposed to Modex or to charity. In mid-July, new packs began including a note that said “20% of all proceeds” would go to the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund and “help provide education access to the world's most marginalized children, build safe learning environments, and accelerate progress toward every child's right to quality education across more than 200 countries.” FIFA Collect's website says that $1.4 million has so far been raised for the fund.

A FIFA spokesperson, when asked about revenue breakdowns, wrote that the governing body “does not disclose the specifics of commercial and financial agreements or strategies.”

But he did say: “As with all of FIFA's commercial activities, revenues go directly back into football development and social projects worldwide, with Modex taking a commission to scale operations and cover technical costs. FIFA Collect therefore provides life-changing opportunities for fans, new digital ecosystems for stakeholders, and additional revenue to grow the game globally.”

Whatever FIFA's cut, it represents a small fraction of the more than $3 billion that FIFA expects to make in 2026 from hospitality and ticket sales.

The roughly 70,000 tickets that have been promised via RTBs (according to FIFA Collect Info) represent around 1% of the roughly 6 million tickets FIFA expects to sell for the 2026 World Cup's 104 matches.

Brazil's 1970 triumph, summed up by their captain's brilliant strike in the final, was the game's Woodstock, a glorious moment offering an implausible future

Tostão picks up the loose ball and nudges it back to Wilson Piazza just outside his own box. The ball is moved in a slow triangle through Clodoaldo to Pelé and Gérson and back to Clodoaldo. His touch is slightly heavy, enticing an Italian challenge. Clodoaldo skips round him and then two other tackles. He sidesteps Antonio Juliano and rolls the ball to Rivellino on the left. Rivellino sweeps a 40-yard pass down the line to Jairzinho and the rhythm has suddenly changed.

Jairzinho runs at Giacinto Facchetti and, as he turns inside, Pierluigi Cera advances to close him down. Jairzinho pokes the ball on to Pelé, perhaps 27 or 28 yards out. Tarcisio Burgnich stands between him and the box, but Pelé pauses, turns casually to his right and lays a pass into the path of Carlos Alberto, surging forward from full-back. Just inside the box the ball bobbles so it sits up perfectly. Carlos Alberto doesn't have to break stride as he lashes a shot hard across goal, the force of the strike lifting him high off the ground as the ball flies into the bottom corner. With four minutes of the 1970 World Cup final remaining, Brazil lead 4–1.

For many, it's the greatest goal scored by perhaps the greatest team in the greatest World Cup, a glorious synthesis of team play and individual technical excellence. Yes, it came right at the end of the final and Italy were exhausted by then, accepting their defeat, but it was a goal that encapsulated the joy and virtuosity of that side, that left the world with a shorthand for what the Brazil of 1970 meant.

And if by the time it was scored it was almost a goal without an opposition, an exhibition, that felt appropriate too, for Brazil by then had come to feel as though they were about more than games or results, more even than winning the World Cup: they were about an expression of football in its most beautiful form, about pushing the boundaries of human capability.

The impact of Brazil's victory on the global imagination was profound. This felt thrillingly modern. For those who had colour television, who witnessed those vibrant yellow shirts and the shorts of cobalt blue playing with a dash and a verve in iridescent heat on the sun-bleached grass of Mexico, the impact is hard to overstate.

The tournament revelled in the sense of progress, naming the official ball the Telstar, after the satellite that made live global transmission possible. And Brazil, after all, had undergone a Nasa-approved training course before the World Cup. When the Jornal do Brasil claimed that “Brazil's victory with the ball compares with the conquest of the moon by the Americans” the previous year it didn't seem ridiculous.

Just as the moon landing could be regarded as a triumph of human ingenuity, so Brazil's artistry seemed to transcend the tournament, the petty squabble of nation against nation. Much of what posterity has remembered of Pelé in that tournament – the lob from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia, the header that drew the stunning save from Gordon Banks, the dummy on the Uruguay goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz in the semi-final – didn't lead to goals, as though this was about more than the bureaucracy of the scoreboard; it was about the greater glory of the game.

Ever since, there has been a sense of football trying to recapture the spirit of 1970, that feeling of rapturous and perhaps impossible excitement. By the time of the 1974 tournament in West Germany, João Havelange had been elected president of Fifa and a new age of commercialism had begun.

It's not to present Stanley Rous's tenure as Fifa president as anything other than flawed to suggest that, when a former schoolteacher was replaced by the son of an arms dealer, a certain financial innocence was lost. The 1970 World Cup looks different to every subsequent World Cup because not every surface is covered in advertising. The marketing was not slick, the presentation imperfect, and in that ramshackle aspect there was perhaps a charm: the football, by and large, came first.

And the football in 1970 was thrilling. The contrast to the physicality of the two previous World Cups and England's cautious, mechanistic win in 1966 was obvious and for many those two facets became fused: this tournament was modernity and it had been won by Brazilian artistry, therefore such artistry was modern. But it was not. It had been made possible by the heat and altitude of Mexico that, with the fitness of players as it then was, effectively made pressing impossible. By 1974 in West Germany, pressing was back.

Brazil's World Cup victory in 1970 still has a mythic quality, their performance still used as a shorthand for the best that football can be: it's what gave Pelé's “beautiful game” cliche currency. That it became fused in the popular imagination with the technology that made it possible to witness the tournament live across the globe is natural: the Telstar was both satellite and ball, ball and satellite, and Brazil's mastery over one was disseminated by the other. Their attacking football was brilliant, but this was a tournament just as tawdry, just as mired in political chicanery, and just as blighted by poor refereeing as any other.

The aptest analogy for the 1970 World Cup from the previous year, then, is perhaps less the moon landings than Woodstock, a festival of love and artistry that has come to embody a moment of lost possibility. Like Woodstock, the future offered by the 1970 World Cup was perhaps always implausible.

The popular conception of Woodstock – great crowds high on the prospect of peace and love, listening to Jimi Hendrix, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Joan Baez – stems largely from the over-idealised Michael Wadleigh documentary, released three months before the 1970 World Cup. The reality was chaos: several acts performed hours late; a fence was broken down by anarchists leading to potentially dangerous overcrowding; two people were killed, one of them run over by a tractor; and a worn electric cable combined with persistent rain raised the possibility of mass electrocution.

The 1970 World Cup, similarly, once you peer beyond the brilliance of Brazil's football, becomes a much more sinister event. Mexico's governing PRI was repressive and capable of extreme violence. And in Brazil, along with short-term economic growth, victory in Mexico, and its associated modernity, was presented as part of President Emílio Garrastazu Médici's “Brazilian miracle”.

The result is that the 1970 World Cup stands amid the darkness as a fragile vision of perfection and possibility, of what football can be, what it could have been. It is, in effect, the equivalent of that epiphanic pause before Pelé lays the ball right in the 86th minute of the final. But where that pass was followed by the explosive fulfilment of Carlos Alberto's shot, football itself went awry. That World Cup is the scene in Easy Rider, another cultural touchstone of 1969, in which Wyatt (Peter Fonda) tells Billy (Dennis Hopper): “We blew it.”

Like Wyatt and Billy, Fifa took the money and, while much was gained, much also was lost.

The first opportunity to score regular tickets for the 2026 World Cup is on Wednesday. But be warned: Tickets may not be easy to get — and they likely won't be cheap.

Demand for the popular men's tournament is expected to soar even higher once the tournament kicks off across the United States, Mexico and Canada in June.

FIFA, the organization behind the World Cup, is also upending the way it sells tickets for its flagship tournament, which could compound the challenges of scoring them. 

Most prominently, FIFA is set to unveil a controversial pricing system: They say it's not the same as dynamic pricing — but prices will adjust based on demand.

Here's what to know about ticket sales for the World Cup.

The first window to get tickets will open on Sept. 10 and end on Sept. 19 — but only for eligible VISA cardholders. And they must first register their interest with FIFA. And people won't be able to actually buy tickets then. 

According to information provided by FIFA, those who apply will be drawn into a lottery. If successful, they will be provided with a specific date and time slot to buy tickets starting on Oct. 1.  

Those who are selected have the chance to buy tickets for any of the 104 games that will held in all three countries next year — including the final. Buyers just won't know who's actually playing in them, since the draw won't be held until Dec. 5.

Venue-specific ticket packages, meaning tickets to a handful of games in a specific host city like Boston or Mexico City, will also be available. In addition, spectators can buy tickets that are specific to a national team, but only for the three group games that each team will play.

Other opportunities to buy tickets will follow, including in late October, after the group draw, and next year.

FIFA will also operate a resale platform for ticket holders who no longer want to attend a match, as it has in previous tournaments.

FIFA has touted that some group-stage tickets will start at $60, saying that will offer "an accessible entry point to the tournament." Still, the association notes that the "most exclusive" tickets could reach up to $6,730 for the final.

But what they are not touting so loudly is that the organization will also implement pricing that will fluctuate based on demand, a first for the World Cup. 

It's not dynamic pricing per se; they're calling it "variable pricing." But the differences between the two can be hazy.

Heimo Schirgi, the FIFA World Cup 26 Chief Operating Officer, says variable pricing means that "how the prices are adjusted are not as steep and are more balanced across the different phases."

A FIFA official further told NPR that pricing won't be set by "automated algorithms," but will be guided by a team of people who will be regularly "monitoring and making adjustments in real time" to ticket prices based on supply and demand — which suggests that FIFA officials can ultimately determine how high they are willing to let prices go. (The official declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media in an official capacity.)

FIFA has justified its decision by saying it's simply adapting to the U.S. and Canadian markets, where professional teams regularly use the controversial sales practice of adjusting tickets based on demand, just as airlines or hotels do.

FIFA's "variable pricing" will apply from the actual start of the sales window in October, which means that the $60 "accessible entry point" could quickly rise, depending on how aggressive the organization will be with pricing.

Prices adjusted to demand could also be implemented on FIFA's planned resale platform in the U.S. and Canada, though FIFA has not given exact details. 

However, in Mexico, the resale platform will operate as an exchange platform, meaning buyers can receive up to the amount they spent buying a ticket from FIFA — and no more. That's the way FIFA had operated its resale platforms in the past.

Of course, adjusting pricing based on demand doesn't necessarily mean prices will rise higher. At the FIFA Club World Cup — a tournament held in the U.S. this year — pricing actually dropped for a number of games because demand was lower than anticipated. 

But the World Cup is far bigger and more established than the Club World Cup. FIFA has previously said it is expecting over 5 million people to attend next year's edition. 

That would shatter the previous record from 1994, the last time the U.S. hosted, attracting over 3.5 million spectators.

That's in part a function of the vastly expanded tournament, which will now consist of 48 teams, more than the 32 that participated in the previous World Cup in Qatar. The 2026 World Cup will also be held in three countries and staged in venues such as MetLife Stadium, which has a capacity of over 80,000.

Nonetheless, demand will likely be higher than supply, and getting tickets may prove difficult.

During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA said it received over 23 million requests for about 3.4 million available tickets, meaning buyers who wanted to score tickets had a success rate of only about 15%.

For those who do not want the uncertainty of trying to buy regular seats during a sales window, there is another way to attend — but it will cost you.

They're called "hospitality tickets," and these premium tickets are well known to American fans. They give the ticketholder access to a reserved seating area, such as a box, along with a variety of beverages and food.

But they are pricey. Hospitality tickets have already been on sale since earlier this year, including for individual games and packages that at one point reached $73,200. 

Prices have also fluctuated through the year based on demand. Right now, the cheapest hospitality ticket for a single game is listed at $1,350.

FIFA has also introduced a new ticket sales method called "right to buys," or RTBs. These offer buyers a guaranteed opportunity to buy tickets for specific games, including the final. To get one, fans have to buy digital cards which FIFA releases, or "drops," periodically. They're kind of like electronic baseball cards; they typically contain a scene or video from a previous World Cup game. 

Prices range from the hundreds of dollars for guaranteed opportunities to buy playoff games down to cheaper "surprise packs" that may or may not contain an RTB. That doesn't even factor in the actual price of the ticket, which buyers will need to pay when FIFA makes them available.

FIFA even runs a marketplace where RTB owners can buy and sell these opportunities.

The combination of variable pricing and more games will likely lead to the most profitable World Cup tournament ever.

Bloomberg Intelligence estimates FIFA could rake in a record $4.4 billion, not only from general sales tickets but also by leaning heavily on hospitality seats. Such a haul would also mark a 378% surge from the last men's tournament in Qatar, according to equity research analyst Kevin Near, reflecting in part the expanded tournament with 104 matches and 48 national teams.

"These stadiums are massive, they have huge occupancy," Near says. "And because there has been such a focus now for a little while on building out premium and luxury spaces, that's where you're going to see a lot of those dollars come from."

FIFA, however, is particularly sensitive to criticism that it's just seeking profits, saying the vast majority of the money it raises from its tournaments is intended to be distributed across its 211 member associations to help support the growth of soccer worldwide.

"As part of that mission, which we take very seriously, we're looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadia, so it's always a balance between different factors," Schirgi from FIFA World Cup 26 said in an emailed statement.

Of course, achieving that balance doesn't necessarily mean ticket prices will be low. So when that first ticket sales window opens on Wednesday, one thing's for sure: Buying a World Cup ticket may turn into quite a game.

Roberto Martinez's side kicked-off their World Cup qualifying campaign in style on an emotional evening

Cristiano Ronaldo led the way as Portugal swept aside Armenia in a 5-0 World Cup qualifying victory on Saturday. The 40-year-old icon struck once in either half and was too much for the Armenian defence to handle as the Selecao registered a convincing victory in their first match since the untimely passing of Diogo Jota.

It was Ronaldo's new Al-Nassr team-mate Joao Felix who opened the scoring in the 10th minute from a Joao Cancelo cross, heading home to set Roberto Martinez's side on their way. Eleven minutes later it was two, as Ronaldo diverted home an in-swinging Pedro Neto delivery with one touch of his prolific right boot. With the result already inevitable, Cancelo then turned goal-scorer as the Al-Hilal full-back powered home from the centre of the penalty area.

Just 45 seconds into the second half, Portugal had a fourth and it was Ronaldo again, this time with the best goal of the lot. After a defender turned aside Joao Neves' through ball, Ronaldo struck a sweet half-volley from 25 yards which flew past goalkeeper Henri Avagyan and high into the net. Despite coming close to netting a hat-trick on a couple of occasions and laying on the ball for Neves to strike the post, the ex-Real Madrid was then withdrawn in the 57th minute. Instead it was left to Felix to round out the scoring with an audacious scorpion flick.

President Donald Trump was notably absent from the celebrations at the US Open after he had gatecrashed Chelsea's FIFA Club World Cup trophy ceremony back in July.

During the Club World Cup, the Blues demolished Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, courtesy of strikes from Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro, claiming the silverware at MetLife Stadium. While Chelsea's players basked in glory for their achievement, Trump descended onto the field and joined the festivities with the team, catching several stars off guard.

Fast-forward approximately two months, and Trump was nowhere to be seen on the court at the US Open following Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz's triumph over Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 for his sixth Grand Slam title.

While Alcaraz savored his remarkable victory, the president remained absent from the court, although the trophy was brought to his private box. Trump observed the match from the Rolex Suite and stayed put as spectators erupted in praise for the Spaniard, yet the president refrained from applauding Alcaraz, appearing notably glum while others around him displayed contrasting emotions.

Trump's behavior was so peculiar that body language specialist Judi James highlighted how misplaced the president's attitude appeared compared to surrounding attendees. "Trump's reaction to a very excited and celebratory Alcaraz seems out of step with the rest of the crowd," she revealed.



"As everyone is clapping and cheering Trump appears to hike his pants from the belt and perform a wry, closed lip, ironic-looking smile and pull at his jacket rather than clap."

Throughout the match, it seemed as though Trump might have nodded off, appearing largely uninterested in the tennis action unfolding before him. The audience made their feelings crystal clear when the 79-year-old appeared on the big screen during the national anthem, unleashing a chorus of boos.

Trump could only manage a smirk and salute toward the flag as spectators continued voicing their disapproval. Prior to the contest, Alcaraz shared his thoughts on having the president watching from a VIP box.

"For me, playing in front of him... to be honest, I will try not to think about it," he confessed.

"I don't want myself to be nervous because of it. But I think attending the tennis match, it's great for tennis to have the president at the final."

Even after his remarkable victory, Alcaraz confessed he felt "scared" going up against Sinner, explaining that he used smiles as a strategy to stay calm while pursuing another championship.

"I was scared," he told ESPN afterward. "I'm not going to lie. But smiling is something that helps me a lot to pull out all the nerves. Thanks to that, it seems like I'm having fun. I like this moment. I like the challenge. I like the most difficult moments in the match.

"I like them. I face them like, OK, it's going to happen. So that's why I smile. Thanks to that, I just saw my best tennis in those moments. Obviously, it's the final of a Grand Slam. There is nothing to be scared of, to worry about. It's just about smiling as much as you can, obviously."

If you are wondering why U.S. Soccer tries to avoid playing tournament matches in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, here are some sorry stats to chew on.

If you are wondering why U.S. Soccer tries to avoid playing tournament matches in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, here are some sorry stats to chew on.

The U.S. men's national tea, which has an overall record of 9-12-9 in the region, is 1-7-3 in its last 11 matches there, including Saturday's 2-0 loss to the Korea Republic at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J.. That includes a devastating 2-0 defeat to Costa Rica in a vital World Cup qualifier on Sept. 1 that helped seal the Americans' fate of missing the 2018 tournament in Russia.

Wait! As they say in the commercial, there's more.

The U.S. has been blanked in eight of those contests, scoring only three times. They have a 488-minute scoreless streak in Jersey, dating back to a World Cup warm-up match, a 2-1 triumph over Turkey on June 1, 2014. Clint Dempsey is the last American to find the net for the team in New Jersey, scoring in the 52nd minute.

Saw the players' warm ups in the gym before the match on tv. Based on this I am predicting Alcaraz. I'll reveal my theory only if he wins 😆

Bouchard's half-facetious theory, as it turned out, stemmed from candid scenes in the Arthur Ashe Stadium warm-up area prior to the players' arrival on court.As Sinner stayed loose by playing games with a soccer ball and his coaches, the Spaniard took a more serious approach: He appeared focused and locked in with himself as he did a one-armed plank, and stretched while wearing noise-canceling headphones.But for Alcaraz, preparedness didn't just come in the warm-up.

But for Alcaraz, preparedness didn't just come in the warm-up.

In his post-match press conference, he told reporters that he "studied" the four-set loss he took to Sinner in the Wimbledon final with his coaches."We saw the Wimbledon final, and we spoke about what we would have done better in that match just in case I'm going to face him in another time," he said.Read more: Carlos Alcaraz: I studied Wimbledon final to beat Jannik Sinner in US Open rematch"I think I played perfect.

It's no secret that top ATP Tour players lean on data and statistical analysis to unlock marginal gains, and Casper Ruud did exactly that to claim the biggest title of his career at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid in May.

Ahead of his championship-match clash with Jack Draper, the Norwegian turned to ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF, using the platform to study his opponent's game and spot recurring patterns in his clay-court play. By digging into Draper's tactical tendencies, Ruud arrived on court with a clear plan and the confidence to execute it under pressure.

“His typical left-handed approach to the clay game is penetrating your opponent's backhand with [the] forehand,” Ruud said of Draper. “I tried to cover it as good as I can. That was something I really thought about going into the match. I think I was ready for it, which was really important."

Watch Casper Ruud explain how he uses ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF

ATP Tennis IQ powered by PIF is an enhanced performance-analytics platform that delivers richer match data, advanced scouting, video breakdowns, and wearable integration, all in real-time. The tool is now available to more than 2,000 ATP Tour and Challenger Tour players, as well as ATP coaches, bringing elite-level analysis within reach across the professional game.

By providing insights into opponents' tendencies, tactical patterns, and real-time physical metrics, it empowers players to refine preparation, adapt strategy mid-match, and elevate overall development. Read more about the platform here.



For 13-time ATP Tour champion and former World No. 2 Ruud, the value of the innovative platform is clear.

“It's really cool how you can actually see it on a screen, statistic-wise,” Ruud said of the platform. “It's really cool that you can compare yourself to yourself, and also the rest of the Tour.

“The one thing you can have a really clear vision of is your opponent's serve. I find it helpful using [the platform] to see where my opponents typically like to serve on pressure points. If your gut feeling matches what the Tennis IQ platform says about a player, then I know I'm onto something and I will dive deeper.”

With four Grand Slam champions in 2025 and no single player able to dominate, the season now shifts to its decisive phase. Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka are among the many players who face different tests.

Just like that, the Grand Slam season is behind us. Four majors, four different champions, and a year that never settled into one dominant storyline. It ended fittingly with World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka finally winning her first Slam of 2025 in New York, a victory that steadied her season and raised the stakes for the final stretch.

Now the tour pivots to Asia and beyond, where the points carry extra weight and the margins grow thin. This is where year-end rankings are decided, where confidence can be rebuilt, and where the push to Riyadh defines who's truly had a great season.

There are questions everywhere. Can Iga Swiatek chase down Sabalenka for the year-end No. 1? Will Coco Gauff reset her serve and confidence in time to defend her WTA Finals crown? Is Naomi Osaka's resurgence about to level up, or will it settle back into something steadier? And which of the newer faces can turn promise into staying power?

From here to Riyadh, there's plenty of tennis left to shape the season's story.

Here are three storylines from each of our writers we will be watching most closely in the final stretch:

The year-end No. 1 chaseWho will finish as the year-end World No. 1? The direct rivalry between Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka has mostly taken a back seat in 2025 so far -- they've played just once, in the Roland Garros semifinals. Instead, both players' narratives involved bouncing back from more general setbacks to win one major each, Swiatek at Wimbledon and Sabalenka in New York. Those results have put the pair in a strong position to battle it out for Player of the Year honors -- maybe even through an on-court meeting or two.

Who's the freshest?It's been an arduous season, with the toll on the players compounded by two-week WTA 1000 events in every swing. Who's the freshest heading into the home stretch? Keep an eye on players who have missed chunks of time with injury (Czech comeback queens Barbora Krejcikova, Marketa Vondrousova and Karolina Muchova) as well as a few who haven't been winning matches at their usual rate, and still have a few things to prove in 2025 (Diana Shnaider, Daria Kasatkina).

Breakthroughs under the spotlightCan the tour's recent cohort of breakthroughs keep it up? Three Asian players who turned heads in North America -- the Philippines' Alexandra Eala, Japan's Aoi Ito and Indonesia's Janice Tjen -- should be well placed to take momentum into their home continent. Two teenagers, Canada's Victoria Mboko and the Czech Republic's Tereza Valentova, will also be contesting the Asian swing for the first time and will be worth keeping an eye on.

-- Alex Macpherson

Who gets to Riyadh?Who will emerge from the pack and qualify for Riyadh? In the race to the WTA Finals, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek are already in. That leaves six spots open for singles. If the regular season ended today, the following players would qualify: Coco Gauff (5,184), Amanda Anisimova (4,908/5,608), Madison Keys (4,450), Jessica Pegula (4,209), Mirra Andreeva (4189), Elena Rybakina (3,751). But with WTA 1000 events coming up in Beijing and Wuhan, WTA 500s in Guadalajara, Seoul, Ningbo and Tokyo there are opportunities. Next in line: Jasmine Paolini (3,526), Ekaterina Alexandrova (2,871), Elina Svitolina (2,606), Clara Tauson (2,553), Emma Navarro (2,310) and Naomi Osaka (2,244).

Can Andreeva catch fire again?No one was hotter than Mirra Andreeva through the middle of the season. Still only 17, she won back-to-back WTA 1000s in Dubai and Indian Wells. She beat Iga Swiatek in both tournaments and took down Aryna Sabalenka and Elina Rybakina in Indian Wells. And then she had a terrific clay run, reaching the quarterfinals in Madrid, Rome and Roland Garros. But after getting to the quarters, she's been quiet. Now 18, Andreeva has played only five matches since Wimbledon, going 3-2. She took a nasty fall in a Montreal loss to McCartney Kessler, suffering an ankle injury. Looking for her to get going again in Asia.

Which new names will stick?Which of the newbies who vaulted into the Top 100 will finish strong? Alexandra Eala had a scorching run to the Miami semifinals and lost in the finals at Eastbourne, but has won only one WTA-level match since. The good news? The 20-year-old Filipina is fresh off a WTA 125 title in Guadalajara, Maya Joint, 19, won that Eastbourne final – her second ever, after winning the title in Rabat. Joint has only four wins in six events since Eastbourne. Lois Boisson, 22, was a surprise semifinalist at Roland Garros and the winner of the Hamburg 250. Dogged by an adductor injury, she's 0-2 since.

-- Greg Garber

Can Gauff reset in Asia?Will Coco Gauff right the ship in Asia? It sounds like an absurd question, just three months removed from a French Open title, but it's been a bit of a whirlwind since then. Too many double faults. The surprising hire of biomechanics expert Gavin Macmillan. An early exit in New York. (Though there's certainly no shame in losing to an in-form Naomi Osaka.) Will we start to see her serve improve after more time with Macmillan? Can she repeat at the WTA Finals in Riyadh? And most importantly, can she get her confidence back?

Is Osaka really back?Is Naomi Osaka back? It certainly appears so, though we need more of a sample size to be sure. After hiring Tomasz Wiktorowski last month, all the four-time Grand Slam champion has done is win 11 of 13 matches, reach the final in Montreal and come within a set of returning to the US Open final. But more important than the numbers and accolades is how locked in she's looked, and how much joy she seems to be playing with (a wonderful sight to see). Can she keep it going? We'll find out later this month, in Beijing.

Will a fifth major winner emerge?Had Aryna Sabalenka lost the US Open final, I would have wondered if she would cement her status as the world's top player in Riyadh despite falling short at the majors. But that's less of a concern now. Instead, I'm focused on the incredible parity on the Hologic WTA Tour. Four different players won majors in 2025. Will a fifth emerge victorious at the WTA Finals? I'm looking at you, Jess Pegula, Mirra Andreeva, Amanda Anisimova, Jasmine Paolini ... or perhaps someone else? Gauff did it last year, winning in Riyadh after not winning a Slam.

-- Brad Kallet

 

With four Grand Slam champions in 2025 and no single player able to dominate, the season now shifts to its decisive phase. Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka are among the many players who face different tests.

Felix Auger-Aliassime has reignited his push to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the second time in his career after a dazzling run to the US Open semi-finals.

With just two months remaining before the prestigious season finale, the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin is heating up. Novak Djokovic and Alex de Minaur also made gains during their campaigns at the year's final major in New York.

ATPTour.com looks at the biggest movers in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin as of Monday, 8 September.



Felix Auger-Aliassime - 10th (2,705 points), +8
After a strong early-season that included titles in Adelaide and Montpellier, Auger-Aliassime looked well-positioned for a Nitto ATP Finals spot. A patchy mid-season dimmed these hopes, but his US Open resurgence has firmly put him back in the mix.

The 25-year-old Canadian earned consecutive wins over third seed Alexander Zverev, Andrey Rublev and De Minaur to reach the semi-finals, leaving him just two places shy of qualification in the Live Race.

Novak Djokovic - third (4,180), +2
Novak Djokovic continued his ultra-clean Grand Slam season, advancing to a fourth straight major semi-final in New York before bowing out to eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz. The 38-year-old Serbian joined Jannik Sinner as the only men to reach the semi-finals at all four majors this year.

The record seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion, who also won his 100th tour-level trophy this year in Geneva, climbed two spots to third in the Live Race.

Alex de Minaur - seventh (3,145), +1
Last year, De Minaur made his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals, becoming the first Australian to qualify since Lleyton Hewitt in 2004. Following his run to the US Open quarter-finals this year, the 26-year-old looks in good standing to return to Turin. De Minaur, who won his first title of the season in Washington in July, boasts a Tour-leading 28 wins on hard courts in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Lorenzo Musetti - eighth (3,070), +1
After a slow start to the North American swing, Lorenzo Musetti turned things around in New York by reaching his first major quarter-final on hard courts. With the breakthrough, the 23-year-old is back inside the qualification spots for Turin, where he is aiming to make his debut. Musetti holds a 30-13 record this season, highlighted by semi-final appearances at all three-clay court ATP Masters 1000 events and Roland Garros.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have already qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, taking place from 9-16 November at Inalpi Arena in Turin.

At the 2025 US Open, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner faced off in a third consecutive major final.Alcaraz had previously prevailed in dramatic fashion at Roland Garros in June, before Sinner erased the painful memories of three missed championship points by denying the Spaniard a three-peat at Wimbledon a month later to snap a five-match losing streak in their series.In Queens, the rubber match tipped in favor of Alcaraz. With his four-set victory, the 22-year-old became the second youngest man to win six majors (Bjorn Borg) and overtook Sinner for world No. 1, three years on at the very place where he first rose to the top spot on the back of his maiden Grand Slam triumph over Casper Ruud.

The two have now battled 15 times, with Alcaraz coming out on the winning end 10 times. A look at their history:2021 Paris Masters R32: Alcaraz wins, 7-6 (1), 7-5The match was what most of us expected: A toe-to-toe shootout with no punches pulled, and not much that separated the two players. Alcaraz won because he was more aggressive in the first-set tiebreaker—and also because he won two points on net cords—and because he kept up a relentless pressure on Sinner in the second set. “I'm still learning, gaining experience.” READ MORE

Neither competitor had much grass-court experience to their name coming in. On this day, Sinner out-served his budding rival when it mattered most to book his first quarterfinal at the All England Club Though Alcaraz managed to extend his stay by saving two match points in a tiebreaker, Sinner remained locked in at the service line from start to finish. The No. 10 seed saved all seven break points he faced on the day, with six of those coming in the fourth set across three different games, to get the upper hand. “He had chances today.

On his first set point, Alcaraz torched an untouchable crosscourt backhand. From there, the match was largely in Alcaraz's control. He broke Sinner's serve at 0-1 in the second game and never faced a break point throughout the second set. At 40-30, on his second match point, the Spaniard unloaded another crosscourt forehand that Sinner couldn't reach. “This is a tournament that I love playing.” READ MORE2023 Miami SF: Sinner wins, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-2Sinner knew that if he could keep it close, Alcaraz's brilliance could turn, for just long enough, to recklessness.

Both players had the same amount of winners—19—but Alcaraz was by far the steadier of the two, hitting 14 fewer unforced errors, 24 to 38. The Spaniard's forehand was the shot of the day, numbers-wise, with 16 winners to 11 unforced errors., battling back from a first-set blow-out to snap the Italian's incredible 19-match winning streak. “You have to be strong mentally if you want to overcome these kinds of matches.” READ MORE2024 Roland Garros SF: Alcaraz wins, 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3Whatever the reason, or reasons, this edition of Sinner vs. Alcaraz took a long time—three hours, to be exact—to take flight in the way we had hoped.

Their Beijing final was played on a faster court than normal, and there was a quick, clipped, rapid-fire, kill-or-be-killed feel to the rallies. Neither guy had time to do much other than go a shot that would hurt the other.

Alcaraz's win took 5 hours and 29 minutes, making it the longest final in Roland Garros history. Between them, they hit 1,433 ground strokes. Sinner, the loser, won 193 points; Alcaraz, the winner, won 192. Each broke serve seven times. And each staged one improbable comeback. It ended, after all of that, with Alcaraz raising his game to a place where even Sinner couldn't go.

The matchup had promised another chapter in one of tennis' fastest-growing rivalries. But Sinner, the defending champion, struggled to hit both his serve and his forehand. He retired after dropping his serve for the third time. He would later reveal he was unwell, telling the crowd, “I tried to come out, trying to make it even in a small match, but I couldn't handle more.” Alcaraz, the 2023 finalist, signed the camera lens with a simple message: “Sorry Jannik!” READ MORE2025 US Open F: Alcaraz wins, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4The No. 2 seed secured a two-sets-to-one lead in just under two hours.

The match was delayed by 30 minutes due to heightened security measures at Arthur Ashe Stadium during a visit from U.S. President Donald Trump, one of several high-profile guests at Flushing Meadows this weekend.That didn't rattle Alcaraz, who was in peak form all tournament and didn't drop a set en route to the final—a run that included a semifinal victory over 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic. Against Sinner, the Spaniard served up a hard-court masterclass, hitting 10 aces and winning 83% of his first-serve points.Sinner, on the other hand, made just 48% of first serves and looked to be always on the back foot against the quicker, sharper Alcaraz.“I was very predictable today,” Sinner said. “On court, in the way of he did many things, he changed up the game. That's also his style of how he plays.“Now it's going to be on me if I want to make changes or not, you know? Definitely we are going to work on that.”

In fact, he's willing to take some big risks in order to make those changes happen, as he explains in Tennis.com's Quote of the Day:JANNIK SINNER: I was very predictable today. On court in the way of he did many things, he changed up the game... Now, it's going to be on me if I want to make changes or not, you know? Definitely, we are going to work on that.I'm trying to be more prepared for the next match what I will play against him…I'm going to aim to, you know—maybe even losing some matches from now on—but trying to do some changes, trying to be a bit more unpredictable as a player, because I think that's what I have to do to become a better tennis player.At the end of the day, that's my main goal…

NEW YORK—When Carlos Alcaraz lost his Wimbledon title to Jannik Sinner, he went back to the drawing board. Literally.🖥️📱Tennis Channel Live at the US Open: Stream at 7 p.m. ET Saturday and SundayIn his post-victory press conference at the 2025 US Open, Alcaraz explained how the four-set defeat to Sinner inspired the Spaniard and his team to break down what went wrong at SW19 so he would be ready in time for a Flushing Meadows rematch:Q. In the Wimbledon final, it felt like the match was played more on his terms, lots of baseline rallies. Today you were able to bring in more of your slices and spins and that kind of thing. I just wondered what you thought the difference was how you were able to get on top today?CARLOS ALCARAZ: Yeah, I studied that match. I studied the Wimbledon final. As I said, I spoke with my coaches, and we saw the Wimbledon final, and yeah, we spoke about what we would have done better in that match just in case I'm going to face him in another time.We watch it. We put everything, or we note everything, and we work on it. We just played that game. It doesn't matter. At the beginning, we thought, okay, it doesn't matter if you lose or he wins or I win. I just wanted to do the right things. If I'm doing the right things and he plays unbelievable match and he beat you, it's okay, but at least you did the right things.I think today worked really well. I did everything they told me that I had to do, and it worked. It worked pretty well.

All that studying—which began (almost) immediately after Wimbledon—clearly paid off for the Spaniard, who served out a speedy four-set win of his own in Sunday's championship match over Sinner, dethroning the defending champion and reclaiming the top spot in the ATP rankings.“I just thought about the specific things I want to improve if I want to beat Jannik,” Alcaraz explained after clinching his sixth Grand Slam victory. “So, I just spent two weeks before Cincinnati just practicing specific some things about my game that I need or I felt like I need to improve if I want to beat Jannik.”Alcaraz's improvements seem to have had a similar effect on Sinner, who walked away from the defeat feeling too “predictable” for his longtime rival, who now leads their head-to-head by 10 wins to 5.

“My style, yeah, it's about the variety that I have in a match,” said Alcaraz. “I feel I can do everything on court, to be honest: slices, drop shots, topspin, flat.“I had to work on that just not to make too many mistakes on the matches, so I just been working on that. Keeping that style, the variety, but at the same time being solid from the baseline that give me the opportunity to make the opponents in trouble.”Sinner now has four months to study this loss before taking the court for the 2026 Australian Open; how might each rival's analysis of the other affect “Sincaraz” clashes in the years to come?

Alcaraz and Sinner have become the preeminent rival of the modern men's game, 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic calling the duo “just too good” after losing to the former in the semifinals on Friday.“They seem to have very good team, very good strategy of training and approach to the tennis world.

Illness aside, Sinner has maintained the dominant form that took him to his first two major titles in 2024, defending his Australian Open win and dethroning Alcaraz at Wimbledon for his first major away from hard courts.

While Sinner came to the Open under a cloud when he was forced to withdraw from the revamped mixed doubles tournament, he took the court for singles in fine form, dropping just one set en route to the semifinals. Once there, he navigated four tricky sets against a resurgent Félix Auger-Aliassime, defeating the 2021 semifinalist to reach his fourth major final of the season.Though the 24-year-old Italian has enjoyed an uninterrupted reign atop the ATP rankings—racking up 65 consecutive weeks since his June 2024 accession—Alcaraz has remained his closest rival, trailing the Spaniard 5-9 in their head-to-head.Sinner snapped a five-match losing streak to Alcaraz at Wimbledon but fell behind early in their US Open rematch, Alcaraz winning a marathon first game to open the delayed final with a break. Alcaraz would continue pressuring the Sinner serve, winning just under half of return points played in the first set to claim a second break and claim a one-set lead at love.The second set nearly began like the first when Alcaraz engineered an early break point, but Sinner saved it and flipped the script on his rival three games later, passing Alcaraz at net for a love-break and subsequently held to build a 5-2 lead of his own.

After striking just two unforced errors in the opening set, Alcaraz struggled for consistency in the second, striking 11 errors to five winners, but nonetheless held on to force Sinner to serve for it out. Sinner stepped to the line and did just that, outrallying Alcaraz and earning two set points, converting the first when Alcaraz erred long off a forehand putaway.Alcaraz righted the ship in a major way in the third set, racing out to a 5-0 lead with helped from a cleaned-up ground game of nine winners to two errors.Sinner snuck in a crucial hold, but otherwise it was all Alcaraz and the No. 2 seed secured a two-sets-to-one lead in just under two hours.Under fire early in the fourth, Sinner saved two break points in the opening game—one with an audacious foray to net—but Alcaraz was undaunted, showing off some remarkable defense and pulling off a 31st winner of the match as star athlete Steph Curry looked on.Alcaraz kept pressing and earned another break point on the Sinner serve, converting off another forehand miss from the Italian and consolidating for 4-2, putting himself in touching distance of the title.

Serving to stay in the match two games later at 3-5, Sinner put down a brave hold but Alcaraz matched his rival's firepower when it came time to serve for the title. He landed a 79 mile-per-hour forehand winner to take a 30-0 lead and set up two championship points by drawing Sinner to net with a drop shot.In a near-reversal of the Roland Garros final—where Alcaraz roared back from match points down against Sinner—Sinner saved back-to-back championship points with some stellar play off the ground. But Alcaraz earned a third and made no mistake to clinch his second US Open triumph, squatting to the ground in disbelief.With Sunday's win, Alcaraz not only improves to 10-5 vs. Sinner and returns to No. 1, but he'll also take home a whopping $5 million dollars in prize money.

After suffering his seventh defeat in his past eight Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings with Carlos Alcaraz — a loss that also cost him the World No. 1 ranking — Jannik Sinner admits it's time for a change.

The 24-year-old Italian fell in four sets to Alcaraz in the US Open final on Sunday and, reflecting on the trajectory of their rivalry, he vowed to shake things up. Speaking in his post-tournament press conference, Sinner acknowledged he had become too ‘predictable' and stressed the need to evolve his game if he hopes to turn the tables.

“I was very predictable today on court. He did many things, he changed up the game. That's also his style of how he plays. Now it's going to be on me if I want to make changes or not,” Sinner said after his 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 defeat. “That's definitely [what] we are going to work on. I'm trying to be more prepared for the next match that I will play against him.

“It also depends on how you arrive to play against Carlos. One thing is when the scoreline [or] matches before are comfortable but you always do the same things, like I did, for example, during this tournament, I didn't make one serve-volley, didn't use a lot of drop shots, and then you arrive to a point where you play against Carlos where you have to go out of the comfort zone.

“So I'm going to aim to maybe even lose some matches from now on, but trying to do some changes, trying to be a bit more unpredictable as a player, because I think that's what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player. At the end of the day, that's my main goal.”

Sinner had been virtually untouchable on hard courts in recent years, arriving in the final at Flushing Meadows on a 27-match unbeaten streak at majors on the surface. Yet Alcaraz has now defeated him four straight times on what has long been Sinner's strongest ground.

The foundation of Sinner's dominance has been his ability to blast through opponents from the baseline, a weapon he used to defeat Alcaraz for his first Wimbledon title in July. But with the No. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings on the line at the US Open, Sinner was simply outplayed by Alcaraz, who hit double the amount of winners (42 to 21) throughout their two-hour, 42-minute battle.

“He has improved. I felt like [he] was a bit cleaner today. The things I did well in London, he did better today,” Sinner said, comparing their battles at Wimbledon and the US Open. “That's [the] result. I felt like he was doing everything slightly better today, especially serving, both sides, both swings very clean.

“I think that's it, I give lots of credit to him, because he handled the situation better than I did. He raised his level when he had to. I'm still proud of myself, about the season I'm playing and making, but yeah, he played better than me today.”

Although Sinner was unable to defend his US Open crown and will slip to World No. 2 on Monday, he is proud of the achievements he has made across 2025. With titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon and runs to the final at Roland Garros and the US Open, Sinner became just the fourth man in the Open Era to reach the championship match at all four Grand Slams in a season.

“Overall, the season result-wise, amazing,” said Sinner. “Four Grand Slam finals of the year. Two Grand Slams won, two times lost in the final, it's incredible results, no? [I'm] very happy, and now we try to finish the year as strong as we can.”

Having been knocked off his 65-week reign atop the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner finds himself in the role of the chaser rather than the hunted — a shift in perspective he admits could prove valuable.

“Sometimes adding just something, and I think that's going to be or that's going to make a difference from my personal point of view that I can say that I'm going to become a better tennis player,” said Sinner.

“I'm going to change a couple of things on the serve, just small things, but they can make big differences. Then we see how it goes. I'm looking forward to playing these matches again. Something new is now I'm not No. 1 anymore, so it also changes a little bit that you chase.”



Sinner will leave New York with a 37-5 record on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Although he is now 2,590 points adrift of Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, the reigning Nitto ATP Finals champion will look to close the gap in the season's final stretch as their battle for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours continues.

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Verstappen hands the lead to Norris after cutting the first corner

Fred Vasseur was full of praise for the Ferrari fans at Monza, as Lewis Hamilton experienced his first Italian Grand Prix with the Scuderia.

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur paid tribute to the passionate Tifosi at Monza, who flocked to the track in huge numbers to support the Scuderia, saying they energised seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton across the Italian Grand Prix weekend..

While the Scuderia could not deliver a podium for their fans at their home race, Charles Leclerc managed to come home fourth and Hamilton sixth – the latter improving from P10 on the grid after taking a five-place penalty.

For Hamilton, it was his first taste of the Italian Grand Prix as a Ferrari driver, something he said he had been looking forward to all season long. The fans embraced the seven-time World Champion all weekend long – and even before the drivers made it to Monza, with Ferrari running some special events for the Tifosi in Milan.

Hamilton's mood seemed buoyed when he spoke to the media across the weekend – and his boss was clear as to the cause.

“I think the energy that he received from the Tifosi Wednesday, Thursday in [Milan] was something very special for him," said Vassuer after the Italian Grand Prix. "I don't know if it was expected from him or I don't know what he was expecting from this, but it was something mega and I think this gave him an extra boost all over the weekend.

“Even tonight when he went to the fans to say hello and the Tifosi was something mega. I don't know if you underestimate this or not, that we didn't discuss too much about this, but I think, and even for me, each time that I'm going there I'm surprised.

“We didn't do the race of our life, we were expecting to be at least on the podium, we are not, but they are still there, they are still enthusiastic, still pushing and it's why I'm a bit disappointed that we were not able to give them a podium this weekend.

“But I'm really convinced that it's part of the energy into the team and the positive energy around Lewis this weekend.”

Ferrari looked on the pace from the start at Monza, with Hamilton topping FP1 from his team mate. Leclerc was second in all three practice sessions, and in the mix for the front row in Qualifying until the final runs.

But Ferrari did not quite have the pace to challenge for the podium during the race, although Leclerc gave the fans plenty to cheer thanks to some wheel-to-wheel racing with Oscar Piastri.

The crowd also loved watching Hamilton scythe his way back through the pack from P10 on the grid, ultimately finishing sixth behind former team mate George Russell.

“We had to serve the penalty, and we knew from the beginning of the weekend that with plus five it's not an easy one, but [Hamilton] came back behind Russell and the pace was there from the first lap of FP1 to the last lap of the race,” Vasseur explained.

“Honestly, I think this started in Zandvoort last week. It's difficult to say because the outcome of the weekend was not positive for him, but at the end of the day, the pace was better from the beginning, compared to Charles, the mood was better.

“During the race, he was fighting with Russell until Lap 30, that means that he was back in a better position.”

Sixth was Hamilton's best Grand Prix finish since his fourth at Silverstone, and ended a run of two races outside the points. He has yet to finish on the Grand Prix rostrum this year, but Vasseur is convinced that is going to change in the last eight races.

“[Hamilton] was able to fight with Russell in Zandvoort, to come back from P10 to the gearbox of Russell today," he added. "Russell was a couple of times on the podium, [so] yes we can expect him to be on the podium.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Verstappen hands the lead to Norris after cutting the first corner

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz react to their respective P7 and P11 respctive finishing positions at the Italian Grand Prix.

There were mixed fortunes for Williams in the Italian Grand Prix as Alex Albon walked away from Monza with a hatful of points, while team mate Carlos Sainz was left frustrated by a difficult afternoon that saw contact and a battery issue derail his challenge.

Following a difficult Qualifying that saw both cars exit in Q2, Williams opted to split strategies for Sunday's Grand Prix – starting Albon on the hard tyre and Sainz on the mediums. The former ran a long opening stint, which saw him climb up into the top 10 and run as high as fifth at times, mixing it with the leading cars.

Even after he pitted, Albon managed to hold onto a points paying position and was rewarded with seventh at the flag – finishing as the lead midfield car.

“Fantastic strategy and great car pace, I think those two together, you are going to have a good time of it,” Albon explained as he reflected on his race.

“Honestly… It was meant to be a tough race on paper but actually we were the first hard car once everyone pitted. I don't want to call it an easy race, but the car was really nice to drive. One of the best Sundays balance-wise I've had all year.

“It always seems when we run the low downforce cars, our balance improves as well. Many parts of that race we were just as quick as the top teams. It was a great comeback from a tough Saturday.”

Albon's points keep Williams clear of Aston Martin in the fight for fifth in the Teams' Championship, while the Thai driver sits seventh in the Drivers' standings – moving ahead of Kimi Antonelli in the Mercedes.

“It proves we have a consistent car, it has been one of the biggest focus points for us last year and this year," Albon continued. "That is proving to be working and even at the same time, even when Saturdays are miserable we end up back in the points, I don't even know how!

“I'll keep it going, I'm enjoying it and I'll try and battle Kimi until Abu Dhabi.”

But while Albon was left overjoyed with how his race unfolded in Italy, the same could not be said for his team mate. Sainz has endured more than his fair share of bad luck this season – and more befell the Spaniard at Monza.

He started on the mediums – the same strategy as the majority of the field – but a mix of a battery issue and contact with Ollie Bearman's Haas, saw him come home in 11th – meaning he still has not scored in a Grand Prix since Canada back in June.

“We were the last of the medium starters I think and it was always going to be difficult to make a comeback on the same strategy as everyone in front of me but we actually extended the medium quite a long way and we were doing a good comeback on the hard,” Sainz explained.

“Quicker than Bearman in front, quicker than Bortoleto, we were going to start passing at that stage but when I went for a move with Ollie, unfortunately we touched. That pretty much ruined my race, I got damage and yeah, not the easiest race.

“We also ran into some battery issues so a difficult day in the office.”

Sainz has more than once this year found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time – just last week he was penalised after contact with Liam Lawson, he made contact with Charles Leclerc at Silverstone while brake and gearbox issues prevented him even starting the race in Austria.

Sainz was asked what he can do to arrest his bad luck, with the Spaniard replying: “Keep pushing, like my Qualifying pace is there, my race pace is there so at some point it will finish. But, not going to lie, it is starting to get frustrating and rather depressing.”

I told myself that I wouldn't say that “Eternity” is too long, but isn't it always? If not the premise, that is at least the guiding principle behind David Freyne's sincere, somewhat amusing, and sweetly overextended rom-com, which splits the difference between “After Life” and “Defending Your Life” with its story of a newly deceased woman named Joan (Elizabeth Olsen) being forced to choose which of her two husbands — the smoldering Luke who died in the Korean War (Callum Turner), or the absolute Larry she was married to for the 67 years that followed (Miles Teller) — she'd like to join forever in the great beyond. Each of the fellas has their upsides (Luke is hot, and Larry is comfortable), but committing to either of them until the end of time seems like a pretty bleak proposal. Likewise, none of the gimmicky themed realms that Joan is offered to “live in” — Capitalist World, Studio 54 World, Weimar World, (“Now with 100% less Nazis!”) — feel like the kind of place you'd want to spend more than a few hours, let alone several billion years. “‘Til death do us part” is romantic, practical, and offset by the backdoor insurance policy of divorce. “‘Til the sun explodes, and then maybe even longer after that” is an ungodly prison sentence. Freyne's hyper-agnostic film may not believe in heaven or hell, but it has some pretty vivid ideas of what the latter could look like.A more ambitious — and less conservative — movie might have used this premise to dig a bit deeper into the commitments that people make to each other on this mortal coil, but “Eternity” is content to circle the idea that life is beautiful and worth treasuring because it doesn't last forever. That much is clear from the moment Freyne and Pat Cunnane's high-concept script (a real Black List special) first drops us into the Hyatt-like Junction where souls process what's happened and have seven days to pick their final destinations from a variety of convention floor displays. The options range from bleak to bleaker, as everything about the set-up exudes all the romance and splendor of shopping for a time share. It's enough to make us yearn for the gender reveal party where Larry choked to death on a pretzel; at least that came with the promise of an ending.

But the film's characters are too caught up in their post-mortem love triangle to realize they're essentially fighting over what meal Joan should choose to eat every single day of her infinite afterlife: her favorite comfort food, or a rare delicacy she's been fantasizing about ever since her last taste of it in 1953. Larry is the first dead person we follow into the Junction, and like everyone else his physical form reverts to reflect how it looked when he was at his happiest, which for him was in his mid-30s after he first got married. Cute. The kind of nondescript everyman who loved to complain even though he walked through life without much want or trouble, Larry feels like a guy you'd meet in the buffet line on a cruise ship. He's as nice as he is nondescript, and the jaded but personable Afterlife Coordinator assigned to his case (Da'Vine Joy Randolph as Anna) can't wait to meet and forget her next client.That changes, and how, when Anna realizes that the Junction's handsome local bartender is Joan's first love, and that Joan is the reason he took a service job in purgatory rather than choose a permanent vacation in paradise; Luke has been pouring beer and scrubbing glasses for more than half a century in the hopes that he and Joan might be reunited when she dies. Which, conveniently enough, she does just a few moments before Larry is meant to board a train for the godforsaken eternity he's chosen for himself (Beach World). Suddenly, and to the great delight of both Anna and her fellow AC, Ryan (John Early), there's some real juicy drama in the Junction. Which man will Joan choose, Captain America or the guy whose farts she's had to smell for the last six decades? Like a metaphysical riff on Netflix's “The Ultimatum,” she'll get a trial run with both of them before having to make up her mind. “Eternity” does what it can to leverage its heady concept into a heart-stirring tale of love and longing, but the world-building — or lack thereof — invariably gets in the way of the emotion that Freyne is hoping to generate from it. While the movie's three-sided romance is never quite as artificial as the Junction where so much of it takes place, its angles lose their sharpness over the course of a story that has so much scenery to attend to, and each of its main characters is left to fight an uphill battle against the archetype that threatens to define them. The cast is game for the challenge (and fun to watch do the “old people in A24-era bodies” thing), even if their best efforts aren't quite enough to give “Eternity” the emotional undertow it needs to become more than a semi-charming thought exercise. Teller's upbeat, go-with-the-flow charm makes him easy to accept as a simple guy who just wants — and expects — his afterlife to resemble the one he left on Earth, and the fact that he's more of a leading man than a characer actor lends an extra zing to the constant jokes about how much hotter Callum Turner is, like any of us could hope to compete with the future Mr. Lipa (someone in the movie compares Luke to Montgomery Clift, and Turner channels that matinee idol energy to a tee). Olsen, meanwhile, has the most thankless and important role in the story, but her mid-century war bride routine is charming enough to make the whole thing feel effortless, and the interiority she rescues from the script only makes it more convincing that two good-looking men would fight each other to — or is it from? — the death to be with her forever. While Joan flip-flops about her feelings more often than John Kerry on the campaign trail (a painfully outdated reference that's still a few decades too recent for Larry to use or Luke to understand), her anguish is palpable enough to anchor the movie to something real as it runs between different fantasy worlds. For their part, Early and Randolph both feel held down in a less fortunate way; much as this gifted pair compensates for the comedy that “Eternity” can't wring out of its leads (and have solid chemistry to boot), you can almost feel them being smothered by the schematic nature of a story that doesn't have room for them to cut loose. It's a story that's better told by its setting than with its action — one that doesn't really go anywhere, and still takes the scenic route to get there. In that light, Zazu Myers' production design probably deserves top billing here. We don't get to see enough of the Junction to disabuse us of the sense that it's a glorified Broadway backdrop (complete with painted skylines and cloth scrims to indicate whether it's day or night), but the well-observed tackiness of its mid-century aesthetic, and the related impression that purgatory didn't exist until Don Draper invented it as an advertising opportunity, helps underscore the idea that life in any realm is only as tolerable as the people with whom you choose to spend it. “Eternity,” however doesn't have any interest in that kind of cynicism, to the point that it forgoes the most logical ending — a shared embrace of the void — for a different kind of forever. In doing so, it somewhat forfeits the film's prevailing message — that life is beautiful as a result of its brevity and occasional bitterness — in favor of a more digestible morale about the paradises we create for ourselves here on Earth. It's a fitting compromise for such a pleasantly unobjectionable rom-com; one that's scared of forever, but takes almost just as long just to end up back where it started. 

 










“Eternity” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. A24 will release the film in select theaters on November 14 before expanding on November 26.

	At long last, Michael Stipe is offering answers to questions that have long plagued R.E.M. fans: What the hell is he actually saying on “It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)”?


	The single from R.E.M.'s 1987 album Document is a masterpiece of rock & roll stream-of-consciousness with Stipe striking that perfect balance of cheery and apocalyptic as he unloads a torrent of pop culture references and koans. Certain parts of the song were always easy to distinguish — “Leonard Bernstein!” — but the sheer volume of Stipe's volubility has led to plenty of lyrical misreadings over the years, exacerbated by R.E.M.'s decision not to print song lyrics in their album liner notes.


	But last week, Stipe started to clear up some of the most mysterious lines from “It's the End of the World” on BlueSky. (The exercise was inspired by, of all things, a Simpsons meme, and not even the actual scene with an R.E.M. guest appearance and Homer belting out obviously-wrong lines like, “Leonard, what's-his-name, Herman Munster, motorcade, birthday party, Cheetos.”)

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The first two he clarified were, “Left of west and coming in a hurry with the Furies breathing down your neck”; and “Team by team reporters, baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped, look at that low playing, fine, then.”


	To give a sense of just how easy it is to encounter incorrect lyrics, the “It's the End of the World” page on Genius has those two lines listed as: “Left her and wasn't coming in a hurry with the Furies/Breathing down your neck” and “Team by team, reporters baffled, trump, tethered, crop/Look at that low plane, fine, then.” 

	











	Although further proving just how confounding the lyrics are, Stipe's R.E.M. bandmate Mike Mills chimed in to say he thought the line was actually “that low plane, fine, then,” telling Stipe, “I remember you said it was from a roadside sign about watch out for low planes flying.” 


	Stipe replied, “I'm doing my best. Thx Mike!”

	Over the weekend, Stipe cleared up a couple more lines from “It's the End of the World”: “Feed it off an aux, speak, grunt no strength, the ladder start to clatter with fear fight down height, wire in a fire representing seven games, a government for hire and a combat site.” And, “Uh-oh, overflow, population ‘common food, but it'll do,' save yourself, serve yourself, world serves its own needs — listen to your heart bleed, dummy with the raptured and the revered and the right, right.” 


	He also addressed the futility of trying to discern other R.E.M. lyrics, especially off their early albums Chronic Town, Murmur, and Reckoning. To those looking to sing along or cover those tunes, Stipe advised: “Just form vowels and syllables, and mean it.”

If Dwayne Johnson really is going indie and becoming an artiste after working with Benny Safdie on “The Smashing Machine,” the only logical next step would be to reunite The Rock with Safdie in an even stranger role: The Chicken Man.

Coming very quickly off Johnson's awards buzz for “The Smashing Machine” and Safdie's Best Director win at Venice where the film made its world premiere, Safdie and Johnson are reuniting again for a package that would star Johnson and that Safdie would write and direct, an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire. It's about to be shopped to buyers (looking at you A24).

 










The film is called “Lizard Music,” and it's based on a 1976 young adult science fiction novel by author Daniel Pinkwater. Suffice it to say, the premise is bonkers. It's about a boy who stays up late watching TV, he stumbles across a broadcast featuring actual lizards playing music in a band. As he tries to learn more about them, he meets The Chicken Man (Johnson), who is aware of the lizards and may be from outer space and about to lead an invasion. The official logline does little to make it more sensical:

 








Related Stories ‘Eternity' Review: Elizabeth Olsen Has to Choose Her Own Heaven in an A24 Rom-Com That's Stuck in Purgatory ‘Nuremberg' Review: Yes, It Seems the World Still Needs to Be Reminded of the Horrors of WWII 

When a boy left to his own devices stumbles upon a secret late-night broadcast of lizards playing otherworldly music, a hidden door to the extraordinary swings open. His search for answers leads him to the eccentric and whimsical Chicken Man and his beloved companion, a seventy-year-old chicken named Claudia — two kindred spirits who have also glimpsed the impossible. United by this shared vision, they set off on an adventure that begins as a hunt for a hidden society but blossoms into something far greater: a voyage through invisible worlds, unexpected harmonies, and the unbreakable bond between lost souls who discover magic not only in what they find, but in each other.

The Rock playing an MMA fighter in a biopic seems within the realm of possibility, but whatever this is definitely appears to be taking him out of his wheelhouse. Johnson would also produce the film through his Seven Bucks Productions, and he'd be teaming with Safdie and “Smashing Machine” producer David Koplan. 

Reviews for “The Smashing Machine” were strong, with IndieWire writing that the film is a “sweet duet between a remarkably unembellished Johnson and a blazingly good, blue-collar and freshly blown-out Emily Blunt.” And though its not your typical awards bait, we also told you to believe the hype The Rock was cooking. A24 successfully charted Brendan Fraser and “The Whale” to an Oscar by rebranding Fraser as a serious actor, and the distributor is using the same blueprint for Johnson.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate has put in motion a sequel to The Last Witch Hunter, to star Vin Diesel in a reprise of his role as Kaulder, the immortal Witch Hunter. The film is being developed along with Diesel's One Race Films and Lionsgate, with all parties eyeing a fast path to production. While a deal has not been finalized, Michael Caine is attached to reprise his role as Dolan in the new film. 


	The move goes with Lionsgate strategy to grow IP with staying power and sci-fi fantasy spectacle elements that can overperform in the ancillary markets and create long-term library value. The Last Witch Hunter, about the one man who stands between humanity and the most horrible witch covens imaginable, grossed $130 million at the worldwide box office at the time of its initial theatrical release in 2015. The pic has performed consistently in ancillary markets and re-emerged as a streaming hit this year; it ranks among the five most-viewed movies on Netflix. Advancements in technology since then should allow a sequel to be brought on a more efficient budget expenditure. The rest of the elements will be conjured up quickly.

	











	Said Adam Fogelson, chair of Lionsgate's Motion Picture Group: “The Last Witch Hunter has grown since its theatrical release into a global fan favorite, with audiences continuing to discover and re-watch it across every platform over the past decade. That enduring enthusiasm made clear there is an appetite for more stories set in this world. Vin and I have partnered many times over the years, and he is a true force in our industry. I'm thrilled to be reuniting with him as he returns to this iconic role, and excited by how advancements in filmmaking technology now allow us to economically deliver a sequel on an even more ambitious scale.”

This is out of left field. Michael is gonna come out of retirement for this?!

Of course he is! Michael Caine missed receiving his Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters because he was filming Jaws 4 and getting $1 million dollars for 2 weeks work. I bet he's getting the equivalent of that today, $3 million for a quick week's work. That doesn't mean the film will be good, in fact it will probably be pretty terrible, and a lot worse than the original film that sucked. The bar is pretty low for what Diesel fans expect these days, so it'll probably be a cheap b-movie with an extreme straight-to-streaming look. Vin's career is on the way down the ladder, but he's got enough of a fan base that he'll avoid having to sell his soul to the likes of Corey Large and Edward Drake like some other's have.

Michael Caine on Jaws 4: Caine famously admitted to never having seen Jaws: The Revenge, calling it one of the worst movies he ever made, but defended the decision by saying it was worth it to buy the house for his mother, which he described as “marvelous”.

What a completely unhinged response.

Paycheck. Remmember he also did Jaws Revenge for paycheck.

Doing everything but riddick 4

Jay Harrington and Patrick St. Esprit are set to reprise their original roles from CBS' S.W.A.T. in the show's spinoff series S.W.A.T. Exiles, reteaming with Shemar Moore in the pilot episode. Harrington and St. Esprit played Sergeant David ‘Deacon' Kay and Commander Robert Hicks, respectively, in the mothership series. 


	The news will be a welcome surprise for fans, who have been heartbroken and outspoken since their early exits from S.W.A.T., and learning later from Harrington that he was unaware of the offshoot until a day before the media announcement, when Moore texted him.

	When asked if he would be interested in coming back for the spinoff, he said, “You know, you never say never, you never close any doors. I'd be interested to see if that's the direction they go, and ‘How do they do that?' That would certainly play a part. I've also had a great time directing over the years, and I'll be open to that possibility if that call [to direct] comes as well. You never say never.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sony Pictures TV boss Katherine Pope, around the time of the fan backlash, teased that franchise favorites could return in Exiles.


	Whether Harrington and St. Esprit will appear in further episodes remains unclear. 


Exiles is set after a high-profile mission goes sideways, pulling Sgt. Daniel ‘Hondo' Harrelson (Moore) out of forced retirement to lead a last-chance experimental S.W.A.T. unit made up of untested, unpredictable young recruits. 

	











	Production is set to begin later this month in Los Angeles, preserving jobs for the 200-person local production crew that has been instrumental to the success of the original series for the last eight seasons, according to a release from Sony. 


	Jason Ning serves as showrunner and executive producer. Additional executive producers include Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty of Original Film, as well as Moore, James Scura, and Jon Cowan. Sony Pictures Television produces and distributes the 10-episode series globally. No current network or streamer has been announced for the U.S. or other territories.


	Harrington is best known for his roles in S.W.A.T. and as Ted Crisp in Victor Fresco's comedy series Better Off Ted. He can previously be seen recurring in ABC's Desperate Housewives and the medical drama series Private Practice, as well as CBS' Code Black. In addition to his television work, Harrington has made appearances in feature films American Reunion and High Low Forty. He is repped by UTA, A Management Company, and Brecheen Feldman Breimer.


	St. Esprit has recurred on TV shows including The Shield, Saving Grace, Chicago Code, Revolution, Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, NCIS: LA, Narcos, Ballers, and Unsolved. On the feature side, his credits include United 93, Green Zone, We Were Soldiers, HBO's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Smokin' Aces, Super 8, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Last of Robin Hood, Draft Day, Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence, War Dogs, and The Fate of the Furious. He is repped by Justice & Ponder.

I'm definitely not faulting him for taking the job.  (Always take the job unless you have a sure thing lined up.)  That said, Harrington is too good an actor for this material.  I was hoping this would give him the opportunity to really act in something good.

Late in James Vanderbilt's “Nuremberg” (a fraught title, but still better than the book the film is based on, the chewy “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist”), we finally get to the necessary. Most people who hear the word “Nuremberg” these days — though certainly not all, a problem the film will attempt to grapple with — inevitably picture the German city where the 1945 and 1946 trials of some of the Nazi's highest-ranking leaders took place. Those trials were vividly brought to life in Stanley Kramer's 1961 classic “Judgment at Nuremberg,” which notably included real footage of the Nazi concentration camps to illustrate some of the horrors that were perpetrated by the accused (and, of course, later convicted).

Vanderbilt attempts the same in his film's final act. As with Kramer's film, the footage nearly stops time, astonishing and horrifying and revolting, as the courtroom and its many inhabitants attempt to process what they are seeing. It's the darkest moment of a film that shouldn't need to crib liberally from its predecessor to make its mark, and yet does just that, repeatedly, and in a multitude of ways.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






In both feel and form, “Nuremberg” is either classic or staid, depending on your stomach for such films. All of it is necessary. None of it is new. If there are people who still need to be convinced that the Holocaust did indeed happen — and, tragically, yes, that seems to be the case these days — bits of “Nuremberg” might battle back their woeful misunderstandings. But in trying to sell the idea that what happened during World War II is timely above all else, the historic tragedy itself is forgotten. That the film is so deeply rooted in reminding people of the perils of politicizing hatred is a cruel irony; by making this about today, we lose the potent lessons of yesterday.

Based on Jack El-Hai's 2013 book and with a script by Vanderbilt, the film opens with punchy promise. It is the spring of 1945. Hitler is dead. The war is, in many respects (but crucially, not all), over. Hermann Göring (a deeply invested Russell Crowe) — the highest-ranking German military official of all time, a man so powerful in the Nazi party that he was given the title of Reichsmarschall, a designation created entirely for him and that made him superior to every single German military officer — has been arrested. And he, along with two dozen or so major Nazi players, has been thrown into a secret military prison as the Allies determine what they will do with them.

 










U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson (a restrained but still powerful Michael Shannon) has an idea: a trial, a tribunal, in which the Allies will come together to try and convict the Nazis. Jackson's idea (the film doesn't try to make the trial entirely his concept, but comes damn close) doesn't have much legal precedence, but he's convinced it's the only way to not only punish these evil-doers, but make them such pariahs that Germany wouldn't dare to rise again (just as they had after World War I and its own kind of punishments). At the same time that Jackson and his team are preparing the trial, the army dispatches psychiatrist Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek) to get into the prisoners' minds before they are tried.

But Kelley approaches the task with a twofold plan: He'd like to eventually write a book about what he discovers about his patients (like Göring, the good doctor was, at heart, pretty ambitious), one that will help everyone “dissect evil” so that we might battle it better. But while Jackson and Kelley should feel aligned in their aims, “Nuremberg” keeps them far apart and at odds, instead turning its attention on the growing bond between Kelley and Göring.

That Kelley and Göring become something like friends is essential to the entire thrust of the film and Kelley's eventual findings — there's nothing inherently different about these evil men, and they may even be able to sway good men to their side through charming chatter and shared experience — but it's delivered in the most plain-faced way possible. There is no cat-and-mouse here. There are few surprises. Kelley goes all-in too early (only a scene-stealing Leo Woodall, as an American solider with a secret, brings the appropriate level of dubiousness to the pair's exchanges). Early wins for Kelley (ah ha, Göring does understand English!) go nowhere. 

 










Instead, we watch the two men chatter and bicker, playing games both of the head and board variety, waiting for something — anything — to change between them. As Jackson and his team assemble a case and courtroom just feet from the war criminal's cells, “Nuremberg” tries to build its own arguments (the courtroom and cells, it must be noted, look fantastic, thanks to production designer Eve Stewart). It's never clear what they are. Göring is charming? Kelley is a stooge? The Nazi leaders didn't know anything? They knew everything? This is complicated stuff? It is, and it also isn't, but “Nuremberg” never quite finds that line.

Once Kelley starts visiting Göring's wife and daughter, getting cozy, teaching Göring's cute kiddo magic kids, and ferrying messages back and forth to boot, things get really sticky. What exactly is Kelley getting out of this? We're long past the doc ingratiating himself with Göring for information — and how silly to assume that either man was stupid enough to ever forget the very real power dynamics in their interactions — and so these visits seem to exist simply for discomfort's sake. 

That the real Kelley was married during this period is never mentioned (Kelley, in many ways, is wholly unknowable to us). That perhaps he missed his own wife (with whom he would go on to have three children) and wanted some temporary domestic comforts is never considered. Easy enough characterization, likely true, and yet fully skated over here. Malek is quite good in the role, thin as it might be, bringing real curiosity and confusion to Kelley, portraying him as someone inscrutable who really didn't want to be.

 










Despite the heavy nature of the film, there's an odd streak of peppiness to some of its proceedings. There are little asides about Göring's self-obsession that scan as funny (when he surrenders to the military, he only asks them to carry his luggage, hardy-har-har) and sequences that only flow because of snappy overlapping dialogue (“We'll never get Russia on board!” cut to “Sir, Russia is on board!”). It's a small distraction before the necessary: getting to the trial, getting to something closer to the truth, getting to testimony and not chatter.

By the time Vanderbilt unspools that same iconic, wrenching footage that Kramer used decades ago, its potency feels different. We've seen it all before. We need to see it again. But in the space between those two statements, “Nuremberg” can't find much new to say. Saying something old is certainly better than not saying anything at all, but how, at this moment, can we still be leaning on the old words and the old ways? There has to be something more. The future and the past demand it.

“Nuremberg” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics will release the film in theaters on Friday, November 7.

How do they have a season premiere when the show just keeps going without a break?

Let's Make a Deal seems like it has very little cultural significance. Not sure how that stays on the air but something like Supermarket Sweep doesn't.

As the KPop Demon Hunters smash reigns, Carpenter's "Tears" debuts at No. 3 and former leader "Manchild" bounds 7-4.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Couch, couch, couch will have to wait, as HUNTR/X works its way to a fourth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Golden,” from the soundtrack to the smash animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters.


	Upon the original ascent to No. 1 for “Golden,” HUNTR/X — the singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI (in the roles of the film's characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey) — became the first female group associated with Korean pop to crown the Hot 100.


KPop Demon Hunters has also become the first soundtrack to generate four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s over the chart's 67-year history. The songs place in the bracket for a third week, with Saja Boys' “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” each down a spot from their respective Nos. 4 and 5 bests and HUNTR/X's “How It's Done” holding at its No. 9 high.


	Also in the Hot 100's top 10, Sabrina Carpenter charts two songs: “Tears” launches at No. 3 and former leader “Manchild” climbs 7-4. Both tracks are from her new album, Man's Best Friend, which blasts in as her second No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Sept. 13, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Sept. 9. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.

In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 34.5 million official streams (down 2% week-over-week), 22.1 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 13%) and 9,000 sold (up 4%) in the United States Aug. 29-Sept. 4.


	The track secures a seventh week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; rises 29-24 on Radio Songs — as it hits the top 10, lifting two spots to No. 10, on the Pop Airplay chart; and adds a second week at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales.


	“Golden” is the ninth song associated with Korean pop to rule the Hot 100, and the first by female lead vocalists with ties to the genre. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.)


	“Golden” becomes just the second such song to post at least four weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Here's a recap:




	Plus, “Golden” ties for the fourth-longest Hot 100 command for a song by an all-female group of three or more members, dating to the first four-week No. 1 in the category in 1963:




	Sabrina Carpenter scores two songs in the Hot 100's top five: “Tears” debuts at No. 3 and former chart-topper “Manchild,” which led in its debut week in June, surges 7-4. Both cuts are from her new album, Man's Best Friend, which arrives atop the Billboard 200.


	“Tears” starts with 26.3 million streams (good for a No. 2 premiere on Streaming Songs), 11.9 million in airplay audience and 2,000 sold. Carpenter collects her fifth Hot 100 top 10, all since April of last year.


	“Manchild” drew 19.5 million streams (up 86%) and 49.3 million in radio reach (up 2%) and sold 2,000 (up 129%). It charges 25-5 on Streaming Songs, which it led for one week, and climbs 5-3 for a new high on Radio Songs.


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2, after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It tallies a 12th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73 million, down 1%).


	Below Carpenter and Saja Boys' two Hot 100 top 10s apiece, Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, slides 3-7, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It posts a 16th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” falls 6-8 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 5.


	Below HUNTR/X's “How It's Done,” which concurrently adds a 10th week at No. 1 on the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart, Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and went on to become the year's No. 1 song, drops 8-10. It logs a record-extending 107th week on the chart overall and a record-furthering 77th week in the top 10.

Over 1,300 filmmakers, actors, and other industry professionals have pledged to boycott Israeli film institutions that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” That figure comes from the advocacy group Film Workers for Palestine, which shared the pledge on Instagram today alongside an open letter elaborating on its aim to “‘do everything humanly possible' to end our complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza.” Many high profile names have signed on, including Ava DuVernay, Ayo Edebiri, Boots Riley, Brian Cox, Gael García Bernal, Hannah Einbinder, Javier Bardem, Josh O'Connor, Joshua Oppenheimer, Mark Ruffalo, Melissa Barrera, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Susan Sarandon, Tilda Swinton, and Yorgos Lanthimos. You can check out the full list of signatories here. 

In a press release, Film Workers for Palestine explained that the pledge was inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, a 1987 movement kicked off by Jonathan Demme, Martin Scorsese, and “100 other prominent filmmakers” to demand that the U.S. refuse to distribute films in apartheid South Africa. “As filmmakers, actors, film industry workers, and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions. In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror,” the letter states. “We pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions—including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies—that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” The letter further clarifies that “examples of complicity” include “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.”

This movement is the latest in a string of pledges and other boycotts from the film industry and beyond. Earlier this year, more than 300 filmmakers and actors (including many of the same artists that signed this week's pledge) published an open letter condemning the industry's “silence” in regard to the “horror of reality and the oppression suffered by our sisters and brothers” in Gaza. Many of these signatories also added their name to a mass call on SAG-AFTRA to instate protections for actors speaking out in support of Palestine last year. 

Other signatories include Adam McKay, Aimee Lou Wood, Benedict Wong, Brian Eno, Cynthia Nixon, Debra Winger, Emma Seligman, Ilana Glazer, Lukas Dhont, Morgan Spector, and Paapa Essiedu. You can read the full text of Film Workers for Palestine's open letter below:

As filmmakers, actors, film industry workers, and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions. In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.

The world's highest court, the International Court of Justice, has ruled that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza, and that Israel's occupation and apartheid against Palestinians are unlawful. Standing for equality, justice, and freedom for all people is a profound moral duty that none of us can ignore. So too, we must speak out now against the harm done to the Palestinian people.

We answer the call of Palestinian filmmakers, who have urged the international film industry to refuse silence, racism, and dehumanization, as well as to ‘do everything humanly possible' to end complicity in their oppression.

Inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid who refused to screen their films in apartheid South Africa, we pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions—including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies—that are implicated* in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.

* Examples of complicity include whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.

YouTube said its first-ever global stream of a live NFL game last Friday drew a total audience of 17.3 million people, including 1.1 million outside of the U.S.


	The average minute audience numbers for the Los Angeles Chargers–Kansas City Chiefs contest were a bit lower than a conventional NFL game on domestic broadcast. But for the league and YouTube, the game in Brazil represented a significant milestone as the first being available for free to a worldwide online audience.


	The U.S. numbers came from Nielsen, while YouTube self-reported the tune-in everywhere else.

	The Chargers upset of the Chiefs came in well ahead of a stream last year of a game in Brazil hosted by NBCUniversal's Peacock, which drew 14.2 million viewers. Netflix holds the record for the most popular NFL telecast ever streamed, with last Christmas Day's doubleheader averaging 24 million viewers.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Getting the stand-alone game into 230 countries and territories was a major priority for the NFL, which has ramped up its annual slate of games played outside of the U.S. Speculation has grown that a franchise could soon be awarded to a non-U.S. city. Games played in London have streamed for years, appearing previously on Twitter and Yahoo. 


	YouTube has had a partnership with the NFL since signing on to distribute its Sunday Ticket streaming package in 2023. As part of that deal, the Google-owned video platform began stepping up efforts to integrate league content into its creator community. 


	In keeping with the recent blending, top YouTube channel proprietor Deestroying was part of the broadcast crew, and alternate telecasts and watch parties also involved YouTube personalities. The game also featured new content from top creators MrBeast, Haley Kalil, Michelle Khare and Marques Brownlee. Colombian pop star Karol G performed during halftime.

They hid the live concurrent viewer count. This could easily just mean 17 million clicked on it for a few seconds. What was the peak concurrent viewership YouTube?

Did the count the views from creators they paid to livestream it? Kai Cenat had almost half a million concurrent viewers alone, and it was nonstop roasting of the NFL. Everyone hated getting this boomer shit shoved in their faces.

that was speed, not kai. but yeah.

That's gotta be way lower than what they wanted

Hangout shows usually apply to comedies like Seinfeld, Friends, Happy Endings, and, most recently, Adults. Hulu's Only Murders In The Building, however, has not-so-sneakily joined this category over the years. The series has become less and less the unique true-crime satire it started out as and more a show that coasts along on vibes and the strong chemistry of its leads. The hook here isn't the whodunit; it's spending time with Mabel Mora (Selena Gomez), Oliver Putnam (Martin Short), and Charles Haden Savage (Steve Martin). Any narrative flaws as they go around confronting killers and recording a podcast about it are easy to forgive amidst all of their banter. And the murder mysteries really serve one main purpose: to probe into the protagonists' deep friendship, individual psyches, and interpersonal relationships. 

After all, Mabel, Oliver, and Charles have gone from neighborly acquaintances battling loneliness to being the subjects of a Hollywood movie in no time, brushing shoulders with fans and celebrities along the way. Now, in a repetitive yet enjoyable fifth season, they come face to face with the mafia, wealthy CEOs, and a robot with potentially nefarious intentions. But it doesn't matter how many well-known faces join the cast (including Oscar winners Christoph Waltz, Renée Zellweger, and Dianne Wiest this year), how far the show's scope expands (from Long Island to Los Angeles), or how many bodies drop. OMITB‘s strength lies in the crackling conversations between the trio. And season five is no different, with debates about everything from The Godfather to therapy. In fact, with enough time under their belts in these roles, Gomez, Short, and Martin have never been better together, even if the material itself loses steam.  

The new episodes pick up on the heels of season four's finale, in which Arconia's precious doorman was found dead in the courtyard fountain the morning after Oliver and Loretta's (Meryl Streep) wedding. There's little time to mourn their fallen pal (the podcast isn't going to tape itself, alright?), and the list of people who could've bludgeoned Lester (Teddy Coluca) quickly becomes robust, especially once the three of them discover that a missing Staten Island gangster (played by Bobby Cannavale) and his wife, Sofia Caccimelio (Téa Leoni), might be involved. But, as Oliver puts it, they're part of the “old mob.” Different types of goons run New York City now: billionaires. In this case, he means tech whiz Bash Steed (Waltz), cocky pharma dude Jay Phlug (Logan Lerman), and Manhattan real-estate tycoon Camila White (Zellweger), as each of them has sordid ties to the Caccimelios and the Arconia. 

Perhaps the most logic-defying but fun part of OMITB is the apartment complex's crucial role as a main character. After taking detours to Broadway stages and Hollywood studio lots, the show's focus returns to the eclectic residents of the Arconia and the building itself, which is a Russian doll of sorts. The series has unveiled secret passageways and elevators, a west tower for renters, and a basement with an incinerator hidden within this complex. Even more historically relevant (and stunningly designed) spots get discovered in season five that, as Brazzos would say, send the investigation in a whole new direction. Unfortunately, that direction is frustratingly circular. 



Compelling aspects of Lester's murder or Nicky's vanishing act are marred by the wacky pacing. Major plot twists introduced in the fourth outing annoyingly don't get picked back up until much later. The new faces this season drop in infrequently, so Sofia, Bash, Camilla, and Jay just feel like half-baked red herrings instead of fully-formed figures. (To be fair, this is pretty much OMITB‘s M.O. at this point.) Then again, who cares about a serviceable whodunit when we get scenes of Martin and Richard Kind making bird noises or Streep (committed to pulling off the funniest accents) and Zellweger sipping drinks in a casino? At least the arrival of Mabel's old pal (played by Beanie Feldstein), who moves into the penthouse, leads to an identity crisis. OMITB works best when the absurd circumstances around the trio force them to reevaluate their journey so far. Season five achieves this through flashbacks of Oliver's troubled teen years, Mabel's history with the Arconia, and a dissection of why Charles is “attracted to psychos.” 

The show's appeal also stems from its unique lens into NYC's quirks. That's why a Lester-focused and -narrated second episode about doormen is OMITB‘s finest since season one's “The Boy From 6B.” In a lot of ways, season five harkens back to what made the series tick when in the first place. (Think more monologues from Michael Cyril Creighton's Howard and quips from Jackie Hoffman's Uma, as well as the return of several former residents.) So even when the mystery sags, Only Murders In The Building reminds us that its purpose has changed from offering takes on the true-crime industrial complex to simply mining comedy from its capable stars. And on that front, it remains delightful as ever.   

Only Murders In The Building season five premieres September 9 on Hulu

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


	Oscar-winning director Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit, Thor: Love and Thunder) is set to produce a New York-bound stage musical-comedy about the ill-fated Fyre Festival and its creator Billy McFarland, with “Skyfall” songwriter Paul Epworth composing the score and The Pirates of Somalia director Bryan Buckley writing the book and directing.


	Announced today at a launch event on a barge anchored in New York Harbor, Fyre Fest The Musical will also feature a set design by Hamilton designer David Korins. A production timeline  or Broadway plans were not disclosed.


	“Working in the theater is always fun,” said Waititi in a statement. “I mean I haven't done it for 15 years because it was no longer fun, but I've been told it will be fun this time. And I believe them. When Bryan Buckley told me he wanted to make a musical about the Fyre Festival, I said ‘Who the hell is Bryan Buckley?' I then remembered we've been friends and work mates for 15 years so it was kinda hard to say no. Honestly, I think the idea is exciting, weird, and potentially disastrous, which seems apt and is how I like to work. I can't wait to get started and snatch me some of that sweet American theatre money.”

	Buckley, Oscar-nominated for his short films Asad (2013) and Saria (2019) and once dubbed King of the Super Bowl for his direction of more than 70 Super Bowl commercials, said today, “I never saw myself doing a theatrical musical comedy. But then again, I never saw something completely mind-bendingly ridiculous and intriguing as what went down with Fyre festival. A spectacular failed endeavor—that will haunt a generation forever. I cannot wait to get this show out to the world. And yeah man, this time there will actually be music or your money back.”


	Joining both Waititi and Buckley on the producing team will be recording artist and actor Rita Ora, Rock of Ages Broadway producer Matthew Weaver, and global production company Hungry Man Productions.


	The synopsis: “It's not just a Greek-sized tragedy of one man's con. It's a satirical indictment of an entire generation. Fyre Fest the Musical. It's about as wrong as a bad idea can go.”

	











	The Fyre Festival, of course, was the luxury music festival that never was: Organized by McFarland and American rapper Ja Rule, the 2017 Bahamian festival promised ticket-buyers gourmet meals and well-appointed villas only to deliver packaged sandwiches and tents. In March 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud to defraud investors and ticket holders and was later sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit $26 million. He was released from prison in 2022.


	In addition to today's launch event, various guerilla art installations for Fyre will take place in New York City throughout the week.

	The plot: When a boy left to his own devices stumbles upon a secret late-night broadcast of lizards playing otherworldly music, a hidden door to the extraordinary swings open. His search for answers leads him to the eccentric and whimsical Chicken Man and his beloved companion, a 70-year-old chicken named Claudia — two kindred spirits who have also glimpsed the impossible. United by this shared vision, they set off on an adventure that begins as a hunt for a hidden society but blossoms into something far greater: a voyage through invisible worlds, unexpected harmonies, and the unbreakable bond between lost souls who discover magic not only in what they find, but in each other.

	I first met Johnson late one night for a magazine article, when he was in makeup to play the Scorpion King. Not the resulting spinoff, but rather the cameo in The Mummy Returns that marked his screen debut and transition from the wrestling ring. We spoke long into the night about where he came from and where he wanted to go. It was clear he was putting a lot of energy toward proving he was serious about acting, with aspirations to play Polynesian heroes like King Kamehameha. He's proven himself as a commanding and charismatic presence in brawny blockbusters and comedies, but The Smashing Machine leaves him poised to raise the bar. He's also got a date to star with his Smashing Machine co-star Blunt in a Hawaii-set Goodfellas-style period true-crime drama. He's on his way.

I really hope that thing with Scorsese never happens.
I certainly don't want to see Marty doing another gangster movie.

Me too. My heart can't handle Scorsese making a film with the Rock.

	After a string of departures, Saturday Night Live has confirmed its Season 51 cast, with Bowen Yang, Kenan Thompson, and Weekend Update co-hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che among those set to return.


	According to multiple reports, much of last year's main cast will be back at Studio 8H this fall, including Ego Nwodim, Chloe Fineman, Marcello Hernandez, Andrew Dismukes, Sarah Sherman, and James Austin Johnson (who, of course, handles the show's all-important Donald Trump impression). Two of last year's new featured players, Ashley Padilla and Jane Wickline, are also returning, though it's unclear if they've been promoted to the main cast. (Reps for SNL did not immediately return a request for comment.)


	The confirmation that Jost and Che are returning, as well, comes after a lot of speculation that Season 50 might be their last. Jost has been working at SNL since 2005 when he was hired as a writer, and he's been a cast member for 12 seasons now, making him the fourth longest-serving cast member in the show's history. Che, meanwhile, joined SNL in 2013 as a writer and was named Jost's co-anchor the following year. The pair are the longest-serving Weekend Update anchors, with Season 51 set to mark their 12th season together behind the desk. 

	











SNL is also set to welcome many new featured players this year, including Tommy Brennan, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson, and Veronika Slowikowska. Ben Marshall, who spent the past several years primarily doing pre-tape sketches as part of the comedy trio Please Don't Destroy, was also promoted to the featured players cast.

	With all these new additions, SNL also saw a number of departures. The biggest exit was Heidi Gardner, who enjoyed a very successful eight-year run on the show. During season 49, she participated in more sketches than any other cast member, and she was the longest-tenured female cast member during Season 50. 


Devon Walker and Michael Longfellow are also departing after three seasons, and Emil Wakim after one season. Marshall's promotion to the cast also marked an end for Please Don't Destroy on SNL, with John Higgins set to depart the show and Martin Herlihy joining the writing staff.

It's hard to get a film like “How to Shoot a Ghost,” the new short film directed by Charlie Kaufman and written by American poet Eva H.D., noticed at a festival like Venice. It's a short, after all, and those are often sidelined at festivals despite robust programming that suggests a different story. It's hard to get audiences in the room for them, for one.

But Kaufman, Eva H.D., and the producing team (including singer/songwriter Halsey, who backed it with her company Umade) behind his extraordinary new short did manage a red carpet appearance on September 1 ahead of their premiere — and ahead of Benny Safdie's “The Smashing Machine” in the same theater. Outside the Sala Grande, Eva H.D. stood up for Palestine, brandishing a sign that said, “We Are All an Audience to Genocide,” amid a festival where the war on Gaza weighed heavily — and continues to after Alexander Payne's jury awarded the Palestine-centered drama “The Voice of Hind Rajab” the runner-up prize before Jim Jarmusch's Golden Lion winner “Father Mother Sister Brother” was announced.

The next day, IndieWire sat down with Kaufman and Eva H.D. in a cramped, airless room in the Palazzo del Casinò on the Lido to discuss “How to Shoot a Ghost.” It centers on a translator and a photographer, both of whom are dead, wandering Athens, Greece. They're played by Oscar nominee Jessie Buckley and discovery Josef Akiki.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Life is better when filmmaker and writer Charlie Kaufman is in it. In 2020, he released both the 720-page tome of a novel “Antkind,” an industry satire about many things including a film critic, and the dream-logic, horror-adjacent Netflix feature “I'm Thinking of Ending Things,” loosely based on an Iain Reid horror novel. 

That film contained a poem, “Bonedog,” read by Buckley and written by Eva H.D., who also wrote the lyrical stanzas for Kaufman's 2023 cell-phone-shot short “Jackals and Fireflies.” They're back together again for his latest film, the 27-minute “How to Shoot a Ghost,” which premiered in Venice out of competition. (Five of those minutes are end credits, only further emphasizing the weight and ambition of this uniquely hypnotizing short.)

“How to Shoot a Ghost” also reteams the “Being John Malkovich” writer with “Ending Things” star Buckley, who plays a ghost roaming the streets of Athens and tumbling through elliptical remembrances and nights of partying and taxi-cab rides with the also-dead Akiki. In a blend of street photography, archival footage from Athens' history, and original narrative material shot on location by Michał Dymek (“The Girl with the Needle,” “EO”), this evocative meditation on memory and loss recalls the hybrid fiction works of Chris Marker or the ruminative, temporal poetry of Alain Resnais' “Hiroshima, Mon Amour,” written by author Marguerite Duras.

 










Post-Venice, “How to Shoot a Ghost” will play more festivals, to be announced, before later debuting on the free library streaming service Kanopy. In IndieWire's conversation with Charlie Kaufman and Eva H.D., we touched on the ecosystem of short films, this one's connections to his past work, and where “Synecdoche, New York” — Kaufman's feature directing debut from 2008 — landed on the New York Times' list of the 100 Best Films of the Century. (It didn't, but it was an also-ran in a broader list of 500 chosen by readers.) Reviews were mixed at the time, but that deep-dive into the widening mental abyss of a hypochondriac playwright (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) has only grown in esteem over time. Roger Ebert also picked it as the best movie of the aughts.

This interview has been edited for length.

IndieWire: Eva, it sounds like you weren't familiar with Charlie as a filmmaker when you met years ago at an artists' residency in New Hampshire, before “I'm Thinking of Ending Things.”

Eva H.D.: There was this area of this residency that did give a little bit of an autobiography about everybody, but I'd never seen it. New people were always coming in. Others seemed to know things, like they wrote this book or that book, but it's because there was this little corner where people found things that were posted, but I hadn't read any of it.

 










Charlie Kaufman: You had seen “Being John Malkovich.”

Eva H.D.: I did, but I didn't know about the rest. He said he was writing a novel. I believed [that he was only a novelist]. I'm a sucker.

Charlie, “I'm Thinking of Ending Things” also featured a poem by Eva H.D., but you had already integrated poetry into your work with the Alexander Pope piece from which “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” gets its title. And poetry is the DNA of “How to Shoot a Ghost.” How does that change your filmmaking process?

Eva H.D.: Did you do it because poetry is a moneymaker?

Kaufman: Yeah, that's what I was hoping for. [Laughs] I don't know. I really like Eva's writing. When I was trying to construct that character in “I'm Thinking of Ending Things” and the idea that she was constantly being reimagined by the Jake [Jesse Plemons] character, I wanted one of those iterations to be a poet. I asked Eva if I could use one of her poems for that. For these movies, the two we did together, “Jackals” and this, it's an opportunity when I'm doing a short film, which I hadn't done before, to try and do something that's not conventionally narrative. It's a challenge for me. How do I do this, and what can I visually contribute to what's written?

You shot this movie in six days in Athens, but it feels like a montage cutdown of a much bigger film. You are running all over the city. How did you condense the material?
 










Eva H.D.: At one point in editing, we cut almost everything out, just to see what we could put back in.

Kaufman: We had two different cinematographers. One was off getting stuff for us, and one was with us doing stuff with the actors, which is kind of what we did with “Jackals and Fireflies.” It was a way for us to get more footage. Even with two people, it was a lot of work to do that. It was very difficult traveling around.

Eva H.D.: We went all over the place, very intentionally to places where tourists don't usually go, Americans don't usually go. Charlie was very good at blending. Often, American film types impose themselves. We didn't stop traffic; we were within it.

Kaufman: There was one shot where we're in the middle of the street. It was a last-minute decision. We didn't know how to get this shot, and we were in the middle of the road, and there was traffic everywhere. It was slightly dangerous. We couldn't have stopped traffic if we wanted to. We weren't that kind of production.

Eva H.D.: One of the things I sent him photos of when I was in Athens and he wasn't at the beginning was this weird hot dog stand that's halfway to nowhere. It's very much in the middle of nowhere, and Charlie fell in love with it, and it's in our film. It's a cantina.

 










Charlie, had you stayed in touch with Jessie Buckley about doing another project after “I'm Thinking of Ending Things”?

Kaufman: You always want to work with Jessie. She's an amazing person to work with. We certainly talked about things since then, and then this came up, and she was available. 

How did you land on the character having blue hair? You're reminded of Kate Winslet in “Eternal Sunshine.”

Eva H.D.: That was [Jessie]! She bought that for 10 quid.

Kaufman: She said, “What if she had a blue wig?” She said, “I found this thing online.” She bought it, and she styled it. I can't make decisions based on things like that [such as the connection to “Eternal Sunshine”]. People have determined that I fixate on certain things because they're accidentally things that happen. Here's an example because it's meaningless: That I cast Jesse [Plemons] and Jessie [Buckley in “I'm Thinking of Ending Things”] because their names are the same, and I was making some comment. No! It was [originally] Brie Larson and Domhnall Gleeson. They both couldn't do it. I had no idea who Jessie Buckley was at the time. I called a friend of mine, a production designer, and said, “I need somebody for this role.” She was working with a director in England at the time. I looked at the “Beast” movie [she was in], and said, “OK, I want this person.” And I got her.

 










Eva H.D.: She always manages to channel something protean and anarchic. 

Kaufman: And that was the audition for [“I'm Thinking of Ending Things”], the poem “Bonedog.” She recorded herself and sent it in the next day, and it was like, “Holy shit.”

What about Josef Akiki? How did you cast him?

Eva H.D.: Both Charlie and I went to this thing in Greece called Oxbelly, which is not a residency [but a writers' retreat]. At Oxbelly, Charlie and I did a talk of sorts on poetry and film, a rambling conversation we had. Afterward, this man, Ahmed Hussein, who's a Lebanese filmmaker, chatted with me because he liked it. I got his number, and then when we were looking to cast this film, there were different people who were suggested but most of them were second-generation people with culturally Arabic backgrounds but they were German or American, or they were French. It just seemed wrong for this character to be played by someone like that. I wrote to Ahmed and was like, “Do you have any good Lebanese actors in mind?” He recommended three people, and we watched them, and loved Josef.

The use of archival footage helps tell the story of the changing nature of the city, where Greek locals have been pushed out by tourism and gentrification. Local people can't afford to live there anymore.
 










Eva H.D.: Some of that archival footage is friends' home videos. I just asked everybody and their mother, “Do you have anything?” We found a treasure trove of wonderful material.

Charlie, is there more anxiety or liberation in the short-film format as opposed to a feature? The life cycle of a short film is less traditional. Does that affect your outlook?

Kaufman: I couldn't make this as a feature. I can't even make the features that I write that are more narrative. It's very difficult to get financing. It's easier to get financing for [a short], but the downside is that no one is ever going to make any money on it. You have to piece together financing. I don't need, like in “Jackals,” there were no movie stars. We happen to have Jessie in this, which is great for us, because she brings so much to it. There are all sorts of equations when you're casting a feature to get financing. This person who is of this value, and it's garbage. I don't have to deal with that for a short. It's a lot of work. It's not like it's less work. We've been working on this forever, and there's no payoff.

Eva H.D.: There is!

Kaufman: There is, you're right. But you can't make a living. You lose money making a short. You're still putting in the time…. We're here at this festival, but we're so under the radar here because no one cares about shorts. Then, sort of how awful and ostentatious everything is that surrounds us, I feel grateful that I don't have to participate in that.

 










Charlie, you have a couple of other projects in the works. There's an adaptation called “The Memory Police” from a Yoko Ogawa novel, and another called “Later the War” with Eddie Redmayne and Tessa Thompson, inspired by an Iddo Gefen story. There was a report earlier this year that “Later the War” was going, but then shut down. What's the status of either of these?

Kaufman: We're working on getting [“Later the War”] going. We had to rethink it. I don't know what to say about it. We're still working on getting it going, and I'm hopeful, and it's very good!

What about “The Memory Police”? With “I'm Thinking of Ending Things,” you used Reid's novel as an inspiration and a springboard for your own ideas, similar to Jonathan Glazer's approach to Martin Amis' “The Zone of Interest,” just to use a recent example. “Ending Things” and “Zone of Interest” also had the same cinematographer, Łukasz Żal.

Kaufman: I adapted that from a novel, and Reid Morano is directing it. I stuck to the book. There are things, as you know if you've read the book, that you need to figure out because they're kind of abstract in the way it's described. But [my screenplay] follows the book.

There was that New York Times list of the 100 best movies of the century earlier this year, though I was disappointed “Synecdoche, New York” didn't make the cut.
 










Kaufman: It was on there, on the post list, but it was like #493. Not that I remember! [Laughs] They had the 100 best, and then they had also-rans, and out of that, they went out to 500, and I just slipped in.

That movie has only grown in esteem over time. How do you feel about the idea that it's a film that needed time to be appreciated?

Kaufman: The Academy was doing a Philip Seymour Hoffman retrospective, and Spike [Jonze] presented the film. I wasn't able to make it. It was divisive when it came out. There were people who loved it, and people who absolutely hated it — most especially [former New York Observer critic] Rex Reed. For Roger Ebert, it was the best movie of the decade.

Eva H.D.: He gave you a mold of his own thumb!

Kaufman: I'm happy I made it. I'm happy with the movie. It wasn't helpful to my career as a director, as you can also chart, which doesn't make me happy. I'm happy with the movie and the people I worked with. It'll do what it will do in the world. It's out of my hands.

Eva H.D.: Maybe it was helpful to your career as a human being.

Kaufman: I hope so.

“How to Shoot a Ghost” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. The film will eventually stream on free library streaming service Kanopy.

EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios is finalizing a U.S. deal we understand to be in the $11 million-$12 million range for buzzy action pic Ballerina Overdrive.


The Witcher: Blood Origin director Vicky Jewson has directed the completed feature about a troupe of ballerinas who find themselves fighting for survival as they attempt to escape from a remote inn after their bus breaks down on the way to a dance competition. 


	Lana Condor (To All the Boys franchise), Millicent Simmonds (A Quiet Place), Iris Apatow (The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping), Maddie Ziegler (West Side Story), Avantika (Senior Year), Uma Thurman (Kill Bill franchise) and Michael Culkin (The Nest) star.

	Pic heralds from Deadpool and John Wick director David Leitch and Bullet Train producer Kelly McCormick's 87North, and Bill Bindley and Mike Karz's Gulfstream Pictures (Upgraded), which financed the movie. Piers Tempest (Upgraded) also produces. We understand there are franchise ambitions for the project — the premise seems ripe.

	We hear Amazon's domestic pact is for streaming but that there is potential for a theatrical component. As we previously revealed, Amazon had already taken international on the movie, so they will now have worldwide on the project.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Two-time Oscar winner Cate Blanchett (Tár, Nightmare Alley) will star in Alice Birch‘s Sweetsick, which will rep the filmmaker's feature directorial debut at Searchlight. 


Sweetsick, which Birch also wrote, follows a mercurial woman (Blanchett) with a strange and piercing gift – the ability to see what others most intimately need, often at great personal cost – who sets out on a journey home. Cameras rolls this fall in the UK and Greece. 


	Pic is produced by Tessa Ross, Juliette Howell and Theo Barrowclough from House Productions (Conclave, Mint, The Wonder) alongside Blanchett and her Dirty Films banner. Lee Groombridge will also produce. Film4 will executive produce and co-finance.

	Birch said, “I could not be more excited to be making my debut feature as a director with such an extraordinary team of filmmakers and collaborators. I am in the safest hands with Tessa Ross and her brilliant team at House, and am so proud to be working with Searchlight and Film4. To have the peerless Cate Blanchett at the centre of it is thrilling.”

	“We're all very big believers in Alice Birch and it's been wonderful to see that the fantastic team she's gathered around her, not least the amazing Cate, feel the same way – all drawn in by her bold, beautiful vision,” added Ross.


	Blanchett won a Best Actress Oscar for Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine and a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Martin Scorsese's The Aviator. Other features credits include Searchlight's Nightmare Alley, as well as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Cinderella, Thor: Ragnarok, Ocean's 8, and Don't Look Up. 

	











	Birch broke out with the highly acclaimed Lady Macbeth, for which she was BAFTA-nominated. She then earned a WGA award for her work on Succession and later received high praise for her work on the TV adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel Normal People, for which she was Emmy-nominated. Birch wrote a second Sally Rooney TV adaption, Conversations with Friends, before becoming the writer and showrunner behind the series reimagining of Dead Ringers. On the film front, additional screenplay credits include The Wonder, which garnered her another BAFTA nomination, Mothering Sunday, and The End We Start From. 


	Blanchett is represented by CAA and Birch by UTA, Davis Law Group, and Giles Smart at United Agents.


	VP of Development & Production Pete Spencer and Creative Executive Cameron Chidsey are overseeing the project for Searchlight Pictures, reporting into Production & Development Heads Katie Goodson-Thomas and DanTram Nguyen. Farhana Bhula, Director of Film4 and Alice Whittemore, Development & Production Executive are overseeing the project for Film4. Farhana Bhula is an Executive Producer for Film4, and Zoe Edwards, Harry Dixon and James Green are Executive Producers for House Productions.

	Few people can claim the kind of virtually universal appeal enjoyed by Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks. (The sitting president certainly can't.) Following a West Point Academy alumni group's cancellation of an award ceremony honoring Hanks — a longtime advocate for veterans — Trump celebrated the snub, decrying the actor as “destructive, WOKE,” and unworthy of the honor. 


	“Our great West Point (getting greater all the time!) has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks,” Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social. “We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice.” 


	West Point's alumni association announced to members that Hanks would not be receiving its Sylvanus Thayer Award — which honors non-alumni who embody the academy's motto of “duty, honor, country” — in an email obtained by The Washington Post on Saturday. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“This decision allows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world's most lethal force, the United States Army,” wrote  West Point Association of Graduates President Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger. 


	Does the decision make sense? No. The award has been bestowed on former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, Hank's Forrest Gump co-star Gary Sinise, Ross Perot, and Henry Kissinger. In effect, the award has been given to a sprawling array of political and cultural figures, and has had no measurable impact on the warfighting ability of the American military. 

	











	Why single out Hanks? The actor has ostensibly liberal politics, and has appeared in Saturday Night Live sketches that parody Trump's supporters, angering some of his base. QAnon conspiracy adherents have spread baseless claims that Hanks and other celebrities were involved in a secret child sex abuse ring. In February, MAGA billionaire and former Trump administration official Elon Musk promoted a post from a conservative activist accusing Hanks of being a “pedo.”

	But the issue isn't really Hanks, whose coffee company “Hanx For The Troops” donates 100 percent of its profit to nonprofits supporting veterans and their families; it's the president and this administration.

	Over the first year of Trump's second term, West Point has become a focal point of the White House's crusade to purge the nation of “woke” boogeymen. Fox News weekend host turned Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has led a purge of the school's faculty and administration — as well as the school's curriculum and policies — aimed at fulfilling Trump's demands that American military academies “are prohibited from promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories,” including that “America's founding documents are racist or sexist; and ‘gender ideology.'”


	Somehow, the presence of Hanks, dubbed “America's Dad” by his legions of fans at home and abroad, runs counter to the administration's political priorities.

One month into the Jonas Brothers' 20th anniversary concert tour, the beloved trio has already thrilled fans with surprise guest appearances from celebs including Demi Lovato, Switchfoot, Jesse McCartney, Hoobastank, JP Saxe, JoJo, and the Plain White T's. And at the group's Los Angeles show on September 6, 2025, the crowd went wild when R&B crooner and “The Voice” coach John Legend hit the stage.

Best known for his soaring ballads and for shining a light on serious topics like civil rights, as he did in his Grammy-winning “Glory” from the 2014 movie “Selma,” Legend let loose with the Jonas Brothers and social media lit up with videos of them all having a blast performing together.

A post shared by Coco Mocoe (@cocomocoe)

Nick Jonas appeared as a coach on “The Voice” for seasons 18 and 20 alongside Legend, and the crowd went wild as he sweetly introduced his former colleague to the stage on September 6. 

“We have something in store for you tonight that is legendary,” Nick teased the crowd, as seen in the fan video above. 

“I remember the first time I heard a song by this artist,” he continued. “I was sitting watching the Grammy Awards on TV, at home at our house in Wyckoff, New Jersey. And I thought to myself, ‘Well, that is a different kind of voice, a different kind of storyteller, someone who is truly connected to something profound.”

Nick then recalled, “And years later, I didn't know I'd be sitting with Joe and he said, ‘I just had an amazing session with this artist that we love.' He played me a song that he wrote with this person and, honestly, I was pretty jealous, not gonna lie. He rubbed it in and I played the song on repeat for months.”

After chuckling with his brother Joe about how jealous he'd felt, Nick shared how grateful he was to later get the chance to work with Legend on “The Voice.” 

“You know, we got to know this person over the years and, eventually, I got to do a TV show right here in Los Angeles where we kind of battled back and forth, all in good fun,” Nick told the crowd. “But I got to absorb just a tiny bit of his light, of his artistry, and his brilliance in those two years I did that show.” 

Nick concluded, “And, man, I can't believe I'm about to say these words, but Los Angeles, please welcome our friend and your friend, Mr. John Legend.”  

Loved seeing John Legend, so unexpected! 😍 #johnlegend #jonasbrothers #jobros #jonasbrothersconcert #kevinjonas #joejonas #nickjonas #riristea #rivetsoro @Jonas Brothers @John Legend 

In a rare casual look, Legend strutted out onto the stage wearing jeans and a hoodie, and gave all three brothers hugs as the crowd screamed. 

An upright piano was waiting for him at center stage in the Intuit Dome, and as Legend sat down to play his hit song “All of Me,” the crowd joined along with every word and the Jonas Brothers joined him for the chorus. 

A post shared by Jonas Fans Brasil 🇧🇷 (@jonasfansbr)

After performing “All of Me,” Legend stood up and the four stars strutted in unison onto the walkway in front of the stage, singing the Jonas Brothers' hit song, “I Believe.” 

Legend was feeling the music, grooving to the beat, and fans loved seeing him having so much fun with the Nick, Joe, and Kevin. 

One fan wrote on Instagram, “All of them singing together was so beautiful to hear in person! Definitely one I'll remember for a while”

Another exclaimed, “That's actually a cool collab! One I never expected but just feels right!!”

Someone else wrote on one video, “The colab I did not expect 😭😭😭😭😭 this is giving me so much FOMO. I can't go on with life 😂😂😭😭”

Later in the evening, the Jonas Brothers welcomed another surprise — the band 5 Seconds of Summer, per Billboard. The “JoBros” will continue their U.S. tour through mid-November. Meanwhile, Legend is on his own 20th anniversary tour through early December and will be back on season 29 of “The Voice” in the spring of 2026.

Words like “bold” and “daring” and “wild” will be thrown around — really, have already been thrown around — in regards to Nia DaCosta's “Hedda,” one of the more original and thrilling adaptations of a classic work in recent memory. The same words apply to the title character at the film‘s center, the inscrutable and seemingly unscrupulous Hedda Gabler (a magnetic Tessa Thompson), here yanked firmly from the late 20th century setting of Henrik Ibsen's iconic play into the '50s, and not missing a single trick along the way.

The time setting is hardly the only thing DaCosta, who also wrote the film's screenplay has changed here, which now imagines Hedda to be a Black woman (one supporting character marvels at her “dusky” skin) whose love affairs involve both men and women. The former flame who shows up at her sprawling (read: unaffordable) country home for a raucous (read: deadly) party is, in DaCosta's telling, now a woman: Eileen Lovborg, no longer Eilert Lovborg. Again, bold and daring and wild changes, sure, but also imaginative and illuminating. Which is to say: this all works, very well.

The film opens the morning after Hedda's party, thrown to celebrate Hedda and her husband George Tesman's (Tom Bateman) entrance into society. What the party is really thrown for is something far less mundane: In seeking to please Hedda, struggling professor George has purchased the pair a lush, lavish country estate they can absolutely not afford (production designer Cara Brower's work is stunning, and makes it easy to see why anyone would go half-mad to live here). They've been assisted by Hedda's long-time family friend Judge Roland Brack (Nicholas Pinnock), who takes every opportunity to try to ravish a disgusted Hedda, clearly believing he's owed something.

 










But George has hopes that the Tesmans might soon not owe anyone anything, as they've invited university muckity-muck Professor Greenwood (Finbar Lynch) to the party, and they hope to impress him so very much that he'll give George a cushy new job (and, you know, money). And this party is going to be grand indeed, molded to Hedda's particular taste as possible — less flowers, more champagne — and kitted out with a guest list that proves more bizarre as the night winds on. For Hedda, a woman defined by the many constraints that hold her (familial, professional, societal, racial, sexual, the list goes on and on), a party is something she can really control and make her own.

More to the point: a party's guests are something she can really control and make her own. While the constantly cowed George thinks this is all for him, Hedda has other ideas. Also on their way to the mansion: Eileen Lovborg, Hedda's former flame, George's current rival for that new gig, and apparently some sort of changed person. When Hedda and Eileen were wild together, Eileen's drinking and carousing was a problem, but she's put all that wickedness behind her, mostly thanks to the love of Thea Clifton (a delicate Imogen Poots), who has also just arrived at the mansion for the world's worst party.

 










Thea, of all people, sees Hedda most clearly: as the women reacquaint themselves before Eileen's promised arrival, she muses that Hedda was “terrifying” when they first knew each other in school. That has not abated, but Hedda's reign of terror will find new ways to out itself (and her) over the course of one devastating party. Upstairs, in one of the mansion's many jewel box rooms, Hedda displays her most prized collection: a set of guns handed down to her by her later father General Gabler, which she toys with, tosses around, and loans out, all depending on her whims. In the bottom of the guns' shiny box, there's a shallow reserve, just big enough to hide… well, you'll see.

Since Ibsen first introduced Hedda in 1891, she's served as one of the theater's great anti-heroines. What she refers to as her “whimsicality” is something far richer (or wilder, bolder, take your pick): in being so repressed and restrained, it's only a matter of time that someone as singular as Hedda is going to combust. That she opts to do that at a party? Well, that's just sort of fun. Until it very much is not. Unable to control nearly everything about her life, despite making nothing but safe choices (“safe choices,” thy name is George Tesman), Hedda cannot hold. Conventionality does not offer the protection she expected it to, and so the pain is doubled: she didn't do want she wanted, and she still has nothing to show for it.

 










When Eileen finally swoops into the party (the great Nina Hoss is so electric in her entrance, it's nearly the only moment we're distracted from Thompson, who is riveting in every moment), all bets are suddenly off. Hedda, so determined to be mistress of her own emotions, is felled. This is the great love of her life, and she arrives reborn, in love with someone else, with her next great book literally tucked under her arm, and free of the influence of booze and bad decisions. Hedda, of course, takes this all as a challenge.

Thorny, pissed-off, and hellbent on shaping anything she can to her liking, Hedda stalks around the party, needles here, pushes there, and joyfully takes stock at where her machinations are getting her. Thea falls apart. Eileen falls headfirst into a cocktail. Hedda's rage is so potent that it impacts others seemingly out of her purview, and as the party pushes far into the night, the only question isn't what will happen next, but how horrific it will be. 

And yet. Hedda's magnetism is undeniable, and that people would be under her thrall is understandable. DaCosta and a talented team of craftspeople bolster that idea at every turn: Sean Bobbitt's cinematography is lush and oversaturated, Hildur Guðnadóttir's unpredictable score fuels the party atmosphere with a tinge of dread, and Lindsay Pugh's costumes are sumptuous. There is always something to look at or touch or hear in the mansion, enough that it can almost distract from the evils Hedda is perpetrating, against both herself and others. 

 










At one point, a guest who doesn't know Hedda tells her he's heard of her past, that before she was domesticated, she was “like fire.” That flame is still burning in “Hedda” (and in Hedda), but that brightness masks its true nature: destruction. But, oh, what fun to stand back and let it shine, at least for one evening.

“Hedda” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival.  Amazon MGM will release the film in select theaters on Wednesday, October 22 and then globally on Prime Video on Wednesday, October 29.

	Six years ago, near the end of a show in Austria, Bob Dylan grew so enraged by fans taking photos and shooting video that he stopped the set, narrowly avoided a nasty fall, and delivered an extraordinarily rare rebuke to the audience. “Take pictures or don't take pictures,” he snapped. “We can either play or we can pose. OK?”


	In recent years, fans at his headline shows weren't given that choice, since phones have been banned. To enforce the rule, ushers roam the aisles with flashlights and threaten to remove anyone not in compliance. The result is a refreshingly old-school concert experience where people actually watch the action on the stage and live in the moment. No real effort is made to stop audio bootleggers, and pristine tapes of these shows have emerged, but the video documentation is scattershot and borderline unwatchable since the rule-breakers are often miles from the stage and forced to film at covert angles.


	Last summer, however, Dylan signed onto Willie Nelson's Outlaw Music Festival, a big tour that exclusively hits amphitheaters that seat up upward of 20,000 people. It's simply not viable to ban phones at these events — no one has time to monitor that many seats — meaning that Dylan was playing to a vast sea of iPhones for the first time in years. The upside is that when set list news happened, like the return of “Mr. Tambourine Man” after 15 years or a surprise Pogues cover, everyone got to see it on YouTube the next morning. The downside is that Dylan was likely feeling very annoyed the whole time.

	











	When the Outlaw tour resumed Friday night in Bangor, Maine, after a four-week hiatus, Dylan took the drastic measure of making himself practically invisible onstage. He did this by sitting behind a grand piano, raising the music stand, surrounding himself with four very bright lights, and pulling a hoodie tight over his head. According to fan reports, people even in the first few rows were unable to see anything but the top of his hood. To the rest of the crowd, he was little more than a visual smudge behind the piano, presuming they were able to see any trace of him at all.

	“In my 20 years of Dylan shows, I've never witnessed anything like it,” Dylan superfan Ray Padgett wrote in his indispensable Flagging Down the Double E's newsletter. “The bigger problem wasn't that I personally had a bad view. Boo-hoo me! It was that it created the bleakest crowd energy I've experienced at one of these Outlaw shows. People were pissed.”


	He continued to describe the crowd's discontent in colorful terms. “One person near me spent the first half loudly complaining to anyone within earshot, aggressively offering her binoculars around to prove they don't help anyway,” Padgett wrote. “Another person, who'd apparently been stewing quietly, finally yelled ‘What the fuck!' during ‘Blind Willie McTell' and started shoving people out of the way to leave. Most humorously, two others near me got into a long mid-show debate about whether that really was Dylan up there, or an imposter.”


	It's not an imposter. That's the real Bob Dylan. He's just really, really tired of people watching the show through their cellphones as opposed to their own eyes. And why shouldn't he be? Phones have made concerts almost unbearable at times. (I wrote about this problem at length in 2013, and it's only gotten worse since then.) At an Oasis show the other night in Pasadena, California, many people around me barely glanced at the stage. They were too busy taking photos of each other, shooting segments of songs, and then uploading the images to social-media platforms. The rest of us were blinded by those concertgoers' screens, and mere extras in their photo shoots.

	The entire point of a concert is to experience something cool that's happening here in the physical world, right in front of you. What's the point of even going if you're going to spend the whole time on your phone? The photos you're taking look like absolute shit, and there's 6,000 other people filming every song. If you want to see it again, go on YouTube the next day. You don't have to make the video yourself.


	As George Costanza famously said, “We are living in a society.” If we don't start acting like it, Bob Dylan might start looking even more like the Invisible Man onstage, or maybe he'll simply sing from his dressing room. In the meantime, put down your damn phones. Bob has had enough. (And yes, we can't be 100 percent sure that this is why he's done everything possible to disappear himself at recent shows. But we can't imagine any other explanation.)

From Psycho and The Manchurian Candidate to The Waterboy and Momma's Man, momma's boys have been an onscreen staple for decades. And Daniel Sanderson (Mary & George's Laurie Davidson), the med-student son of Robin Wright's glamorous gallerist Laura in Prime Video's The Girlfriend, is a textbook case—so much so that when we first meet the close mother-son duo, affectionately wrestling in the indoor pool of their posh London home, you'd be forgiven for assuming they were lovers. But soon enough, Laura's sweet life in her sweet home with her sweet son sours with the arrival of a particularly tart fruit: Cherry.

Cherry Laine (Olivia Cooke) is Daniel's new girlfriend, and Laura doesn't approve: not of her name (admittedly stripper-worthy), not of her low-cut red dress (admittedly inappropriate for meeting the parents), and not of her son's hand that Cherry allows to creep scandalously high on her thigh in the middle of dinner. Even when Laura does try to get to know the maraschino-haired young woman, she's left with even more questions and concerns. Did Cherry really attend St. Florian's private school? Does she recognize the paintings that line the walls of Laura's home, or did she just conveniently memorize the excerpts off a nearby coffee-table book? And did she pocket one of Laura's gold bracelets and not-so-accidentally let the family cat loose? What, exactly, is Cherry hiding? 

Helpfully, every episode of the six-part domestic thriller is split into two halves, one following Laura's point of view and the other giving the same order of events from Cherry's perspective. That red dress Cherry wears to meet Daniel's folks? She can't actually afford it and panics when Laura spills coffee on the garment, which still has its tags on it. You see, while Laura's moneyed life is as carefully curated as one of her galleries—from her artfully minimalist wardrobe to the family's sunny vacation home in Spain to even the mistress she allows her husband Howard (Waleed Zuaiter) to keep on the side—Cherry's working-class background is far less tidy, one marked by scrappy determination and social ambition. 

Through this dual-narrator format—which faithfully follows the framework of Michelle Francis' 2017 novel of the same name, on which the series is based—we get to see not only how major plot points differ in the women's minds but also the smaller, knottier stuff: a micro aggression here, a tremor of tension there. A hurtful slight that one finds significant enough to linger on is barely mentioned in the other POV, showing how each mindset, memory, and even ego can bend and buckle the truth. It's a clash the two actors clearly relish, each gamely playing victim or villain depending on which outlook is at the forefront. (As well as starring, Wright is an executive producer on the project and directed half of its episodes. The others were helmed by Andrea Harkin.) 



It's in this deliberate gray area that The Girlfriend succeeds: Is Laura simply being protective—an understandable byproduct of tragically losing her first child, Daniel's sister Rose—or is she paranoid to the point of no return? Is Cherry merely self-conscious of her humble upbringing or is she a manipulative maniac? It's when the limited series gets too sure of who the bad guy really is that it loses its addictiveness, its pulpy predictability lumping it in with other rich-white-people psycho-thrillers. Speaking of, the show's soundtrack certainly doesn't help, echoing both the unsettling vocalizations of The White Lotus as well as memorable needle drops from Big Little Lies.

And while Wright and Cooke are given abundant material to work with as each woman descends further and further into monsters-in-law madness, the rest of the cast is left wanting (though Zuaiter does have several quietly devastating moments as a father dulled by grief). Davidson's Daniel has boyish charm and Paul Mescal-esque good looks, sure, but the character is so blandly written and improbably oblivious (the dude is supposed to be surgeon-level smart, mind you) that you have to wonder why two alpha females like Laura and Cherry would be at each other's throats over the dimple-cheeked dolt. 

Unburdened by that additional story weight, the increasingly outlandish actions of our leads do keep things light, lean, and moving swiftly along, a plus when the mystery has largely been removed from the narrative. And while most thrill seekers might disapprove of the lack of startling twists and turns throughout the show's six installments, The Girlfriend finds ripe drama in the interpersonal, offering up fruitful things to say about perspective, prejudice, and possessiveness. Cherry and Laura's feud alone is juicy enough to warrant a bite. 

The Girlfriend premieres September 10 on Prime Video

Benoit Blanc is back! And riding the best reviews for one of his whodunnits since the original “Knives Out” premiered in 2019. 

Like that film and its slightly less well-regarded sequel “Glass Onion,” the new installment, “Wake Up Dead Man” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. IndieWire's Kate Erbland, in a B+ “Critic's Pick” review from the fest, said that this new entry is darker than the previous ones and draws inspiration from Edgar Allen Poe. The first teaser for “Wake Up Dead Man” is below. The Netflix film will be released in theaters November 26 and stream December 12.

 










Its director, and franchise mastermind, Rian Johnson has proven himself a master of the whodunnit form with these films, showing a knack for Agatha Christie puzzle-plotting that, well, the actual adapters of Christie haven't shown in recent years. Not just the broad strokes like sprawling ensemble casts of big personalities, a quirky private dick in Daniel Craig‘s Blanc, endless red herrings, and an extended “reveal”  of the killer, but small, subtle details: Like how Johnson repurposed the curved font on a 1980s paperback release of Christie's “Curtain” as his “Knives Out” font. The man knows his stuff.

“Wake Up Dead Man” takes on this current moment of misinformation (one character says, “There's GOD in DOGE”) and offers a particularly great foil in Josh O'Connor, who is either a suspect for Blanc or someone who can team up with him. He's joined by another (somewhat literal) murderers' row of actors including Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, Kerry Washington, Cailee Spaeny, Andrew Scott, and Thomas Haden Church. Plus, Jeremy Renner intriguingly not playing himself — the real-life Jeremy Renner, though not appearing in “Glass Onion,” was mentioned and his likeness featured on a vanity hot sauce called “Renning Hot.”

Maybe it was those kind of touches that made “Glass Onion” arguably less beloved than “Knives Out” itself? A lengthy prologue before all the characters assembled and the plot could begin certainly didn't help. Regardless, though, like its predecessor, “Glass Onion” received a screenplay nomination at the Academy Awards (adapted in that case, since it was a sequel, to the first film's original screenplay nod).

“Wake Up Dead Man” will hit theaters November 26 before streaming on Netflix December 12.

	“This world, as we all know, can be so full of criticism and discrimination and negativity,” Sabrina Carpenter said Sunday at the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards. “So to get to be part of something, so more often than not, that is something that can bring you light, make you smile, make you dance, make you feel like the world is your fucking oyster — I am so grateful.”


	It's a perfect summary of pop fandom — but also everything that was missing from the VMAs this year. MTV's annual bash came up mighty short on star power, pop flash, celebrity egomania, humor, sleaze, madness, glitter-cringe misbehavior — you know, the kind of thing you watch the VMAs to see. It's one thing to begin with a Kenny G cameo. But it's another when Kenny G turns out to be one of the damn highlights.


	The night's best line came from Ariana Grande: “Thank you to my therapists and gay people! I love you!” Ariana was the MVP — one of the few big-deal stars who actually showed up, sure, but also someone the camera could always rely on for total unflagging enthusiasm. Every time the energy level sagged, which was often, they could cut to the Ari-Cam and catch her cheering or singing like she was genuinely excited to be here. She won Video of the Year for “Brighter Days Ahead” — yet the whole show would have been basically unwatchable without her. Thank you, Ariana's therapists and gay people! MTV owes you big-time.

	











	Ariana also presented the Video Vanguard award to Mariah Carey, who finally got her long-overdue career award after somehow never winning a single VMA in her career until now. “I can't believe I'm getting my first VMA tonight,” Mariah said in a hilarious speech. “I just have one question: What in the Sam Hill were you waiting for?”

	This was the first VMAs aired on CBS, and there was plenty of rookie energy in the air. The network seemed to have trouble persuading actual stars to perform. They didn't dream up any clever moments or duets. They ran ads from the federal government trying to recruit ICE agents, a real middle finger to the audience. There was a glut of new legacy awards, as if they needed to cover up for their difficulty getting big names to return their calls. Busta Rhymes came on to do a medley of his hits — the exact same medley he did on the show just four years ago. Nikki Glaser, normally the life of the party at any award show, didn't even get to make any jokes. The weakest VMAs in years, after a five-year winning streak. What in the Sam Hill was going on?

	On the bright side, you had to love all the 2000s energy. The whole night was full of millennial fever. When host LL Cool J said, “We've got icons in the house!,” the camera cut to Paris Hilton waving. (Some things never change.) There was a Burger King ad bumping Taio Cruz's “Dynamite,” then a cellphone ad starring Lindsay Lohan, saying, “Now that I'm a mom, things are, well, different!” MTV kept pimping their incredibly innovative cutting-edge ideas with promos for the “historic season finale” of Jersey Shore Family Vacation. (Dude, it's the first time Sammi is meeting Ronnie's parents? No way — time to pour some Ron-Ron Juice and get obliviated!) As a great woman once sang, the whole night was “So Yesterday.”


	And just when you thought it couldn't get any more 2000s, Ashlee Simpson made a proud return, radiating all her glorious “La La” evergy. Ashlee never loses her touch, proving that she was 100 percent right when she warned the world all those years ago — you can throw her like a boomerang, but she'll come back and beat you up. She came onstage with her sister Jessica, who also reminisced about “back in 1999,” when she was on tour opening for Ricky Martin, “the world's biggest pop star.” When Paris presented the Song of the Year award, her walk-on music was “Stars Are Blind,” which somehow failed to win this award back in the day.

Lady Gaga was one of the 2000s stars who defined the VMAs — some of us will ride forever for the night she hosted in character as her male alter ego Jo Calderon. So it's cool she dominated the show tonight, winning Artist of the Year. Then she rushed across town, from New York's UBS Arena to Madison Square Garden, so she could reappear live from her own Mayhem Ball, doing a spectacular gothed-out performance of  “Abracadabra” and “The Dead Dance.” But Gaga dedicated her award to the audience. “The way you move for your life is iconic and rare,” she said. “It is entirely yours.”

	











	Mariah did a medley of her hits, including “Fantasy,”  “Heartbreaker,” “Obsessed,” and “We Belong Together.” She also traded air kisses with Ariana, gushing “She's so little! You're the cutest!” Mariah reminisced about her long VMAs journey. “Being here brings back amazing memories,” she said. “Like when I presented LL Cool J with his Vanguard Award. Or when Whitney Houston and I opened the show with a faux stand-off, when we both had our dresses — we were like, ‘Try it on me!'” It's just a shame MTV couldn't persuade Jennifer Lopez to be part of the Video Vanguard tribute. (Hey, Taylor Swift came out 10 years ago to give this same award to “my friend Kanye West,” so there's precedent.)


	Sabrina took a Nineties trip for her live debut of “Tears,” turning a NYC street-party scene into a ballroom bash, as she waved the flag for transgender rights. Her dancers included a slew of drag queens and ballroom stars: Lexi Love, Simone, Leganja Estranj, Honey Balenciaga, Dashaun Wesley, Richie Shazam, Jewels Sparkles, Denali. Her dancers held signs that said “Protect Trans Rights,” “Dolls Dolls Dolls,” and “If You Hate You'll Never Get Laid.” The boom-box radio announced it was 69 degrees — “a wet one” — as Sabrina crawled out of a manhole. So yeah, she's still not into subtlety, fortunately for us all.


	Sombr, wow — now there's a showman who knows how to show, pure glitter sex-on-a-stick startime, with shoulder pads even Bowie would have coveted. He did a fantastic Studio 54 goth-glam “12 to 12,” opening with the words, “This one's for the girls that get it.” Best moment: One dancer crawled across the stage to slither up alongside him, then dropped to her knees before him, and he looked so sweetly embarrassed it was downright touching, without compromising any of his Mick Jagger/Richard Ashcroft stud-liosity. Never let anyone try to talk you into shirts that button, Sombr. You're better than that.


Tate McRae did her thing on the floor, writhing acrobatically to “Revolving Door” and “Sports Car”— if you've seen her current tour, you know she can do two hours of this easy, going again like three-four times. Tate could have been designed in a lab as the perfect star for this award show — she taps right into the TRL aesthetic. She was born the summer of 2003, when Madonna and Britney had their historic VMAs kiss, and it's as if she were born from that kiss.

	











Doja Cat went totally '80s for “Jealous Type,” opening with the smooth tones of Kenny G's soprano sax making sonic love to us all. She got all the era details right, heavy on the pastels, a guitarist in black leather and a cameo, a keytar queen in a Stacey Q-worthy perm, Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis-style mall beats, all on a black-and-white checkerboard floor. With the Club MTV energy off the charts, you had to keep wondering if Downtown Julie Brown was about to give Doja some wubba-wubba-wubba love, or if MC Skat Kat would suddenly dish the dirt on stealing Paula Abdul's covers. But respect to Doja for finessing the fine points.


	Busta Rhymes won the brand new Rock the Bells Visionary Award — he complained about waiting 35 years to win it, so guess nobody told him this was the first one ever. GloRilla joined him for hits like “Scenario” and “Pass the Courvoisier.” A class act as always, Busta gave a moving salute to the late MTV VJ Ananda Lewis.


	Ricky Martin won another new honor, the Latin Icon Award, shaking his bon-bon in a medley of Nineties hits like “La Copa De Vida” and “Livin' La Vida Loca,” making you wonder what the voodoo-loving kink temptress in the song is up to these days. (Reiki yoga instructor, right?) “I am addicted to your applause,” Ricky said. “That's why I keep coming back.” But the highlight of this interlude was the moving fan tribute from J. Balvin. “I want to talk with my heart,” Balvin said. “Man, we love you.” It was one of the only moments all night (along with Ariana on Gaga) where the stars got to act like shameless music fans — the show could have used a lot more of that.


	Rosé won Song of the Year for her '80s-themed Bruno Mars duet “Apt” (somewhere, Toni Basil must have been happy) and gave a sweet speech where she thanked herself (it was her therapist's idea) and also dedicated the award to her 16-year-old self, remembering her awkward teen days when she felt like an “oddball.” Post Malone and Jelly Roll did a bromantic duet on “Losers,” appearing live from Germany. J Balvin got busy with Lenny Tavarez, Justin Quiles, and DJ Snake, while Lola Young did “Messy” and Alex Warren sang “Ordinary.” Megan Moroney rocked her emo-cowgirl anthem “6 Months Later.” She also won the first VMA for Best Country Video — a welcome sign of the times.

	The Ozzy Osbourne tribute got hyped all night, right from LL Cool J's opening monologue, where he promised, “Tonight we are honoring a man known as the Prince of Darkness, who brought a lot of light into the world!” Aerosmith's Toxic Twins, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, reunited for “Mama I'm Coming Home.” (Perry is on a hot streak these days, ripping it up on his excellent solo tour with the Black Crowes' Chris Robinson.) But Yungblud didn't have the vocal chops for “Crazy Train” or “Changes.” Sadly, Lita Ford didn't show — and why didn't Busta jump up there for his Ozzy duet “This Means War”? Why didn't we get Sabrina singing “Iron Man,” or Ariana belting “Children of the Grave”? But it said a lot about the void Ozzy left in the universe, after his tragic death this summer.

	











	Conan Gray closed out the night doing “Vodka Cranberry” in a red velvet cape, a look he should try more often, since Hammer-horror '60s Dracula mode works for him. He staged a Sleeping Beauty-style pageant, singing to an unconscious Stephen Malkmus look-alike in a frilly blouse (Girl Meets World star Corey Fogelmanis) on a bed of flowers, until Conan finally took a sip from a conveniently placed decanter of crimson liquid — vodka cranberry? A magic love potion? Or was it bloooooood? Honestly, hope it was the vodka — after a song that sad, Conan looked like he could use a drink. The Romeo-as-Juliet he was serenading was very conspicuously breathing, so we weren't in deathbed territory here, yet it was still a startlingly downbeat way to end an award show. But maybe he just felt a bit snoozy after such a sluggish VMAs ceremony — an understandable feeling after all so little excitement and spectacle.

Alexia Umansky, daughter of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Kyle Richards and real estate mogul Mauricio Umansky, has officially tied the knot. Alexia married her longtime love, Jake Zingerman, in a Los Angeles ceremony on Sept. 6, surrounded by family and friends.

A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)

The daughter of Bravo veteran Kyle Richards walked down the aisle in an elegant ivory gown with a taffeta bustier, while Zingerman wore a crisp white tuxedo jacket with black trousers and a bow tie. 

The celebration was a true family affair, with Alexia's sisters—Farrah Brittany Aldjufrie, Sophia Umansky, and Portia Umansky—serving as her maids of honor. Her cousin Nicky Hilton, daughter of Kathy Hilton, also shared a glimpse of the event on Instagram, posting photos of a rose-covered entrance illuminated by candlelight.

Photos from the evening showed the bride's vision of an “enchanted evening garden” came to life with rich tones, sparkles, and eclectic touches, which she had described just days earlier during a livestream with her mother. Later in the evening, Alexia swapped her gown for a short lace minidress and danced alongside Jake as guests celebrated into the night.

According to The Daily Dish, the wedding, originally planned for Aspen, was moved to California after the couple decided a destination event was too “stressful.” Richards and her husband, Mauricio Umansky, were in attendance to support their daughter on her big day.

Both Kyle and Mauricio have shared their admiration for Jake over the years. Kyle previously described her daughter's husband as “a very, very, very cute” addition to the family. “They are a very cute couple, and they're great together,” she said during an Amazon Live stream.

Mauricio also spoke warmly about Jake in a past interview with Us Weekly, saying, “He's awesome. We love him.” Their approval has been clear throughout the couple's engagement and wedding journey.

Alexia and Jake, who began dating in 2019 after first meeting in grade school, already share a home in Los Angeles. In a recent Amazon Live appearance, Alexia revealed she will hyphenate her last name to Umansky-Zingerman.

As for a honeymoon, the couple said they plan to delay the trip. “We're not gonna go right away,” Alexia explained. “It was too hard to plan the honeymoon and a wedding in such a short amount of time.”

With a strong foundation of family support and a shared life already in place, Alexia and Jake are entering this next chapter with plenty of love around them.

As NBC's “Sunday Night Football” kicks off on September 7, 2025, it will begin for the 13th year in a row with country superstar Carrie Underwood singing the latest version of the theme song, “Waiting All Day For Sunday Night.” 

The former “American Idol” winner and current judge says it's the thing she's most recognized for, according to the New York Times, which went behind the scenes of the June recording session, during which Underwood sang 80 versions of the iconic song, set to the tune of Joan Jett's 1988 hit “I Hate Myself For Loving You.”

A post shared by SNF on NBC (@snfonnbc)

The “Sunday Night Football” theme song changes slightly with every new NFL matchup across 18 Sundays, according to the New York Times. But because the primetime lineup can change later in the year, depending on which games are likely to draw the most viewers, producers have to be prepared for the intro song to pump people up for a variety of possible team and player matchups. 

That means Underwood recorded dozens of permutations of the rock song, standing in a dark Nashville studio in her bare feet, the outlet reported. For the September 7 game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Buffalo Bills, NBC producer Rob Hyland told the New York Times they wanted Underwood's lyrics to focus on superstar quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen. 

Underwood was given multiple different lines to record, with the freedom to change words here and there if the lyrics don't feel quite right.

“It's just all about flow and the rest of the sentence,” Underwood told the New York Times. “You get in there and sometimes you'll sing something and it sounded clunky, and then somebody will be like, ‘Why don't you switch the names or switch the order?'” 

A post shared by SNF on NBC (@snfonnbc)

2025 marks the 20th season of “Sunday Night Football” on NBC. Tripp Dixon, creative director for the opener, told NBC Insider they wanted to give Underwood's theme song a special sound for the occasion.

Dixon said, “For the 20th season of SNF, we wanted to set the tone for the night by reimagining the anthem sound in a way that plays to Carrie's powerhouse vocals, while visually creating a seamless blend of stylized shots and behind-the-scenes moments evoking the national roadshow that is Sunday Night Football, week after week in the fall.”

Keanu Reeves is receiving all the love as he celebrates his 61st birthday with a sweet surprise from Alexandra Grant. Fans got a rare look inside Keanu Reeves' birthday thanks to his girlfriend. The artist posted a photo of his celebration, complete with a custom cake and a touching note.

She posted a photo of a heart-shaped cake covered in white frosting and rimmed with black and white candies. Red gel icing spelled out “KEANU X.” Candles lined the edge.

“Thank you to everyone for sending over sweet wishes for Keanu's birthday yesterday,” Grant wrote on Sept. 3. “He was well-celebrated!”

Grant also shared a direct note to Reeves, who stays offline. “To Keanu—who saw this post as a draft!—I am so grateful for your love and partnership,” she wrote. “Now back to painting! Xo.”

The couple, who made their red carpet debut in 2019, have kept much of their romance private. Reeves confirmed the relationship the following year, telling Parade in 2020, “It's been really wonderful to be with Alexandra. We enjoy each other's company, whatever that may be.” Read her sweet message here.

Reeves and Grant first met in 2009 at a dinner party. They went on to collaborate on two books together: the 2011 release “Ode to Happiness” and the 2016 series “Shadows.” In 2017, they co-founded X Artists' Books.

Grant has spoken openly about their later-in-life romance. “The good news about falling in love as an adult is that I had built my own career by the time that my relationship had begun,” she told People in 2023. “I feel very confident in the relationship on the red carpet. I feel confident on it alone.”

The couple occasionally shares glimpses of their love in public. In April 2023, they kissed on the red carpet at the MOCA Gala in Los Angeles.

Around that time, Reeves gave rare insight into his personal happiness. Asked about his last moment of bliss, he told People: “A couple of days ago with my honey. We were in bed. We were connected. We were smiling and laughing and giggling. Feeling great. It was just really nice to be together.”

Keanu Reeves' 61st birthday celebration shows that even after decades in Hollywood and roles in “The Matrix,” “John Wick,” and “Speed,” some of his happiest moments are found offscreen with Alexandra Grant.

She nabbed the song of the year VMA for her Bruno Mars collab "APT."


													By
												

	Joe Lynch


Executive Digital Director


	While ROSÉ already has some VMAs in her back pocket thanks to BLACKPINK's several wins at the MTV Video Music Awards over the years, the New Zealand/South Korean singer now has one of her own as a solo artist – and the big moment was not lost on her.


	Bruno Mars & ROSÉ's smash “APT.” (which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100) was named the song of the year at the 2025 VMAs on Sunday (Sept. 7) night at the USB Arena in Elmont, N.Y. Taking the stage to accept the honor (Mars was not present at the show), Rosé unfurled a pre-written note and read a well-thought-out, personal speech.

	











	“I feel like this is a really big moment for myself and a lot of other people,” she began before pausing, laughing a bit and continuing. “Thank you so much, Bruno. I can't believe this. I'm gonna call you after, thank you so much for believing in me.”

	ROSÉ then brought it back in time. “Someone asked me the other day what my fear in life was and I was quite shocked at my own response. I had no idea how deeply personal this journey had been for me. I told them I feared that somewhere along this journey of pursuing my dreams I might hit a wall and disappoint my 16-year-old self who grew up always an oddball among society, who wished someday she could be herself and pursue her dreams like anyone else I saw on television.”




	Holding her speech and the Moon Person, she declared, “Twelve years later I dedicate this award to my 16-year-old self who dreamed and to all those who have watched me grow into the artist I am today. Every single one of you has put me here…. Now I believe there is no imposter in the world when MTV has given me this award at the VMAs.”


	Rosé thanked her team, her label, her fellow BLACKPINK members and “my loyal fans for believing in me.”


	“This is a really big moment for 16-year-old me and anyone else who has dreamed of being accepted equally for their hard work,” she said. “As my therapist tells me to do every day, I'd like to thank myself for not giving up even in the toughest of times.”

Rosé looked like she could barely believe she won Song of the Year at the 2025 Video Music Awards, but had a two-page speech prepared just in case. After Paris Hilton (who walked out to her own bygone hit of sorts, 2006's “Stars are Blind”) presented her with a win for “Apt.” with Bruno Mars, the Blackpink star giddily took the stage, shocked.


	“I've prepared something because I didn't want to mess this up and I feel like this is a really big moment for myself and a lot of other people,” she began before thanking Mars for his friendship and world-building. Rosé shared an anecdote about being asked her what her fear in life is. She realized, she said, it would be hitting a wall and disappointing her 16-year-old self, who she described as “an oddball among society that wished someday she, too, could be herself and equally pursue her dreams just as well as anyone else I saw on television.” She dedicated the award to that young version of her.


	Rosé also thanked the members of Blackpink in both English and Korean, as well as her family, and many members of her team. Before walking off with her “heavy” Moon Person, she added, “As my therapist tells me to do every day, I'd like to thank myself for not giving up, even in the toughest of times. Always remember you've got you.”

Lamenting the decision to allow fans to chart the course of the Fast And Furious movies, NBC Universal Chief Content Officer Donna Langley apologized for a scene in 2021's F9: The Fast Saga in which Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris' characters, Roman and Tej, don SCUBA suits and fly to the International Space Station in a rocket car. “I'm sorry that we sent them to space,” Langley said at the Toronto International Film Festival. “We can never get that genie back.” Though she did not offer an early apology for Vin Diesel's recent announcement that Brian O'Connor, the character played by the late Paul Walker, would appear in the next film, Langley admitted that most of the series' ideas come from fans. Citing Diesel as an “early adopter of talking to his fans directly,” Langley said that plot points, including the deaths of major characters like Michelle Rodriguez's Letty, were “led by fan engagement.”

“[People would] sort of throw out little things about, ‘Oh God, don't kill Letty,'” Langley said. “OK, we'll bring her back. ‘She never died. Don't worry. Nothing to see here.' But that's all led by fan engagement.”

Langley, who didn't apologize for the scene in F9 where Roman (Tyrese Gibson) realizes he and the rest of the family are immortal and possibly fictional characters inside a fake universe, says that the expansive silliness of the series was born out of a desire to help the franchise grow. “We made a conscious decision to pivot to a sort of a globe-trotting heist scenario,” she said. That doesn't quite explain how a globe-trotting heist scenario became a globe-orbiting one, nor was the initial apology necessary, as that scene in F9 is fun and funny. We'll accept the apology anyway and hope that getting this major regret off her chest helps Langley produce the ever-elusive Fast X: Part 2, which has yet to materialize.

With just one week to go before the 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, the television industry started the festivities with the Creative Arts Emmys, two nights of awards for technical and artistic excellence behind-the-scenes of the year's best shows. Night one honored key players in narrative fiction (though the results don't hint obviously at next week's big winners), and night two shifts to reality, variety, nonfiction, and documentary programming. 

Many of the September 7 awards went to the HBO documentary “Pee-wee as Himself” (including director Matt Wolf) and NBC's “SNL50” celebrating half a century of the iconic sketch comedy series. Ted Passon's “Patrice” won the award for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking. “The Daily Show” picked up awards for writing and for specific segments, while “Love on the Spectrum” received accolades for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program and for its casting. The Grammys, Oscars, and Beyoncé Bowl all picked up awards, as did streaming favorites “Cunk on Life” and “The Traitors.”

Exploring our solar system and returning pieces of it to Earth is a central part of the existential quest to search for life beyond our home planet.

Understanding the biosafety and biocontamination implications of landing on a planetary body or in bringing pieces of our solar system back to our home planet are the two themes that are central to planetary protection, a discipline that is unique to spacefaring nations.

The nature of planetary protection is twofold: (1) to ensure that we minimize our own terrestrial microbial footprint on other planets and moons (planetary bodies) in our solar system (forward contamination), and (2) to ensure that we minimize the potential impact of returning samples from another planet or moon to Earth (backward contamination).

The discipline of planetary protection focuses on who is the biological “invader” and when does their arrival indicate an “invasion”? The degree to which there is potential for biological or organic interactions that result in biocontamination or changes in biosafety posture is the central topic of this work.

Russell Crowe earned three Oscar nominations between 1999 and 2001, but he's since entered a different phase of his career, starring in a wide variety of films each year. He recently transitioned into the horror genre with his work on The Pope's Exorcist, the 2023 supernatural thriller telling the story of Father Gabriel Amorth (Crowe), the Vatican's leading exorcist, who investigates the demonic possession of an American boy in Spain. This leads him to uncover a secret the Vatican has kept buried for years. The Pope's Exorcist is streaming on Hulu in America but on Netflix globally, where it's entered the top 10 in several countries, including the Philippines.

The Pope's Exorcist was not particularly well-received by critics, who rated the film a Rotten 50% on the aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. Crowe's charm mostly landed with general audiences, though. The film currently holds a solid 81% on the audience-driven Popcornmeter. Despite negative critical reception, fans were extremely curious to see how Crowe's turn to the horror genre would be received, which led to the film finding massive financial success. It grossed $76 million at the box office against a modest $18 million budget, meaning it more than doubled its break-even point.

The real Gabriele Amorth earned a writing credit for The Pope's Exorcist due to the movie being based on the stories he wrote about his time working for the Vatican. Jeff Katz teamed up with Chester Hastings, R. Dean McCreary, Evan Spilotopoulos, and Michael Petroni to write the script for The Pope's Exorcist, and Julius Avery stepped behind the camera to direct the film. Avery had previously worked with Sylvester Stallone on Samaritan, the critically panned superhero movie that's currently streaming on Prime Video.

Russell Crowe will next star alongside Rami Malek and Michael Shannon in Nuremberg, which is coming to theaters on November 7, 2025. Richard E. Grant, Colin Hanks, John Slattery, and Leo Woodall have also been cast in the film, which wrapped production more than a year ago and has been seeking distribution since. The first trailer for Russell Crowe's Nuremberg was released at the end of July. James Vanderbilt, best known for his work as a scribe on Zodiac and The Amazing Spider-Man, is writing and directing Nuremberg.

Check out The Pope's Exorcist on Hulu in America and Netflix globally, and stay tuned to Collider for more streaming updates.

I've been in fandoms my entire life, starting with The Vampire Diaries. I would read stories on Fanfiction.net, watch fanmade YouTube edits, have discussions about shipping with other fans on forums, and, of course, fight over ships on those same forums. From Doctor Who and Star Wars to K-pop and anime, fandom was my way of escaping reality. But when real life was occupying my time, my presence in fandom was less active. I was content with my private little bubble of enjoying things. That all changed last year, when I became obsessed with AMC's small-screen adaptation of Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire and started seeking out connection again in online spaces, eager to recapture those same experiences I had as a high schooler on Tumblr. Instead, I was met with chaos.

Admittedly, things were never all sunshine and rainbows back then, either, up to and including homophobic, transphobic, and racist censorship initiatives poorly disguised as concerns about violence and sex in fan works. Now, modern fandoms are littered with harassment, doxxing, and racist attacks that target Black, trans, and/or otherwise marginalized users who speak up against policing — and it's not showing signs of stopping any time soon. We've seen, in real time, how conservative pipelines work in online spaces — whether the crunchy-to-alt-right, the TERF (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist), or the incel-to-alt-right version. It starts with specific rhetoric, planting the seed of fear into young, insecure minds. A specific group of people is painted as the enemies, dehumanized, and dogpiled with harassment. I set out to investigate if other people were having the same experience.

 Right away, someone else in the Interview with the Vampire fandom spoke up. Mica*, who prefers to remain anonymous for fear of doxxing, first joined fandom spaces at eight years old with Neopets before going on to be a part of the Harry Potter, Marvel Cinematic Universe, Homestuck, and even SuperWhoLock (Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock) communities. “I feel as if fandom has largely lost a lot of its earnestness and creative drive, and has instead become largely reactionary, with non-creatives becoming BNFs [big name fans] based on takes and policing fandom,” they admitted.

Similar to my own experience, Mica came up in the “DON'T LIKE, DON'T READ” era of fandom, where shipping non-canon gay pairings was seen as provocative and morally wrong. “Censorship is always a slippery slope, and the first people to be targeted will be the most vulnerable,” they said. It's true: The fight to censor gay works in 2002 and 2012 led to the mass purging of mature-rated fanfic on Fanfiction.net. One fan group, Critics United (described as a “volunteer fandom police”), mass-reported specific stories they deemed inappropriate by leaving abusive comments.

As a person of color, Mica had experiences with other fellow fans, often other POCs, harassing and doxxing them for perceived injustices over fictional characters. “My harassment was acceptable because I hurt a fictional non-white man's feelings — and it was always a man,” they said. “Instead of reading anything I said as good faith, it became carte blanche to harass and bully me.”

Mel Stanfill, Associate Professor of English at the University of Central Florida and author of Fandom Is Ugly: Networked Harassment in Participatory Culture, presented a study where they and their team looked at stories on Archive of Our Own (AO3) tagged as rape or non-consensual. Their research showed there were significantly fewer stories rated Teen or Mature, and more rated Explicit. “The argument we made is that people who otherwise would have been writing about this as a social issue have been scared away, or they've been locking their stories because we couldn't see those stories in our methods. They were invisible to us. Those other people are still posting them, but there was a real dramatic shift and the proportions of those stories changed,” Stanfill said.

 While the above concerns are valid and certainly experienced by plenty of fans, it's possible that there's a generational war at the heart of the issue. “My instinct is always [to ask], ‘Is this actually happening? Or is it more visible?' Like so much of fan culture, I think that's always been there, but it's just more visible,” said Dr. Ben Litherland, lecturer in Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Huddersfield, researcher, and co-host of the Ill Effects podcast. Algorithms play a huge role in this, one that entirely includes the collapse of context. People don't search hashtags on TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter anymore to find content; they let the platforms deliver the content to them. “Platformized algorithms [have] governed the systems. Twitter's a big part of this conversation, right? [Where you're] performing your fandom in front of the whole world, potentially. And just the affordances of that technology have always felt terrible, like some adorable 15-year-old who's learning to be political and a fan at the same time, and then they get quote-retweeted by everyone around, and they've got 50,000 people screaming at them because they've clumsily articulated something.”

One fan I spoke with was present during the peak of one of the Internet's biggest fandoms in Supernatural. After initially joining during the show's fourth season, around 2008, they took a break from fandom in 2015, which lasted a decade. Now in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer fandom, a show they watched when they were younger, they've definitely noticed a difference in online interactions. “In the past, there wasn't so much discourse. People would argue, but it didn't launch entire bullying campaigns. Wincest and Destiel fans didn't agree on stuff, but it wasn't at the level of ship wars now. You wouldn't dox a person. You wouldn't harass them and encourage others to do [it], too. You'd argue in reblogs or asks, and that'd be it,” Dakota* said.

Even a fandom known for its in-fighting and controversies, like Supernatural was back in the day, doesn't compare to what we're seeing now, but why? Dakota believes it's because of the political climate Gen Z and younger have grown up in. “The pressure to be so woke that it's performative, coupled with the hive mind and groups ganging up on folks, even making up things to justify such behavior, is just wild. 90% of the time, it's virtue signaling over something taken out of context or a made-up scenario,” they said.

Ash, also known as @thisredwine on Twitter, has personal experience with this uglier side of fandom. While he got his fandom start dabbling in media like Star Wars, Vampire Academy, and First Kill, he's recently become more active in the Interview with the Vampire fandom, posting his thoughts after Season 2 of the show began airing from his perspective as a Black biracial trans person. “Getting to talk to so many people has been amazing — especially other Black and trans folk who've been in touch — but I've also been harassed really severely in the past few months,” Ash said.

Within the IWTV fandom, Ash has been called anti-Black slurs, misgendered, and deadnamed several times on X in the last six months alone. He believes it's because he chooses to discuss the show from a race-centric perspective — which IWTV invites its viewers to do, considering the AMC adaptation changed the story's main character, Louis de Pointe du Lac, from a white slave owner to a Black Creole man. Beyond casting shifts, however, Ash has also called out the racism that lurks within the IWTV fandom itself.

“BIPOC having honest, good faith conversations about fandom racism and implicit bias isn't ‘starting drama' or supporting censorship, but unfortunately, a lot of people operating in bad faith try to frame it that way,” he said. “We just want people to be more conscientious of how they might be perpetuating different forms of bigotry — whether that's implicit bias, microaggressions, racist stereotypes or tropes, or enabling outright hate campaigns and macroaggressions — and make an effort to do better.”

 While some in fandom spaces might claim they're anti-censorship and say they welcome all, their actions have demonstrated otherwise. “Their ‘anti-censorship' framework boils down to ‘it isn't OK to harass me or my friends for the fictional material we enjoy, but it's ok if we harass others and doesn't take into account how marginalized groups are always the ones affected first and worst by censorship,” Ash said.

This self-policing is not coming from an outside source dictating how people should or should not behave in fandom circles. It's internal, inspired by systems that restrict people in their everyday lives outside the internet. “[It's] populist moral panic, which is a moral panic that is bottom-up rather than top-down,” Stanfill said. They've theorized this phenomenon is due to “context collapse,” a term used most commonly in social media academic research where online spaces have become more singular experiences, existing outside established context. In real life, people know how to behave at work versus at home, for example, but online spaces are different now, with everyone co-existing together, Stanfill pointed out. “Communities used to be in little enclaves, [with] the people writing these [explicit] stories and the people who just wanted to have nice fuzzy stories, didn't they interact with each other. They were in different spaces. But now with social media, with Tumblr, with AO3, with Twitter, hashtags or tags in general are bringing people together who ordinarily would have been in little enclaves before. So, there's a culture shock.”

One fan artist, Jay*, who preferred to speak under condition of anonymity, describes their online fandom experience as more annoying than enjoyable. After some involvement in various video game fandoms, they're now active in spaces for anime like Golden Kamuy and Jujutsu Kaisen. They describe interacting in fandoms as constantly walking on eggshells. “It feels more negative and less fun each day. It's more about infighting than actually appreciating the original media. There is less analysis, less fan works, and more discussions about the moral aspects of fan work and moral interpretations,” they said.

Having grown up in a religious community, it was hard for Jay to ignore the fact that a lot of fandoms have adopted many of the same conservative talking points, like the notion that violent video games and movies equate to violent actions. “Depictions of violence are seen as negative, despite these being fictional. they're called ‘glorification' rather than this violence being a part of the narrative,” they said. “In my community, we were discouraged from analyzing the messages of any media, and just judge based on their moral depictions of any topic, on a very superficial level.”

Fandoms have now progressed from the earlier years of homophobic purging to queer being the norm to the present day, where lesbian and gay ships are often seen as fetishization. “While it's valid to not want to interact with sexual content, they have started referring to artists and writers as ‘gooners,' ‘perverts,' even ‘degenerates,' and ask others to harass or block.”

This overcorrection problem in fandom is something Noor has seen, too. As a member of numerous fandoms throughout her life, including Harry Potter (specifically Marauders), Doctor Who, Supernatural, and One Direction, and currently Severance, Yellowjackets, and Taylor Swift, she's witnessed a different and unfortunate new trend in these circles. “I think there's been a rise in ‘puriteens,' a subset of fandoms that includes younger fans (not necessarily teens) who take umbrage with certain content — sometimes it's sexual content where the reasoning is ‘why is everything about sex?' but it's often also content where characters aren't portrayed as morally good all the time,” she said. “It feels like, at some point, people began policing things that are ‘problematic,' which at first does not seem like a conservative way to approach fandom, but it eventually morphed into a prescriptive approach to fandom where there's a right and wrong way to engage with characters and ships.”

Sure, there's always been infighting in fan spaces, but things have taken a seriously dark turn in recent years. It's not limited to petty fighting, either; it's doxxing, harassment, stalking, slurs, and deadnaming. It's personal, and it's political. “[It's] a politics of disgust, right? It is about imposing your disgust on other people, and making your disgust the rule.” Stanfill said.

This is a really insightful article but I think it could go deeper honestly. I'm a fandom old head too (mid 30s millennial), and I really noticed the shift mid and post covid. I don't think laying the fault entirely at Gen Z's feet is fair, but can you blame them? At least millennials grew up having kid specific spaces online where we could learn about how to interact with other humans on the internet. They didn't have that. And then they spent their most important adolescent years not even being able to see each other IRL. Their only spaces are on the internet. So it makes sense that the kind of interpersonal petty infighting they'd normally have with their real life friends are happening with strangers on the internet where, as the author rightly pointed out, they are clumsily still discovering their politics and points of view and are in a stage of psychological development where they have very strong opinions that they feel very passionate about. But the internet—and especially fast moving spaces like Twitter—are notoriously bad at giving people the grace and space to evolve and be wrong.

It also feels VERY worth noting that this seems to have been written before SDCC when several IWTV fans, including one of the people interviewed here for having been doxxed, themselves doxxed a handful fans for, seemingly, not liking the “correct” ship. The SDCC incident involved a Black fan (who has been notorious in the fandom for previously doxxing other Black fans and calling them a number of anti-black slurs, again over which characters they ship) calling the San Diego convention center and other law enforcement to make a false charge that several fans who were attending the con were stalking one of the actors and intended him harm. YouTube creator Autumn Brown made a video explaining the incident in detail, but SDCC staff handled the situation extremely poorly and have made no move to rectify the situation. 

With regards to your previous comment, black fans, and especially the one being interviewed in this article, did not doxx people at SDCC. That is a bold faced lie and its frankly in extremely poor taste to spread it on an article about someone being stalked, doxxed and harassed for almost a year straight. Blaming random black fans for doxxings is disturbing to say the least, especially when the fans have proven time and time again that they had nothing to do with the SDCC or any other doxxing and when many of the black fans you are describing have been doxxed themselves. By spreading this rhetoric you are opening these black fans up to further harassment and You should really think about the things you spread online, especially with little verifiable proof

Glam-rock powerhouse DIAMANTE is a force to be reckoned with. 

The Coming In Hot singer is unapologetically herself in an epic 80s-Thriller inspired music video for her energizing summer single “Silver Bullet.”

Comparable to legendary women in rock such as Bonnie Tyler, Joan Jett, and Lita Ford, the rising rockstar continues her message of female empowerment in this latest head-bang-worthy jam: 

“When she was a little girl / She knew she wanted the world / Nobody could kill her shine / There was nothing she couldn't survive…”

Not afraid to stand in the face of danger, DIAMANTE embodies the perilous weapon just as striking as her commanding vocals. As the silver bullet herself, the monsters that judge her performance are no match for her prowess in this motivational, vibrant music video. Nothing holds back a woman who knows what she wants.



DIAMANTE joined heavy rock band Bad Wolves on their melodic single “Hear Me Now,” as part of their debut album Disobey, which peaked at number two on Billboard's Mainstream Rock charts in 2018. 

The American singer gained national recognition with her successful tour in support of  Shinedown on The Revolution's Live Tour in 2022 alongside The Pretty Reckless, promoting her independent album American Dream (2021). 

In 2024, DIAMANTE joined female-led bands Kittie and The Pretty Wild in an epic cover of Metallica's hit single “The Unforgiven” as part of the Queen of the Ring motion picture soundtrack. The powerful trio joins several other artists on the Sumerian Records project, including Corey Taylor, Bad Omens, Larkin Poe, and Kat Von D. 

DIAMANTE also appears on the American Psycho Comic Series Soundtrack with her fierce cover of “Love Is A Battlefield,” channeling rock legend Pat Benatar.

“Silver Bullet” is available to stream on most streaming platforms.

In the neon-lit sprawl of a near-futuristic Tokyo, Tokyo Underground Killer immerses players in a gritty cyberpunk underworld. The game casts you as Kobayashi, a supernatural assassin dubbed the ''Shinjuku Vampire,'' entangled with the Gokuraku crime syndicate. The story unfolds through nearly 100 pages of hand-drawn comic scenes, blending dark humor and existential yearning. Kobayashi, a killer with a longing for a simpler life, hunts depraved psychopaths linked to Kinoshita, a deceased musician-turned-cultist. This narrative, steeped in supernatural intrigue and Tokyo's criminal underbelly, sets a feverish tone, with the city's catacombs hiding secrets about a demonic invasion by creatures known as Flatliners. The story's mix of violence and introspection creates a compelling backdrop, reminiscent of the cyberpunk noir found in Katana ZERO, though with a distinctly Japanese flavor.

 

 

The game's world exploration is a love letter to Tokyo's iconic districts. Players traverse reimagined versions of Shinjuku, Akihabara, and Shibuya, each drenched in neon and cyberpunk aesthetics. Between intense missions, Kobayashi's apartment in Kabuki-Cho, Tokyo's infamous red-light district, serves as a personal hub where players can unwind. A city hub expands the experience, offering shops and mini-games like pachinko, UFO catchers, and arcade challenges. These elements ground the game in Tokyo's vibrant culture, with every alley and neon sign dripping with atmosphere. The catacombs, a labyrinthine network beneath the city, add layers of mystery, encouraging exploration to uncover narrative clues and hidden upgrades.

Combat in Tokyo Underground Killer is a visceral, fast-paced affair centered on katana-based mayhem. Players slash, stab, and parry through hordes of Flatliners, demonic enemies inspired by Japanese folklore. The innovative Blood Skills system, fueled by collecting enemy blood, lets players unleash abilities like time-slowing strikes, armor-breaking slashes, or rocket-vaporizing bursts. With 10 upgradable skills and an ability tree, combat feels dynamic and strategic, demanding quick reflexes and tactical planning, especially during the game's 10 escalating boss battles. Paired with a pulsing electronic soundtrack, the combat's intensity matches the game's vivid world, making Tokyo Underground Killer a thrilling cyberpunk odyssey.

As the nights grow longer and the corners start tofill with ominous shadows, you might find your thoughts drifting toward all the things that might be lurking there.

Hold on. What was that strange sound? And what's triggering those sudden goosebumps?

Sure, there could be a rational explanation. Or maybe, just maybe, was it a ghost?

Indulging our imaginations and looking for explanations beyond the conventional isn't uncommon, even among those of us who might self-describe as a materialist, that is, someone who puts all their stock in physical matter and rejects the notion of the spiritual world.

In many cultures these days, materialism tends to be the prevailing mode of thought. But that doesn't mean its grip is absolute. According to a Gallup poll conducted this past May, one-third of Americans remain open to the idea of paranormal phenomena, and nearly 70% of all respondents (yes, skeptics included) either believed in or didn't rule out the existence of psychic or spiritual healing.

Researchers working in the field of the cognitive science of religion, or CSR, have suggested that this might simply be the path that our mental processes follow. Not unlike the ancients who interpreted drought as divine punishment, we're naturally inclined to attribute agency to events that have no immediate or obvious explanation.

It's why, on hearing a creaking floorboard in an empty house, your initial instinct might be to stop and listen for an intruder — one that's physically present or visiting from the astral plane.

"We like to have control in our environment, and so beliefs play a role that way," says Brian Laythe, director of the Institute for the Study of Religious and Anomalous Experience and co-author of the book Ghosted! Exploring the Haunting Reality of Paranormal Encounters.

"What they do is they provide you with a map of how you think the world is going to behave on a day-to-day basis. Placing people in environments where they don't know what's coming next almost immediately causes mental breakdowns. It's a form of torture," he says.

Furthermore, materialism is a relatively new philosophy that's working against millennia of accepted social behaviors. For most of the time that humankind has been attempting to make sense of the world, paranormal explanations were considered just as valid as any other.

"These things were part of the human experience and the human condition long before science [as an institution] came along, you know, three or four hundred years ago," says Eddy White, a University of Arizona professor who teaches a course titled "Weird Stuff: How to Think About the Supernatural, the Paranormal, and the Mysterious."

Here in the 21st century, thanks in part to the adoption of the scientific method, we have far more documented knowledge and instruments of observation and measurement at our disposal than at any point in human history.

Yet the brain's default function as a "belief engine" — a phrase White uses in summarizing the book The Science of Weird Shit: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal by the anomalistic psychologist Chris French — is perhaps more apparent than ever in our current political climate.

"One of the things I keep highlighting for my students is this whole idea of confirmation bias because we keep running into it. We have these ideas and the things that we believe in. Anything that confirms that is what we're embracing, and anything that challenges it is something people reject," White says.

But the abiding appeal of the supernatural could come down to something that unites rather than divides us: the love of a good story, especially one that transports us away from the mundane.

Laythe calls this enchantment, which he describes as "that sense of awe and mysticism that occurs when we see things that are out of the ordinary." In this case, not knowing what will happen next is a perk rather than a drawback.

"It's why people watch really engrossing fantasy movies," he says. "But we also have to note that enchantment can be positive or negative, right? The out-there horror movie is a weird negative feeling of awe because it's mysterious and it's new and it's unknown."

Is all that to say, then, that humans' enduring interest in the supernatural comes down to our desire for a little more mystery in the world? That it's a byproduct of some remaining ancient mental wiring pushing us toward those conclusions? That it's explained by our stubborn insistence on simple explanations?

Or is there something more there? In Ghosted!, Laythe and his co-authors raise the concept of Haunted Person Syndrome and propose that there could be a number of factors at work — some psychological, some less clear-cut.

That lack of definitiveness probably won't be enough to win over many skeptics, but it might offer some hope to the sizable portion of belief-leaning respondents in the Gallup survey. Of those who gave some credence to the paranormal, nearly nine out of 10 believed in ghosts.

Witches, however, have their work cut out. They were the most rejected group among skeptics and believers alike.

It seems like lately, there's a new — and confounding — political melee surrounding a company branding decision every other week. One company sniffles, and someone declares it woke. Another coughs, and it's white supremacist. Just look at what happened with American Eagle and Cracker Barrel over the summer. Or a couple of years ago, when the green M&M got sneakers. The near-constant meltdowns over simple business moves are a sign of the times, though. Americans are seeing everything as politically coded, even when it's not.

Corporate America has played a role in fostering all of this culture war tea-leaf reading. Over the past decade or so, more firms have waded more explicitly into politics, often because it seemed good for their bottom lines, and now many are trying to reverse course. Companies are backing away from any moves that might rock the boat and taking a real "nothing to see here" approach to their messaging. But the blandification is too late, given how polarized the country has become.

"People are putting a political overlay to everything," says Kevin Lane Keller, a marketing professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. "There are a lot of minefields out there."

The United States is turning into a nation of conspiracy theorist consumers. We're doing QAnon, but for capitalism — and people of all political stripes are strapping on their tinfoil hats.

Trying to explain the dustup over Sydney Sweeney's ad campaign for American Eagle in July makes me feel a little bonkers. The actor was featured in spots declaring that "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," the play on words being that she also has great "genes," as in, she's good-looking. Some progressives and people online read the ads as being "Nazi propaganda," a "dog whistle," and promoting white supremacy and even eugenics. Conservatives swept in to defend Sweeney and claim her as one of their own. But the point of the ad wasn't that Sweeney is a Republican (though she is reported to be registered as one) or that American Eagle thinks Adolf Hitler is good (no) — it's that Sweeney is hot.

August's blowup over Cracker Barrel's new logo made the American Eagle tussle look like small potatoes (which, to be fair, it was). The restaurant scrapped the old guy leaning on a barrel from its corporate logo, opting for what I'm sure some consultant told them was a sleeker, more modern look. The right, however, decided it was a signal that Cracker Barrel had gone woke and that the decision to abandon its old aesthetic reflected an abandonment of traditional values. Its stock dropped. Cracker Barrel tried to explain that it was just a simple branding tweak. President Donald Trump weighed in. After about a week, the company said it would change its logo back. To all the people losing sleep over the cartoon guy, congrats.

Plenty of companies have stepped in it in the past, misfiring with an ad campaign or a rebranding effort. Both Tropicana and Gap wound up rolling back their logo redesigns in 2009 and 2010, respectively, after public backlash. Calvin Klein commercials in the '90s were criticized for being too sexy. But historically, outside a few fringe culture warriors, the public conversation has been more "this is ugly" than "this offends or aligns with my deeply held political sensibilities."

The mood around these corporate quarrels became noticeably more intense in recent years — and explicitly partisan. The Bud Light controversy of 2023 wasn't political. Yes, politics took hold of it, but there's nothing inherently Democratic or Republican about sending a transgender woman a six-pack of beer for a single Instagram post. But conservative commentators seized on the decision and made it into an us-versus-them battle for the soul of the country.

"Everything has become a Rorschach test," says Sadie Dyer, strategy director at Siegel+Gale, a global branding agency. "Everyone is looking now at brands and reading these brand moves and trying to suss out what it's signaling and if the brand is trying to send a message or trying to shift their purpose or signal a change in their identity or the audience they're going after."

It's no secret that Americans tend to wrap up their identities in the things they buy. Through our consumption, we signal that we are cool or care about the environment or love America. As the country has become more politically polarized, we've started to graft politics onto our purchasing habits, too.

People have increasingly sorted their brand preferences in a partisan manner, says Oded Netzer, a business professor at Columbia Business School. His research finds that since the 2016 elections, brands' online followings have become more split along partisan lines. That was especially the case for Democrats after their first loss to Trump: Many started seeking "Democratic" companies to buy from, even if the companies themselves didn't change. After Trump lost in 2020, Republicans started picking their own corporate champions more. It's a form of "compensatory consumption," Netzer says, when people buy things to make up for some sort of perceived deficit or reinforce their identities.

"Our political identity is much stronger than it was before. It spills over to our day-to-day life and to things that are seemingly nonpolitical," Netzer says. Ten years ago, the Cracker Barrel branding change probably wouldn't have made the same waves as it has today, he says, "because we are all living with a political identity that is much more salient."

Companies have always done politics to some extent — making donations, lobbying for lower taxes, etc. But they were generally pretty quiet about their activities. Elisabeth Kempf, an associate professor of finance at Harvard Business School, says businesses' recent, more public engagement with political topics may have had the "unintended consequence" of changing people's perceptions of corporate America. Companies talk about politics more, and people have gotten used to it.

"That maybe has changed the level of scrutiny, so that now people are trying to read signals into more messages or advertisements that companies are putting out there," Kempf says.

When companies have taken political stances in the past, many of them didn't really mean it. It just looked good to say they supported Black Lives Matter in 2020 or were serious about corporate responsibility and ESG after major investment leaders, who also happened to be massive shareholders of public companies, made a fuss about it. Kempf notes that businesses in more competitive industries have tended to engage in more political messaging as a way to differentiate themselves and as a reaction to external pressures. It's another piece of evidence that the talk has been more about winning than believing. And partisanship aside, brands have done a lot of legwork to develop and reiterate identities over time that consumers are constantly reading into. When company logos have little Easter eggs in them and commercials come with winks and nods, people start to map a deeper meaning onto things.

"We have been ensuring that every touchpoint and experience that surrounds a brand communicates what that brand stands for and how we want to be perceived in people's minds," Dyer says. "We've trained the general public to look at every detail, to look at the smile in the Amazon logo and that it goes from A to Z, right?"

I don't want to place all of the blame on the business world here because it really is facing quite the conundrum. I sincerely doubt anyone on the American Eagle marketing team thought they were sending a subliminal message about Nazism, or anyone at Starbucks was out to take down Christmas when they gave plain red cups the go-ahead for the 2015 holiday season. But that won't stop easily riled-up people from getting easily riled up.

For older brands such as Cracker Barrel, heritage is always a "double-edged sword," Keller says. "It helps you in the way of a lot of emotional attachment and feelings, but at the same time, you're not maybe seen as relevant. You are boring," he says.

Brands have to move forward and become more modern, especially as their original customer bases age. At the same time, the move can't be so drastic that it puts existing fans into a tizzy, especially now that that tizzy might catch fire online. Angry letters have always existed, but now some clout-chasing guy can post that letter on TikTok and X and try to get others to cosign.

"These things snowball. That's the problem," Keller says.

There's money to be made in manufacturing outrage. Partisan media ecosystems thrive on ginning up anger over contrived controversies. There's a financial payoff for influencers who blow whatever whistle of the day. And the social media algorithm is designed to surface and circulate emotion-fueling content — the madder people are, the more ad cash comes in.

Some companies may make the calculation that it's just best to forge ahead in this environment, but a lot of that depends on understanding who their customers are. If you're Nike, you've got a lot more leeway on the "woke" stuff than if you're Bud Light. American Eagle has said its Sydney Sweeney campaign — plus a collaboration with Travis Kelce, the NFL star who's Taylor Swift's new fiancé — has been a boon. And if you're Target, it seems like everybody's probably going to be mad at you, no matter what you do.

"The first thing is to realize that you do live in a different world where you are going to be interpreted politically," Netzer says.

Keller says this level of hyperreactiveness among consumers has led him to shift his thinking on ad testing. "I always felt like, do the research before you create the ad," he says. It used to be that if you knew your customer well enough beforehand, you could be creative in crafting an ad and send it out with confidence. Now, companies and marketers might decide it's worthwhile to test specific ads before releasing them to the general public to get ahead of any problems. "The money you spend on that is well worth spending versus having your brand dragged through a bunch of negative mud and everything, however long," Keller says.

Good business leaders are accustomed to undertaking financial calculations ahead of any ad campaign or brand change. Now, they've got to make some political calculations, too.

"You have to market and explain what you're doing, why you're doing it, and how you're doing it, and for whom you're doing it," says Edward Segal, the author of "The Crisis Casebook: Lessons in Crisis Management from the World's Leading Brands."

It's easy to look back at Pizzagate and laugh. For those who don't remember, it was a 2016 conspiracy theory that Democrats were running a pedophilia ring out of a pizza restaurant in Washington, DC. As goofy as it sounds, some people took it very seriously and even acted on it. At one point, a guy showed up at the restaurant with a gun to "self-investigate" the obviously false claims. The conspiracy theories about the relatively bland antics from corporate America may not be as outlandish or the consequences as scary, but an increasing number of people are seeing codes and signs where they're not.

We're living in a day and age in which it's getting harder to know what's real. AI slop runs rampant on the internet. Online provocateurs and influencers grab onto tiny morsels of information, true or false, and run wild with them. People don't trust institutions or one another. Politics feels inescapable and hopeless at the same time, and so buying something, or getting mad at a company that sells something, is the best approximation some people have to doing something. It's quite the hellish little situation we're in. It would be neat if everyone could take a breath and chill on turning everything into a political debate. Like, don't be the guy at the party everyone low-key avoids because he gets weird and annoying really fast. And right now, a lot of us are being that guy.

By all means, shop your values, but within reason. Ads and redesigns often don't have deeper meaning; a brand would just like to sell you things and remind you that it's there. And remember that companies really have only one core value: making money for shareholders.

Polish border guards reported the discovery of debris from an unidentified flying object in a village near the border with Belarus, police said late on Sunday, the latest in a series of similar incidents in the NATO-member state.

"Today, before 10:00 PM, the officer on duty at the Terespol police station received a report from Border Guard officers about the discovery of debris from an unidentified flying object near the Terespol border crossing in Polatycze," local police wrote on Facebook.

"We are securing the site of the discovery. No one was injured in the incident."

Poland has been on high alert for objects entering its airspace since a stray Ukrainian missile struck a southern Polish village in 2022, killing two people, a few months into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

On Saturday, an object likely to be a smuggling drone fell in eastern Poland, a defence ministry spokesperson said.

In August, a drone crashed into a cornfield in eastern Poland, scorching crops and shattering windows in nearby homes. A prosecutor investigating the incident said at the time it appeared to have entered Poland from the direction of Belarus, an ally of Russia.

Military drones have also crashed in Romania and the Baltic states.
