                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released on Monday a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein purportedly signed by President Donald Trump, which he has denied. He filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for a report on the alleged letter. The letter was included as part of a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein's birthday. The president has denied having anything to do with it. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee received a copy of the birthday album on Monday as part of a batch of documents from Epstein's estate. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. After the letter was released, White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich posted pictures on X of Trump's signature and tagged The Wall Street Journal's parent corporation, News Corp., writing: “Time for @newscorp to open that checkbook, it's not his signature. Trump has denied writing the letter and creating the drawing, calling a report on it “false, malicious, and defamatory.” Also, I don't draw pictures,” Trump said. The letter bearing Trump's name and signature includes text framed by a hand-drawn outline of what appears to be a curvaceous woman. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,” the letter says. The letter's disclosure comes amid a bipartisan push in Congress for the release of the so-called Epstein files amid years of speculation and conspiracy theories. Calls for the release of the records came from Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance before he was sworn into the country's No. Epstein, a wealthy and well-connected financier, killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges that said he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of underage girls. The case was brought more than a decade after he secretly cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida to dispose of nearly identical allegations. Epstein was accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them. Trump's ties to Epstein have been well-documented, though he said they had a falling-out two decades ago. He has said he kicked the financier out of his private club in Florida after Epstein betrayed him more than once by hiring people who had worked for him. The president has not been accused of misconduct in connection with their social relationship. In addition to the birthday book, lawmakers requested Epstein's last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his contact books, and his financial transactions and holdings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Crime crackdowns: President Donald Trump is continuing to tease more federal action on crime in US cities, mulling on social media “Who's Next?? ?” Administration officials have, for weeks, privately discussed targeting Chicago and Boston. However, two new polls find widespread opposition to using the National Guard against crime in American cities. • Court weighs in : The Supreme Court today backed the president's push to allow “roving” ICE patrols in Southern California. • Ukraine war: Trump said he would speak with President Vladimir Putin “very soon” after signaling readiness to move on sanctions against Russia after it launched its largest air attack of the war this weekend. President Donald Trump is expected to attend a game at Yankee Stadium on the anniversary of 9/11, a White House official told CNN. This post has been updated with details about Trump attending the US Open. “I informed him about the constant Russian attacks targeting our cities and residential buildings with drones and missiles,” Yermak posted on X. “These strikes kill civilians, including children, and destroy our infrastructure. Yermak said the two also discussed security guarantees, increased defense support for Ukraine, and strengthening sanctions on Russia. “Putin understands only force and has no intention of stopping this war,” he said. The Supreme Court ruling in favor of divisive federal immigration patrol efforts in California comes as President Donald Trump and his administration continues to aggressively crack down on illegal immigration. Los Angeles is expected to serve as a blueprint for the administration as officials plan to move forward with the president's immigration and crime crackdowns in other cities. Here's what we know about the immigration raids in California: CNN's Maureen Chowdhury, Devan Cole, John Fritze, Michelle Krupa, Elizabeth Wolfe, Norma Galeana, Stephen Collinson and Kaanita Iyer contributed reporting to this post. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine arrived in Puerto Rico today amid rising tensions between the US and Venezuela. The Pentagon said in its daily schedule that both Hegseth and Caine were traveling, though it has not released any further details about the visit. CNN previously reported that 10 F-35 jets were being deployed to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean, following a military strike on an alleged drug boat tied to a Venezuelan cartel. The Supreme Court today backed President Donald Trump's push to allow immigration enforcement officials to continue what critics describe as “roving patrols” in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the 4th Amendment. President Donald Trump touched on his administration's efforts to exert influence over Smithsonian Institute museums during remarks at the White House Religious Liberty Commission, saying he got “a little involved” due to what he believes is an overemphasis on negative aspects of American history. I said, ‘What about the good things we've done?' Trump gave credit to the Smithsonian, however, adding, “Honestly, they're making changes. You know, they were also told what to do by people that came before me, in all fairness, but they're making changes. The Smithsonian Institute is approaching a deadline on Friday to submit the first round of requested materials to the White House as it undergoes an internal review, including 250th anniversary programming, current exhibition content, traveling and upcoming exhibitions and internal guidelines and governance. Last month, Trump said that the Smithsonian is “out of control” and puts too much focus too much on “how bad slavery was.” At the Museum of the Bible Monday, Trump also said that he delivered his personal family bible, which he said was given to him by his mother, to go on display. According to financial documents released in June, Trump made more than $1.3 million Trump from Lee Greenwood's “God Bless the USA” Bible. President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration will soon issue guidance aimed at protecting the right to pray in public schools. The Education Department is expected to issue the guidance, which Trump said was spurred by an episode in Texas where a student was prevented from organizing a group prayer on school grounds for an injured classmate. “The principal didn't like it, can you imagine?” Trump said, adding that the student “held her ground and she won.” President Donald Trump again lashed out at Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker this morning, questioning why the Democrat doesn't want federal intervention to crack down on crime in Chicago. This would mean that over the past number of weeks, approximately 50 people were killed, and hundreds were shot, many expected to die. Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn't want Federal Government HELP! Trump also said that “only the criminals will be hurt” by any federal efforts in the city, and that crime there is “ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!! Over the weekend, Pritzker called Trump “a wannabe dictator” and interpreted his “Chipocolypse Now” meme as a threat “to go to war with an American city.” Pritzker said in a recent appearance on MSNBC that if Trump really wanted to help Chicago fight crime, “why not help us with providing ATF, the people that can interdict firearms?” As CNN reported, seven people were killed in Chicago from Friday evening through Sunday, preliminary police figures show. Trump administration officials have, for weeks, privately discussed targeting Chicago and Boston — two Democratic-led cities that drew the ire of the administration over their so-called sanctuary policies. The escalating rhetoric from the president and his officials is in line with how the administration is planning its aggressive immigration agenda moving forward, equipped with more funds and efforts to bring on more federal personnel. Immigration arrests have already been ongoing in each city this year. But discussions picked up over the weekend to move forward with an operation sooner. Operations in Chicago are expected to mirror Los Angeles. The man charged with operations there, Gregory Bovino, was deployed to Chicago to do the same there, officials told CNN. One official described it to CNN as “Los Angeles on the road.” President Donald Trump is continuing to tease more federal action on crime in American cities, praising his initiative in Washington, DC, and signaling on social media that he's still mulling the decision of where to go next. The administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, DC, and federalized the city's police force, though that aspect is expected to expire this week. Yesterday, Trump told reporters that he would make a decision “as to where we go over the next day or two,” when asked about his plans for Chicago. Over the weekend, Trump posted what appears to be an AI image of himself as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a character in “Apocalypse Now,” writing that he loves the “smell of deportations in the morning.” President Donald Trump remains broadly underwater on his approval rating as two new polls find widespread opposition to his use of the National Guard against crime in American cities. The CNN Poll of Polls averaging surveys conducted from mid-August through early September finds Trump's approval rating at 43% approve to 55% disapprove, similar to where it's held all summer. In the CBS poll, nearly six in 10 Americans say they oppose Trump deploying the National Guard to Washington, DC (57% oppose) or other cities (58%). Slightly more (61%) say they would oppose Trump deploying National Guard troops to their own local city or area. More see Trump's deployment of the National Guard as a purely political move (45%) than as one designed to reduce crime (33%), with another 22% saying Trump is motivated both by political reasons and a goal of reducing crime. The poll finds broad partisan divides across all these questions, with independents generally opposed and far more likely to see political motivation in Trump's moves (51%) than a push to reduce crime (28%). The NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll was conducted online August 13 through September 1 among 30,196 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. The CBS News/YouGov poll was conducted online September 3 through 5 among 2,385 adults and has an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 points. America is stronger with the power of prayer,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said. Trump's remarks today will come amid a meeting of the Religious Liberty Commission he established by executive order in May. It is unassociated with the city's major Smithsonian museum system, and unlike Smithsonian institutions or the National Gallery of Art, it charges an admission fee. Trump's visit today will be his first stop at a museum since he ordered a review of Smithsonian organizations for programming and exhibitions the administration found objectionable. Europe's top sanctions envoy is in Washington, DC, today for discussions with US administration officials on tightening pressure on Russia, according to people familiar with the meetings. European Union sanctions envoy David O'Sullivan, who has spearheaded the bloc's sanctions regime against Russia, is expected to meet with officials at the US Treasury Department to discuss and coordinate potential measures on Moscow as it escalates the war in Ukraine. The meetings come as President Donald Trump has said he's ready to slap new measures on Moscow. Trump said yesterday that European leaders were expected in Washington early this week to discuss the Ukraine war. He also said he was prepared to apply new sanctions on Russia after it launched the largest drone attack to date in its three-and-a-half-year war. President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would speak to Russia's Vladimir Putin “very soon.” Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war this weekend, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these … The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.” Last month, administration officials told CNN that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace. Yesterday, Trump said: “I believe we're going to get it settled. Trump added European leaders would visit the US this week to work on a solution. “Certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday and individually, and I think we're going to get that settled.” Trump previously threatened “severe consequences” for Putin if he does not end the war, including the possibility of “massive sanctions or massive tariffs,” also signaling yesterday that he was ready to move on sanctions. The Trump administration is moving ahead with its crime and immigration crackdowns, now focusing its attention on Chicago and Massachusetts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday attempted to clean up earlier remarks he made claiming that President Donald Trump had been an “FBI informant” in the Jeffrey Epstein case. “What I was referring to in that long conversation was what the (Epstein) victims' attorney said,” Johnson told reporters. “More than a decade ago, President Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago, and he was one of the only people, one of the only prominent people, as everyone has reported … that he was willing to help law enforcement go after this guy who was a disgusting child abuser, sex trafficker, all the allegations. So the president was helpful in that.” The speaker added: “I don't know if I used the right terminology, but that's common knowledge, and everybody knows that. So this is much ado about nothing.” Here's what's next in the Epstein files saga Some had seized on Johnson's comments on social media, seeking to paint Trump as a hero in relation to the case that has seen heightened national political furor in recent weeks. Pressed by CNN Monday on whether Trump had specifically told him about any involvement with law enforcement's investigation of the late convicted sex offender, Johnson said he was “recounting what others have said” but that he and the president have spoken about “the Epstein evils many times.” Johnson, when asked, said he had no information about whether Trump had ever been asked to wear a wire. “I was repeating what has been common knowledge for a long time. The president was helpful in trying to get Epstein for the law enforcement to go after Epstein. “He's not saying that what Epstein did is a hoax. Asked at the time to clarify the comment, a spokesman for the speaker's office said in a statement that Johnson was “reiterating what the victims' attorney said, which is that Donald Trump — who kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago — was the only one more than a decade ago willing to help prosecutors expose Epstein for being a disgusting child predator.” GOP leaders won't help Massie's bid for reelection as Trump plots his ouster Brad Edwards, a lawyer for numerous Epstein abuse victims, implored the president last week to back survivors' push for transparency around the case, saying Trump had helped him with his investigation of the case in 2009. At the time, Trump was not in public office and Epstein had just been sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security prison for his crimes with minors as part of a plea deal that has since faced significant criticism for being too lenient. “So at this point in time, I would hope that he would revert back to what he was saying to get elected, which is, ‘I want transparency.' This about face that occurred, none of us understand it,” he continued Johnson on Monday indicated that House Oversight Chairman James Comer and committee members were planning to visit the Epstein estate in Florida to view visitor logs as part of their probe into the case. CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immigration agents conduct an operation at a car wash Aug. 15, 2025, in Montebello, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) Immigration agents conduct an operation at a car wash Aug. 15, 2025, in Montebello, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can carry out brief stops for questioning. “The prospect of such after-the-fact judicial second-guessing and contempt proceedings will inevitably chill lawful immigration enforcement efforts,” he wrote in a concurrence. In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision erodes constitutional freedoms. “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” she wrote. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.” Kavanaugh, for his part, suggested stops in which agents use force could yet face legal challenges. The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the Trump administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area. U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong's ruling in place. Federal attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that ICE agents can use at least some of those factors in combination with others, and Kavanaugh said apparent ethnicity could be a relevant factor for a stop. The number of immigration raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong's order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store. The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong's order only prevents federal agents from making stops that align with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent. Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the decision would fuel aggressive immigration enforcement in other major cities and constrain lower-court judges. “The Supreme Court majority makes clear that average non-white workers are targets, and it functionally gives its stamp of approval for Trump to trample their bedrock constitutional rights,” he said. “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” she wrote. The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said he found Kavanaugh's rationale for lifting the stay “disturbing.” He pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can't be considered in college admissions. “They prevent the use of race (in college admissions) to tackle discrimination but allow the use of race to potentially discriminate,” Bonta said. Gavin Newsom, a vocal Trump opponent, said the order would allow agents wide latitude to make stops “including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California's families and small businesses.” Plaintiff Pedro Vasquez Perdomo said ICE agents never explained why they stopped him or showed a warrant. Now, the Supreme Court says that's okay?” he said in a statement.</p>

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram looks at how Congress may be getting involved in the debate over pay for college athletes on 'Special Report.' 1-ranked Texas Longhorns at the goal line three times. Ohio State quickly curbed talk about the greatness of Texas quarterback Arch Manning. Especially after they shellacked Grambling State 70-0 in Week 2. And we haven't even talked about Bill Belichick's coaching debut at North Carolina. So settle in for quite a season between now and mid-January. But there could be new rules off the playing field. Congress may attempt to referee what collegiate athletes can earn from their own name, likeness and image, better known as NILs. Carson Hinzman #75 and Emeka Egbuka #2 of the Ohio State Buckeyes celebrate after scoring a touchdown in the second quarter against the Indiana Hoosiers at Ohio Stadium on Nov. 23, 2024 in Columbus, Ohio. "Without clear rules and an enforcement mechanism, the NIL landscape has become akin to the Wild West," said Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C. There are competing bills in the House and Senate to address compensation for student-athletes. "We've already seen states competing with one another to get a leg up. And that patchwork is threatening the values and the balance that makes college sports so special," said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich. Rep. Debbie Dingell speaks to reporters on June 11, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Getty Images) She has reservations about the current House bill. The House legislation comes on the heels of a multibillion-dollar agreement approved by a federal judge earlier this summer. That agreement lets schools pay student-athletes up to $20.5 million per year. Those sports generate the most revenue in college athletics. "Whether or not we should allow student-athletes to be considered employees under the law, the ramifications of that would be pretty profound," said Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind. He noted that a Senate bill to regulate pay in college sports is on "the proverbial one-yard line." They believe it inhibits the rights of college athletes – as workers. "This bill bans student-athletes from First Amendment rights to form unions, also guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act," said Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla. "They have basic rights. She claims the bill will trigger "a conflict" between sports that earn money at schools and those that don't. Most Democrats argue that lawmakers should focus instead on problems in higher education, not the athletic field. Then-President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a news conference at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 16, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida. "And the way we're going with this administration, I don't even know if there's going to be any colleges or universities worth fighting for." Pallone added that the committee's focus was misguided amid questions about education and healthcare. And instead would rather talk about college sports," said Pallone. In addition, players associations for Major League Baseball, the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Soccer all oppose the legislation. They believe the bill inhibits college athletes from negotiating a fair wage. The "pay" and "NIL" issues have vexed top collegiate athletic officials for years. The NCAA and many schools have long pushed for congressional intervention. But we need the help of Congress and national legislation," said ACC commissioner Jim Phillips on Fox News earlier this year. Former Alabama football coach Nick Saban echoed Phillips during an interview with colleague Bret Baier. "We need some kind of federal standard and guidelines that allow people to enforce their own rules." Alabama coach Nick Saban reacts in the fourth quarter at Bryant-Denny Stadium on Sept. 11, 2010. "I think if they had had stronger management, if they made some decisions early on, we wouldn't be in this position," said Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C. "It's unfortunate that Congress has to step in at all." However, the North Carolina Republican added he was "deeply concerned about the future of college sports if we don't act." That's why Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., wants Congress involved – even if she opposes the current House plan. Attorneys general from Florida, Ohio, New York, Tennessee and the District of Columbia are worried about antitrust provisions in the House plan. So this fight may spill into overtime on Capitol Hill. Congress could vote sometime on legislation refining NILs. Or lawmakers may again punt – as they've done for several years now. But this is a lower priority for Congress. Lawmakers must avoid a government shutdown by Oct. 1, and they may need to wrestle with another government funding round later this fall.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump celebrated news on Monday that an alumni group from West Point canceled an award ceremony set to honor Tom Hanks, with the president calling the famous actor “destructive” and “WOKE.” “Important move!” Trump said in a post on his social media network Monday. “We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! West Point, its alumni association and a representative for Hanks did not immediately respond to messages and calls seeking comment Monday. This summer, the Army secretary directed West Point to review its hiring practices, bar outside groups from choosing employees and remove a newly announced hire who led the nation's cybersecurity agency under then-President Joe Biden. Earlier this year, West Point disbanded a dozen cadet clubs centered on ethnicity, gender, race and sexuality in response to the Trump administration's push to eliminate diversity programs throughout government. The school also rehung a painting of Gen. Robert E. Lee dressed in his Confederate uniform in the library as the Trump administration has pushed to restore Confederate names and monuments that have been removed in recent years. Last year's recipient was former President Barack Obama. Hanks starred in the 1998 war drama “Saving Private Ryan” and co-produced with Steven Spielberg the World War II HBO miniseries “Band of Brothers.” Hanks is among Hollywood's most politically active celebrities, donating to support a slew of Democratic politicians and progressive causes. He vocally endorsed Obama, Hillary Clinton and Biden in their presidential bids and signed an open letter endorsing Kamala Harris last year. In 2012, he narrated a short documentary, “The Road We've Traveled,” for Obama's reelection campaign. To fete Biden's inauguration in 2021, Hanks hosted a 90-minute prime-time television special, “Celebrating America.” He also served as a celebrity co-chair for When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization founded by former first lady Michelle Obama to boost voter outreach. He called the then-Republican candidate a “self-involved gasbag” during an on-stage interview in 2016. After Trump took office, Hanks said during an American Civil Liberties Union fundraiser that actions like the attempted travel ban for Muslim-majority countries represented a “brand of tragedy.” During Biden's inauguration, he spoke of “deep divisions and a troubling rancor in our land” and warned against attempts to twist the truth by those entrusted with public service during a 2023 Harvard commencement speech.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Homeland Security launched Operation Midway Blitz on Monday to start detaining illegal immigrants in Chicago and Illinois after Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) repeatedly refused to cooperate with the Trump administration's crime crackdown. “This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the department said. DHS is launching Operation Midway Blitz in honor of Katie Abraham who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run car wreck caused by criminal illegal alien Julio Cucul-Bol in Illinois.This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois… pic.twitter.com/OjbgtTE1Au “For years, Governor Pritzker and his fellow sanctuary politicians released Tren de Aragua gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago's streets—putting American lives at risk and making Chicago a magnet for criminals,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. The announcement featured an interview with Abraham's parents, both of whom denounced illegal immigration based on their personal experience. Abraham died in January when Julio Cucul-Bol hit her with his vehicle and fled. Probably not the guy you want to stand behind.” They pushed back against claims that the Trump administration is not giving illegal immigrants due process, saying their daughter did not get that right. Ever since President Donald Trump teased that Chicago would be one of the cities after Washington, D.C., to see federal pressure on violent crime and illegal immigration, Pritzker vowed to oppose the effort. Trump fired back, most recently posting an AI-generated, Apocalypse Now-inspired meme depicting a squadron of helicopters en route to Chicago. Operation Midway Blitz appears to be solely related to immigration enforcement rather than a full-blown policing mission, as Trump said Monday morning, he was “waiting for a call from Chicago” for armed troops and agents to enter the city. The president previously indicated he would like Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to invite federal assistance to the Windy City, even though they have condemned Trump's threats.</p>

Police said the attack on Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old who had fled to the U.S. from war-torn Ukraine, was random. GoFundMe said that it removed multiple fundraising campaigns created on behalf of Decarlos Brown Jr., the ex-convict accused of stabbing and killing Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska aboard a Charlotte, North Carolina, light-rail train. "GoFundMe's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit fundraisers for the legal defense of anyone formally charged with a violent crime. Consistent with this long-standing policy, all fundraisers for Decarlos Brown Jr.'s legal defense have been removed from the platform, and any donors have been fully refunded," a company spokesperson told Fox News Digital. According to information reviewed by Fox News Digital, the campaigns were taken down within hours of being flagged. GoFundMe declined to specify how many pages were removed but emphasized that it actively scans for and blocks attempts to launch campaigns on behalf of individuals facing violent charges. Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed three times with a folding knife during what police described as a random attack on Aug. 22. Zarutska, 23, fled Ukraine with her family in 2022 to escape Russia's war before settling in Charlotte, according to her obituary. Fox News Digital has reached out to Zepeddie's for comment. "Recently, our Zepeddie's family suffered a tremendous loss. We lost not only an incredible employee but a true friend. Since her passing, we have kept a candle burning in her memory—a small reminder of the warmth, kindness and light she brought into our lives every single day. We are so grateful for the love, support and prayers we've received during this difficult time," Zepeddie's Pizza said in a statement. "Iryna, we miss you more than words can say. You will forever be in our hearts." Friends remembered Iryna Zarutska as kind-hearted and creative. She studied art and dreamed of working with animals as a veterinary assistant. Her family described Zarutska as a passionate artist and graduate of Synergy College in Kyiv, where she earned a degree in Art and Restoration. WATCH: Ukrainian refugee stabbed to death on Charlotte light rail On Aug. 22, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, authorities found Zarutska stabbed to death on the Lynx Blue Line after she sat in front of Brown, who allegedly pulled out a folding knife and attacked her without provocation. Surveillance video reviewed by Fox News Digital shows Zarutska boarding the train just after 9:45 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 22. Around four minutes later, the man pulls out a knife and begins stabbing Zarutska three times, including in the neck. Records obtained by Fox News Digital reveal that Brown has a lengthy criminal history spanning more than a decade. His convictions include larceny and breaking and entering in 2013, as well as a 2015 conviction for robbery with a dangerous weapon, for which he served more than six years in prison. He was released in 2020 and remained on parole until 2021. More recent charges included communicating threats and misuse of the 911 system earlier this year. While campaigns to raise money for Brown's defense have been shut down, a separate, verified fundraiser supporting Zarutska's family remains active on GoFundMe. I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed this morning or last night in Charlotte by a madman."

Josh Stein broke his silence over the murder of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte train after facing heated criticism over the weekend for not speaking out earlier despite the release of a brutal video of the attack. "I am heartbroken for the family of Iryna Zarutska, who lost their loved one to this senseless act of violence, and I am appalled by the footage of her murder. We need more cops on the beat to keep people safe," Stein posted on X on Monday morning after a weekend of criticism for not posting about last month's murder and a request for comment from Fox News Digital earlier Monday morning. I call upon the legislature to pass my law enforcement recruitment and retention package to address vacancies in our state and local agencies so they can stop these horrific crimes and hold violent criminals accountable," he continued. Social media exploded over the weekend after surveillance footage, released by the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS), showed 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska boarding a Lynx Blue line last month before a man pulled out a knife and began stabbing Zarutska three times, including at least once in the neck. Josh Stein is under fire for his silence over the murder of a Ukrainian woman on a Charlotte bus. Zarutska, who had fled war-town Ukraine, grabs her neck as blood spilled onto the floor. Authorities later pronounced her dead at the scene. The attack, which took place on August 22, prompted many on social media to criticize Stein for speaking out about George Floyd, a Black man killed by a White police officer, but not being as vocal for this murder, where a White woman was murdered by an alleged Black assailant. @NC_Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, has had nothing to say about the brutal murder of Iryna Zarutska, a resident of his state," journalist Megan Basham posted on X. "Yet, in 2020, when he was attorney general, he DID find time to lament the death of George Floyd and initiate a "Task Force for Racial Equity in Criminal Justice." "This task force's recommendations included increasing ‘pre-trial release'--which is exactly the kind of thing that allowed Zarutska's killer, DeCarlos Brown, to be on the streets after 14 previous arrests." "Not a word about Iryna Zarutska from Democrat North Carolina Governor Josh Stein," conservative influencer account LibsofTiktok posted on X. "Iryna Zarutska's slaying is the #1 new story on X - not just North Carolina - and yet NC Governor Josh Stein has had NOTHING to say about it," Article III Project senior counsel Will Chamberlain posted on X. "The lack of response by Democrat politicians in North Carolina is outrageous," John Lott, founder and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, posted on X. "This murderer had a long violent criminal record. "He was arrested 14 times," White House deputy press secretary Abigail Marone posted on X. And shame on your for trying to shift the blame." "Preposterous statement from the @NC_Governor," conservative commentator Michael Knowles posted on X. He was arrested over two dozen times! The problem is that liberal prosecutors, judges, and legislators like you refused to keep him locked up." "You were Attorney General of North Carolina when her killer was arrested and released from jail 14 times," conservative commentator Greg Price posted on X. The suspect, identified as 34-year-old Decarlos Brown, was arrested shortly after the stabbing and hospitalized before being arrested on a charge of first-degree murder. Records obtained by The New York Post showed that Brown has a history of arrests going back more than a decade, including charges of felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon and communicating threats. Police said Brown and Zarutska did not know each other and the attack had been random. Zarutska's death has renewed calls for action on public safety in Charlotte. Members of the Charlotte City Council expressed concern after Zarutska's murder about violence on the city's transit system. Fox News Digital's Bradford Betz contributed to this report.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's foreign minister departed for the U.S. on Monday to finalize steps for the return of several hundred South Korean workers detained in a massive immigration raid in Georgia, a spectacle that has caused confusion, shock and a sense of betrayal among many in the U.S.-allied nation. This image from video provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via DVIDS shows manufacturing plant employees waiting to have their legs shackled at the Hyundai Motor Group's electric vehicle plant, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025, in Ellabell, Ga. (Corey Bullard/U.S. South Korea announced Sunday that the U.S. has agreed to release them and that it would bring them home on a charter flight once final administrative steps are completed. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters in London that Trump sent a “powerful” message to investors and their employees. Speaking with reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the Hyundai plant raid sends a clear signal. Appearing at a legislative hearing before his departure, Foreign Minister Cho Hyun called the raid “a very serious matter” that he hadn't anticipated at all, as many lawmakers lamented the American operation. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun listens to lawmaker's question during a session of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, Sept. 8, 2025. Another lawmaker, Kim Gi-hyeon from the conservative opposition People Power Party, said the “unacceptable” raid dealt South Korea a “severe blow that will be difficult to heal.” The Trump administration has made a series of workplace raids to fulfill its mass deportation agenda, but this was the Homeland Security agency's largest yet at a single site, and targeted Georgia, a symbol of bilateral cooperation where many large South Korean businesses operate and plan future investments. Particularly stunning is that this raid came only weeks after South Korea promised to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. investments as part of a tariff deal, and days after Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung held their first summit meeting in Washington on Aug. 25. “The way that Trump is pressuring the Korean government and inflicting damages on its people is very rough and unilateral,” said Kim Taewoo, former head of Seoul's Korea Institute for National Unification. In a long-term perspective, it won't be good for U.S. national interests as well.” In an editorial Monday, South Korea's biggest newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, wrote that “Fundamental doubts emerge: What does the U.S. mean by ‘alliance,' and are investment benefits guaranteed across administrations?” This image from video provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via DVIDS shows manufacturing plant employees being escorted outside the Hyundai Motor Group's electric vehicle plant, Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025, in Ellabell, Ga. (Corey Bullard/U.S. Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University said the U.S. goal of restoring manufacturing through foreign investments is colliding with its lack of visa and immigration systems that could support such an effort. South Korean companies operating in the U.S. will likely suffer “a great confusion” as they will now be forced to bring workers back home to resolve visa issues, he said. Such developments would undermine U.S. interests, but Trump won't likely make any concessions anytime soon, Paik predicted. But South Korean officials and experts have expressed frustration over what they call strict U.S. limits on visas for highly skilled foreign workers to protect its domestic workforce, and inaction on Seoul's calls to expand work visas for skilled South Korean nationals. As a result, South Korean companies have been relying on short-term visitor visas or the Electronic System for Travel Authorization to send the workers they need to launch manufacturing facilities or handle other setup tasks. “The incident will inevitably exacerbate shortages of skilled workers with legal work authorization and create pressure for increases in labor costs, potentially disrupting operations and rising costs across major business projects in the United States,” South Korea's Eugene Investment & Securities said in a report Monday. Daishin Securities, meanwhile, predicted in a report that the raid could delay operations at the targeted battery plant, which was slated to begin production early next year, potentially affecting Hyundai's EV business in America.</p>

The independent senator from Vermont criticized New York Democratic leaders, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, for refusing to endorse Mamdani in the heated race for Gracie Mansion. "I find it hard to understand how the major Democratic leaders in New York State are not supporting the Democratic candidate," Sanders said. "One might think that if a candidate starting at 2% in the polls gets 50,000 volunteers, creates enormous excitement, gets young people involved in the political process, gets nontraditional voters to vote, Democratic leaders would be jumping up and down. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani hold hands during the town hall "Fighting Oligarchy" event at Brooklyn College on Sept. 6, 2025. The Brooklyn native capitalized on the event as an opportunity to pressure New York Democrats to rally behind their nominee. Mamdani is fielding challenges from two independent candidates, former Gov. When reached for comment regarding Sanders' apparent call to action on Saturday, Hochul's office pointed to the governor's comments on "Fox News Sunday." "There's been so much speculation about what I'm going to do. I vote in Buffalo, New York, just for the record. But listen, it is up to the voters and there should not be outside influences on this decision from the White House on down. Let the voters of New York decide," Hochul told Fox News' Shannon Bream. Regardless of who wins the New York City mayoral race, Hochul said she needs that person to work with her to protect the Jewish community and ensure businesses can continue to thrive through affordability and public safety. We'll see what happens," Hochul added regarding an endorsement. Schumer and Jeffries did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., right, is joined by Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for a press conference in Statuary Hall at the Capitol on Feb. 12, 2025. As Sanders rallied New Yorkers for Mamdani, the town hall wasn't without its detractors. one protester yelled at Mamdani as he addressed the crowd. President Donald Trump has dubbed Mamdani a "100% communist lunatic" since he won the Democratic primary in June. Ahead of the town hall in Brooklyn, the two progressive leaders marched alongside union members in Manhattan's Labor Day parade. On Saturday afternoon, Mamdani posed for a photo with Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in Astoria. The post amassed more than 6 million views on X as of Monday morning. Sanders, a two-time Democratic presidential nominee runner-up, was an early endorser of Mamdani's primary campaign, along with Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez sparked sizable buzz on the "Fighting Oligarchy" tour earlier this year, firing up thousands of Democrats at rallies across the United States who have been left without a clear party leader since devastating losses up and down the ballot in 2024. Mamdani's campaign platform promises progressive ideas like rent freezes, city-run grocery stores, free buses and raising the minimum wage — all of which he plans to pay for by raising taxes on corporations and the 1%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Attorney General Letitia James indicated on Monday that she is intervening in a lawsuit filed by her Texas counterpart, who is suing a New York county clerk for refusing to enforce a judgment against an abortion provider operating in the Empire State. The legal battle is set to test the legality of New York's abortion shield law, which prevents other states from suing or prosecuting abortion providers in New York. “Texas has no authority in New York, and no power to impose its cruel abortion ban here,” she said in a statement. “Our shield law exists to protect New Yorkers from out-of-state extremists, and New York will always stand strong as a safe haven for health care and freedom of choice. Ulster County Clerk Taylor Bruck twice declined to file a summary judgment and court summons against Dr. Margaret Carpenter, who lost a civil lawsuit in March. Carpenter, a founder of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine Access, allegedly prescribed and mailed abortion pills to a patient in Collin County, Texas. She did not have a medical license in Texas. She is expected to maintain the legality of New York's abortion laws. Paxton, confident in his argument, responded forcefully to the Democratic attorney general's intervention. “Letitia James is a lawless abortionist who is obsessed with killing babies and weaponizing her office for her political career,” he wrote on X. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) defended New York against out-of-state litigation and prosecution regarding the abortion case. Jeff Landry (R-LA) signed a warrant for Carpenter's arrest in February, Hochul denied the request. Greg Abbott (R-TX) is expected to sign the bill into law. New York is one of eight states that have passed such a law since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Ukraine war: President Donald Trump said he would speak with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin “very soon” after signaling readiness to move on sanctions against Russia after it launched its largest air attack of the war this weekend. • Crime crackdowns: The president is continuing to tease more federal action on crime in American cities, mulling on social media “Who's Next?? ?” Trump previously said a decision on a crime crackdown in Chicago would come in the “next day or two.” Meanwhile, Trump also decried the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, adding that his administration will not tolerate violent crime and vowing “to get to the end of it.” • Trump's approval rating: Trump remains broadly underwater on his approval rating as two new polls find widespread opposition to his use of the National Guard against crime in American cities. The Supreme Court ruling in favor of divisive federal immigration patrol efforts in California comes as President Donald Trump and his administration continues to aggressively crack down on illegal immigration. Los Angeles is expected to serve as a blueprint for the administration as officials plan to move forward with the president's immigration and crime crackdowns in other cities. Here's what we know about the immigration raids in California: CNN's Maureen Chowdhury, Devan Cole, John Fritze, Michelle Krupa, Elizabeth Wolfe, Norma Galeana, Stephen Collinson and Kaanita Iyer contributed reporting to this post. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine arrived in Puerto Rico today amid rising tensions between the US and Venezuela. The Pentagon said in its daily schedule that both Hegseth and Caine were traveling, though it has not released any further details about the visit. CNN previously reported that 10 F-35 jets were being deployed to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean, following a military strike on an alleged drug boat tied to a Venezuelan cartel. The Supreme Court today backed President Donald Trump's push to allow immigration enforcement officials to continue what critics describe as “roving patrols” in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the 4th Amendment. President Donald Trump touched on his administration's efforts to exert influence over Smithsonian Institute museums during remarks at the White House Religious Liberty Commission, saying he got “a little involved” due to what he believes is an overemphasis on negative aspects of American history. I said, ‘What about the good things we've done?' Trump gave credit to the Smithsonian, however, adding, “Honestly, they're making changes. You know, they were also told what to do by people that came before me, in all fairness, but they're making changes. The Smithsonian Institute is approaching a deadline on Friday to submit the first round of requested materials to the White House as it undergoes an internal review, including 250th anniversary programming, current exhibition content, traveling and upcoming exhibitions and internal guidelines and governance. Last month, Trump said that the Smithsonian is “out of control” and puts too much focus too much on “how bad slavery was.” At the Museum of the Bible Monday, Trump also said that he delivered his personal family bible, which he said was given to him by his mother, to go on display. According to financial documents released in June, Trump made more than $1.3 million Trump from Lee Greenwood's “God Bless the USA” Bible. President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration will soon issue guidance aimed at protecting the right to pray in public schools. The Education Department is expected to issue the guidance, which Trump said was spurred by an episode in Texas where a student was prevented from organizing a group prayer on school grounds for an injured classmate. President Donald Trump again lashed out at Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker this morning, questioning why the Democrat doesn't want federal intervention to crack down on crime in Chicago. This would mean that over the past number of weeks, approximately 50 people were killed, and hundreds were shot, many expected to die. Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn't want Federal Government HELP! Trump also said that “only the criminals will be hurt” by any federal efforts in the city, and that crime there is “ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!! Over the weekend, Pritzker called Trump “a wannabe dictator” and interpreted his “Chipocolypse Now” meme as a threat “to go to war with an American city.” Pritzker said in a recent appearance on MSNBC that if Trump really wanted to help Chicago fight crime, “why not help us with providing ATF, the people that can interdict firearms?” As CNN reported, seven people were killed in Chicago from Friday evening through Sunday, preliminary police figures show. Trump administration officials have, for weeks, privately discussed targeting Chicago and Boston — two Democratic-led cities that drew the ire of the administration over their so-called sanctuary policies. The escalating rhetoric from the president and his officials is in line with how the administration is planning its aggressive immigration agenda moving forward, equipped with more funds and efforts to bring on more federal personnel. Immigration arrests have already been ongoing in each city this year. But discussions picked up over the weekend to move forward with an operation sooner. Operations in Chicago are expected to mirror Los Angeles. The man charged with operations there, Gregory Bovino, was deployed to Chicago to do the same there, officials told CNN. One official described it to CNN as “Los Angeles on the road.” President Donald Trump is continuing to tease more federal action on crime in American cities, praising his initiative in Washington, DC, and signaling on social media that he's still mulling the decision of where to go next. The administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, DC, and federalized the city's police force, though that aspect is expected to expire this week. Yesterday, Trump told reporters that he would make a decision “as to where we go over the next day or two,” when asked about his plans for Chicago. Over the weekend, Trump posted what appears to be an AI image of himself as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, a character in “Apocalypse Now,” writing that he loves the “smell of deportations in the morning.” President Donald Trump remains broadly underwater on his approval rating as two new polls find widespread opposition to his use of the National Guard against crime in American cities. The CNN Poll of Polls averaging surveys conducted from mid-August through early September finds Trump's approval rating at 43% approve to 55% disapprove, similar to where it's held all summer. In the CBS poll, nearly six in 10 Americans say they oppose Trump deploying the National Guard to Washington, DC (57% oppose) or other cities (58%). Slightly more (61%) say they would oppose Trump deploying National Guard troops to their own local city or area. More see Trump's deployment of the National Guard as a purely political move (45%) than as one designed to reduce crime (33%), with another 22% saying Trump is motivated both by political reasons and a goal of reducing crime. The poll finds broad partisan divides across all these questions, with independents generally opposed and far more likely to see political motivation in Trump's moves (51%) than a push to reduce crime (28%). The NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll was conducted online August 13 through September 1 among 30,196 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. The CBS News/YouGov poll was conducted online September 3 through 5 among 2,385 adults and has an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 points. America is stronger with the power of prayer,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said. Trump's remarks today will come amid a meeting of the Religious Liberty Commission he established by executive order in May. It is unassociated with the city's major Smithsonian museum system, and unlike Smithsonian institutions or the National Gallery of Art, it charges an admission fee. Trump's visit today will be his first stop at a museum since he ordered a review of Smithsonian organizations for programming and exhibitions the administration found objectionable. Europe's top sanctions envoy is in Washington, DC, today for discussions with US administration officials on tightening pressure on Russia, according to people familiar with the meetings. European Union sanctions envoy David O'Sullivan, who has spearheaded the bloc's sanctions regime against Russia, is expected to meet with officials at the US Treasury Department to discuss and coordinate potential measures on Moscow as it escalates the war in Ukraine. The meetings come as President Donald Trump has said he's ready to slap new measures on Moscow. Trump said yesterday that European leaders were expected in Washington early this week to discuss the Ukraine war. He also said he was prepared to apply new sanctions on Russia after it launched the largest drone attack to date in its three-and-a-half-year war. President Donald Trump said yesterday that he would speak to Russia's Vladimir Putin “very soon.” Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war this weekend, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these … The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.” Last month, administration officials told CNN that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace. Yesterday, Trump said: “I believe we're going to get it settled. Trump added European leaders would visit the US this week to work on a solution. “Certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday and individually, and I think we're going to get that settled.” Trump previously threatened “severe consequences” for Putin if he does not end the war, including the possibility of “massive sanctions or massive tariffs,” also signaling yesterday that he was ready to move on sanctions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Monday backed President Donald Trump's push to allow immigration enforcement officials to continue what critics describe as “roving patrols” in Southern California that lower courts said likely violated the Fourth Amendment. At issue were a series of incidents in which masked and heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulled aside people who identify as Latino – including some US citizens – around Los Angeles to interrogate them about their immigration status. Lower courts found that ICE likely had not established the “reasonable suspicion” required to justify those stops. The decision deals with seven counties in Southern California, but it has landed during a broader crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration – and officials are likely to read it as a tacit approval of similar practices elsewhere. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld that decision, which applied only to seven California counties. “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this court's case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors,” Kavanaugh wrote. “We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the “on-the-ground reality” of immigration arrests cuts against the federal government's fears that a court ruling could chill authorities' ability to detain and deport undocumented migrants. “The evidence in this case, however, reveals that the government is likely to continue relying solely on those four factors because that is what agents are currently authorized and instructed to do,” Sotomayor wrote. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “has called the District Judge an ‘idiot' and vowed that ‘none of [the government's] operations are going to change,'” Sotomayor wrote. Referring to Kavanaugh's concurrence, Sotomayor said that ICE agents aren't just conducting brief or routine traffic stops. Frimpong, appointed by President Joe Biden, said in her ruling that the court needed to decide whether the plaintiffs could prove the Trump administration “is indeed conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.” “Today's Supreme Court order puts people at grave risk, allowing federal agents in Southern California to target individuals because of their race, how they speak, the jobs they work, or just being at a bus stop or the car wash when ICE agents decide to raid a place,” said Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the ACLU, which was part of the legal team challenging the stops. “For anyone perceived as Latino by an ICE agent,” she added, “this means living in a fearful ‘papers please' regime, with risks of violent ICE arrests and detention.” Kavanaugh used his 10-page concurrence to launch into a broader discussion about the debate around illegal immigration. “To be sure, I recognize and fully appreciate that many (not all, but many) illegal immigrants come to the United States to escape poverty and the lack of freedom and opportunities in their home countries,” he wrote. Sotomayor leaned into a growing criticism around how the Supreme Court has handled high-profile emergency cases dealing with Trump: That it has offered no explanation. The court itself offered only a single paragraph of boilerplate language in siding with Trump. Kagan said earlier this year that she thought the court could often provide further explanation in its emergency decisions. But Kavanaugh and others have noted that the court is sometimes hesitant to signal which way it's leaning in a case. “In the last eight months, this court's appetite to circumvent the ordinary appellate process and weigh in on important issues has grown exponentially.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A shocking incident on board the light rail in Charlotte, North Carolina, in which a Ukrainian refugee was fatally stabbed and the suspect has a lengthy rap sheet, has once again put the spotlight on violent crime in cities and President Donald Trump's plans to use the federal government to counter it. The unprompted attack happened shortly before 10 p.m. on Aug. 22. The victim, Iryna Zarutska, was a refugee from Ukraine. GoFundMe takes down fundraisers for North Carolina stabbing suspect Zarutska was pronounced dead at the scene. Zarutska, a 23-year-old refugee, fled Ukraine in 2022 with her immediate relatives due to the war. “Iryna will be remembered for her kindness, her creativity, and the lasting impression she left on everyone she met. The suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown Jr., has over a dozen charges dating back to 2014. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bond. A judge ordered Brown to be evaluated for 60 days, and his next court appearance is on Sept. 19. Brown's criminal record includes armed robbery, felony larceny, breaking and entering, and shoplifting dating back to 2014, according to jail records reviewed by WBTV. In court Friday, Zarutska's uncle said, “The accused has taken a very bright, beautiful woman from our family, and we are heartbroken by that. I ask the court not to release him.” Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles offered her condolences and said she did not think it was appropriate to share video of the attack widely. I want to thank our media partners and community members who have chosen not to repost or share the footage out of respect for Iryna's family,” she said. My prayers remain with her loved ones as they continue to grieve through an unimaginable time,” the mayor said. “Like so many of you, I'm heartbroken — and I've been thinking hard about what safety really looks like in our city. I remain committed to doing all we can to protect our residents and ensure Charlotte is a place where everyone feels safe.” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized the mayor's comments. Because she and other public officials in her city bear responsibility,” Duffy posted on social media. Local and national Republican leaders also accused the mayor of not doing enough to combat violent crime in the city. North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall tied the attack to “soft on crime” policies, and Rep. Mark Harris (R-NC) said “violence in Charlotte is a microcosm of a national epidemic.” President Donald Trump commented on the attack during a speech at the Religious Liberty Commission on Monday morning. “I give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed in Charlotte by a madman — a lunatic — while she's just sitting there.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court upheld an $83.3 million judgment against President Donald Trump for defamation against writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019. A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected on Monday Trump's appeal of a January 2024 jury finding related to the president's 2019 denial of Carroll's allegation that he raped her at a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room sometime in the mid-1990s. Trump has repeatedly denied that the incident occurred, and his 2019 denials of the allegation led to Carroll filing the first of two defamation lawsuits against him. The appeals court panel rejected Trump's appeal, in which he argued he was entitled to presidential immunity for the statements he made denying Carroll's accusation because he made them while serving his first term in the White House. “We conclude that Trump has failed to identify any grounds that would warrant reconsidering our prior holding on presidential immunity. The three-judge panel that issued the ruling Monday was made up of two Biden appointees and one Obama appointee. The ruling concerns the first of two defamation cases Carroll has brought against Trump. In the first case, Carroll was awarded $83.3 million for Trump's 2019 comments. In the second case Carroll brought, a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing her during the alleged Bergdorf Goodman incident, along with finding him liable for defaming her with comments he made in 2022 denying the incident again, leading to a $5 million judgment against him. A panel on the 2nd Circuit similarly rejected the appeal in that case in December.</p>

There are more than 200 mosquito species in the country — but just a few to worry about. There are more than 200 species of mosquitoes in the United States, but only a handful are known to be dangerous to humans because of the diseases they carry. But now, the concern for mosquito-borne disease threats is rising. While a mosquito bite may have long been merely an itchy inconvenience, getting bitten today could be much more serious. The good news is mosquitoes aren't indestructible monsters; a well-aimed finger flick can end one forever. They aren't fans of the cold — most mosquitoes stop biting when temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Here, diseases such as malaria and yellow fever have dropped in the rankings as public health threats over the 20th century with concerted efforts to keep them in check. But this progress is fragile — and it's time to be on the lookout. Temperatures are rising on average due to climate change. That is opening up new habitats for these bloodsuckers while making them more vivacious in places where they're already established. Newer invasive mosquito species that arrived as stowaways are also setting up shop across the country. It's not just the geographic range — warmer temperatures are allowing mosquitoes to survive at higher elevations, too. Mosquitoes are also very sensitive to humidity and rainfall. They need water to lay their eggs and for their larvae to mature, and the climate is changing in rather unfortunate ways in this regard, too; more extreme rainfall events are creating the standing water conditions that are ideal breeding grounds for some of the more dangerous disease carriers. Humans have also stacked the deck in mosquitoes' favor. Deforestation and ecosystem losses mean that there are fewer natural mosquito predators like bats and birds to keep a lid on their numbers, while urbanization — with its more impervious roads, sidewalks, and parking lots — creates more places where water can pool and mosquitoes can breed. Newer diseases like chikungunya and Zika have started to make inroads into the country as well. There are seven key mosquitoes worth tracking in the US that have benefited from these changes and are known to transmit some of the most common and dangerous infections. These are some of the biters you're most likely to see and could be the ones that make you sick. Containing mosquitoes requires a coordinated strategy between cities, states, and the federal government to anticipate where they're going and quench outbreaks. But knowing which mosquitoes are around you can help you track the potential threats in your neighborhood and take steps to protect yourself from annoying bites — or worse. In the grand scheme of things, it's actually uncommon for a given mosquito to spread any kind of disease at all. So, the spread of mosquito-borne disease is a numbers game, a function of how many mosquitoes and how many infected hosts are around. In America's growing urban and suburban centers, there are a lot of opportunities. Perfect temperature and rainfall conditions might create a bumper crop of mosquitoes, but if there are no infected animals or people around, there won't be any transmission. Still, more favorable conditions for mosquitoes increase the odds that a disease will spread. Figuring out which ones are spreading and what infections they might be carrying can help health officials determine what kinds of pesticides to use, where they should target spraying, what kinds of repellents are effective, and the symptoms individuals should try to identify. This disease causes headaches, fever, and body aches, though most people don't develop symptoms at all. They can also carry St. Louis encephalitis and Eastern equine encephalitis, rare but dangerous diseases that can cause fatal brain infections. Here are the seven types of mosquitoes to watch out for. And remember: It's only the females in each of these insects that you need to worry about, and that gives you a great starting point for narrowing in on potential threats. In general, female mosquitoes are larger than males and males tend to have bushy, feathery antennae, while females have straight, unadorned antennae. Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, originated in Europe but is now found on every continent except Antarctica. Culex quinquefasciatus, the southern house mosquito, looks similar to Culex pipiens and can cross-breed with it, though it tends to prefer warmer climates. Culex tarsalis, the Western Encephalitis mosquito, is much more prevalent in the Western US, especially in wetlands and areas with irrigated farms. The disease was a scourge for much of US history until a national campaign of insecticide spraying and destroying mosquito breeding sites drove down infection rates. Malaria was declared eliminated in the US in 1951, but the Anopheles mosquitoes that spread it are still around and rebounding. Anopheles mosquitoes have a pair of long appendages called palpi on either side of their proboscis, giving their heads a distinctive trident. They are often found resting with their abdomens pointing in the air and are about 5 millimeters long, less than a quarter inch. Anopheles freeborni, the western malaria mosquito, is brownish-black with spotted wings. These mosquitoes are notorious container breeders, meaning they only need tiny pools of water — such as in flower pots, old tires, or bottle caps — to reproduce. Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito, has white stripes on its thorax in the shape of a lyre, and it likes to bite people indoors. It's a daytime biter and can reach 10 millimeters in length. Again, a lot of things have to align to ignite a mosquito-borne disease outbreak, but the US is becoming more hospitable to the insects that spread some of the most worrying illnesses. Mosquito-borne diseases are often spotted in travelers returning from areas like the tropics where these illnesses are endemic, but in recent years, the US has seen cases of them spread to people who haven't been abroad. With warmer average temperatures, mosquitoes have longer breeding seasons as spring starts earlier and summer ends later. Their reproductive cycles accelerate, as well, so more generations can arise in a season. Pathogens also replicate faster inside the mosquitoes when it's warmer, increasing the likelihood that a bite will lead to an infection. However, the various mosquito species all have slightly different preferences for their environments. Some are more tolerant of the cold (to a point). Depending on how much average temperatures continue to rise, the suitable range for each mosquito species will look different. Even under a scenario where humanity's greenhouse gas emissions eventually taper off and global temperatures stabilize by the end of the century, it will still be warmer than it was, and most disease-spreading mosquitoes will have a much larger tolerable range across the US. Health departments can begin surveillance to proactively find out which mosquitoes are present and what pathogens they're carrying. From there, they can deploy interventions like preventing water accumulation or spraying targeted pesticides. The growing range of mosquitoes also makes a compelling case for preserving habitats for mosquito-eaters like bats to control their numbers. Mosquito-borne diseases are a threat, but they can be managed with good planning. Otherwise, there will be more dangerous infections buzzing over the horizon.

This small Texas city is leading the country's response. BROWNSVILLE, Texas — How do you capture the deadliest animal on Earth, one that has been responsible for the death of more people than any other species in history? Here at America's southern border, it's not with high-tech weaponry, but with a black plastic tub of stinky water tucked under a bush. Surrounded by tall, yellowing grass near a sports complex, the bait water reeks of damp soil and decaying vegetation. This simple, humble device is called a gravid trap and its fetid smell is meant to mimic the ideal breeding site for mosquitoes. On a recent, humid Texas summer day with triple-digits on the thermometer, it proved to be very effective: Ensnared inside are dozens of mosquitoes, many ready to lay eggs. Collecting mosquitoes from traps and looking for larvae in roadside ditches isn't an activity you'll find in South Texas tourism brochures. Malaria has been around for as long as people walked on two feet, and it still infects around 250 million people per year and kills more than 600,000. Right now, most of the devastation from infections transmitted by mosquitoes is in developing countries. In much of the US, mosquitoes are mostly just a buzzy, itchy nuisance. It took decades of painstaking public health work in the US to control disease-carrying insects, reshaping the landscape and using blunt tactics like draining swamps, cutting down forests, and recklessly spraying pesticides like DDT, whose effects we're still dealing with. Continuing to keep these diseases away demands constant vigilance, but the country's success in diminishing mosquito-borne disease has pushed surveillance down the list of public health priorities, and few health departments are investing the resources to keep tabs on these bloodsuckers. Laying traps, collecting them a day or two later, cataloging the insects, running genetic tests to identify pathogens, collating the data, and preparing a counteroffensive is difficult, tedious work, and Gonzalez is one of just a handful of experts in the whole country doing this job full time, and Brownsville is one of the few cities willing to invest in her work. That's because Brownsville, a city of 190,000 people on the US-Mexico border, can't afford to be complacent. Brownsville's location has made it a sentinel for the US-wide rise in vector-borne disease driven by travel, urbanization, and a warming climate — and the city's efforts to stay ahead of the threats are uncommonly robust because it's where all these factors collide. “We usually get the first of everything and anything,” Gonzalez said. Vector-borne illnesses are starting to erupt further inland as changes in the environment and human movement overwhelm our past efforts to contain mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are a fact of nature, but the evolving threats they pose are a consequence of how humanity has reshaped the environment, and how that environment in turn is changing us. “Now you have a greater presence of mosquitoes because of the warmer temperatures, and you're going to end up with an outbreak in parts of the world that probably would never have seen it before.” In an overgrown lot in a residential neighborhood dotted with illegally dumped mattresses and furniture, Gonzalez checks another type of mosquito trap. Its lure is meant to well, smell like us. Our most dangerous adversaries, it turns out, see us merely as carbon-spewing bowls of sweat. “Everyone smells different, and that's why some people get attacked more than others,” Gonzalez said with a shrug. Zika virus disease is a heartbreaking infection spread by Aedes mosquitoes, a collection of species that thrives in tiny pools of water near where people live. In pregnant people, the disease can cause serious birth defects, including infants born with shrunken heads. “Zika, for us, was the big moment,” said Rodriguez, Brownsville's public health director. Gonzalez joined the team in October 2020, fresh out of grad school, and just in time to put her skills to the test. “I literally had just defended my thesis that Wednesday, and by the next Thursday, I was already dealing with four cases of suspected dengue,” Gonzalez said. Dengue continues to lurk in the Rio Grande Valley. Last year, Cameron Country reported a locally transmitted case of dengue. The city has a hotline where residents can report mosquito infestations and request spraying, especially if they know which species is buzzing around. That data then feeds into mapping software that can identify potential hot spots and coordinate mosquito control measures across the city. Alexis de la Cruz, a public health analyst for the city of Brownsville, told me that officials can see where citizens have asked for insecticide treatments, identified potential breeding sites, or found mosquito larvae. Using GPS, de la Cruz can track the routes of spraying trucks and where anti-vector treatments like mosquito dunks have been deployed. “People think neighborhoods that are low income are going to have the worst mosquitoes, but people in really nice neighborhoods also have really bad mosquito problems because they water their lawns a lot,” de la Cruz said. Read our field guide for identifying the species across the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes genuses — featuring quick-reference cards, just like this one: Applying mosquito controls is already a complicated and expensive process. Hard as it may be to believe, most mosquitoes aren't harmful — even if they do leave us pretty itchy. Mosquitoes can also become desensitized to certain pesticides over time. Plus, the most dangerous mosquito species are cagey, hiding away during the day and creeping back out at dusk to bite. While the temperatures can get too hot even for mosquitoes to get on our nerves, they know how to lay low. Brownsville, like much of the US, is getting warmer, and mosquitoes prosper in the heat, breeding faster and for a longer duration. Sudden deluges can create pools and puddles that make ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes; some mosquitoes, like those from the Aedes genus, don't need much and can breed in a bottle cap filled with standing water. Losing natural habitats means there are fewer natural mosquito predators like bats and birds around — allowing mosquitoes to creep in closer and in greater numbers. New neighborhoods are going up around Brownsville, which means lots more paved surfaces and retention ponds — essentially creating little island chains where water can stagnate and mosquitoes can jump from one region to another. “In the past year, we have about 48 miles of new subdivision, which is insane. There have been more asylum-seekers coming through the city from regions like Central America or even further in recent years. Just 30 minutes from the Gulf Coast, Brownsville is also a popular staging area for vacationers. It's also just inland from Starbase, SpaceX's rocket launch facility. Brownsville has a rising profile as a birdwatching destination, particularly for migratory birds like the Redhead duck and the Blue-winged Teal. Brownsville used to have to send suspected infected mosquitoes to the Texas Department of State Health Services in Austin for testing, but now they have a modular laboratory where they can do the work in-house, speeding up the turnaround time. Once a mosquito tests positive or a resident falls ill, city health officials work to trace the geographic epicenter of the outbreak. They begin spraying insecticides in the area tailored to a specific vector species. This whole process of spaying, dumping water, treatment, and communication can last weeks. During that time, city workers like Gonzalez continue to set up traps and patrol the city with F-150 pickup trucks outfitted with noisy insecticide sprayers and air conditioners powerful enough to keep up with the South Texas sun. Each mosquito trap can cost up to $300, a PCR machine to confirm the presence of a disease can cost $15,000, and the salary of a specialist like Gonzalez adds even more to the bill, on top of the other city workers roped in to help with a mosquito outbreak response. Gonzalez is one of three full-time staffers on the vector control team, and the program has an annual operations budget of $400,000. That's why few cities have followed Brownsville's lead in developing their own in-house mosquito surveillance and response system — it's a big, ongoing expense to deal with a threat that may not materialize for a long time. But that means help may not be readily available when dengue or West Nile cases suddenly start piling up. Truly containing vector-borne disease requires a multipronged strategy, and there's only so much city officials can do on their own. Jose Campo Maldonado, an infectious disease physician at the University of Texas Health Rio Grande Valley, said he's trying to educate his fellow doctors and patients about their role in dealing with infections spread by mosquitoes. Health workers are getting better at recognizing potential symptoms of vector-borne disease, but “there is room for improvement,” Campo Maldonado said. One of the challenges is that vector-borne diseases don't always present on their own; they often occur in people who are facing other health problems like heart disease or diabetes, so they can be tricky to recognize and treat. Many patients, on the other hand, have unstable living situations that leave them more vulnerable to getting bitten, or they can't afford treatments. “It's really hot outside, and sometimes it's hard to follow some of the recommendations like using long sleeves,” Campo Maldonado said. The US can't take its historical victories against vector-borne disease for granted, Romero said. It takes active, sustained work to keep these illnesses out and prevent new ones from coming in. Old foes like yellow fever and malaria can still come roaring back. “When you're dealing with combating pathogens whose evolutionary clock works at a faster pace than humanity, we always will be dealing with an evolving landscape of threats,” Romero said. Though some of the old tactics that helped the US push vector-borne disease to the margins in the 20th century aren't viable now, there's a whole new suite of tools available that Brownsville is trying out: mosquito surveillance, less harmful and more targeted insecticides, disease risk forecasting models, and more.
