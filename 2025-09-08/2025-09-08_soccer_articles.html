                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the 2026 FIFA World Cup nears and the USMNT continues to stumble with preparation time running out fast, head coach Mauricio Pochettino has remained calm and confident. That does not, however, mean Pochettino's approach lacks fight. Ahead of the team's second September friendly against Japan on Tuesday, the 53-year-old went to war with critics who have increased in size and volume as the adverse results stack up. Fans and media have expressed frustration with the recent run of poor results, the latest a 2-0 friendly defeat to South Korea. Despite the limited preparation time ahead of next summer's massive tournament on home soil, the head man has left many of the national team's most prominent players off the roster in consecutive international windows, preferring to call up fringe players with little chance of making the World Cup squad. Buried within praise of the upcoming game's setting in Columbus, Pochettino hinted early in his press conference that he was aware of the recent noise about his approach. "We know how the fans are here [in Columbus], and because I listen and I hear a lot of things." That was a foreshadow of what would come over the next 20 minutes, as Pochettino would repeatedly field unrelated questions and spin his answer into repeated offensives on his warpath against the recent criticism. When asked for an update on the fitness of defender Chris Richards, who came off the bench against South Korea on the weekend, Pochettino began his assault. "People sometimes create debate and talk with no sense," Pochettino said. "This national team and this country has qualified already for the World Cup, so the important thing is to apply common sense. If people want to talk about bullsh*t, they can talk about bullsh*t, but we feel the responsibility to provide the whole group of players ... we need to give the priority for how he feels. "I think the same people that debate about why he's not playing [also debate] why he's playing. "If we only work with a few players, but the moment after they arrive some guy arrives with an injury and cannot play at the World Cup, it's not the moment to make tests or give the opportunity to get experience. That is why you cannot be surprised if tomorrow I do some changes. At this point, Pochettino had the attention of the room, but he was far from done making his point. After fielding a question about when decisions will be made regarding trimming the roster, he continued. But at the same time, we need to provide time to players who maybe have no experience. You saw in the Gold Cup how competitive the team is when we are together 40 days working together. We played with players maybe you didn't think one day could perform in the national team, but we are here because something needs to change. That is why less than one year ago they come and offered me in charge of the national team, because we are different." Of course I want to win all the games, but if we cannot win, we need to be positive in knowing that we are doing things very important for arriving to the World Cup in the best condition." Pochettino, nearly always a calm and collected figure, was clearly agitated by the recent criticism. While maintaining a calm overall demeanor at the stand, the USMNT boss had palpable frustration in his words. When asked about what progress he's seen from the team, he took it as a springboard to continue his rant. To illustrate his next point, he recalled the woeful disappointment in the CONCACAF Nations League finals earlier this year. But I think that was a wakeup call because we needed to start a different process and different approach. "That is why all that happened helped to realize that the most important thing is the national team, the federation, and this one —" Pochettino said as he pointed to the USA crest on his shirt, "is more important than any single name. We are all important, but that is the most important thing, and we need to work all for this. And I think why we are progressing, is because that is the mentality shown in the players. That is, for me, the most important thing. That competition will be very healthy for the organization. When asked about their preparation for the Japan match, Pochettino said they are trialing a number of different tactical approaches to see which works the best. "We have not too much time to work, and I think it's important to use these games like a training session. That is important for you to know, it's like a training session. We need to put into practice things that will be important for the future of the team." MORE: USMNT roster, squad for September friendly matches against South Korea, Japan In his introductory press conference, for example, the U.S. coach said that it was instilled in him during his playing days that there was no such thing as a friendly. "For me, it's not a friendly game. Veteran players have since repeated that mantra on multiple occasions, as Tim Ream did during January camp earlier this year ahead of a friendly against Costa Rica. "Listen, these games against CONCACAF opponents are always tough, they're always physical and are never straightforward and easy games," Ream said. Yet only months later, Pochettino had reversed course, talking about upcoming friendlies like they are little more than practice for the real thing on the horizon. The idea that it was acceptable to "compromise the result" to achieve a greater good was a complete 180 from his previous narrative, presenting a highly confusing and contradictory message. In fact, he was only just getting started, next taking aim at those who have criticized his and the federation's approach. "We are a very strong group now," Pochettino said. "People who talk need to think a little bit, there always can be another way to assess and analyze things, not only being negative. "Being critical is one thing, because I like the critiques when you say things that are right, you know? Pochettino would ultimately wrap up his point when asked about his experience in the 2002 World Cup as a player for Argentina. I know how we are moving in this work, if you win it's easy to say 'oh very good, very nice, good decision' how good we are. If you come from a long time and say ok, that process, enough that you are not getting results, ok maybe you can say it's wrong the plan or the process is not doing well. But when it's a very short space of time, with all the circumstances that happen, it's important to translate the idea that of course we want to win, it is the process that will sustain in 10 months to arrive with the possibility to win at the World Cup." That's all fine and dandy for now. Results which will take place in a very short space of time. The process will be judged on the results, not the other way around — will they have sufficient time to shift their mindset from process-oriented to results-oriented? Or will they arrive at the World Cup lacking the necessary knowledge of how to dig deep and just get a result? Until then, fans are resigned to accept his process as the way forward. Next summer's achievements will anoint or condemn that process, and Pochettino has put himself squarely behind that judgement.

In addition, he faces a tough challenge ahead, as Luis Suarez will not only receive the Leagues Cup sanction after his altercate with Sounders assistant Steven Lenhart, but the MLS has also taken strong action due to his behavior. According to Tom Bogert, MLS has suspended Luis Suarez for an additional three games following his altercation with Steven Lenhart. The Inter Miami star will miss matches against Charlotte FC, Seattle Sounders, and DC United, creating further challenges for his team in the Eastern Conference. Following a stringent sanction by the Leagues Cup, Luis Suarez could miss up to nine games with Inter Miami. Luis Suarez has consistently ranked among the most influential players in modern soccer. Yet, his legacy also carries the weight of numerous absences owing to sporting sanctions. Luis Suarez finally addresses spitting incident after Inter Miami's Leagues Cup loss to Sounders Remarkably, Suarez has missed 67 games due to suspensions, as reported by Transfermarkt. This statistic is noteworthy, surpassing the number of matches he has missed because of injuries, which have increasingly hindered him in recent years, totaling 62 games.

The international break will come to a close with another round of matches at the beginning of this week, offering, among other things, a chance for the U.S. men's national team to bounce back after yet another disappointing outing on Saturday. The U.S. men's national team marked their return to play with a 2-0 loss to South Korea on Saturday, with Mauricio Pochettino notching his seventh defeat in 17 matches since taking the job roughly a year ago. As has frequently been the case, Pochettino went with a lineup that featured a mix of established players and fresh faces in the hopes of learning something new about the player pool, but Saturday's loss was the latest in a familiar stretch of unexciting results. The USMNT were doomed by defensive disorganization on both goals, thanks in part to a rough outing for center back Tristan Blackmon on his debut and right back Sergino Dest in his first international game since sustaining an ACL injury last year. The game also offered a stark reminder that some of the issues predate Pochettino, who has just one win in seven games against opponents ranked in FIFA's top 30. His predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, had only five wins against top 20 opponents, and four of them came against Mexico, while the USMNT have been outscored 11-2 in their last seven matches against top 25 teams. It raises questions about whether or not the team have gotten better under Pochettino and has landed them in 26th place in James Benge's latest World Cup power rankings, one spot below fellow World Cup co-hosts Canada. Pochettino's experimental version of the USMNT will get one final run out on Tuesday in Columbus against Japan, the head coach deeming next month's matches as his deadline to select a core group of players – even if that means going down to the wire. Mauricio Pochettino may have given a handful of fringe USMNT players a chance to impress on Saturday, but like several before them, few really made a case for themselves against South Korea. Tuesday's friendly against Japan marks one final opportunity to pull off that feat, even if it means long-lasting lineup questions – some of which existed well before Pochettino showed up – are up in the air for another few weeks. Pochettino opted for a back three midway through the second half, bringing on Chris Richards to join starters Tim Ream and Blackmon, a tactic that the head coach teased could come back in the future. Who starts in those defensive positions, though, is another question entirely. The USMNT's backline always looks its best when Richards is on the field, the Crystal Palace defender missing out on a starting role with a small issue he had before arriving to camp. The lineup, in all honesty, might be full of question marks – Dest is skilled with the ball at his feet and in attack but has defensive lapses, while no one has convincingly stepped in while fellow wingback Antonee Robinson is out of the group. Josh Sargent had another go at the role on Saturday after starting the Championship season with five goals in four games. Once again, it did not go according to plan – Sargent took zero shots and had just 17 touches in 62 minutes, still yet to break an international goalless drought that stretches back to November 2019. Balogun came on in Sargent's place for his first game under Pochettino after an injury-plagued year and was much more present – he had four shots and 22 touches in 28 minutes, the shot tally on that day equal to Sargent's shot count in his last six games for the national team. Balogun may have quickly reasserted himself as the USMNT's first choice in that role, and a strong outing on Tuesday may finally bring an end to a years-long search for the team's starting striker. : It's been nearly a year since Pochettino took the USMNT job, and things have flatlined.

Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane sent Tunisia to the World Cup with a goal in the fourth minute of injury time that secured a 1-0 win over Equatorial Guinea on Monday in qualifying.

Romdhane was teed up by fellow substitute Firas Chaouat to slot home the late winner and spark wild celebrations for the visitors on the track behind the goal.

Tunisia needed a win to secure a spot at next year's tournament in North America with two games to spare. It tops Group H with 22 points from eight games, 10 points ahead of second-place Namibia, which has a game in hand. Tunisia has yet to concede a goal in qualifying.

It is the seventh time that Tunisia has qualified for the World Cup, and third in a row. It went out in the group stage in 2018 and 2022.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clubs Praise New UCC Competition Formats; Debrief on FIFA Club World Cup The Board was provided with a review of the new men's UEFA Club Competitions (UCCs) formats introduced in 2024/25, which have met with an overwhelmingly positive response from clubs. ECA Member Clubs have provided a range of specific feedback, including many highlighting that the introductions of the League Phase, a single league table and simultaneous final matchdays collectively added more competitiveness, unpredictability and excitement. In 2024/25, a record €448m (over 10% of UCC revenue) was distributed in solidarity, including €308m to non-participating clubs and €140m to clubs who only played qualifiers. This included a mandate to finalise with FIFA the mechanism for distributing the significant FIFA Club World Cup solidarity funding to non-participating clubs. Upcoming New Competitions and Media Partnerships Drive Women's European Football ECA has worked closely with UEFA to help deliver a hugely significant step forward for women's European club football. Starting this season, the UEFA Women's Champions League (UWCL) has been reshaped with an 18-team league phase, driving competition at the highest level and providing access to more clubs. Furthermore, ECA supported UEFA in the development of the new UEFA Women's Europa Cup, delivering European club football to more clubs and providing a second pathway for clubs exiting UWCL qualifying. These reforms were developed in close consultation with clubs to strengthen competition, visibility and sustainability. Disney+ will stream every UWCL match across Europe from 2025/26 to 2029/30, complemented by extensive free-to-air coverage via the European Broadcasting Union's network of major European broadcasters. These agreements will ensure clubs are given excellent visibility across Europe and beyond. Clubs and National Teams Working Together to Support Players Enhancing Away Fan Experience; Supporting Ongoing Development of Supporter Liaison Officers This Working Group will focus on the sharing of knowledge and best practice between clubs, especially in the area of away fan attendance, and on identifying opportunities to further support the development and professionalisation of club Supporter Liaison Officers. ECA Member Benefits Providing Opportunities for All Clubs and Stakeholders The Board was provided with an update on the new ECA Executive Leadership Programme in partnership with Harvard Business School Executive Education. Each intake will benefit from a seven-month course including online learning and in-person gatherings at Harvard University in Massachusetts, USA, and at PSG Campus in Paris, France. The event will bring together senior leaders from many hundreds of ECA members, strategic partners and global football stakeholders to share ideas, discuss current challenges and explore opportunities to drive the game forward.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DEBRECEN, Hungary — The coach of Israel's national soccer team says he is “standing behind my country” amid calls for the team to be suspended from international competition because of the war in Gaza, adding that “we are in a very complicated situation.” Israel “hosts” Italy in neutral Hungary in a World Cup qualifier today, and the Italian Soccer Coaches' Association said last month that it had written a formal letter calling for Israel to be suspended. “We have a super morale and amazing country,” Israel coach Ran Ben-Shimon says. Ben-Shimon adds that he wasn't paying attention to the criticism “in front of me,” because “I'm looking who is standing behind me, and this is our people. Israel's players were to wear black armbands for the game, UEFA confirms, after Palestinian attackers opened fire at a bus stop in Jerusalem this morning.

Argentina national team coach Lionel Scaloni commented on if he thinks Lionel Messi will play at the World Cup

Lionel Scaloni spoke at a press conference on Monday about young players against Ecuador and he also confirmed that Nicolás Otamendi will captain Argentina against Ecuador on Tuesday. In the same press conference, Scaloni spoke about Lionel Messi and if he will play at the World Cup with Argentina.

Messi had commented on if he will play at the World Cup following Argentina's 3-0 win against Venezuela. When asked about Messi's comments, here is what Scaloni had to say:

“Will Messi play in the World Cup? I haven't spoken to him about it, I only know what he has said publicly, and I know that he is going to take his time to decide.

“We have to leave him alone, and whatever he decides will be fine.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Suddenly, Zambia looks dangerous and is looking to get back into the game. A brilliant move down the left and Hamza Igmane finishes well under pressure from the opposition to score. The lead grows and there is still plenty of time left. Here, we will find out who wins this World Cup  qualifying match. The goalkeeper jumps to deflect it backward, but the assistant referee decides that it has gone out of bounds anyway. Zambia are still unable to score 0-1 wins Morocco. Who will come out on top in this World Cup qualifying match? Morocco has scored a total of 8 goals in its last 2 games. Zambia has gone 7 games without a win. As for Zambia, uncertainty is growing due to their recent results, which have been truly lackluster: in fact, the team has lost six of its last seven games, showing enormous defensive problems. The team's form is also impressive: Morocco has won seven of its last eight games. In the African Cup of Nations, Morocco even lifted the trophy after beating Madagascar in the final, and did so without several of its main stars who play in Europe. Theoretically, it still has a chance to fight for second place, but the remaining schedule is very demanding: first Morocco, then Tanzania, and finally Niger. If you want to follow the game online, VAVEL is your best option. Although it was designed primarily for soccer, it is also used for other sporting and cultural events, including concerts and large gatherings. The Zambian national team often plays there, and it also serves as an occasional venue for local clubs. The stadium was built with financial and technical support from China, marking a significant step in the modernization of Zambia's sports infrastructure. Today, the stadium not only plays an essential role in sports, but is also a symbol of the country's growth and international aspirations. My name is Esteban Monsalve, and I will be your host for this match. We will bring you pre-match analysis, score updates, and live news here on VAVEL.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Read between the lines of countless articles on Alyssa Thompson's move from Angel City FC to Chelsea and you will get a clear sense that Angel City FC really didn't want to let her go. And as Chelsea closed in on the U.S. women's national team forward, it was clear neither did the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). The best-backed clubs, such as Chelsea with its six consecutive Women's Super League (WSL) titles, can stockpile players, while the rest of the landscape aspires to develop a talent who can tug at these giants' heartstrings and pursestrings alike. But while world-class players of all nationalities still make moves to the NWSL, the ongoing trend of WSL teams plucking the top U.S. players from their domestic league is an understandable concern. And while that wanderlust is inevitable in some cases, the league likely won't want to see it become a habit. With marquee players such as Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson nearing the end of their contracts with NWSL clubs, and a salary cap in place, it's a growing predicament—one of the NWSL's own design. They were seen as a necessary makeweight for wealthy owners to maintain leverage with their star employees. The salary cap, in all of its forms, has been part of the American sports landscape for over four decades. Some leagues have strict caps; others opt for luxury taxes on high spenders. It has allowed MLS to foster a rare level of annual parity, giving 30 fanbases reason to hope they could challenge for a title in any three-year window. It has also kept MLS from reaching the absolute pinnacle of the men's game, as teams simply can't spend to match the talent of rival circuits in Europe, South America and Mexico. When the NWSL launched in 2012, with U.S. Soccer playing a major role in its construction, a cap was included from launch. Their spending on sports can only get so high, and there was a mechanism to use as a shield against criticism of finance-guided decisions. The latest NWSL collective bargaining agreement, which runs through 2030, determined that teams must compile squads of 22 to 26 players within the salary cap. So while it's possible that a club could pay 25 players identical $132,000 salaries for a balanced squad, it does not work out that way. This was a key factor when Naomi Girma made the move from San Diego Wave to Chelsea earlier this year, a realization that her departure (partly) came down to the realities of her being a defender. Soccer teams often invest more in attackers — who generally command higher transfer fees and salaries because goals are how you win games and their jerseys are in demand — than defenders. In that sense, Thompson is exactly who a team like Angel City FC should be built around: a 20-year-old USWNT star leading her local team's attack in between international windows. But no player is immune to cap considerations. When NWSL teams can no longer guarantee the best salaries in the landscape, players will have to consider additional factors to a greater degree. While many other factors led to Thompson's departure, cap space is a factor all NWSL teams have to consider when negotiating. Would Angel City rather commit more of its budget to Thompson's wages or use that money on her replacement and two other starting-level players? “There's a salary cap in NWSL and I think that's an ongoing issue there that hopefully can be changed or increased,” USWNT captain Lindsey Heaps said in April, herself having spent six seasons with the Portland Thorns in between stints with Paris Saint-Germain and OL Lyonnes. “It's a factor in the NWSL and for players coming overseas. I wanted to play for a big club like (Lyonnnes). A greater number of NWSL clubs are spending more ambitiously on players and facilities, and may be ready to lift the cap restrictions, too. Michelle Kang, who owns a multi-club organization that includes Washington Spirit, OL Lyonnes, and the London City Lionesses, said owners were discussing the concern well before Girma and Thompson went to Kingsmeadow. “Free agency doesn't mean much to us if the salary cap doesn't go up because we're gonna lose our players to Europe, right?” Kang said in March 2023. “We as a group, 12 owners, soon to be 14 owners, we have all those issues on the table and working very hard.” The salary cap was raised the following year, with escalators to continue to increase it, but it remains in place. The combining factors have left NWSL with an identity crisis. The fan perspective of the selling club is driven home in a two-comment exchange below The Athletic's initial newsbreak of Chelsea's pursuit: “So ACFC is a feeder club? Brighton for the women's game?” and “It looks like ACFC is now the Triple A team for Chelsea. Factors beyond Girma's own career made it reasonable to leave a club that was undergoing a wholesale transformation — working out from the aftermath of the fraught Jill Ellis era, dealing with Alex Morgan's retirement, and navigating a coaching search. Despite launching together in 2022, Angel City has never hit the same sporting heights as San Diego. While the Wave has an NWSL Shield and an NWSL Challenge Cup, Angel City's landmark achievement is arguably being the NWSL team with the highest valuation — $280 million, as of May. Now, just three years into her time with the club, she's gone. Unless or until there's more financial freedom, these pain points will recur with increasing frequency. While WSL's lack of a salary cap might not be the answer to keeping players and maintaining the league's competitive nature, as only a few teams in England are currently spending big, one possible solution for a NWSL willingly beholden to American sports customs is to take another page from MLS's book. The designated player allows teams to spend as much as they would like — in transfer fees and wages — on up to three star players, who each hit the cap at a fixed rate ($743,750 in 2025, or 12.5 percent of the cap). Teams could then determine how much it's worth keeping their USWNT stars, for sporting and marketing reasons alike, knowing there's a limit on their salary cap hit. It is a concept that will not be enacted before this winter, but would have definitely come in handy. An even sterner test of the NWSL's pull awaits this offseason, with Rodman and Wilson (pending her 2026 player option) set to hit free agency this winter. Will they, or an NWSL rival, be able to make an offer that could withstand any options among the UEFA Women's Champions League class? After all, they're the ones who make and break fans' interest in any team. Jeff Rueter  is a senior soccer writer for The Athletic who covers the game in North America, Europe, and beyond. No matter how often he hears the Number 10 role is "dying," he'll always leave a light on for the next great playmaker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil's 1970 triumph, summed up by their captain's brilliant strike in the final, was the game's Woodstock, a glorious moment offering an implausible future Tostão picks up the loose ball and nudges it back to Wilson Piazza just outside his own box. The ball is moved in a slow triangle through Clodoaldo to Pelé and Gérson and back to Clodoaldo. His touch is slightly heavy, enticing an Italian challenge. Clodoaldo skips round him and then two other tackles. Jairzinho runs at Giacinto Facchetti and, as he turns inside, Pierluigi Cera advances to close him down. Jairzinho pokes the ball on to Pelé, perhaps 27 or 28 yards out. Tarcisio Burgnich stands between him and the box, but Pelé pauses, turns casually to his right and lays a pass into the path of Carlos Alberto, surging forward from full-back. With four minutes of the 1970 World Cup final remaining, Brazil lead 4–1. For many, it's the greatest goal scored by perhaps the greatest team in the greatest World Cup, a glorious synthesis of team play and individual technical excellence. Yes, it came right at the end of the final and Italy were exhausted by then, accepting their defeat, but it was a goal that encapsulated the joy and virtuosity of that side, that left the world with a shorthand for what the Brazil of 1970 meant. And if by the time it was scored it was almost a goal without an opposition, an exhibition, that felt appropriate too, for Brazil by then had come to feel as though they were about more than games or results, more even than winning the World Cup: they were about an expression of football in its most beautiful form, about pushing the boundaries of human capability. For those who had colour television, who witnessed those vibrant yellow shirts and the shorts of cobalt blue playing with a dash and a verve in iridescent heat on the sun-bleached grass of Mexico, the impact is hard to overstate. And Brazil, after all, had undergone a Nasa-approved training course before the World Cup. Just as the moon landing could be regarded as a triumph of human ingenuity, so Brazil's artistry seemed to transcend the tournament, the petty squabble of nation against nation. It's not to present Stanley Rous's tenure as Fifa president as anything other than flawed to suggest that, when a former schoolteacher was replaced by the son of an arms dealer, a certain financial innocence was lost. The 1970 World Cup looks different to every subsequent World Cup because not every surface is covered in advertising. The contrast to the physicality of the two previous World Cups and England's cautious, mechanistic win in 1966 was obvious and for many those two facets became fused: this tournament was modernity and it had been won by Brazilian artistry, therefore such artistry was modern. It had been made possible by the heat and altitude of Mexico that, with the fitness of players as it then was, effectively made pressing impossible. By 1974 in West Germany, pressing was back. Brazil's World Cup victory in 1970 still has a mythic quality, their performance still used as a shorthand for the best that football can be: it's what gave Pelé's “beautiful game” cliche currency. The popular conception of Woodstock – great crowds high on the prospect of peace and love, listening to Jimi Hendrix, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Joan Baez – stems largely from the over-idealised Michael Wadleigh documentary, released three months before the 1970 World Cup. The reality was chaos: several acts performed hours late; a fence was broken down by anarchists leading to potentially dangerous overcrowding; two people were killed, one of them run over by a tractor; and a worn electric cable combined with persistent rain raised the possibility of mass electrocution. The 1970 World Cup, similarly, once you peer beyond the brilliance of Brazil's football, becomes a much more sinister event. Mexico's governing PRI was repressive and capable of extreme violence. And in Brazil, along with short-term economic growth, victory in Mexico, and its associated modernity, was presented as part of President Emílio Garrastazu Médici's “Brazilian miracle”. The result is that the 1970 World Cup stands amid the darkness as a fragile vision of perfection and possibility, of what football can be, what it could have been. But where that pass was followed by the explosive fulfilment of Carlos Alberto's shot, football itself went awry. That World Cup is the scene in Easy Rider, another cultural touchstone of 1969, in which Wyatt (Peter Fonda) tells Billy (Dennis Hopper): “We blew it.” Like Wyatt and Billy, Fifa took the money and, while much was gained, much also was lost.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA President Gianni Infantino attends an event in Los Angeles on May 17, 2023, to mark the upcoming World Cup, which will held next year across the United States, Mexico and Canada. Most prominently, FIFA is set to unveil a controversial pricing system: They say it's not the same as dynamic pricing — but prices will adjust based on demand. Here's what to know about ticket sales for the World Cup. And they must first register their interest with FIFA. And people won't be able to actually buy tickets then. According to information provided by FIFA, those who apply will be drawn into a lottery. If successful, they will be provided with a specific date and time slot to buy tickets starting on Oct. 1. Venue-specific ticket packages, meaning tickets to a handful of games in a specific host city like Boston or Mexico City, will also be available. In addition, spectators can buy tickets that are specific to a national team, but only for the three group games that each team will play. Other opportunities to buy tickets will follow, including in late October, after the group draw, and next year. FIFA will also operate a resale platform for ticket holders who no longer want to attend a match, as it has in previous tournaments. But what they are not touting so loudly is that the organization will also implement pricing that will fluctuate based on demand, a first for the World Cup. Aerial view of Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico, which will host the opening game of the 2026 World Cup on June 11. A FIFA official further told NPR that pricing won't be set by "automated algorithms," but will be guided by a team of people who will be regularly "monitoring and making adjustments in real time" to ticket prices based on supply and demand — which suggests that FIFA officials can ultimately determine how high they are willing to let prices go. FIFA has justified its decision by saying it's simply adapting to the U.S. and Canadian markets, where professional teams regularly use the controversial sales practice of adjusting tickets based on demand, just as airlines or hotels do. Prices adjusted to demand could also be implemented on FIFA's planned resale platform in the U.S. and Canada, though FIFA has not given exact details. However, in Mexico, the resale platform will operate as an exchange platform, meaning buyers can receive up to the amount they spent buying a ticket from FIFA — and no more. Of course, adjusting pricing based on demand doesn't necessarily mean prices will rise higher. At the FIFA Club World Cup — a tournament held in the U.S. this year — pricing actually dropped for a number of games because demand was lower than anticipated. FIFA has previously said it is expecting over 5 million people to attend next year's edition. Brazilian players celebrate their victory over Italy in a penalty shootout at the 1994 World Cup final in Pasadena, Calif., on July 17, 1994, as then Vice President Al Gore looks on. The 2026 World Cup will also be held in three countries and staged in venues such as MetLife Stadium, which has a capacity of over 80,000. Nonetheless, demand will likely be higher than supply, and getting tickets may prove difficult. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA said it received over 23 million requests for about 3.4 million available tickets, meaning buyers who wanted to score tickets had a success rate of only about 15%. For those who do not want the uncertainty of trying to buy regular seats during a sales window, there is another way to attend — but it will cost you. Hospitality tickets have already been on sale since earlier this year, including for individual games and packages that at one point reached $73,200. Prices have also fluctuated through the year based on demand. Right now, the cheapest hospitality ticket for a single game is listed at $1,350. FIFA has also introduced a new ticket sales method called "right to buys," or RTBs. These offer buyers a guaranteed opportunity to buy tickets for specific games, including the final. Prices range from the hundreds of dollars for guaranteed opportunities to buy playoff games down to cheaper "surprise packs" that may or may not contain an RTB. That doesn't even factor in the actual price of the ticket, which buyers will need to pay when FIFA makes them available. FIFA even runs a marketplace where RTB owners can buy and sell these opportunities. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates FIFA could rake in a record $4.4 billion, not only from general sales tickets but also by leaning heavily on hospitality seats. Such a haul would also mark a 378% surge from the last men's tournament in Qatar, according to equity research analyst Kevin Near, reflecting in part the expanded tournament with 104 matches and 48 national teams. "These stadiums are massive, they have huge occupancy," Near says. FIFA, however, is particularly sensitive to criticism that it's just seeking profits, saying the vast majority of the money it raises from its tournaments is intended to be distributed across its 211 member associations to help support the growth of soccer worldwide. "As part of that mission, which we take very seriously, we're looking at optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadia, so it's always a balance between different factors," Schirgi from FIFA World Cup 26 said in an emailed statement. Of course, achieving that balance doesn't necessarily mean ticket prices will be low. So when that first ticket sales window opens on Wednesday, one thing's for sure: Buying a World Cup ticket may turn into quite a game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump was notably absent from the celebrations at the US Open after he had gatecrashed Chelsea's FIFA Club World Cup trophy ceremony back in July. Fast-forward approximately two months, and Trump was nowhere to be seen on the court at the US Open following Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz's triumph over Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 for his sixth Grand Slam title. Trump observed the match from the Rolex Suite and stayed put as spectators erupted in praise for the Spaniard, yet the president refrained from applauding Alcaraz, appearing notably glum while others around him displayed contrasting emotions. Trump's behavior was so peculiar that body language specialist Judi James highlighted how misplaced the president's attitude appeared compared to surrounding attendees. "Trump's reaction to a very excited and celebratory Alcaraz seems out of step with the rest of the crowd," she revealed. "As everyone is clapping and cheering Trump appears to hike his pants from the belt and perform a wry, closed lip, ironic-looking smile and pull at his jacket rather than clap." Throughout the match, it seemed as though Trump might have nodded off, appearing largely uninterested in the tennis action unfolding before him. Trump could only manage a smirk and salute toward the flag as spectators continued voicing their disapproval. Prior to the contest, Alcaraz shared his thoughts on having the president watching from a VIP box. "For me, playing in front of him... to be honest, I will try not to think about it," he confessed. "I don't want myself to be nervous because of it. Even after his remarkable victory, Alcaraz confessed he felt "scared" going up against Sinner, explaining that he used smiles as a strategy to stay calm while pursuing another championship. "I was scared," he told ESPN afterward. But smiling is something that helps me a lot to pull out all the nerves. Thanks to that, it seems like I'm having fun. I face them like, OK, it's going to happen. Thanks to that, I just saw my best tennis in those moments. Obviously, it's the final of a Grand Slam.

Some close marking on USMNT's Josh Sargent. If you are wondering why U.S. Soccer tries to avoid playing tournament matches in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, here are some sorry stats to chew on. The U.S. men's national tea, which has an overall record of 9-12-9 in the region, is 1-7-3 in its last 11 matches there, including Saturday's 2-0 loss to the Korea Republic at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J.. That includes a devastating 2-0 defeat to Costa Rica in a vital World Cup qualifier on Sept. 1 that helped seal the Americans' fate of missing the 2018 tournament in Russia. As they say in the commercial, there's more. The U.S. has been blanked in eight of those contests, scoring only three times. Front Row Soccer editor Michael Lewis has covered 13 World Cups (eight men, five women), seven Olympics and 28 MLS Cups. He has written about New York City FC, New York Cosmos, the New York Red Bulls and both U.S. national teams and has penned a soccer history column for the Guardian.com. Lewis, who has been honored by the Press Club of Long Island and National Soccer Coaches Association of America, is the former editor of BigAppleSoccer.com. He has written seven books about the beautiful game and has published ALIVE AND KICKING The incredible but true story of the Rochester Lancers.</p>
