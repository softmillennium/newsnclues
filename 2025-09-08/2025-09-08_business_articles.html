                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are two big winners for the $1.787 billion Powerball jackpot — and one could face a bigger tax bill. Winning tickets sold in Missouri and Texas matched all six numbers from Saturday night's drawing, and those individuals will split the second-largest lottery jackpot, according to Powerball. Each ticket holder can pick between two pretax options: a lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million. "Virtually everybody who wins the lottery picks the lump sum distribution," Andrew Stoltmann, a Chicago-based lawyer who has represented several lottery winners, previously told CNBC. In some cases, the annuity is a better option because "the typical lottery winner doesn't have the infrastructure in place to manage such a large sum so quickly," he said. But either way, the winners will face a hefty tax bill. Both Powerball jackpot winners will face an automatic federal tax withholding. For prizes over $5,000, the IRS requires a mandatory 24% withholding. The next Powerball jackpot winner will easily land in the 37% federal income tax bracket, regardless of whether they choose the lump sum or yearly payments.For 2025, the 37% rate applies to individuals with taxable income exceeding $626,350 and married couples filing jointly with taxable income of $751,600 or more for 2025. You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income. But the 37% rate doesn't apply to all of your taxable income. For 2025, single filers pay $188,769.75 plus 37% of the amount over $626,350. Meanwhile, joint filers pay $202,154.50 plus 37% of the amount over $751,600. The jackpot winners' remaining tax bill after the 24% federal withholding depends on several factors, but could easily represent millions more. President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" raised the standard deduction, among other breaks, which could reduce taxable income for many filers in 2025. In addition to the 24% federal withholding, the Missouri Lottery is required to withhold 4% for state income taxes for prizes over $600. But the bill could be higher since Missouri's top income tax rate is 4.7% for 2025. Meanwhile, Texas does not tax lottery winnings, which means that ticket holder could pay millions less. Powerball isn't the only chance to win big. The jackpot for Tuesday night's Mega Millions drawing now stands at an estimated $358 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the latest sign of trouble for the U.S. labor market, confidence in the ability to move from one job to another has hit a record low, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Monday. Respondents to the central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for August indicated a 44.9% probability of finding another job after losing their current one. The result further demonstrates the reversal of the "Great Resignation" that occurred in 2021-22, when at one point 4.5 million workers a month were quitting their jobs and feeling good about finding new ones. That number stood at 3.2 million in July, well off the pace of a few years ago and down more than 5% from the same period in 2024, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures. "Consumers are feeling down about job-finding opportunities, and those feelings are wholly appropriate," said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at consumer site NerdWallet. "It's very difficult to find work right now. And unlikely to get better any time soon. Employers aren't hiring much, so workers are stuck job-hugging, clinging to their current jobs because the market isn't favorable to job seekers." Various factors that had come into play during the Covid pandemic helped influence the high level of mobility, including a supply-demand mismatch in the labor market that saw more than two open jobs for each available worker. While there are not too many signs that employers are laying off workers en masse, hiring has slowed dramatically. That has caused workers to stay put in their jobs as uncertainty over inflation and economic growth has caused employers to be cautious about growing payrolls. There are now more workers available than job openings, something that hasn't been the case since well before Covid. At the same time, expectations that the unemployment rate will be higher a year from now rose to 39.1%, up 1.7 percentage points from July and a point above the 12-month average. The results follow a dismal August nonfarm payrolls count. Moreover, the June count was revised lower to a loss of 13,000, the first monthly decline since December 2020. Markets widely expect the Fed to respond to the labor market weakness with its first interest rate cut since December 2024 when it next decides on rates on Sept. 17.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>StubHub is aiming to raise as much as $851 million in its initial public offering, giving it a valuation of up to $9.2 billion, the company revealed in a new filing on Monday. The ticket reselling marketplace plans to sell more than 34 million shares priced between $22 and $25 per share, according to the filing. The long-awaited IPO comes after StubHub hit pause on the process in April as the stock market was reeling from President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. The company also eyed an IPO last year, but it postponed its efforts in July 2024 amid a slowdown in the IPO market. The IPO market has bounced back in recent months, with recent debuts from Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, design software company Figma and crypto firm Circle. Klarna, a Swedish provider of buy now, pay later loans, and Gemini, the crypto firm founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, are gearing up for public debuts this week. StubHub filed an updated IPO prospectus last month, showing that first-quarter revenue grew 10% from a year earlier to $397.6 million. Operating income came in at $26.8 million for the period. The company has been a longtime player in the ticketing industry since its launch in 2000. It was purchased by eBay for $310 million in 2007, but was reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 for $4 billion through his new company Viagogo. StubHub had sought a $16.5 billion valuation before it began the IPO process, CNBC previously reported. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court on Monday rejected President Donald Trump's bid to overturn a jury verdict ordering him to pay $83.3 million for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The ruling from a trio of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld that verdict, which Trump argued was both excessive and invalid following a Supreme Court decision that expanded his presidential immunity. The panel held that Trump "has failed to identify any grounds that would warrant reconsidering our prior holding on presidential immunity." The judges also ruled that a lower federal court "did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury's damages awards are fair and reasonable." The decision came less than a week after Trump's lawyers signaled they will soon ask the Supreme Court to overturn a jury verdict in a second civil case Carroll had filed against the president, for which she has been awarded $5 million. The jury in Carroll's second case, known as Carroll II, found after a spring 2023 trial that Trump sexually abused the writer in 1996 and defamed her more than two decades later. In his appeal of the first case, known as Carroll I — which was filed first but went to trial second — Trump had argued that a lower court was wrong to bar his lawyers from relitigating whether his statements about Carroll were true or false. While Carroll I centered on claims Trump made in 2019 and Carroll II focused on claims he made in 2022, "the statements were identical in material respects because both accused Carroll of fabricating the sexual assault allegations for improper purposes," they wrote. They also rejected Trump's argument that a Supreme Court decision in July 2024 — which granted former presidents presumptive immunity for "official acts" and other protections — cast doubt on the Second Circuit's prior dismissal of his immunity claims. Trump "submits that [the Supreme Court case, Trump v. United States,] represents a sufficient intervening change of law and that enforcing our prior decision on immunity would work a manifest injustice in light of that change." "We are not persuaded," the judges wrote. Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, celebrated the ruling, telling CNBC in a statement, "We look forward to an end to the appellate process so that justice will finally be done." The White House referred CNBC to Trump's personal lawyers in the case, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The panel who delivered Monday's ruling comprised two judges appointed by former President Joe Biden and one judge picked by former President Barack Obama.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Most people have a 100-year-old technology, a metal box with some plastic switches in their homes," Greg Connolly, the cofounder and CEO of Kora, told Business Insider. Renewable energy is intermittent, which means its supply may not always match demand. That can lead to wasted energy or a forced reduction of power generation, usually from sources like wind and solar. "We could significantly power more of the grid with renewables, if we just had somewhere to put that power, instead of just turning off all of these solar rays and wind farms when we have nowhere to store it," Connolly said. Kora says its platform allows customers to decide which rooms and appliances stay on during a power outage, and use its app to sell excess energy at wholesale market rates. Connolly, who previously cofounded the meal delivery service Trifecta, said Kora aims for customers to save enough money by reducing their bills and selling surplus energy to make their investment back in "three to five years." Kora plans to start shipping its systems in January 2026. The startup bills itself as a Tesla competitor because it offers a fully integrated stack that goes beyond Tesla's Powerwall, a home battery system that stores energy generated by solar or from the grid. Kora claims to have a higher photovoltaic intake and additional services, such as its energy trading platform. Cleantech stocks — and, collaterally, climate startups — have had a difficult year as Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" slashed federal tax credits for many green energy projects. Connolly said it's been a tough funding environment, but certain upcoming regulatory changes, such as the FERC Order 2222, would be a boon for customers, as they would be able to participate more freely in the wholesale energy market. Additionally, Connolly has invested $300,000 of his own money in the startup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter Women's 3-on-3 basketball league Unrivaled is now valued at $340 million after a new funding round that included tennis legend Serena Williams, the league announced Monday. Williams' Serena Ventures was part of a Series B funding round that was led by Bessemer Venture Partners and also included Warner Bros. Unrivaled's latest cash infusion means a dramatic rise in its valuation from just one year ago when the league was valued at $95 million, according to a person familiar with the league who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters. "To add arguably the most iconic female athlete to play sports, I think it exemplifies who Unrivaled is not just with our players on the court, but the number of investors on our cap table who had been icons in their own lanes," said Alex Bazzell, co-founder and president of Unrivaled. Other Unrivaled investors include high-profile names such as tennis legend Billie Jean King, NBA superstar Stephen Curry, tennis champion Coco Gauff and Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps. Bessemer has previously invested in ticketing resale site StubHub, as well as streaming services BallerTV and Twitch. The venture firm sees Unrivaled as a blueprint for the next generation of sports leagues, according to Caty Rea, a vice president at Bessemer. "We always look for category-defining businesses with generational tail winds and really audacious founders who kind of have that product hard to fit," Rea said. Unrivaled was founded in 2023 and offers women's professional basketball players a league that runs in the offseason of the WNBA. Previously, many players went abroad in the offseason for extra compensation. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. The league says it offers women the highest average salary in professional women's sports history and provides equity to players. For comparison, the WNBA does not offer its players equity, and players are currently negotiating their collective bargaining agreement, which expires Oct. 31. One of the key issues being debated is an increase in player compensation. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told CNBC in July that the average WNBA team valuation has increased to about $260 million. Bazzell said the new funding will be used to add more resources to the league's facilities, for developmental efforts and to create additional awareness of the league as it heads into its second season. So now we have to grow that footprint," he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UK branch of the Big Four accountancy firm PwC confirmed to Business Insider that it had lowered entry-level recruitment this year. PwC will take on 1,300 entrants to its graduate and school leaver programmes, compared with 1,500 last year, the firm said. "PwC will always be a large employer and training ground for young people in the UK," but the impact of AI and a sluggish economy are changing the firm's hiring practices, Amitrano wrote. For now, the development of new tools and investment in skills was offsetting more serious disruption to jobs, but that balance was likely to change in the future, he said. The PwC chief said consistent policy, regulatory reform, and a more predictable tax environment would help create jobs. He was also optimistic about AI's potential, saying the technology could create new industries if there was "sustained and serious investment in tech, infrastructure, and training." "Most technologies, if not all, have boosted both productivity and wages," Amitrano said. Entry-level hiring is also set to slow at the firm's US branch. In August, BI obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years. A bullet point on the presentation slide said leadership's decision to slow down associate-level hiring related to "transformation efforts, the impact of AI, and further AC integration" — with AC integration referring to PwC's acceleration centers, or offshoring hubs. In his Sunday op-ed, Amitrano addressed offshoring, saying the global labour market was "more competitive and accessible than ever before." Deloitte UK has also lowered its intake for graduate and apprentice hires in recent years. Last week, the firm announced it was taking on 1,400 entrants to its graduate programme, BrightStart apprenticeship, and industrial placement programme — 300 fewer than it accepted for the same programmes in 2023. Deloitte didn't respond to a request for comment from BI about why it has reduced the numbers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geoffrey Hinton helped invent the technology behind ChatGPT. "It's going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. "That's not AI's fault," he said, instead blaming the "capitalist system." Universal basic income "won't deal with human dignity," he said, adding that people get their worth from their jobs. Not all tech leaders share Hinton's bleak view on the future. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has long pitched a universal basic income as a cushion against job losses, even funding one of the largest UBI trials in the US. Elon Musk has echoed those calls, telling an audience at VivaTech last year that in a benign AI future, "probably none of us will have a job" — but universal income could let humans pursue meaning while machines handle work. That, he argues, will slash the value of human labor and make UBI "crucial" to prevent a surge in inequality. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, meanwhile, has called UBI just "a small part" of the solution, warning that society will need to invent entirely new systems to manage the shift. While he's previously advised the UK government to explore UBI, he now says cash payments won't replace the sense of dignity people derive from their work. Having lost two wives to cancer, he still hopes AI delivers breakthroughs in healthcare and education. But beyond that, he believes the technology is more likely to erode livelihoods than uplift them. "We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening," he said, "and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"~80% of Tesla's value will be Optimus," Musk wrote on X this month. Although Musk is involved in several business ventures — including aerospace manufacturing and AI development — creating an autonomous humanoid robot has long been a priority. If Musk's predictions hold true, Optimus will help ensure that he meets the various thresholds on his $1 trillion pay package proposed by Tesla's board this month. Here's everything you need to know about Optimus. Although Tesla became a household name as an automaker, the company announced during an AI event in 2021 that it would expand into humanoid robots. Musk said what was then called the Tesla Bot would be 5'8" and weigh 125 pounds. "Essentially, in the future, physical work will be a choice," Musk said. However, audience members didn't see an official prototype that day. By January 2022, Musk had developed lofty ambitions for Tesla's humanoid robot, which became known as Optimus. "In terms of priority of products, I think the most important product development we're doing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid," he said during Tesla's Q4 earnings call. Musk unveiled an official Optimus prototype eight months later during Tesla AI Day. In a December promotional video, the company said a 30% walk speed boost and improved full-body control were among the updates for Optimus Gen 2. Footage also showed the robot doing squats and picking up an egg. "Everything in this video is real, no CGI," Tesla senior manager Julian Ibarz wrote on X. Optimus is your personal R2D2 / C3PO, but betterIt will also transform physical labor in industrial settings pic.twitter.com/iCET3a9pd8 During the event, robots served drinks, answered questions, and played rock-paper-scissors. Videos of guests interacting with the robots gained traction on social media. "One of the things we wanted to show tonight is that Optimus is not a canned video, it's not walled off," Musk told guests. However, the robots aren't fully autonomous just yet. The event failed to impress Wall Street analysts and investors, resulting in Musk's net worth falling $15 billion that October. "We expect to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this year, beginning this fall," Musk said. He said Tesla could produce one million units by 2030. "I think we feel confident in getting to one million units per year in less than five years, maybe four years. So by 2030, I feel confident in predicting one million Optimus units per year — it might be 2029," he said. However, Chris Walti, the former team lead for Tesla's robot, told Business Insider that humanoid robots may not be an ideal fit in factories. Most of the work that has to be done in industry is highly repetitive tasks where velocity is key," Walti said. Tesla uses rare-earth magnets from China to power the robot's actuators. Beijing paused exports of specific rare-earth elements in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Additionally, Musk said China needed reassurance that the magnets Tesla acquires wouldn't be used for a weaponized system or in other robots. "Tesla as a whole does not need to use permanent magnets, but when something is volume constrained, like an arm of the robot, then you want to try to make the motors as small as possible," Musk said. At the time, Musk said Tesla was "working through" the issue with China and hoped to get a license. Tesla has changed its strategy for training the Optimus robot. The company will now primarily use video recordings of humans performing tasks to train the robots instead of motion capture suits and teleoperation. The company believes stepping back from teleoperation and motion capture suits will allow Tesla to scale data collection faster, insiders told Business Insider last month. The pivot underscores Musk's belief that AI can complete complex tasks using cameras. He's used a similar approach when training Tesla's autonomous driving software. Optimus 3 will have agility roughly equal to an agile human. Musk has hyped up the newest model of Optimus multiple times on X, including in July when he said, "Optimus 3 will have agility roughly equal to an agile human." More recently, Musk called Optimus V3 "sublime" in an X post on Sunday.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US companies will soon face pressure from rivals and investors to elevate AI to the top of the org chart — not just as a C-suite helper — but as co-CEO or perhaps even as a stand-alone chief. AI's gains in efficiency are starting to challenge traditional executive functions, including decision-making, forecasting, and risk modeling, he told Business Insider. Add in investors' endless demands for efficiency, Tchong said, and you're all but promoting AI to co-CEO. Chatter about AI in the office tends to stir fears that a bot takeover will make loads of desk workers as necessary as reply-all email chains. Yet what Tchong predicts is more than just a CEO querying ChatGPT about strategy. One result of AI bosses would be tireless leaders who could fire off emails at any hour — perhaps not unlike some humans — and tinker continually with a company's operations. Having AI in the corner office could be an outgrowth of the pressure that many companies already face to talk about AI. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent podcast that the company had slashed about 4,000 customer-support roles because AI agents were taking on so much work at the tech giant. Tchong said examples of corporate chiefs handing duties like reporting quarterly results to AI are indicators that more leaders could get comfortable having digital sidekicks who share titles and never take PTO. And a handful of companies outside the US have named AI leaders. Already, various leaders, including Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, have said AI could do their jobs. Tamay Besiroglu, who cofounded and runs the startup Mechanize, wants to use AI to automate every role, including those of execs like himself. Others, like Sam Liang, CEO and cofounder of the note-taking app Otter, expect more top leaders will soon use avatars to attend meetings and field questions. Tchong said investor pressure could also make it more likely that some companies name AI as CEO, not just co-CEO. Why can't it also run the whole company?'" Yet not everyone thinks workers will toil under digital bosses. Gimbel, who is the incoming chairman of the American Staffing Association, said that CEOs lean on advisors, attorneys, accountants, and their boards to help navigate business decisions. On top of that, he said, chiefs now have AI to help outline various scenarios. Tchong said that because AI tools are already embedded at the executive level, it will just take time before the technology handles managerial work. He said one immediate concern is about what happens if an AI leader makes a mistake. Yet, Tchong said, that would make the bots similar to human beings, who also have "bouts of fantasy." "I would give him the informal title of 'chief empathy officer,' because that's what an AI can't do," Tchong said. AI, for its part, could work to optimize a company's operations and take over "laborious tasks" that even CEOs might not like to do, he said. That's because he expects that companies with AI in at least one driver's seat will outperform, and, as a result, investors will demand to see more tech with a decision-making role. And, unlike highly paid C-suiters, bots would be far cheaper, Tchong said. "The AI CEO does not demand a $29 billion salary," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One detail has already stirred grumbling: Employees will have to pay for gym access. The move highlights a broader shift on Wall Street, where flexing about your workout has become almost as important as closing a big deal. Firms see gyms as both a perk and a way to keep staff anchored to the office, so Wall Street gyms have evolved to include everything from river-view spin studios to juice bars, features designed with the long hours and high demands of finance in mind. In the past decade, banks and hedge funds have poured money into in-house gyms that now rival independent fitness studios and national gym chains. Now, they're the ones saying, 'We want to do more.'" Here's a look at five of Wall Street's luxe workout spaces, from Goldman Sachs to Citigroup, which boast amenities from Himalayan salt rooms to Peloton bikes; even skyline views count as a perk. The facility spans about 40,000 square feet — nearly the size of a football field — with floor-to-ceiling Hudson River views, a full suite of cardio and strength machines, and studios offering everything from yoga to HIIT training, according to people familiar with the space. An on-site laundry service relieves employees from having to pack a gym bag, providing standardized workout clothing, including T-shirts and shorts, people who have used the gym told Business Insider. You pick up the little banker bag, put your gym clothes in it. It's part of the thing," a former Goldman Sachs employee said. Trainers are available, and some senior partners have their regulars, this person said. Membership, which is subsidized, is tiered with analysts, associates, and administrators paying around $50 a month, vice presidents closer to $70, and managing directors over $100, these people said. JPMorgan's new Park Avenue HQ, which has started welcoming some employees and will open more fully later this year, features a state-of-the-art fitness center run by performance-training firm EXOS, which calls itself a "human performance" company specializing in employee wellness programming. The gym is designed as part of a broader health hub that will also include medical clinics and meditation rooms. Locker rooms and showers will be integrated into the sleek, futuristic facility. The bank told employees on its online portal that there'd be a monthly charge, but didn't say how much. At its tower in Chicago, BofA employees have access to 110Fit+, a 17,000-square-foot facility managed by Kinema Fitness. Kinema operates more than 50 corporate gyms across the country. The center features high-end locker rooms with overnight storage and laundry, along with a training floor designed around functional rigs and performance equipment rather than rows of machines, the company's website shows. Members can work with three certified personal trainers, booking 30-, 45-, or 60-minute sessions that cost under $100. Love said Kinema's Chicago location has drawn 600 members, including Bank of America's employees. Demand has been strong enough that Kinema recently added new therapeutic offerings, including a salt cave. For finance professionals working long, high-pressure hours, Love says the space offers "a chance to reset." The gym at the Chicago office and former headquarters of hedge fund giant Citadel is equipped with cardio machines, weights, and space for group classes, plus locker rooms and training, the Citadel Center website said. The gym offers midday stretch breaks for 15 minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, half-hour classes on training basics, cardio, strength, and core workouts. Trainers are available on demand, giving staff flexibility around demanding schedules. Less is known about what Citadel has in store for its planned Miami headquarters, where the firm is developing a new tower that could feature an even more ambitious fitness setup. Citi's Live Well Fitness center in Tribeca, staffed by degreed fitness professionals, features cardio and weight equipment, group classes, and personal training, public documents show. Membership is $50 per month, according to a spokesperson, but rates fluctuate across Citi locations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rosé from Blackpink just secured a massive win for K-pop. "APT," the lead single from Rosé's debut album in 2024, "Rosie," became a hit for its catchy tune and playful lyrics about a Korean drinking game. Previous recipients of the award were Sabrina Carpenter for her 2024 song "Espresso" and Olivia Rodrigo for her 2021 song "Driver's License." Rosé, whose real name is Roseanne Park, was visibly emotional when she accepted the award. "I dedicate this award to my 16-year-old self, who dreamed, and to all those who have watched me grow into the artist that I am today, and placed their dreams in me to make this change," she said in her acceptance speech. She also thanked her fellow Blackpink members, Jennie, Lisa, and Jisoo. Rosé wore a shimmery butter yellow dress for the occasion, accessorized with a tennis bracelet and dangly earrings. In December, during its first week of release, "Rosie" sold 102,000 equivalent album units and 70,000 albums, Billboard reported. K-pop artist Felix Lee from boy band Stray Kids walked the runway for LVMH in March as its brand ambassador. The boy band Seventeen is also making inroads into the US, with a new tour and solo collaboration tracks from members like Joshua Hong. Other group members, including the band's leader S.Coups and rapper Mingyu, have also been recognized in fashion, landing collaborations with brands like Calvin Klein and Hugo Boss. And one of the biggest Gen Z-favorite acts of the moment is Katseye, a girl group managed by Seoul-based Hybe Entertainment. Rosé is on Blackpink's "Deadline" world tour, with over 30 stops in Asia, North America, and Europe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said foreign companies that want to do business in the US should respect the country's immigration laws and bring their workers in legally. Trump made these remarks in a Truth Social post on Sunday. His post came after hundreds of workers were detained in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on a Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday. "I am hereby calling on all Foreign Companies investing in the United States to please respect our Nation's Immigration Laws," he wrote. "Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so. What we ask in return is that you hire and train American Workers," he added. On Sunday, Kang Hoon-sik, the chief of staff to South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, said his country had concluded talks with the US on returning its detained citizens. Nearly 500 workers were detained at a Hyundai-LG battery facility in Georgia. "This, in fact, was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security investigations," said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, during a press conference Friday. Kim told reporters before his flight that LG's "top priority" is for the "prompt and early release" of both LG's and Hyundai's employees. "The government is also responding with all its might, and we will do our best to ensure everyone's safe and speedy return," Kim added. Hyundai, based in Seoul, is one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers by revenue. The Georgia battery factory that was raided is still under construction and due to open in the first half of next year. It is part of a larger, $7.6 billion operation that includes a production plant for Hyundai's electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, as well as autos for its Genesis luxury brand and sister company, Kia. Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company," it added. Hyundai said that it is "committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate," including employment verification and immigration laws. Chris Susock, the North America chief manufacturing officer, is taking over the Georgia site and ensuring that subcontractors follow regulations, per Hyundai. Today, @ATFAtlanta joined HSI, FBI, DEA, ICE, GSP and other agencies in a major immigration enforcement operation at the Hyundai mega site battery plant in Bryan County, GA, leading to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety. South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday that Park Yoon-joo, the country's first vice-minister of foreign affairs, expressed regret over the matter during his call with US Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker. Day laborers outside of Home Depot locations have also been targeted. Trump signed a bill into law in July that provides ICE with additional funding and resources to assist in the arrests of immigrants living in the US illegally, including enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 individuals. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most US imports from South Korea, including automobiles, in exchange for duty-free treatment on many American products. Update: 9/5/2025 — This story now contains an updated statement from Hyundai.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that his country's interceptor drones struck 150 Russian long-range attack and decoy drones in a single night. In his regular public address, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched a total of 810 drones in one wave, including over 400 Shahed loitering munitions. "Of course, not everything is being shot down yet, and we still need to further strengthen our air defenses," Zelenskyy said in his address. Interceptor drones, originally made to catch and destroy reconnaissance craft, are high-speed uncrewed aerial systems that must fly fast enough to chase down their target midair and crash into it. Many of these are first-person-view drones that feed live camera footage to a pilot who must fly the system into its target. With Russia's growing use of the Shahed, Ukraine is now pivoting its interceptor development to fight loitering munitions. Each produces its own drone, which is sold or donated to Ukrainian air defense troops in coordination with the government. "This is a top priority," Zelenskyy said on Sunday. "Russians keep the number of Shaheds in massive strikes at the level of 300 to 400 per strike, and our interceptors must reach a matching level. The rest of Ukraine's air defense system relies on jamming, air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and mobile fire groups, which are vehicle crews equipped with mounted machine guns. But they've often been overwhelmed by the sheer number of drones Russia launches in one wave. Moscow has increasingly started accumulating attack drones and ballistic missiles to launch them in greater numbers at the same time. Kyiv thus hopes interceptors can soon be used as a cheap, reliable way to counter the onslaught. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that his government has been securing financing and contracts for interceptors. Roughly 56 drones made it past Ukrainian air defenses, with at least one impacting Kyiv's parliamentary headquarters, officials said. At least four people, including an infant, were killed in the attack, Ukrainian authorities said.</p>
