                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum treasury company Sharplink got a muted response from investors when it told Decrypt last week that it'll stake a portion of the $3.6 billion worth of ETH in its treasury on Linea once mainnet goes live. And now, it's been the case for a week that users on Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt parent company DASTAN, are doubting that Sharplink will scoop up enough Ethereum to hold 1 million ETH before Sept. 16. The company currently has 837,230 ETH in its treasury, worth approximately $3.62 billion at current prices. The sagging share price and growing doubts about the pace of its ETH acquisition likely has to do with Sharplink aggressively issuing shares and diluting existing investors, Samantha Bohbot, chief growth officer at RockawayX, told Decrypt. “Currently, most DAT ‘investors' should be thought of more as technical traders than long-term business backers,” Bohbot said. Few appear focused yet on whether a DAT's premium valuation is justified by its ability to generate yield above simply holding the asset.” SharpLink Will Explore Staking Portion of $3.6 Billion Ethereum Treasury on Linea, CEO Says That doesn't mean she thinks Sharplink's plans are a bad idea. It's also worth noting that Sharplink already stakes a percentage of its ETH holdings on the Ethereum mainnet, so far earning 2,318 ETH (or $10 million worth at today's prices) in rewards since June. There's other factors to consider too, said James Harris, CEO of institutional digital asset firm Tesseract. “Linea is still new and untested at scale, so investors may be wary of smart contract or operational risks that don't exist with more established custodial staking providers, though Consensys' involvement should help mitigate this concern” he told Decrypt. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) Leading Ethereum development company Consensys has been central to Sharplink's ETH treasury since it was first announced in May. So it's likely that Ethereum investors have been expecting Sharplink to stake on Linea for months, but as Harris pointed out, “yield terms and liquidity mechanics haven't been fully disclosed yet, making it harder for institutions to assess risk-reward.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The injected malware is reportedly designed to steal crypto by swapping wallet addresses and intercepting transactions. According to several reports on Monday, hackers broke into the node package manager (NPM) account of a well-known developer and secretly added malware to popular JavaScript libraries used by millions of apps. The malicious code swaps or hijacks crypto wallet addresses, potentially putting many projects at risk. “There's a large-scale supply chain attack in progress: the NPM account of a reputable developer has been compromised," Ledger Chief Technology Officer Charles Guillemet warned on Monday. Together, these libraries are downloaded more than a billion times each week, meaning even developers who never installed them directly could be exposed. NPM is like an app store for developers — a central library where they share and download small code packages to build JavaScript projects. Attackers sent emails posing as official NPM support, warning maintainers that their accounts would be locked unless they “updated” two-factor authentication by September 10. The fake site captured login credentials, giving hackers control over a maintainer's account. Once inside, the attackers pushed malicious updates to packages with billions of weekly downloads. Charlie Eriksen, a researcher at Aikido Security, told BleepingComputer the attack was especially dangerous because it operated “at multiple layers: altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what users' apps believe they are signing.” This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

The marketplace's reserve, called the Flagship Collection, will begin with CryptoPunk #5273, which was last purchased for $282,000 on August 25 before being transferred to a new address on Monday. - OS Mobile: a beautiful trading experience powered by AI- Flagship Collection: honoring web3's cultural heritage- Final Rewards Phase: 50% of platform fees funding millions in token & NFT prizes- $SEA Update: details in early October The firm will choose pieces for the collection using a committee of OpenSea employees and a group of external advisors with strict internal procedures in place to prevent the leak of information prior to acquisitions. “There are a variety of elements that factor into our buying criteria, ranging from cultural significance, impact on Web3 as a whole, unique expressions of creativity and more,” OpenSea CMO Adam Hollander told Decrypt. “The goal is to spotlight well-deserving artists and creators, even new and emerging ones, placing their works shoulder-to-shoulder with historical pieces that represent digital culture.” Starting on September 15, the firm will begin using 50% of its platform fees to create a prize vault for the final phase of pre-token generation rewards. Additionally, it is kickstarting the vault with $1 million worth of the native tokens from Ethereum layer-2 networks Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB). Full tokenomics details are expected to be shared by the OpenSea Foundation in early October. In July, OpenSea acquired crypto portfolio application, Rally, to level up its mobile experience. Waitlists for a revamped mobile application and an AI-focused trading experience are expected to launch in the coming weeks, the firm said Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenSea, the largest NFT exchange, is launching a $1 million "flagship collection" funding initiative to commemorate digital culture, according to an announcement on Monday. The so-called OpenSea Flagship Collection will include a "$1+ million commitment to acquiring, curating, and celebrating digital art and culture." OpenSea noted that the collection selection process is "designed to showcase NFTs as cultural artifacts and support the artists and collectors who've shaped the space," and will begin by purchasing CryptoPunk #5273. It will also be overseen by a "Committee of OpenSea employees and a small group of trusted external advisors." Notably, this is not the first CryptoPunk to be used as a reserve asset. In July, Ethereum holding company GameSquare purchased a rare Punk NFT for $5.15 million worth of preferred shares from DeFi mainstay Robert Leshner for use as a treasury asset. "We've always said NFTs are culture," OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer said in a statement to The Block. OpenSea Mobile will enter beta in mid-September, with waitlists opening over the next two weeks, while the OpenSea Foundation promises to share details on the token generation event in October. As part of the SEA token launch, OpenSea will "start sweeping millions in tokens and NFTs into a massive prize vault" using 50% of all platform fees beginning Sept. 15 that will be passed on as user rewards. Apparently, $1 million worth of OP and ARB tokens are "already loaded in the vault." OpenSea has faced criticism in the past for its internal controls. Most notably, in 2021, former OpenSea product manager Nathaniel Chastain was accused of insider trading after using confidential information to buy NFTs before they were featured on OpenSea's homepage, then selling them at a profit. Chastain was convicted of wire fraud and money laundering in 2023, sentenced to three months in prison, but the conviction was overturned last month. According to The Block's data, trading data is still a fraction of a fraction of NFT trading at its height. That said, OpenSea, launched in 2017, has begun retaking that top spot as the leading NFT exchange, after a couple of months of losing out to Blur. OpenSea has also been teasing a series of product launches and improvements, as well as a native SEA token.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple integration with Finastra opens access to 11,000 SWIFT-connected financial institutions. Finastra's payments hub already serves more institutions and handles about $5 trillion in cross-border flows each day. Routing RippleNet through that middleware would give Ripple an immediate, indirect pathway to a substantial share of SWIFT's member banks. Finastra operates a global payments service used by thousands of banks. In 2025, SWIFT ran pilots that assessed public ledgers — including the XRP Ledger. The tests examined whether tokenised settlement could speed transfers and improve data richness. The XRP Ledger settles payments in seconds and at very low cost  — settlement times of roughly 3–5 seconds and micro-dollar fees per transfer are typical in ledger performance summaries. Ripple's CEO has positioned the ledger as a liquidity rail that can sit alongside existing messaging systems. In June 2025, Ripple executives reiterated that banks do not need to rip out SWIFT to use XRP for settlement; they can add it for liquidity on demand. They adopt them where legal, compliance, and operational controls are clear. That governance model underpins trust and dispute resolution among 11,000 institutions. Any material re-routing of bank liquidity to public token rails will need custodial models, settlement finality rules, and regulatory sign-offs acceptable to banks and supervisors. SWIFT's public statements emphasise that neutrality and a legal framework are prerequisites for large-scale change. Industry commentary supplies rough scenario math: even a small reroute of SWIFT flows to tokenised settlement could represent hundreds of billions, or more, in value running through on-chain rails. SWIFT's own pilots acknowledge blockchain's promise but underscore that governance and legal enforceability are non-negotiable.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MegaETH, an Ethereum scaling network designed for transactions that process so quickly it calls itself a "real-time" blockchain, said on Monday it is launching a native stablecoin with fast-growing DeFi protocol Ethena ENA$0.7695. The token will be backed in the beginning by Ethena's USDtb, a yield-generating token backed by BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL. Later, other and future Ethena-issued tokens may be added such USDe, MegaETH said in a blog post. Stablecoins are a fast-growing, $270 billion group of cryptocurrencies, predominantly with prices tied to the U.S dollar. They serve as a primary liquidity and trading pairs on crypto venues, and are also increasingly used for cross-border payments promising faster, cheaper transactions on blockchain rails compared to traditional banking channels. Popular crypto wallet MetaMask recently announced the launch of its own stablecoin with infrastructure providers M0 and Stripe's Bridge, while Hyperliquid, a layer-1 network known for its popular on-chain perpetual swaps exchange, is holding an audition for a stablecoin issuer partner for its own token. MegaETH's token plan also highlights Ethena venturing into the stablecoin-as-a-service business, helping other crypto ecosystems to issue their own stablecoins.

Christie's has shut down its digital art department, cutting staff including VP Nicole Sales Giles at the end of August, according to a report from Now Media. The auction house confirmed the move, saying digital works will now be sold within its 20th and 21st Century Art category.

The changes follow the appointment of new CEO Bonnie Brennan in February and coincide with a downturn in the digital art market. 

Christie's, which helped spark the NFT boom with Beeple's $69 million sale in 2021, later launched its onchain platform Christie's 3.0, now facing an uncertain future.

In our submission, we emphasised the importance of Government using its powers to create a more enabling environment for publishers, specifically by extending PECR – Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, exemptions on consent requirements to include data sharing with third parties for advertising purposes. We highlighted that the privacy risks in this area are marginal, given the vast availability of personal data online (particularly that controlled by large platforms), and that genuine digital anonymity is now virtually non-existent.Our response also underlined that publishers cannot sustain viable advertising models on contextual or consent-less inventory alone. Continued access to personalised advertising is critical to maintaining quality, independent content and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the sector.The consultation comes as the ICO sees a change in leadership, with William Malcolm, a former Google lawyer, replacing Stephen Almond as regulatory lead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the U.S. Senate Banking Committee's most recent version of the CLARITY Act, Bitcoin and crypto developers would be protected from being charged with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business moving forward — and retroactively. On Friday, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee released its latest draft of the CLARITY Act (CLARITY), in which it proposes an amendment to 18 U.S. Code § 1960(a) stipulates that only crypto developers or providers that “knowingly exercise control over currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency” be treated as money transmitting businesses. What is more, this amendment would not only protect Bitcoin and crypto developers in the wake of a bill with this language included in its passing, but it would also protect said developers retroactively. If this language is included in a version of the bill that is enacted into law, Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who was found guilty of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business last month, stands to benefit. Unfortunately, if CLARITY passes with the retroactive protections included, this will not help the Samourai Wallet Developers, who accepted a plea deal for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in July. This most recent draft of CLARITY also stipulates that developers or providers of “non-controlling” (noncustodial) crypto technology shall not be treated as money transmitting businesses under 31 U.S. Code § 5330. Non-controlling developers are defined as those who create or work on “distributed ledger service(s), that in the regular course of operations, does not have the legal right of the unilateral and independent ability to control, initiate upon demand, or effectuate transactions involving digital assets to which users are entitled, without the approval, consent, or direction of any other third party.” The definition applies to developers of crypto services, software, or hardware that helps customers facilitate the self custody and safekeeping of digital assets. “This legislative draft reflects feedback from hundreds of stakeholders on a wide range of questions as part of the Request for Information (RFI) on the July discussion draft,” a spokesperson from the Senate Banking Committee told Bitcoin Magazine. “Chairman Scott, Senator Lummis, and their colleagues will continue working in a bipartisan way to deliver a final product that will protect investors, foster innovation, and keep the future of digital finance anchored in America.”</p>

After an initial round of selling, PUMP is now interesting again, with 110% growth from its local lows. PUMP recovered to $0.0048, with a growing share of activity on Hyperliquid, surpassing even the Bybit trading pairs. The expanded open interest and spot trades revived PUMP, which initially was considered a token at risk of failing. Recently, one large-scale trader started opening leveraged long positions, getting exposed to risk on the narrative change.

While Hyperliquid still has a relatively small market share, the public positions of whales are used as a signal for conviction. PUMP is still seen as potentially undervalued and pressured by sellers. The token was sold at record speed, placing $500M in just 12 minutes. Since the ICO token launch, most metrics for Pump.fun have improved. In August, the platform habitually carried 16K to 24K daily token launches. Since the beginning of August, Pump.fun also saw a robust fee recovery. Recently, the platform logged over $5.7M in daily fees, a level not seen since February. The platform is capable of producing $1B in daily fees, which is seen as a favorable metric compared to the PUMP market value of $4B. Compared to other networks, PUMP is considered undervalued, especially if selling stops and Pump.fun buys back more tokens. PUMP may also rally during another SOL season. SOL already expanded to $213.37, breaking out in the new week. For Pump.fun, however, the trenches are not back as during previous launches. Token creation picked up after Project Ascend boosted compensations by 10X. On-chain data, however, shows that some of the new token projects are still at risk of rug pulls, crashing soon after reaching peak valuation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. When Arianna Simpson was 22 years old, she plowed her savings into Bitcoin. She had left her college job and traveled with a friend through Zimbabwe, witnessing firsthand the consequences of hyperinflation. Aside from investing the contents of her bank account, Simpson started a blockchain lunch meetup at her next post, Facebook. She wrote a blog post on multisignature wallets that landed her a job at the infrastructure startup BitGo, where she became the third employee. (More than 10 years later, BitGo is set to go public, though Simpson sadly left before her shares vested.) Instead of sticking it out in the early crypto startup trenches, Simpson moved into venture, first working at a friend's generalist firm before starting her own crypto fund, Autonomous Partners, which raised from Brian Armstrong, David Sacks' Craft Ventures, and Steve Cohen's family office. This was 2017, when crypto was beginning to explode into the mainstream, and Simpson invested in companies like Talos and Mythical Games. Through Armstrong, she also met Katie Haun, a Department of Justice prosecutor-turned-a16z investor, who convinced Simpson to come on board. Simpson joined a16z crypto as a deal partner in 2020. “I had a lot of respect and appreciation for the fact that the firm, despite being like an institution, had taken this category seriously,” Simpson says. Simpson came on right at the start of the boom years, which included a16z crypto's landmark $2.2 billion third fund in 2021 and $4.5 billion fourth fund in 2022. And amid power players like Chris Dixon and Haun, she made a name for herself investing early in companies like Blackbird, the dining rewards startup created by Resy cofounder Ben Leventhal, and Phantom, the crypto wallet recently valued at $3 billion.

He has also interviewed a few prominent experts within the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin price today stays strong around $110K while analysts debate long-term forecasts from $250K to $13M. At the center of discussions is Michael Saylor's bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $13 million per coin by 2045. While the figure sounds extreme, many note that previous milestones like $10,000 or even $100,000 once seemed impossible until they became reality. Saylor believes Bitcoin's network effect will continue to drive adoption and price growth, creating a cycle where higher demand leads to higher prices, and vice versa. According to Dr. Jeff Ross, a macro strategist, Bitcoin is actually undervalued today. He estimates its fair value above $140,000 based on global liquidity. He argues that broader economic uncertainty has delayed growth, but once conditions improve, Bitcoin could climb rapidly. Meanwhile, Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, believes this market cycle may stretch into 2026, with Bitcoin potentially hitting $250,000 before cooling down. The case for Bitcoin remains tied to its limited supply. With ETFs, sovereign funds, and institutions buying aggressively, analysts warn there isn't enough Bitcoin to meet demand. However, they caution that market peaks often come when hype is at its highest, making timing critical for investors. While Bitcoin dominates headlines, Ethereum is quietly strengthening its Wall Street presence. Strong institutional accumulation, significant exchange outflows reducing sell pressure, and positive sentiment around Bitcoin's long-term value are driving the market upward. Some altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are gaining momentum due to unique catalysts, though Bitcoin remains the dominant force in terms of institutional inflows. Ethereum (low exchange balances), Solana (developer activity), XRP (regulatory clarity), and Chainlink (real-world data use) are displaying strong bullish trends. Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by institutional accumulation and long-term bullish predictions, though short-term volatility remains a concern.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Catalini, who created Meta's Libra, believes Stripe's Tempo could be doomed since permissionless networks are the future. In fact, Catalini believes that if Stripe's Tempo succeeds commercially, it would mean that early crypto idealists will have to embrace a future where the original ethos of decentralization is lost. Catalini used the example of Libra's failure to demonstrate his point. “Looking back on Libra, the stablecoin project I helped design inside Meta, I can confirm we weren't just early; we were also comically, spectacularly wrong.” Besides the unfortunate timing, several other factors contributed to Libra's ultimate failure. This included the “Silicon Valley hubris—the belief that elegant code can simply wish away centuries of financial regulation,” Catalini wrote. Additionally, Facebook's aggressive marketing of Libra not only drew more attention, but also provided ammunition to its opponents. According to Catalini, there is a prevalent misconception that Libra failed because it could not meet regulatory guidelines. However, the opposite is true, Catalini wrote, adding: And “crypto's purpose is to break this cycle of broken promises,” Catalini wrote, adding: “It's the same fundamental economic truth we identified at MIT almost a decade ago: the only thing that truly separates crypto from the systems it aims to replace is that it's permissionless.” “A world where users truly control their own money is messy, borderless, and doesn't fit that legacy blueprint. According to Catalini, if corporate blockchains like Tempo and Circle's Arc succeed, it would indicate that “the crypto experiment was not a revolution, but a failed coup.” This is because while the backend technology will be different, the market structure will remain “eerily familiar,” he wrote. In fact, Catalini described it as a change of kings while the throne remains the same—fintech giants will replace existing card networks and financial institutions. Catalini believes that if Libra's demise could be wholly chalked up to bad timing, then Tempo's success is nearly inevitable, given the change in regulatory stance. And in such a case, “the crypto world's original dreamers may finally have to accept a more pragmatic, centralized reality.” It is merely staging an entertaining, and very expensive, sequel.” In 2020, Monika immersed herself in crypto, maintaining skepticism yet firmly believing blockchain could address key issues like financial disparity and transparency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A crypto strategist known for his timely Bitcoin (BTC) calls says he has his eye on two large-cap altcoins. According to the trader, Ethereum appears to be in the process of flipping a major resistance level into support, which would put ETH in a stronger position to reach new all-time high territory. We had the beautiful, the magnificent, nobody's ever seen it, this beautiful descending broadening right angle wedge – a breakout from that, and really the measured move, whether you go log or linear again [is] $6,500 and $9,000… So even though there's the measured move from the broadening wedge, it paused at all-time high [level], so that's resistance. You've got support here, and very simply, Ethereum is pretty easy to mark up here because you're going to zoom in and you're going to say, if I get a shot, if I get a bullish retest, a throwback, $3,950, $4,000, I'm jumping in, and you've got your overhead level. At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $4,279. Another coin on the trader's radar is Solana (SOL). It doesn't have a straight-up breakout feel, and a lot of people keep getting these early [failed breakouts]. It's breaking out and pushing back into the range, but what's most notable is this rising demand trend. I think as long as that continues, despite the choppy breakout nature, I think it's likely to continue. That's kind of the key level for me still.” At time of writing, SOL is trading for $200.
