                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cognition AI, the startup behind AI coding agent Devin, has hit a $10.2 billion valuation after raising $400 million, marking a jump from the company's $4 billion valuation earlier this year, reports Bloomberg. Founders Fund, the Peter Thiel-backed VC, led Cognition's latest round, with participation from existing investors like Lux Capital, Joe Lonsdale's 8VC, Elad Gil, Definition Capital and Swish Ventures. The raise comes after serious growth for Cognition's core product. Net burn has remained under $20 million since its founding two years ago, per Bloomberg. Last month, Cognition laid off 30 staffers and offered buyouts to the remaining 200 employees, offering them a way out of the expectation to work 80-hour, six-day weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is laying off another 42 workers at its Redmond headquarters, according to a filing Monday, continuing a series of workforce reductions that have collectively impacted thousands of employees in recent months. The ongoing trickle of smaller layoffs marks a departure from the traditional corporate mantra of “cut once, cut deep” — leaving some employees feeling nervous about whether their job will be next. The cuts come as Microsoft spends record amounts on AI. The company continues to hire in key areas like AI while making targeted cuts elsewhere. Across the tech sector, companies including Amazon, Google, and Meta have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs, citing pandemic-era over-hiring and a renewed focus on efficiency and strategic priorities like AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Salesloft said a breach of its GitHub account in March allowed hackers to steal authentication tokens that were later used in a mass-hack targeting several of its big tech customers. Citing an investigation by Google's incident response unit Mandiant, Salesloft said on its data breach page that the as-yet-unnamed hackers accessed Salesloft's GitHub account and performed reconnaissance activities from March until June, which allowed them to download “content from multiple repositories, add a guest user and establish workflows.” Contact Us Do you have more information about these data breaches? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. In stealing these tokens, the threat actors breached several Salesloft's customers, such as Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, Proofpoint, Palo Alto Networks, and Tenable, among others, many of which are likely still unknown. By accessing Salesloft tokens, the hackers then access Salesforce instances, where they stole sensitive data contained in support tickets. “The actor's primary objective was to steal credentials, specifically focusing on sensitive information like AWS access keys, passwords, and Snowflake-related access tokens,” Salesloft said on August 26. Salesloft said on Sunday that its integration with Salesforce is now restored.

And to the people charged with decision making, we need nothing at all. And to the people charged with decision making, we need nothing at all. If reformation fails then we are headed towards a dark place anyway. Its ironic that they promote the titled narrative when we have neither a free market, nor effective price discovery (due to dark pools and other actors). In the name of "capitalism", our government has allowed big business to grow ever larger, become ever more inescapable, and often even delegates/cedes governmental power to big business. So really if anyone is reading this, getting angry at the rise of "socialism", and wanting to save capitalism - it's really incumbent upon you to be loudly criticizing both the foundational and emergent problems of capitalism as currently conceived. Because otherwise this frustration is just going to continue building, and we are going to lose what we do have, for good.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may be setting his sights on acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, as a root trigger of autism spectrum disorder. HHS is purportedly planning to list acetaminophen use during pregnancy as a risk factor for autism in its much-awaited report later this month. Though similar medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have their advantages, acetaminophen remains the most widely used over-the-counter painkiller and fever reducer in the world. Like every drug, though, acetaminophen has its side effects. Chronic use or excessively high doses can potentially trigger acute liver or kidney damage, and acetaminophen is known to be the most common cause of acute liver failure from drug overdose in the U.S. Overall, however, acetaminophen is thought to be safer and more tolerable to take than aspirin or NSAIDs, making it an appealing pain and fever treatment for women during pregnancy. That said, some studies over the years have pointed to possible complications from taking acetaminophen during pregnancy. Just last month, a review published by Mount Sinai researchers found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen could increase the risk of several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). RFK Jr. Says He Doesn't Know How Many Americans Died From Covid During Heated Senate Hearing It's not at all clear yet that Tylenol can cause autism, however, and there's reason to believe that many positive studies have failed to account for the noise in the data. Last year, for instance, researchers in Sweden and the U.S. conducted a sweeping analysis of all children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019. They initially found a slightly increased risk of autism in children whose mothers reported acetaminophen use during pregnancy in the raw data. Autism is likely caused by a mix of genetic and environmental influences. And since siblings share many of these influences, these sorts of studies are better able to analyze risk factors that differ between one pregnancy and the next (in this case, acetaminophen use). Since women who use acetaminophen could have an increased risk of health conditions or other factors that make their children more vulnerable to autism, acetaminophen may simply be a red herring, the researchers noted. “Results of this study indicate that the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders is a noncausal association,” the study authors wrote in their paper, published April 2024 in JAMA. Though it's possible some external factors may be helping increase the prevalence of autism, many experts believe that reported cases have largely increased due to better detection and expanded criteria for diagnosing autism. Promises to Reveal the ‘Cause' of Autism Next Month He seems to be cherry-picking old data rather than looking at the body of research as a whole.” As things stand already, though, it seems unlikely that the HHS report will offer any real clarity of the complex causes of autism, as RFK Jr. has promised.

At an event Wednesday, RFK Jr. argued that children's dysfunctional mitochondria are responsible for a bevy of chronic health and behavioral issues. At least five senior CDC employees, including its director, have resigned or been fired since Wednesday. Kennedy made the announcement at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may never get another season of Hannibal, but there's some comfort to be found in Dust Bunny, Hannibal creator Bryan Fuller‘s feature directorial debut—which just so happens to star Dr. Lecter himself, Mads Mikkelsen. He plays a hired killer who befriends his young neighbor after she loses her family; she believes a monster did it, but he's got an equally scary, more real-world idea of the culprit. Check out the first trailer for Dust Bunny here: “Ten-year-old Aurora has a mysterious neighbor (Mads Mikkelsen) who kills real-life monsters. So, when Aurora needs help killing the monster she believes ate her entire family, she procures his services. Suspecting that her parents may have fallen victim to assassins gunning for him, Aurora's neighbor guiltily takes the job. Dust Bunny casts Mikkelsen as a good guy who's done some very bad things; complicated villains are his specialty and this reunion with Fuller will hopefully capture some of that old Hannibal magic—with what look like some fantastical fight scenes to boot.

Intel's 14A manufacturing technology (1.4nm-class) technology — the company's first fabrication process that was designed both for Intel and its foundry customers from the ground up — will be more expensive to use than the company's upcoming 18A production node according to Intel. The reason for that will be use of ASML's next-generation Twinscan EXE:5200B High-NA lithography machine with a 0.55 numerical aperture optics. "14A is more expensive than 18A," said David Zinsner, chief financial officer of Intel, at the Citi's 2025 Global TMT Conference. "It is not significantly [more expensive] in terms of investment. [But] it is a higher wafer cost, for sure and partly that is because we, we are expecting to use High-NA EUV tools in 14A, which was not the case in 18A." The new manufacturing technology features RibbonFET 2, an upgraded gate-all-around transistor structure, and PowerDirect, a backside power delivery network that connects power wires directly to source and drain of transistors. A key innovation of 14A is Turbo Cells, which enhance CPU and GPU frequency by optimizing critical timing paths using high-drive, double-height cells within dense standard cell libraries, which boosts speed without major area or power compromises. However, High-NA EUV reduces the exposure field by 50%, requiring chipmakers to adjust their design strategies. Moreover, the new systems are more expensive than existing litho machines. ASML's current-generation Low-NA EUV Twinscan NXE:3800E tool costs around $235 million per unit, whereas its upcoming High-NA EUV Twinscan EXE:5200B (or more advanced) tools are expected to cost $380 million per unit. Due to the high cost and unique challenges posed by the technology, adoption of High-NA EUV vary: Intel is pushing for early deployment with 14A several years down the road from now, while TSMC is taking a more cautious approach. As a result, once all the extra costs are added, they really make 14A process technology more expensive than 14A, which is why Intel Foundry needs external customers to justify extra costs. "So yes, Intel Products will be a big customer on 14A, but it is, it is the totality of that demand, and we need to make sure it is to the level that we can generate a, a reasonable ROI for shareholders."

However, Intel may no longer have a choice, but to finish development of 14A and then start production of chips on this technology as Intel Foundry is an indispensable part of Intel that cannot be spun off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6's rollable display is something of a marvel, and Lenovo didn't skimp on the keyboard and trackpad. But the expensive price and a few first-gen issues make this system only for die-hard enthusiasts. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. They might have lighter designs than previous years or improve performance with new chips. It's the type of device you would expect to see shown off at a trade show like CES (where it debuted) and then never seen again — except that for $3,299.99, you can actually own it. You can buy powerful gaming laptops for the same price. But no other computer yet offers this functionality, even if there are a few first-generation hiccups. It's surely the most interesting laptop I've used all year, if not longer. Out of the box, the ThinkBook looks like a pretty standard (if not dull) laptop, with a two-toned silver design. The aluminum deck is sturdy and features a backlit keyboard. That's not a lot of ports for any laptop, especially one seemingly meant for productivity, but I suppose something had to go in order to make room for the display.The laptop is 11.95 x 9.08 x 0.78 inches and weighs 3.72 pounds, which is hefty for a 14-inch PC. But this laptop is also a 16-inch PC, thanks to its rollable display, which makes the ThinkBook far more interesting than it looks at first. Other laptop vendors should do this more often, and Lenovo should bring it to more of its own machines. Unrolled, you get a far taller display, measuring 16.7 inches diagonally with a resolution of 2000 x 2350 and an 8:9 aspect ratio. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Unfolding a foldable the first time feels futuristic. Having a motor do it for you feels magical. The motor isn't terribly loud, but it does take time to roll and unroll — about 9 seconds from button press to full extension or contraction. I'd like to see that cut in half, though I don't know what that would do to durability. The plastic OLED screen looks really nice, and performs pretty well, too. The screen measured 150% of DCI-P3 coverage by volume, and 211.7% of SRGB, easily surpassing the Yoga Book 9i Gen 10's impressive dual panels. The thing is, though, it's not really great for multimedia. Those increased to obscene amounts with the taller 16-inch screen unrolled. What these aspect ratios do allow for is strong multitasking. And there are uses for tall displays; some coders love a desktop display turned vertical to show more text. This is no gaming device, simply because of that issue. Of course, it also doesn't have dedicated graphics.And for all its impressive unfurling, there are limitations to the screen. For one, it's not a touchscreen, despite the many foldables that use similar technology, all featuring touch capabilities. I don't feel that all clamshell laptops inherently need touchscreens, but there's something about a screen this tall that feels like it invites it. Additionally, the hinge only goes just past a 90-degree angle. This seemingly supports the display and rolling mechanism, ensuring it rolls and unrolls at ideal angles, but it feels quite limiting. You have to be careful with the screen. You also can't change the resolution or screen orientation in Windows 11 on this laptop. While I doubt many people would actually change it, it's surprising to get a pop-up that says "The current model does not support resolution adjustment" as Windows reverts to the native resolution whether you tell it to or not. (You can still change scaling, though Lenovo warns it could cause problems with the ThinkBook Workspace app). This isn't terribly different from the way you can sometimes see the crease on foldable phones, but it doesn't feel terribly premium. You need your hand in the perfect spot, then the sensor needs to recognize your hand, and only then do you move it up or down. There's only one configuration of the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable. The fancy screen is backed by an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. If you're buying this, it's mostly for the display. The bump to 32GB of RAM is nice, but otherwise the specs are all pretty similar to what you can get in cheaper ultraportables. This price can get you a big, gaming-ready GPUs. With this laptop, you're getting ultrabook internals and an innovative screen, and you'll have to live with integrated graphics. Here, we're comparing the ThinkBook Plus to Lenovo's own Yoga Book 9i (Intel Core Ultra 7 255H), with dual screens that also lets you work tall, as well as the 14-inch MacBook Pro and HP OmniBook X Flip 14, both of which are more typical laptops with Apple's M4 and AMD's Ryzen AI 7 350, respectively, and cost far less. The Rollable's scallop-shaped keys are great to type on. While I've seen some snappier keys on some of Lenovo's ThinkPad lineup, this keyboard was comfortable and balanced, letting me hit 110 words per minute on the monkeytype typing test with my standard 2% error rate. I have no complaints about the haptic touchpad — a computer with a rolling screen doesn't need more moving parts. Maybe it's the extra bit of thickness the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 needs to fit a screen, but it also allows for surprisingly powerful speakers in an ultrabook. As I worked, Linkin Park's "Two Faced" screamed through my apartment with clear vocals, clashing drums, strong guitars, and even a hint of bass on the low end. You rarely find that on a business machine. Given the complexity of this device, I was shocked that there were any user-replaceable parts. Removing them, I was able to pull the bottom off from a well-placed space near the chassis' palm rest. The SSD is also user-replaceable if you want to add more storage. The RAM is soldered.Be careful while working inside this system, though. I'd hate to lose a screw in there. An extra two inches of screen real estate (and the accompanying pixels) affects battery life. Rolled up to 14 inches, the ThinkBook ran for 9 hours and 28 minutes on our battery test, which includes web browsing, light WebGL testing, and video streaming with the screen set to 150 nits. With the screen unrolled out to 16 inches it ran for 8:43. Both are longer than the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i Gen 10, with two screens, and the HP OmniBook X Flip 14, a convertible with one display. To measure skin temperatures under load, we took heat readings while running our Cinebench 2024 stress test. I'd prefer a button on the keyboard, but this works fine. Lenovo has several pieces of software designed specifically for the rollable, though I'll be frank — I don't think any of them are strictly necessary. The big one is ThinkBook Workspace, which lets you add mini apps like your reminders, to-do-list, and calendar from your Microsoft account. The app also features a user guide, an awkward secondary virtual display, and access to Smart Copy, a clipboard manager. You can also pin your own apps to Workspace's thick title bar. One of the first things I did with Workspace was prevent it from launching every single time I extended the screen (there's an easy enough keyboard button for it). If you want a fun animation to play while you extend the screen (which I wouldn't recommend, as it covers your work), or to try enabling the feature to raise the screen with your hand, you'll have to dig.There's also Lenovo AI Now, a local AI app that lets you feed documents into your "personal knowledge base" to find or easily digest information without using the cloud. Lenovo requires an account for this app, which is a shame, since the point of it is that it uses local computing. Just like Lenovo's other devices, Vantage is on board for warranty information, easy access to your serial number, battery, and device settings, system updates, and an advertisement for McAfee Secure VPN.There's also Lenovo Smart Meeting, which makes adjustments to your camera, background, or replaces you with a temporary avatar if you have to leave a meeting. Lenovo Now attempts to foist upsells and partner offers on you, and I think for a $3,300 laptop, you shouldn't have to deal with that. Lenovo sells the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 with a one-year courier or carry-in warranty, which can be increased for a longer duration or to include more services for additional charges. But Lenovo made the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable real, and it's by far the most interesting laptop I've reviewed in a long time. It's a good enough performer for typical productivity tasks like writing, spreadsheets, video conferencing, and basic coding. But with the $3,299.99 price tag, you're really paying for that rolling screen and all of the engineering behind it.In truth, there's nothing like it. This device also offers a traditional laptop keyboard and touchpad, unlike the more powerful Yoga Book 9i with dual screens.You could buy any number of traditional laptops with similar specs and add in one of the best portable monitors on top of it for a lot less money. If that's worth the considerable extra expense (and extra weight) for you, then the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is worth considering. Andrew E.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a move that blurs the lines between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. like never before, the United States government has acquired a nearly 10% equity stake in Intel Corporation. This historic transaction, valued at approximately $8.9 billion, effectively converts previously allocated CHIPS and Science Act grants into a direct ownership position, creating a de facto U.S. sovereign wealth fund with one of America's most iconic technology companies as its cornerstone asset. To understand how this happened, one must appreciate the immense pressure Intel and its leadership have been under. This decline culminated in a period of intense public scrutiny, including from the White House itself. President Donald Trump had publicly called for the resignation of Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, citing alleged conflicts of interest related to China, creating a politically charged environment. For Intel's leadership, refusing the deal was likely not a viable option. Turning down the government's offer would have meant forfeiting billions in essential funding and risking the appearance of being uncooperative with a national security imperative. The concept of a government owning stakes in key industries is not new. Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are common globally, with varying degrees of success. These successful funds are characterized by professional management, a clear mandate to maximize long-term returns, and a strong firewall insulating them from short-term political interference. However, the history of government intervention is also littered with failures. State-owned enterprises in many countries have been plagued by inefficiency, corruption, and political cronyism, becoming a drain on public resources rather than a source of national wealth. Even in the U.S., direct government investments have a checkered past. The risk is that political objectives — like preserving jobs in a specific district or favoring certain suppliers — can override sound business strategy, dooming the investment to fail. For Intel, successfully navigating this new reality will require a delicate balancing act. This will be crucial to building trust and demonstrating that the capital is being deployed effectively to achieve the shared goal of technological leadership. The company is in the middle of a monumental turnaround plan, investing over $100 billion to build advanced fabrication plants (fabs) in Arizona, Ohio, and beyond. This government capital injection de-risks that colossal undertaking, but it doesn't guarantee success. For decades, the U.S. has watched its leadership in manufacturing this critical technology erode, creating a dangerous dependency on East Asia, particularly Taiwan. This investment is a direct, muscular intervention to reverse that trend. This clause acts as a poison pill to prevent a future sale of the manufacturing assets, ensuring that the taxpayer-funded fabs remain under American control. If successful, this model could be replicated, creating a portfolio of strategic national assets designed to secure America's supply chains and technological edge for generations. The U.S. government's investment in Intel is a watershed moment for American industrial policy. While 14-inch laptops are great for portability, the larger display on a 16-inch machine provides screen real estate that comes tantalizingly close to a desktop experience, dramatically improving productivity without being tethered to an external monitor. This week's standout product, the HP EliteBook 8 G1i series 16-inch, is a masterclass in this form factor, blending performance, security, and intelligent design into a compelling package for the modern professional. HP wisely offers two distinct flavors of this machine, allowing buyers to choose based on their core priorities. For those seeking maximum multi-threaded performance for demanding applications like data analysis or compiling code, the AMD Ryzen Pro-powered EliteBook 8 G1i is the clear winner, offering a raw power advantage. Conversely, if your organization is standardized on Intel's vPro platform for deep remote management and compliance, the Intel Core Ultra-equipped EliteBook 8 G1i is the purpose-built choice. HP's more robust thermal solution allows either the AMD or Intel chip to maintain peak performance longer, giving it a real, measurable advantage. It delivers crisp details and beautifully accurate colors, ideal for everything from spreadsheets to creative work, without the higher cost and potential longevity concerns of OLED technology. But what truly elevates this notebook into an “AI PC” is HP's software suite. Unlike the vague marketing from competitors, HP delivers tangible AI-powered features. HP Wolf Security uses machine learning for next-generation threat detection, while applications like AI-based noise reduction and automatic framing for the 5MP webcam create a superior collaboration experience. The sleek aluminum chassis is both durable and professional, and the battery life is solid enough to get you through a demanding workday.

Historically, making a thin phone meant trading the usual battery for one that's slimmer and less robust. And what good is a thin phone with poor battery life? The Whoop fitness trackers have had a silicon-carbon battery since 2021. So far, the technology's application has been split by form factor, with folding phones enjoying thinner designs and candy bar phones earning bigger battery capacities Apple is expected to debut the iPhone 17 Air this week, and it's rumored to be a mere 5.5 mm thick, making it the slimmest iPhone ever. The company may be using a silicon-carbon battery to ensure it can get close to or match the battery life you'd expect from a modern-day iPhone. But phone makers have been shedding millimeters like it's nobody's business, and 2025 has seen a blossoming of super-slim devices. This past spring, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S25 Edge, merely 5.8 mm. The even more recent Galaxy Z Fold7 is impressively 4.2 mm when unfolded, but Huawei's tri-folding phone, the Mate XT Ultimate, beats it at 3.6 mm unfolded. It's not the first time that phone makers have chased thinness as a feature. We've even seen thinner since: the Oppo R5 from 2014 was 4.85 mm. With the new thinness wars, only a select few of these companies are utilizing silicon-carbon batteries so far, like Huawei and Honor. But these tweaks weren't enough—the Edge's battery life is still lackluster. So what exactly is a silicon-carbon battery, and how could it impact the iPhone 17 Air? Silicon can store approximately 10 times the number of lithium ions by weight than graphite, according to Rick Luebbe. The graphite anode takes up a large amount of space in a typical lithium-ion battery—around 60 percent, Luebbe says, depending on the battery design. It's worth noting that a company like Group14 or Sila isn't actually making the battery; these silicon anodes are what is known as a drop-in product. The powdered silicon-carbon anode is sent to battery manufacturers like ATL, which produces batteries for smartphones and laptops. A company like ATL can simply replace its graphite powder with the silicon-carbon mixture without disruption. A phone maker can take one of two approaches. Manufacturers like Honor, OnePlus, and Nothing use silicon-carbon in their latest candy bar phones. These devices maintain their standard thickness for the most part and feature increased battery capacities. For example, the OnePlus 13 has a bigger 6,000-mAh battery and is thinner than its predecessor, but its 8.5 mm thickness is on par with most traditional phones. Rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air's battery capacity will sit around 2,900 mAh, a steep drop from prior iPhone models, especially at the 6.6-inch screen size. But the company is supposedly making up for it with power-saving tricks to make sure battery life remains similar to other iPhones, including Apple's more efficient C1 modem that debuted on the iPhone 16e earlier this year. Luebbe declined to comment on whether Group14's silicon-carbon composite is being used in the iPhone 17 Air's batteries; Sila Nanotechnologies and Enovix did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The problem with silicon batteries is that they expand. When you lithiate raw silicon, Luebbe says it can expand up to three times its initial volume. Lithium-ion batteries also swell; you've probably heard of or maybe even experienced this, as it can happen for a myriad of reasons. It means something has gone wrong, and the battery is now a safety risk. It starts to get a bit technical here—and each silicon anode company has its own proprietary process—but Luebbe says Group14's approach is to start with a porous carbon material. “Imagine a carbon sponge, but the pores of that sponge are on the single-digit molecule wide, we're talking less than 10 nanometers wide,” he says. These pores are filled with silane gas (the silicon), but only about halfway. The particle you're left with is made up of silicon, carbon, and void space. He says while silicon is here to stay as a material to be used in lithium-ion batteries, there are still a few challenges for broader adoption, namely cost. Companies like Group14 use silane gas instead of solid silicon, which yields better battery performance, but could be 10 times the cost. That could make it harder to sell their composite to battery makers, and it could drive up the prices of consumer electronics. The iPhone 17 Air is rumored to cost around $1,099, a potential $200 bump from the iPhone 16 Plus it's expected to replace, though there could be other factors affecting its price, like tariffs. Chevrier also says he often sees silicon-carbon makers inflate the energy density claims. Group14, for example, says on its website that its silicon batteries can deliver up to 50 percent more energy density than conventional lithium-ion batteries. But if the material is just dropped in to replace graphite and not much else is changed with the battery, you're more likely going to see a 10 percent boost in energy density with a switch to a silicon-carbon anode. Silicon-carbon batteries also have worse cycle life than graphite. That's how many full charge to discharge cycles (zero to 100 percent) a battery goes through before its capacity degrades below 80 percent. In terms of the energy efficiency of silicon—how much of the energy put in the battery ends up as heat and how much is stored as energy—Chevrier says “more energy is lost to heat than graphite.” Graphite could have the potential to achieve 5,000 charge cycles, whereas Group14's composite sits at 1,000 cycles, or about 3 years, depending on how often you fully charge the phone. However, Chevrier points out that current batteries with graphite anodes do not hit 5,000 charge cycles because companies like Apple cram higher energy density, which stresses the battery but keeps the phone operating throughout the day. iPhone 16 batteries can retain 80 percent of their capacity at 1,000 charge cycles. The growing list of artificial intelligence features running locally on phones is increasing, and they'll happily sip up more power if they can get it. That means you may not enjoy longer battery life even if a device maker stuffs in a silicon-carbon anode and expands battery capacity. In the case of the iPhone 17 Air, Apple is taking the space-saving advantage of silicon-carbon anodes and experimenting with a thin and lightweight design to see if consumers will bite, without resorting to a smaller screen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every year, we recognize extraordinary young researchers on our Innovators Under 35 list. Recent honorees told us how they're faring under the new administration. This story is part of MIT Technology Review's "America Undone” series, examining how the foundations of US success in science and innovation are currently under threat. Every year MIT Technology Review celebrates accomplished young scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors from around the world in our Innovators Under 35 list. The US government is the largest source of research funding at US colleges and universities, and many of our honorees are new professors and current or recent graduate or PhD students, while others work with government-funded entities in other ways. Meanwhile, about 16% of those in US graduate programs are international students. We sent surveys to the six most recent cohorts, which include 210 people. We asked people about both positive and negative impacts of the administration's new policies and invited them to tell us more in an optional interview. Thirty-seven completed our survey, and we spoke with 14 of them in follow-up calls. Twenty-six people told us that their work has been affected by the Trump administration's changes; only one of them described those effects as “mostly positive.” The other 25 reported primarily negative effects. These shifts have left many respondents deeply concerned about the “long-term implications in IP generation, new scientists, and spinout companies in the US,” as one respondent put it. Ultimately, many are worried that all the lost opportunities will result in less innovation overall—and caution that it will take time to grasp the full impact. “We're not going to feel it right now, but in like two to three years from now, you will feel it,” said one entrepreneur with a PhD who started his company directly from his area of study. “There are just going to be fewer people that should have been inventing things.” The administration has also cut or threatened to cut funding from a growing number of universities, including Harvard, Columbia, Brown, and UCLA, for supposedly not doing enough to combat antisemitism. Since it was terminated earlier this year, she's been spending less time in the lab and more on fundraising. One AI researcher who studies climate-related issues is concerned that her multiyear grant may not be renewed, even though renewal would have been “fairly standard” in the past. Two individuals lamented the cancellation of 24 awards in May by the DOE's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, including grants for carbon capture projects and a clean cement plant. Climate research and technologies have been a favorite target of the Trump administration: The recently passed tax and spending bill put stricter timelines in place that make it harder for wind and solar installations to qualify for tax credits via the Inflation Reduction Act. Already, at least 35 major commercial climate-tech projects have been canceled or downsized this year. In response to a detailed list of questions, a DOE spokesperson said, “Secretary [Chris] Wright and President Trump have made it clear that unleashing American scientific innovation is a top priority.” They pointed to “robust investments in science” in the president's proposed budget and the spending bill and cited special areas of focus “to maintain America's global competitiveness,” including nuclear fusion, high-performance computing, quantum computing, and AI. The DOE, DOD, and NSF all soon proposed similar caps. This collective action has sparked lawsuits, and indirect costs remain in limbo. Looking ahead, an academic at a public university in Texas, where the money granted for indirect costs funds student salaries, said he plans to hire fewer students for his own lab. “It's very sad that I cannot promise [positions] at this point because of this,” he told us, adding that the cap could also affect the competitiveness of public universities in Texas, since schools elsewhere may fund their student researchers differently. Still, he acknowledged colleagues working on different projects don't feel as optimistic: “Folks are definitely feeling the pressure.” Many who are affected by cuts or delays are now looking for new funding sources in a bid to become less reliant on the federal government. However, the amount of private funding available can't begin to make up the difference in federal funds lost, and investors often focus more on low-risk, short-term applications than on open scientific questions. The NSF declined a request for comment from MIT Technology Review. Nine people who responded to our survey said their work is already being affected by these taxes imposed on goods imported into the US. For some scientists, this has meant higher operating costs for their labs: An AI researcher said tariffs are making computational equipment more expensive, while the Texas academic said the cost of buying microscopes from a German firm had gone up by thousands of dollars since he first budgeted for them. One cleantech entrepreneur saw a positive impact on his business as more US companies reevaluated their supply chains and sought to incorporate more domestic suppliers. “Everybody is proactive on tariffs and we're one of these solutions—we're made in America,” he said. Another person, who works for a European firm, is factoring potential tariffs into decisions about where to open new production facilities. What's more, financial backers have encouraged her company to stay rooted abroad because of the potential impact of tariffs for US-based facilities: “People who invest worldwide—they are saying it's reassuring for them right now to consider investing in Europe,” she said. Many have changed how they describe their work in order to better align with the administration's priorities—fearing funding cuts, job terminations, immigration action, and other potential retaliation. This is particularly true for those who work at universities. The Trump administration has reached deals with some institutions, including Columbia and Brown, that would restore part of the funding it slashed—but only after the universities agreed to pay hefty fines and abide by terms that, critics say, hand over an unprecedented level of oversight to administration officials. Some respondents had received guidance on what they could or couldn't say from program managers at their funding agencies or their universities or investors; others had not received any official guidance but made personal decisions on what to say and share publicly based on recent news of grant cancellations. Both on and off campus, there is substantial pressure on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which have been hit particularly hard as the administration seeks to eliminate what it called “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” in one of the first executive orders of President Trump's second term. One respondent, whose work focuses on fighting child sexual abuse materials, recalled rewriting a grant abstract “3x to remove words banned” by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, an administration ally; back in February, Cruz identified 3,400 NSF grants as “woke DEI” research advancing “neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda.” (His list includes grants to research self-driving cars and solar eclipses. His office did not respond to a request for comment.) Many other researchers we spoke with are also taking steps to avoid being put in the DEI bucket. One biologist described hearing that grant applications for the NIH now have to avoid words like “cell type diversity” for “DEI reasons”—no matter that “cell type diversity" is, she said, a common and “neutral” scientific term in microbiology. (In its statement, the NIH said: “To be clear, no scientific terms are banned, and commonly used terms like ‘cell type diversity' are fully acceptable in applications and research proposals.”) Plenty of other research has also gotten caught up in the storm. One person who works in climate technology said that she now talks about “critical minerals,” “sovereignty,” and “energy independence” or “dominance” rather than “climate” or “industrial decarbonization.” (Trump's Energy Department has boosted investment in critical minerals, pledging nearly $1 billion to support related projects.) One survey respondent described the language shift as “definitely more red-themed.” And one biomedical researcher fears that the administration's effective ban on DEI will force an end to outreach “favoring any one community” and hurt efforts to improve the representation of women and people of color in clinical trials. The NIH and the Food and Drug Administration had been working for years to address the historic underrepresentation of these groups through approaches including specific funding opportunities to address health disparities; many of these efforts have recently been cut. “As an academic, we have to be very careful about how we voice our personal opinion because it will impact the entire university if there is retaliation,” one engineering professor told us. “I don't want to be a target,” said one cleantech entrepreneur, who worries not only about reprisals from the current administration but also about potential blowback from Democrats if he cooperates with it. “I'm just trying not to get fined by the EPA.” Some people we spoke with feel vulnerable, particularly those who are immigrants themselves. The Trump administration has revoked 6,000 international student visas (causing federal judges to intervene in some cases) and threatened to “aggressively” revoke the visas of Chinese students in particular. In recent months, the Justice Department has prioritized efforts to denaturalize certain citizens, while similar efforts to revoke green cards granted decades ago were shut down by court order. One entrepreneur who holds a green card told us, “I find myself definitely being more cognizant of what I'm saying in public and certainly try to stay away from anything political as a result of what's going on, not just in science but in the rest of the administration's policies.” On top of all this, federal immigration raids and other enforcement actions—authorities have turned away foreign academics upon arrival to the US and detained others with valid academic visas, sometimes because of their support for Palestine—have created a broad climate of fear. Four respondents said they were worried about their own immigration status, while 16 expressed concerns about their ability to attract or retain talent, including international students. More than a million international students studied in the US last year, with nearly half of those enrolling in graduate programs, according to the Institute of International Education. “The adversarial attitude against immigrants, especially those from politically sensitive countries, is posing a brain drain,” an AI researcher at a large public university on the West Coast told us. This attack on immigration in the US can be compounded by state-level restrictions. Texas and Florida both restrict international collaborations with and recruitment of scientists from countries including China, even though researchers told us that international collaborations could help mitigate the impacts of decreased domestic funding. “I cannot collaborate at this point because there's too many restrictions and Texas also can limit us from visiting some countries,” the Texas academic said. All this is leading to more interest in positions outside the United States. One entrepreneur, whose business is multinational, said that their company has received a much higher share of applications from US-based candidates to openings in Europe than it did a year ago, despite the lower salaries offered there. Another said that she was looking for positions in other countries, despite her current job security and “very good” salary. So even as the number of international students dwindles, there may also be “shortages in domestic grad students,” one mechanical engineer at a public university said, and “research will fall behind.” Have more information on this story or a tip for something else that we should report? Using a non-work device, reach the reporter on Signal at eileenguo.15 or tips@technologyreview.com. In the end, this will affect not just academic research but also private-sector innovation. One biomedical entrepreneur told us that academic collaborators frequently help his company generate lots of ideas: “We hope that some of them will pan out and become very compelling areas for us to invest in.” Particularly for small startups without large research budgets, having fewer academics to work with will mean that “we just invest less, we just have fewer options to innovate,” he said. And a biotech entrepreneur pointed out that US-based scientists can still command more resources than those in most other countries. “I think the US still has so much going for it. “For me, I've always been like, the American dream is something real,” said one. Elon Musk's satellite internet service has been absolutely critical to the country's defense.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After growing up without reliable power at home, Iwnetim Abate is working to develop a steady supply of sustainable energy. Iwnetim Abate is one of MIT Technology Review's 2025 Innovators Under 35. So, for several days each week when they were without power, Abate would finish his homework by candlelight. Today, Abate, 32, is an assistant professor at MIT in the department of materials science and engineering. Part of his research focuses on sodium-ion batteries, which could be cheaper than the lithium-based ones that typically power electric vehicles and grid installations. He's also pursuing a new research path, examining how to harness the heat and pressure under the Earth's surface to make ammonia, a chemical used in fertilizer and as a green fuel. Growing up without the ubiquitous access to electricity that many people take for granted shaped the way Abate thinks about energy issues, he says. One of his chores was preparing cow dung to burn as fuel—the key is strategically placing holes to ensure proper drying, he says. Can the vast and sparsely populated African country translate its renewable power potential into national development? But actually getting there proved to be a challenge. Abate applied to US colleges for three years before he was granted admission to Concordia College Moorhead, a small liberal arts college, with a partial scholarship. He received countless rejections but didn't let that phase him. When Abate finally made it to the Minnesota college, he walked into a room in his dorm building and the lights turned on automatically. He reached out to Sossina Haile, then at the California Institute of Technology, to ask about a summer research position. Haile, now at Northwestern University, recalls thinking that Abate was particularly eager. “No obstacle was going to stand in his way,” she says. Abate spent the summer working on materials for use in solid oxide fuel cells. He returned for the following summer, then held a string of positions in energy-materials research, including at IBM and Los Alamos National Lab, before completing his graduate degree at Stanford and postdoctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley. He joined the MIT faculty in 2023 and set out to build a research group of his own. Today, there are two major focuses of his lab. One is sodium-ion batteries, which are a popular alternative to the lithium-based cells used in EVs and grid storage installations. Sodium-ion batteries don't require the kinds of critical minerals lithium-ion batteries do, which can be both expensive and tied up by geopolitics. One major stumbling block for sodium-ion batteries is their energy density. It's possible to improve energy density by operating at higher voltages, but some of the materials used tend to degrade quickly at high voltages. That limits the total energy density of the battery, so it's a problem for applications like electric vehicles, where a low energy density would restrict range. In January, his team published research describing a process to make ammonia underground, using naturally-occurring heat and pressure to drive the necessary chemical reactions. Once you get over the ick factor, new technologies are efficiently transforming human waste into agricultural solutions. Today, making ammonia generates between 1% and 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Abate cofounded a company called Addis Energy to commercialize the research, alongside MIT serial entrepreneur Yet-Ming Chiang and a pair of oil industry experts. (Addis means “new” in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.) When he's not tied up in research or the new startup, Abate runs programs for African students. In 2017, he cofounded an organization called Scifro, which runs summer school programs in Ethiopia and plans to expand to other countries, including Rwanda. The programs focus on providing mentorship and educating students about energy and medical devices, which is the specialty of his cofounder. While Abate holds a position at one of the world's most prestigious universities and serves as chief science officer of a buzzy startup, he's quick to give credit to those around him. Abate often thinks about his friends, family, and former neighbors in Ethiopia as he works on new energy solutions. “Of course, science is beautiful, and we want to make an impact,” he says. “Being good at what you do is important, but ultimately, it's about people.” The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators. The country is installing solar, building EVs, and investing across energy at a rapid clip. Discover special offers, top stories, upcoming events, and more.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. When it comes to cutting out annoying outside noise, there is no brand in history that has denatured more decibels than Bose. The pioneers of noise-canceling haven't been without challengers in recent years, including Sony, Apple, and others, but Bose has maintained the crown for generation after generation. Perhaps no product showcases this iterative talent more than its latest earbuds, the QuietComfort Ultra 2. There wasn't anything wrong with the first pair. I liked their ergonomic fit, excellent noise reduction, and bold low end, not to mention their excellent microphones, angled toward your mouth in an homage to Apple's popular AirPods Pro. With the new QC Ultra 2, we get wireless charging, more customizable sound, better immersive audio, and improved noise reduction. As far as I'm concerned, if you're a business traveler or someone who wants a compact pair of headphones that truly removes the sound of the world around you, these are—once again—the best you can buy. I find it very hard to fault Bose for its rubber-stamped design approach; the previous pair were very comfortable and functioned extremely well. You now get wireless charging in the clamshell case and a guard to prevent earwax buildup, and you can toggle the included touch controls in the app, which is very helpful when doing activities where you might brush your ear. Bose has even opted for the same drivers in this new generation of buds, with slight tuning adjustments that I'll get into in a bit. If you're new to the world of wireless earbuds or are coming from a more basic pair, the amount of customization that you can do with Bose's latest buds can feel daunting. You can choose various “modern traditional” adjustments like EQ and noise canceling/transparency modes, but the buds also allow you to dial in two kinds of immersive 3D upscaling (one for staying in place, one for while you move around), among other wild and fantastical new settings that take advantage of modern processors and machine learning tech. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. One other favorite was the Aware mode, which lets you hear the outside world but with loud spikes in sound smoothed out; great for folks who get jumpy at loud noises. The new buds may not get new drivers, but improved processing and adjustments to tuning make them stand out as immersive and excellent when listening with noise canceling on or off (or any of the myriad in-between settings Bose offers). They don't overcompress content like some modern earbuds can—they don't make quiet sounds too loud, they're good enough to reveal them at the right volume. The subtle count-in on Charlotte Cornfield's cover of “You Can Have It All,” for example, sneaks in at an appropriate whisper just before a round kick-drum punch and the wide guitars, keyboards, bongos, and cymbal swells of the song take over. I recently discovered Chicago cosmic country band Tobacco City and have been really enjoying the way songs like “Autumn” mix guitars. There aren't a pair of buds that reveal the wide stereo acoustic and electric guitars as well as the QC Ultra 2. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This type of detail is best when noise canceling is engaged, but they remain pretty well balanced with ambient sound piped in, or with noise canceling disengaged entirely, which speaks highly of Bose's commitment to consistency across extremely varied listening conditions. You can barely hear even tough-to-tame high frequencies like keyboard clicks or the high-pitched overtones of a Weedwacker, and HVAC sounds and other low-frequency noises all but disappear completely. Add that to the other features and excellent sound quality, and I found the QC Ultra 2s to basically be perfect everyday buds. The only reason I'd choose the Sony model over these is if I had smaller ears or wanted a slightly smaller charging case. As far as cutting noise, the QC Ultra 2 act as the perfect foil to my toddler's enthusiastic background screams while I'm working on a draft, and they also let me listen for her and her mom when they pull in from day care. On calls, they're as good or better than the last pair, with mics that pick up my voice but seem to magically reject unwanted background noise like some kind of anti-HVAC Gandalf. I am sure it will have its fair share of faulty products in the future—frankly, I hope that it remains bold enough to do so. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.
