Bartels and his colleague Michael Bannert wanted to explore how different colours are represented in parts of the brain associated with vision, and how consistent this is across different people. The pair used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activity in the brains of a group of participants while they viewed different colours. This allowed them to create a map of brain activity that showed how each hue was represented neurologically. They then trained a machine learning model called a linear classifier on this data, and used it to predict which colours were being viewed by members of a second group of study participants, on the basis of their brain activity.

Nature Climate Change volume 15, pages 963–970 (2025)Cite this article Extreme heat may affect added sugar consumption through the increased intake of drinks and frozen desserts, but such an impact is rarely quantified. Here, using individual transaction-level data for US households in 2004–2019, we find that added sugar consumption is positively related to temperature, notably within 12–30 °C at a rate of 0.70 g °C−1. This is primarily driven by the higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and frozen desserts. The magnitude of such impact is larger among households with lower income or educational levels. Our projections indicate a substantial nationwide increase in added sugar consumption of 2.99 g per day by 2095 (or equivalently 5 °C warming level), with vulnerable groups at an even higher risk. Our results highlight the critical need to mitigate health risks from the over-intake of added sugar and to explore dietary adaptation to climate change. Climate affects food consumption and nutrition through multiple pathways. Extreme weather events can disrupt transportation and distribution networks, threatening food security10. Climate-related factors, such as changes in carbon dioxide levels, can lower the nutritional quality of crops4. Despite the large body of literature on the supply side, few studies have evaluated how climate affects dietary demand. Hot weather may increase the need for hydration as higher metabolism increases water loss11,12. High temperatures often drive individuals to consume chilled items such as frozen beverages and desserts13. As a result, climate change could exacerbate excessive added sugar consumption with critical health consequences, especially in countries and regions accustomed to consuming food and drinks with an intensive sugar content. The socio-economic heterogeneity of climate impacts on the demand side calls for further exploration. Differences in sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, food choices and nutritional quality across socio-economic groups have been well documented, particularly in the USA and other high-income countries14,15,16. Lower income, lower educational attainment and certain ethnic groups are associated with a lower intake of nutrients and poorer dietary quality, mediated by socio-economic characteristics such as dietary knowledge, food affordability and accessibility, cultural norms and the food environment. How climate change interacts with socio-economic inequality to affect nutritional quality has been examined, although predominantly on undernutrition issues in developing countries, such as sufficient food supply and affordability17. A more nuanced examination of the moderating effect of socio-economic drivers is required for developing targeted interventions and policies aimed at promoting healthier dietary habits and reducing disparities in added sugar consumption across different population groups. Excessive consumption of added sugar has substantially increased the risk of obesity, various metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other health complications18. Individuals aged 2 years and above consumed over 70 g (17 teaspoons) per day in 2017–2018, far surpassing the dietary guidelines of less than 10% of daily calories from added sugars, equivalent to about 60 g on a 2,400 calorie diet19. The American Heart Association recommends even lower limits of 24 g for women and 36 g for men20. In this study, we examine the impact of weather conditions on added sugar consumption in the USA during 2004–2019. Using household-level food purchase scanner data, we quantitatively estimate how meteorological factors affect added sugar consumption and investigate the sources of added sugar from various food groups. We further explore the socio-economic and geographical heterogeneity of the effect based on a rich set of consumer characteristics nationwide. Finally, future added sugar intakes are projected in climate scenarios to provide policy implications for food and nutrition interventions. We first examined how monthly average temperature affects averaged daily added sugar consumption per person, adjusted to the calorie requirement of an adult male to exclude the effect of physical differences due to age and sex (Methods). Added sugar consumption increases with temperature (Fig. 1a), mildly below 10 °C and 12 °C (approximately 0.09 grams per degree celsius per capita-day), then steeply between 12 °C and 30 °C (approximately 0.70 grams per degree celsius per capita-day), before plateauing or even declining beyond 30 °C, which should be interpreted with caution as only 0.8% of observations go beyond 30 °C (Fig. The results are similar for unconverted, actual consumption (Fig. Wind speed shows a significant negative impact (−1.14 g m−1 s), precipitation has a positive impact (+0.06 g mm−1) and relative humidity has negligible impact (Supplementary Table 3). a, The total effect of temperature on added food consumption. Food groups were identified using the WWEIA food categories (Methods and Supplementary Table 1), which provide an application to analyse foods and beverages as consumed in the American diet based on the FNDDS. The statistics are from two-sided t-tests based on regression analysis, and complete results are presented in Supplementary Tables 3 and 9. The monthly average temperature may even out the possible impacts of extreme heat. We used the daily mean temperature to calculate the number of days within specific intervals per month for robustness checks (Supplementary Table 8), in 2 °C increments with separate categories for extreme cold (<0 °C) and extreme heat (>30 °C). The results confirm increasing added sugar consumption with rising temperatures, with the effect intensifying as temperatures increase. While the impact remains relatively modest and less statistically significant in lower temperature ranges (0–20 °C), a marked escalation in consumption occurs when temperatures exceed 20 °C, peaking in the 24–30 °C range. Notably, positive effects persist even above 30 °C. We also adopted a 5 °C interval classification (Supplementary Table 8). A 5 °C interval classification yields similar trends but with slightly weaker coefficients at high temperatures. These results imply that the potential impacts of extreme heat may be obscured, reinforcing the value of granular temperature stratification. We further examined the temperature effects by breaking down the added sugar into different food groups (Fig. Sweetened beverages emerge as the main driver, with consumption rising sharply between 12 °C and 30 °C (added sugar, 0.73 g °C−1). The consumption of frozen desserts increases much slower (0.06 g °C−1). Sugar from bakery goods, oils and raw sugars slightly decreases, suggesting a potential substitution towards more chilled, hydrating items. Above 30 °C, consumption growth from beverage slows, but declines from bakery goods, oils and sugars persist, explaining the downwards trend in total added sugar intake at higher temperatures (Fig. These effect probably stem from physiological and psychological demand for fluids and refrigerated products in warmer weather, or weather-based promotion strategies. To disentangle these factors, we controlled the average price per 100 g of the major food groups (Supplementary Table 10). Prices of sugar-added beverages and bakery goods negatively affect added sugar consumption, whereas price increases in added sugar-free drinks such as 100% juice (distinguished from the ‘fruit drinks' as the former does not contain added sugar while the latter belongs to the subcategory of SSBs), milk and diet beverages significantly increase the consumption of added sugar, indicating a possible substitution effect. However, price volatility was low (s.d. ~0.02) and temperature effects remained stable, indicating that this increase is more likely attributed to physiological and psychological factors. Still, temperature change does facilitate promotion, as the product price drops in hotter days (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. We also tested for heterogeneous responses using segmented linear regression to identify vulnerable groups (Methods). Compared with the binned approach, segmented regression reduces the number of parameters in a model, thereby allowing for more robust estimates when breaking down data further by ethnic or socio-economic groups. Added sugar consumption is less responsive to temperature among higher educational levels and higher income groups (Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Table 14), with those earnings >US$100,000 or holding post-college education showing near indifference. The effects are consistent across male and female heads (Methods). Variations across ethnic groups are substantial: most ethnic groups exhibit similar positive marginal effects within the temperature range of 12–30 °C, whereas the Asian group shows a nonsignificant reaction. a,b, The effect of temperature by education level for households with a male head (a) and female head (b). c,d, The effect of temperature by income (c) and ethnic group (d). e,f, The effect of temperature by work environment for households with a male head (e) and female head (f). We divided the household income into five income groups according to the data collection methodologies of Nielsen Company (annual income <US$24,999 (very low), US$25,000–49,999 (low), US$50,000–69,999 (medium), US$70,000–$99,999 (high) and >$100,000 (very high)) and categorized the work environment based on the occupation of male/female heads into indoor and outdoor settings. The statistics are from two-sided t-tests based on regression analysis and the complete results are presented in Supplementary Tables 14 and 15. The analysis is based on a total sample size of n = 6,908,936. The limited responsiveness of high socio-economic status groups to weather changes may stem from experience of different micro-environmental temperatures, particularly at workplaces. Stratification by working environment (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Table 15) shows significant differences for male heads but only minor differences for female heads. Correlation analysis also reveals a stronger income–education link among male heads (Supplementary Fig. The higher income and/or higher education groups may also opt for healthier food and drink choices out of health concerns, reflected in their lower added sugar consumption (Supplementary Table 3), although they demonstrate a larger increase in juice, which is not necessarily healthy due to the free-sugar content (Supplementary Tables 19 and 20). Moreover, they are less responsive to product promotion in hot weather as their purchase prices remain steadier across categories (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 13), probably leading them to select lower-sugar beverages for hydration. Since sugar-added beverages are the major contributors to the increased added sugar consumption, we examined how different beverages respond to temperature (Fig. While plain water and SSB consumption rose markedly, shifts in other drinks were modest (100% juice and alcoholic beverages) to negligible (others). Higher socio-economic status showed smaller responses across all drink types regardless of whether they are healthy or not (Supplementary Fig. 9), possibly due to a higher consumption of tap water, which lowers purchase needs, though only differences in sugar-added beverages and plain water are not statistically significant (Supplementary Tables 21 and 22). a, The effect of temperature on sugar-added beverage consumption for the whole sample. b, The heterogeneous effect of temperature on sugar-added beverage consumption by education level in households with a male head (i), education level in households with a female head (ii), income (iii), ethnic group (iv), work environment in households with a male head (v) and work environment in households with female head (vi). c, The heterogeneous effect of plain water consumption by education level in households with a male head (i), education level in households with a female head (ii), income (iii), ethnic group (iv), work environment in households with a male head (v) and work environment in households with female head (vi). The statistics are from two-sided t-tests based on regression analysis and complete results are presented in Supplementary Tables 19–21. Household income was categorized as defined in Fig. Climate background may also affect behavioural responses. Residents in historically hotter areas may be acclimatized and less reactive to temperature rises, as seen in other behaviours such as air conditioner purchasing21. Analysis by climate zones classified by the US Department of Energy Building America Program22 indicates minimal response in the Hot–Humid Climate Zone in the southeast coastal area but largest responses come from the Marine Climate Zone in the northwest coastal area (Extended Data Fig. Nevertheless, the differences are not statistically significant. Drinking habits may also play a role, with heavier drinkers of SSBs being more responsive as found in the previous studies23,24. Our examination shows that the heavier drinkers (SSBs ≥150 g with added sugar consumption ≥45 g, above the recommendations of 36 g added sugar for male adults20, with statistics indicating that US adults consumed 145 kcal day−1 from sugary drinks in 2011–2014 from the USA25) do have a significantly larger response compared with other groups (Supplementary Table 18 and Supplementary Fig. We projected added sugar consumption changes using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations from 25 models under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-85 (SSP5-8.5) scenario. As we found no significant difference in the effect of temperature across regions with distinct background climate, either in terms of cooling degree days (CDDs) (Supplementary Table 17 and Supplementary Fig. 7) or climate zones (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 16), we used the nationwide segmented linear regression model (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4) to void small-sample bias above 30 °C. Based on an overall temperature increase of 5 °C from 2019 to 2095 and other changes in meteorological data, we project a daily added sugar consumption of 2.99 (1.40–4.62) grams per person per day on average by the end of this century. Hence, the increased added sugar consumption from seasonality is primarily due to different sensitivity associated with distinct baseline seasonal temperatures (3.3 °C on average in winter, but between 12 °C and 30 °C in other seasons; Supplementary Table 23). 4b), probably due to temperature increase and sensitivity of added sugar intake. Despite the higher temperatures in southern counties, summer temperatures frequently exceed 30 °C (Supplementary Fig. 10) with climate change, resulting in a slower growth in the annual average added sugar consumption growth compared with northern states. b, The projected added sugar consumption of counties in 2095. c, The projected added sugar consumption of heterogeneous groups in 2095 by education level in households with a male head (i), education level in households with a female head (ii), income (iii), ethnic group (iv), work environment in households with a male head (v) and work environment in households with female head (vi). The distribution in a shows the temperature distribution for 2019 and 2095 for all climate models, with an average temperature increase of approximately 5 °C. The annual line and shaded area in a and the dots and vertical lines in c show the annual mean and the lowest and highest predictions of the n = 25 models in 2095, respectively. Household income was categorized as defined in Fig. The socio-economic breakdown show the highest increase is up to 6.2 (3.9–9.3) grams per person per day for households that have a male head with a graduate school education. The increase reaches 3.5 (2.3–4.8) grams per person per day and 4.9 (2.4–7.2) grams per person per day for households that have a female head without a high school degree or household income less than US$25,000, respectively. The change in consumption is about 3.4 g for white people and exceeds 2.6 g for black people and other races, while the change in consumption of the Asian group is not significant (Fig. We also project added sugar consumption changes using 16 models under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, which represents some intervention in human activities and results in a temperature rise of about 2.3 °C in 2095 relative to 2019. The results based on the degree of climate change under this scenario are about half of those under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (Supplementary Fig. This study explores the impact of weather on added sugar consumption in the USA from 2004 to 2019 using household-level food purchase scanner data. We find that added sugar consumption increases with temperature, especially between 12 °C and 30 °C, which slows down above 30 °C, possibly due to physiological responses such as appetite suppression. The increase is mainly driven by SSBs such as soda and juice, and frozen desserts such as ice creams and gelato. Lower-income and lower-education groups exhibit stronger responses, indicating heightened vulnerability. Projections show that future climate change will aggravate health risks related to added sugar intake, particularly for socio-economically disadvantaged populations whose average daily intake already exceeds 10% of the recommendations from the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans26 and almost 20% of the recommendations from the American Heart Association20. Our analysis provides empirical evidence on the impacts of weather conditions on added sugar consumption for cost-effectiveness analyses of sugar reduction programmes and policies under climate change. The results also highlight the urgent need to tackle nutrition and health inequalities exacerbated by climate change, identifying key populations for targeted interventions. Considering fine-tuned food policy in adapting to climate change, our analysis provides implications for achieving several Sustainable Development Goals, including No Hunger, Good Health and Well-being, Climate Action and Reduced Inequality. As the over-intake of added sugar and climate-related risks have both become pressing global concerns27,28, our analysis informs food policy and climate change adaptation strategies, not only in the USA but also in other countries with increasing nutritional and health challenges. Several limitations should be noted. The Nielsen data cover retail purchases but exclude restaurant meals and food received without purchase. Nevertheless, our main results still hold unless weather significantly affects the added sugar consumed via different channels. Moreover, our analysis reflects household-level purchases rather than individual intakes as data on post-purchase food storage, food waste and intra-household food allocation are not available. This discrepancy may be more pronounced for bulk-purchased or long shelf-life items (for example, granulated sugar and coffee/tea), raising potential issues if high-sugar items in such categories are stored for extended periods rather than consumed within a month and/or if temperature changes influence the allocation of sugar between presweetened products and sugar added manually (for example, blending the granulated sugar with coffee and tea). However, these effects are probably minimal as SSBs, as the main driver, are typically consumed immediately rather than stored for long time, and both granulated sugar and coffee/tea show relatively low sensitivity to temperature variation. Shifts in intake or waste ratios at higher temperatures are probably secondary as well. Furthermore, nutritional content is approximated by linking product labels with the USDA food content table. While the match considered the labelling information of products with low sugar or no sugar available in the Nielsen dataset, some mismatches may still exist as the variety of food products consumed in the real market can be different from that available from food content tables. In this way, the dependent variable may incur a random measurement error, which does not introduce bias but can lead to larger standard deviations of estimates. This leads to only minimal impacts on our findings as the significance of the regression analysis remains robust in various tests. The Nielsen data remains as the only dataset, to our knowledge, with high temporal resolution that allows us to capture the fluctuation of food consumption along with weather changes. Nevertheless, trackable intake records at the individual level should be addressed in future data infrastructure construction for more accurate estimates for the USA, as well as for other countries and regions. These findings underscore the urgent public health implications of climate-induced dietary changes, especially for low socio-economic groups and particularly during warmer temperatures. The USA needs to further strengthen its policies aimed at reducing the intake of added sugars, especially from SSBs, in the context of climate change. While SSB taxation has been effective in reducing purchases in certain US cities and around the world29,30, the nationwide implementation of such taxes could face crucial challenges and delays. Additionally, proposals to modify the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to encourage the purchase of healthier items face considerable debate and are slow to implement31. Continuous nutritional education programmes and nutrition warning labels on SSBs32 should also be considered and prioritized moving forwards. As consumers become increasingly health conscious, there is a potential for the industry to respond by reformulating products to reduce the sugar content in beverages. Our findings also provide important implications for public health in the context of climate change adaptation. The results demonstrate potential adverse health impacts associated with weather-induced shifts in dietary behaviours, emphasizing the need for potential policy interventions for added sugar intake in the context of climate change. This is particularly crucial in minimizing the additional disease burden and mitigating escalating medical costs for conditions attributed to excessive sugar consumption. Moreover, our research stresses the importance of targeting disadvantaged groups in interventions under climate change who exhibit a more substantial response to temperature-induced changes, potentially due to less mindful choices or constrained options with budget limitations33,34 and less control of the occupational/living environmental temperature. Our results and policy implications offer insights not only for the USA. Given that the USA encompasses a diverse range of climate types found across many countries and regions, the conclusions of our study have broad applicability and relevance on a global scale. Therefore, these findings apply both to other developed countries and to nations in the global south27, such as Brazil35, South Africa36 and Mexico37,38, owing to changes in the food environment and increased purchase power that raises the accessibility and affordability of added sugar39. While progressive public health measures, such as soda taxes and front-of-pack labelling, have been implemented in some countries in both the global north and global south, dietary challenges persist due to the learning process of policy intervention lagging behind the rapid changes faced by consumers40. In developed countries where regulations have been put in place, sugar intakes have only begun to decline in recent years and it remains at high levels causing considerable health challenges41,42. Additionally, climate-related factors pose shared challenges: rising global temperatures are expected to exacerbate health risks, particularly for populations in both developed and developing nations with a high proportion of individuals working in nonclimate-controlled settings. Together, these factors intensify the health risks associated with dietary shifts driven by climate change27. Future research could add more on-the-ground evidence of how weather and climate affect the physical and psychological demand for food in various geographical and socio-economic backgrounds to address the urgency for strategies for safeguarding nutrition and health. The dataset tracks the product purchase records from 40,000–60,000 US households, with sample sizes varying by year. The same households are tracked for multiple years before replacement and thus constitute a longitudinal panel. The food items cover all retail outlets across the USA except Alaska and Hawaii, though consumption data at restaurants are not included. The panel is nationally representative with a sampling weight applied. Although the purchased foods can be stored rather than consumed in a short period, this issue is partially relieved in our analysis since (1) we focus on monthly food consumption, (2) most products with high added sugar content such as sweetened beverage are typically consumed within a short period following purchase, unlike items that are often stored for extended durations before use such as flour and (3) even for the items that are likely to be stored such as sugar, our analysis provides conservative estimates (in which the purchase of sugar is less immediately responsive to changes in the temperature). We focus on all the food items to retrieve the consumption of added sugar for each household. Unfortunately, the nutrition facts are not directly available from the Nielsen dataset, and a direct search to obtain these nutrition facts using the product name is not feasible as only the abbreviation of the name is available other than the 716 product modules, which describe the nature of the products (sweetened beverage, cake, ice cream and so on) and special characteristics (low sugar, zero sugar and so on) in the Nielsen dataset. Therefore, we match the products with the items in the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS)43, which is updated every 2 years and describes the amounts of nutrients/food components in the most common foods and beverages consumed by Americans. We conducted multiple rounds of manual matching with the description of more than 6,000 food items in the FNDDS, after which a manual check was conducted to randomly sample the Nielsen products and inspect their matchings to ensure that the matches best reflect the nutrition facts of the products. For some food ingredients that are not included in FNDDS, such as cake flour and beverage powders, we used the Food Patterns Equivalents Ingredients Database (FPID) to complete the matching, which is an equivalent ingredient database developed based on multi-ingredient foods in FNDDS. To demonstrate the response by product categories, we used the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) categories, which provide a concise division of food items with nutritional implications and are directly available for every food item in FNDDS. A full relation between Nielsen products and WWEIA categories is available in Supplementary Table 1. Note that such method can only quantify the added sugar consumption rather than the actual intake, the limitation of which is examined in ‘Discussion' section. The ground-station level meteorological records are from Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD)44, which provides daily meteorological records, including atmospheric temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity and so on. We matched each household with all the climate stations within a 100 km buffer of the county where it is located, similar to previous research21. The spatial distributions of the stations and the counties in which data are available are shown in Supplementary Fig. The specification was constructed as where \({y}_{{irt}}\) is the indicator related to added sugar consumption per capita per day in household i in month r of year \(t\). Particularly, unpleasant weather would lower the shopping frequencies since people tend to avoid outdoor travelling45. As a result, regression at the trip level may show a smaller correlation between high temperatures and added sugar consumption, potentially leading to an underestimation issue. \(f\left({\mathrm{temp}}_{{irt}}\right)\) is a response function of temperature, describing how each household reacts to a particular temperature level in consuming added sugar and other food and nutrient components. The vector \({\bf{W}}_{{irt}}\) contains other meteorological variables including precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity and its squared terms. \({\bf{H}}_{{irt}}\) is the vector of household characteristics including the household income, household size, educational level and age of male and female head, presence and age of children, marital status and ethnic group. Among them, the original income is a categorical variable representing nominal annual income ranges. It is converted to a continuous variable by assigning mid-point values, simplifying high-income categories to 150,000, adjusting for inflation (2010 as base year) and standardizing by dividing by 10,000 to reflect real purchasing power in 10,000 units for regression analysis (Supplementary Table 2). Notably, the Nielsen survey employed a stratified sampling design to ensure sample representativeness, balancing nine key household characteristics including household income, which was categorized into six distinct levels for stratification purposes. Based on this framework, we combine two adjacent middle-income tiers (US$25,000–34,999 and US$35,000–49,999) to create a five-category structure for subsequent heterogeneity analysis, as illustrated in Fig. We also include fixed effects for household (\({\alpha }_{i}\)), the interaction between month of year and climate zone (\({\gamma }_{{rc}}\)) and the interaction between year and climate zone (\({\lambda }_{{tc}}\)). The classification of climate zones are classified by the US Department of Energy Building America Program in determining the standards of building construction22. This classification provides a concise way in separating the background climate. Multiple indicators related to added sugar consumption are examined as \({y}_{{irt}}\). We first adopted the actual per-capita added sugar consumption, which distorts the discrepancy between the age–gender distribution of average energy requirements and that of sugar consumption thresholds. We thus converted the per-capita consumption to adult male equivalents to allow for better standardization and comparison of consumption across different age and gender groups46. Since the Nielsen data provide consumption data for the entire household rather than each member, we standardized sugar consumption using the total energy requirement ratio between all the true household members and the adult equivalent members. Here, we first defined adult males as men aged 18–29 years, and for infants under 1 year old, we calculated them as 11 months. We then calculated the conversion ratio using the average energy requirement (AER) for energy of a specific age and gender with physical activity level values of 1.6 (replaced with 1.4 when children aged 1–3 years) provided by European Food Safety Authority using the following equation: The adult male equivalent per-capita consumption of added sugar can then be adjusted by dividing the actual per-capita added sugar consumption by this conversion ratio. Multiple forms of \(f\left({\mathrm{temp}}_{{irt}}\right)\) are included in our analysis. We ran the binned model for the main results with \(f\left({\mathrm{temp}}_{{irt}}\right)={\sum }_{j}{\beta }_{1j}{\mathrm{temp}}_{{ijrt}}\), in which \({\beta }_{1j}{\mathrm{temp}}_{{ijrt}}\) are a set of bins indicating whether the monthly average temperature falls into a specific interval. We set 2 °C for each interval to allow a high resolution in detecting the possible nonlinear effect of temperature. The results show that all the outcome variables are monotonically increasing with temperature (Fig. We also conducted robustness checks, replacing \({\sum }_{j}{\beta }_{1j}{\mathrm{temp}}_{{ijrt}}\) by the CDDs and heating degree days (HDDs) aggregated to the monthly level (Supplementary Table 5). These two measures are used to estimate energy demand for heating or cooling buildings as a proxy of how much the atmosphere temperature is beyond the thermal comfort of human being. The CDD is calculated when the outdoor temperature exceeds a base temperature (for example, 18 °C or 65 °F), indicating a need for cooling, while the HDD is calculated when the temperature falls below the base, indicating a need for heating. In addition, we completed a robustness check using interactions of education (male head and female head) with month and year as fixed effects in the model and find that there is no critical change in the results (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). We also reran the regression analysis including food price as a control to explore whether the weather fluctuation covariates with price changes. To include food category prices in the regression analysis and eliminate the impact of price changes, we calculated the monthly average price of each food category based on the purchase data of each household trip. To exclude outlier influence, we remove the top 5% of all purchase prices, and then averaged the monthly average price of each food category in each county according to the county where the household was located. We also checked the results by removing the top and bottom 5% price outliers (the low price is probably due to the discount and redeem of vouchers, but can also be due to misrecording, and the regression results do not change, as shown in Supplementary Table 10). However, some counties may have missing prices because no households purchased them. We first tried to replace them with the annual average price of the same county. We evaluated multicollinearity in the price model using variance inflation factor tests. The results show that, except for relative humidity and its squared term, all other variables had adjusted generalized variance inflation factor values within acceptable thresholds (<2), indicating no severe multicollinearity issues in the model (Supplementary Table 11). We then conducted a spline regression, which exhibits higher sensitivity to changes in the independent variables compared with the binned model but provides more flexibility in capturing the potential nonlinearities of temperature compared with the CDD and HDD method. Based on the results of the binned model, the spline model divides the temperature range into three segments: 0–12 °C, 12–30 °C and above 30 °C, which allows us to better capture the growth rate of added sugars in different temperature ranges. The spline model also provides a smaller number of temperature variables to facilitate the tests on heterogeneous effects that require interaction terms between temperature indicators and the socio-economic characteristics of the households, which could otherwise involve too many regressors in the binned model. Note that we do not use the interaction above 30 °C in the heterogeneity analysis due to the insufficient number of observations so that the slope is same for all groups in this temperature interval. Meteorological variables for projected climates are from the CMIP6. Here, we used monthly surface temperature (tas), rainfall (pr), wind (sfcWind) and relative humidity (hurs) from the r1i1p1f1 run of SSP5-8.5 (2015–2100) experiments from 25 models (ACCESS-CM2, ACCESS-ESM1-5, AWI-CM-1-1-MR, CanESM5, CanESM5-1, CAS-ESM2-0, CESM2-WACCM, CMCC-CM2-SR5, CMCC-ESM2, EC-Earth3, EC-Earth3-CC, EC-Earth3-Veg, EC-Earth3-Veg-LR, FGOALS-f3-L, FGOALS-g3, FIO-ESM-2-0, INM-CM4-8, INM-CM5-0, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC6, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, MRI-ESM2-0, NorESM2-LM and NorESM2-MM). We subsampled model outputs at the grid box in each county with the 100 km buffers for spatial join. Although other SSP scenarios are available, we used the highest emission scenario (SSP5-8.5) to test the widest possible warming range, and results are also reported as a function of the global warming level47. When a county covers more than one grid box, we used the averaged value. To account for possible model biases in climatology, we calculated anomalies relative to simulated 2015–2023 monthly climatology and added observed climatology over the same time interval48. Bias-corrected simulations were further averaged using a 9-yr running smoother to dampen interannual variability. The projection of added sugar consumption was then calculated using equation (1). Multimodel mean results are shown in Fig. 4, and descriptive statistics for individual models are listed in Supplementary Table 24.

(2025)Cite this article The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is Earth's most abundant photosynthetic organism and crucial to oceanic ecosystems. However, its sensitivity to a changing climate remains unclear. Here we analysed decade-long field measurements using continuous-flow cytometry from our SeaFlow instrument, collecting per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence and size data for ~800 billion phytoplankton cells across the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean to quantify the temperature dependence of cell division. Prochlorococcus division rates appear primarily determined by temperature, increasing exponentially to 28 °C, then sharply declining. Regional surface water temperatures may exceed this range by the end of the century under both moderate and high warming scenarios. Under these future conditions, our global ocean ecosystem model suggests a possible 17–51% reduction in Prochlorococcus production in tropical oceans. Even with the inclusion of hypothetical warm-adapted strains, models show significant production declines in the warmest regions, suggesting that thermal adaptation may not prevent negative impacts. These results highlight the potential vulnerability of Prochlorococcus-dependent marine ecosystems to future warming. You have full access to this article via your institution. Global warming is pushing sea surface temperatures and ocean stratifications to record levels1, with predictions that by 2100, much of the tropical and subtropical surface oceans will regularly exceed 30 °C (ref. Such changes in ocean conditions threaten marine ecosystems, potentially leading to the extinction of key species due to profound and complex impacts on the competition and distribution of organisms3. Microscopic, unicellular phytoplankton are fundamental to the function of marine ecosystems as their photosynthesis generates the organic carbon consumed by other organisms. However, as future oceans warm and become more stratified and circulation patterns change, the flow of deep-water nutrients essential for phytoplankton growth may decrease4,5, potentially favouring smaller phytoplankton species that are more efficient at nutrient uptake6,7. This shift towards communities dominated by small phytoplankton is expected to alter carbon cycling within ecosystems as their rapid turnover and slow sinking rates may lead to increased nutrient cycling in surface waters6, less efficient transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels and reduced sinking of organic carbon to the deep ocean8. And yet, our understanding of how small phytoplankton will respond to future ocean temperatures remains largely based on laboratory studies using model organisms9,10, which cannot recapitulate the complexity of interactions and genetic diversity found in natural populations. Here we document the in situ thermal sensitivity of natural populations of the keystone cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, revealing a decrease in division rate at high temperatures. Our numerical simulations predict that rising temperatures will decrease Prochlorococcus biomass production in future oceans, potentially triggering cascading effects throughout open ocean food webs. The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the smallest (0.5–1 µm) and most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. It inhabits over 75% of the world's sunlit surface oceans, thriving in the nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical waters where it contributes nearly half of the phytoplankton biomass11. Due to its small size and ability to genetically adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions12, Prochlorococcus is predicted to reach even greater dominance in future warmer oceans owing to its potential range expansion towards the poles and an increased relative abundance under the low-nutrient conditions predicted for more stratified oceans13,14. The extent to which these predictions based on laboratory experiments reflect the true thermal sensitivity of Prochlorococcus in diverse, more complex communities remains uncertain, partly owing to the limited availability of cell division rate estimates for natural populations, a challenge compounded by the difficulties of conducting non-disruptive measurements at sea15. Over the past decade, we have deployed our continuous-flow cytometer, SeaFlow16, on 90 research cruises, to collect per-cell fluorescence and light scatter data—optical measurements that reveal cell type and cell size, respectively—for approximately 800 billion phytoplankton cells less than 5 μm in size, including Prochlorococcus (Methods), across 200,000 km of surface ocean17. We generated 180 cell division rate estimates for Prochlorococcus populations using hourly binned size distributions in a size-structured matrix population model18, a mathematical approach that tracks how cell size distributions change over time as cells grow and divide (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 and Methods). These estimates are derived from changes in the relative cell size distribution rather than cell abundance, which avoids the confounding effects of mortality agents such as grazing. The model uses Bayesian inference and retains only estimates with strong model fit and convergence, excluding those with abrupt changes in size distributions that can arise when sampling across different water masses containing Prochlorococcus populations with distinct cell sizes. This non-disruptive approach requires no manipulations or incubations, providing in situ division rates comparable to estimates from dilution experiments and cell cycle analysis19,20,21,22. To broaden the spatial coverage of Prochlorococcus's distribution range, we complemented our data with publicly available data from cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 and dilution experiments that estimate Prochlorococcus division rates from shipboard incubations24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 (n = 114; Extended Data Fig. a, Geographic distribution of daily division rates derived from the matrix population model (n = 180 independent samples), along with publicly available data from dilution experiments24,26,27,28,29,30,31 (n = 103 independent samples) and cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 (n = 11 independent samples). The vertical bars represent methodological uncertainties associated with the matrix population model and cell cycle analysis; uncertainty estimates were not reported for dilution experiments. The inset map shows sampling locations coloured by methodology. b–e, Relationships between division rates and environmental variables: daily average seawater temperature (°C) (b), daily average photosynthetically active radiation (light, µmol E m−2 s−1) (c) and phosphate (d) and nitrate (e) concentrations (nmol l−1). Temperature and light were directly measured in situ for all methodologies. Nutrient data sources varied by methodology: for the matrix population model, 21 out of 180 measurements came from direct observations and 159 out of 180 came from the Mercator-PISCES biogeochemical model; for cell cycle and dilution experiments, 65 out of 114 included measured nutrient data while the remainder was omitted from the plot. Statistical relationships were assessed using ordinary least squares regression with two-sided tests (α = 0.01). The black line in b shows a second-order polynomial regression fit (P = 5.746 × 10−9), while the black lines in c–e show linear regression fits to the respective environmental factors. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were applied. Our results reveal high variability in the division rates of Prochlorococcus across latitudes, highlighting the complex interactions of temperature, nutrient and light availability on its growth (Fig. 1a) and motivating evaluation of the individual effects of each of these parameters. We observed a notable nonlinear relationship between division rate and temperature (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2), with an initial increase in division rate followed by a decline at high temperatures, a pattern consistent across multiple cruises, locations and methodologies. A second-order polynomial regression fit to the data reveals a significant positive linear term (1.58 ± 0.28, P < 0.001), supporting the previously observed increase of division rate with temperature20, but also a significant negative quadratic term (−0.85 ± 0.28, P = 0.003). Light intensity and nutrient concentrations showed less pronounced effects within the observed ranges, with non-significant terms in their regressions (Fig. Across all environmental conditions, in situ division rates of Prochlorococcus never exceeded 1.6 d−1, equivalent to a population doubling time of about 10.5 h, with the highest values observed in tropical Atlantic24 and Indian Oceans23. Given the apparent impact of temperature on Prochlorococcus division rates, we analysed the maximum division rates (top 80%) across various sea surface temperatures for each method (that is, the matrix population model, dilution experiments and cell cycle analysis) (Fig. This approach minimized potential confounding effects of the methodology and environmental conditions to better determine the upper limit of the division rate at a given temperature (Extended Data Fig. The analysis revealed that maximum division rates increased exponentially with rising temperature up to an in situ threshold of approximately 28 °C. Above this temperature, maximum division rates declined sharply, with a nearly threefold reduction by 31 °C, comparable to rates observed at ~19 °C. This decline appeared primarily driven by temperature (generalized additive model: P < 0.001; generalized linear model: P < 0.004), while the effects of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were not statistically significant within the observed ranges (Extended Data Fig. Importantly, we have not observed the high division rates predicted by exponential thermal curves (>2.5 d−1 at 30 °C; solid line in Fig. 2a) even in warmer regions such as the Indian Ocean, where nutrient conditions are more favourable (Extended Data Fig. 2), further supporting our findings of thermal limits in Prochlorococcus communities. Although environmental factors interact in complex ways and are difficult to disentangle in natural phytoplankton communities, the field-observed patterns mirrored the thermal responses of 13 Prochlorococcus culture isolates grown with sufficient light and nutrient-replete conditions37,38,39 (Fig. We should note that only 2 of these 13 isolates originated from regions where annual mean sea surface temperatures exceed 28 °C, indicating that our culture collection does not fully represent Prochlorococcus from the warmest waters (Extended Data Fig. Similarly, most of our field measurements come from cooler subtropical waters rather than warmer tropical regions, so we might be missing important data on Prochlorococcus that live in the hottest parts of the ocean. Despite this geographical sampling bias, culture isolates often show broader temperature tolerances than their isolation environment would suggest40. The slightly lower division rates in cultures compared with natural populations further highlight the challenge of extrapolating laboratory findings to natural communities, as culture conditions cannot fully replicate the complex interactions with other marine microorganisms that influence Prochlorococcus growth in its natural environment. Notwithstanding these inherent limitations in both field sampling coverage of the warmest ocean regions and laboratory culture representation, the remarkable consistency between laboratory cultures and field observations across different methodologies and ocean regions indicates that Prochlorococcus growth rates probably do not increase exponentially beyond a temperature threshold of approximately 28 °C (solid line in Fig. a, Maximum division rate (top 80%, d−1) of field populations, estimated from the matrix population model (n = 100 independent samples, blue circles) and from data compilations of dilution experiments24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 (n = 45 independent samples, orange circles), cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 (n = 9 independent samples, red circles) and culture isolates37,38,39 (n = 94 independent samples, white squares) grown under nutrient-replete conditions, plotted as a function of daily average seawater temperature (°C). The solid and dashed lines represent the 99th quantile regression fits using a standard exponential curve and a metabolic theory approach, respectively. Shading around the dashed line indicates the standard deviation of 1,000 bootstrap replicates. b, Cell abundance (106 cells l−1) as a function of temperature, where points represent the median values of the top 80% of abundance measurements observed at each temperature bin. Data combine hourly binned SeaFlow measurements and compiled datasets14,23,43, with colour coding representing the number of observations at each temperature. The red boxes highlight the observed detrimental effects of warm temperatures on the organism (>28 °C). The inset maps show the geographical distribution of sample locations, with samples collected in water above 28 °C indicated in red. The thermal sensitivity observed in natural populations of Prochlorococcus can be captured using a metabolic reaction function (dashed line in Fig. 2a), which incorporates the thermal sensitivity of enzyme kinetics, directly linking temperature changes to changes in metabolic rates10. This unimodal thermal response better captures Prochlorococcus temperature dependence than the traditional exponential curve approach (mean squared error of 0.11 and 0.79, respectively) that uses a Q10 temperature coefficient—a measure of how much growth rate changes with a 10 °C increase (solid line in Fig. However, this Q10 function fits better for Synechococcus, the second smallest phytoplankton, across many ecotypes (Extended Data Fig. The Q10 formulation also fits better for species groups within other taxa (for example, diatoms, coccolithophores)41,42. By contrast, the exponential curve predicts unrealistically high maximum division rates for Prochlorococcus above 28 °C (solid line in Fig. 2a), overlooking its actual thermal sensitivity. Building upon these observations, we investigated the relationship between slower division rates at higher temperatures and population abundances by combining our hourly average Prochlorococcus cell abundance data (n = 12,814) with those from compiled datasets14,23,43 (n = 5,386). We identified three distinct thermal responses: below 19 °C, Prochlorococcus abundance maxima (top 80%) increased exponentially with temperature; between 19 °C and 28 °C, abundance maxima leveled off despite exponentially increasing division rates, suggesting a proportional increase in mortality rates (Fig. 2a); and above 28 °C, maximum abundances began declining, with cell abundances reduced about twofold by 30 °C (Fig. Synechococcus abundances did not show a similar decline at high temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 5), maintaining populations in waters above 28 °C where Prochlorococcus abundances decrease. This differential response provides additional evidence against nutrient limitation as the primary driver of decline. If nutrient limitation at high temperatures were responsible, we would expect Synechococcus, with larger cell sizes and higher nutrient requirements, to be more severely affected than Prochlorococcus. This contrasting pattern supports our findings that direct temperature stress, rather than nutrient limitation, is the dominant factor causing the observed decline in both Prochlorococcus division rates and abundance at the warmest ocean regions. We explored how our findings might affect future ocean ecosystems by integrating the observed Prochlorococcus thermal sensitivity into a comprehensive three-dimensional numerical ecosystem model within a global circulation framework42. The model simulates the distribution and fitness of many functional groups, including heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophs, mixotrophs and zooplankton types, linking physiological traits to biogeochemical function and cell size through size-dependent power laws (Supplementary Fig. Changes in population biomass are based on growth, grazing, mortality, sinking, and ocean fluid dynamics and mixing effects44. For all functional groups except Prochlorococcus, we incorporated exponential thermal response curves (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4) for both growth and grazing rates. This Q10 parameterization aligns with previous studies for all other autotroph functional groups, including Synechococcus45,46 (Extended Data Fig. However, for Prochlorococcus specifically, we implemented the metabolic thermal response curve from our data, with decreased division rates above 28 °C (dashed line in Fig. To project future impacts, we compared a baseline ocean derived from pre-industrial conditions (1860; Methods) with end-of-century conditions under two different climate scenarios (Supplementary Table 5). The first scenario projects stabilized greenhouse gas concentrations at ~650 ppm CO2 equivalent by 2100 (similar to the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 4.5), while the second assumes high emissions leading to CO2 equivalent concentrations of ~1,370 ppm by the end of the century (similar to RCP 8.5). These scenarios result in a 1.9 °C and 3.8 °C increase in average sea surface temperatures and a nearly 6% and 9% reduction in nutrient supply in the sunlit surface waters, respectively (Extended Data Fig. Our model incorporating Prochlorococcus's upper thermal limit predicts a substantial decrease in both depth-integrated biomass (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b,g,i and Extended Data Fig. 8) in the tropical regions where future surface temperatures are projected to exceed 28 °C for much of the year (Extended Data Fig. By 2090–2100, Prochlorococcus production in tropical regions will decline between 17% and 51% depending on whether moderate or high warming scenarios unfold (Supplementary Table 6). Regions such as the Western Pacific Warm Pool face particularly severe impacts, with our model predicting a near-complete collapse of Prochlorococcus populations (Fig. Thermal stress, not decreased nutrient supply, drives this decline (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 6), supporting our observations (Fig. Despite habitat expansion into warmer, higher latitudes, global Prochlorococcus production will decline by 10–37% depending on the climate scenario (Supplementary Table 6). These substantial changes exceed the interannual variability in model projections by an order of magnitude (Methods and Supplementary Table 6) and will occur even under a moderate warming scenario, highlighting the potential threat to these foundational organisms. These projections contrast sharply with simulations relying on the more typically used exponential thermal response curve (solid line in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4), which instead forecasts moderate increases in annual Prochlorococcus production (18–30% under different scenarios) (Fig. 3a,b,h, j, Extended Data Fig. a–f, Latitudinal change (%) in depth-integrated biomass production for Prochlorococcus (a,b), Synechococcus (c,d) and all other phytoplankton (e,f) using either a standard exponential curve (grey) or a metabolic reaction approach (red) that relates the Prochlorococcus division rate to temperature, with shading representing longitudinal variation from the mean (s.d.). g–r, The corresponding maps illustrate the percentage change in depth-integrated annual biomass production for Prochlorococcus (g–j), Synechococcus (k–n) and all other phytoplankton (o–r) projected under the two thermal norm assumptions and two climate scenarios. The white areas in d–i indicate that the phytoplankton type does not exist in those regions either pre-industrially or by the end of the century. Values of 100% increase indicate an expansion in the geographical range. As Prochlorococcus declines owing to the unimodal nature of its thermal norm, our model projects a compensatory increase from Synechococcus, seen in both increased biomass (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d,k,m). This compensation appears the strongest in tropical regions, where Prochlorococcus decline is most severe, resulting in an 11–34% increase in mean depth-integrated annual Synechococcus production across climate scenarios (Supplementary Table 6). Notably, this pattern of Synechococcus thriving in the very regions where Prochlorococcus populations collapse, such as in the Western Pacific Warm Pool, further supports that temperature stress, not nutrient limitation, is the primary driver of Prochlorococcus decline. As warming enables range expansion towards the poles, global Synechococcus production increases by 5–20% depending on the climate scenario (Fig. 3c,d,k,m and Supplementary Table 6). Larger phytoplankton, primarily picoeukaryotes, show modest changes with production decreasing 4–7% (Fig. 3e,f,o,q and Supplementary Table 6). These results contrast sharply with projections assuming exponential Prochlorococcus temperature response, with a 15–26% decrease in Synechococcus production and a 6–11% decrease for larger phytoplankton across climate scenarios (Fig. 3c–f,l,n,p,r and Supplementary Table 6). We created an in silico warm-adapted strain with an increased thermal tolerance to evaluate the potential impacts of Prochlorococcus populations adapted to warmer temperatures that were not included in the current metabolic response model. We reasoned that these warm-adapted populations could come to dominate future oceans either because they currently exist within regions not covered in our current dataset or because they emerge over time through adaptation or mutation and selection in response to continued warming ocean conditions. We retained the metabolic response function for these warm-adapted strains, increasing the optimal temperature from 28 °C to 30 °C and the maximum division rates from 1.3 d−1 to 1.6 d−1 (Supplementary Fig. 4), a temperature shift comparable to that observed for Synechococcus following long-term thermal tolerance experiments47. Given that nutrient limitation has been shown to lower optimal temperature and reduce division rates in diverse species of phytoplankton, including cyanobacteria48, this thermal shift represents a reasonable upper bound on thermal adaption in Prochlorococcus. At the global scale, replacement of the observed thermal sensitivity (Fig. 2a) with the enhanced thermal adaptation into our global ecosystem model partially mitigates the negative impacts on Prochlorococcus production (Fig. 3), resulting in a projected 6% increase under moderate warming and a 7% decrease under high warming in global Prochlorococcus production (Fig. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. Under the high warming scenario, Synechococcus production increased by only 2% when competing with warm-adapted Prochlorococcus strains (Fig. 4c,d) and the larger phytoplankton groups showed moderate production decreases (7–9%) under the same conditions (Fig. Enhanced temperature adaptation proved effective in maintaining Prochlorococcus populations in tropical regions where temperatures remained below the warm-adapted strain's temperature threshold. However, even with increased thermal tolerance, significant production declines still occurred in the warmest tropical regions under the high warming scenario (15%; Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 6), suggesting that thermal adaptation may delay but not prevent the negative impacts of ocean warming on Prochlorococcus. a–f, Latitudinal change (%) in depth-integrated biomass production for Prochlorococcus (a,b), Synechococcus (c,d) and all other phytoplankton (e,f) comparing the standard metabolic reaction model (blue) with a warm-adapted variant (red) for Prochlorococcus. The lines represent the mean across longitudes, and shading indicates longitudinal variation (±s.d.). Both projections use the same future climate scenario (2090–2100) and pre-industrial baseline (1860) as Fig. The thermal sensitivity observed in natural populations of Prochlorococcus suggests fundamental physiological constraints that distinguish it from larger phytoplankton. Our findings show that Prochlorococcus division rates increase exponentially with temperature up to approximately 28 °C, then decline sharply at higher temperatures. This thermal response differs markedly from that of Synechococcus and other phytoplankton groups, whose growth rates continue to increase at temperatures where Prochlorococcus begins to decline. This differential thermal sensitivity probably reflects distinct evolutionary histories and habitat adaptations. Prochlorococcus evolved in relatively stable tropical and subtropical environments where temperature fluctuations are minimal, potentially favouring resource efficiency over thermal versatility. Unlike coastal and high-latitude phytoplankton that experience substantial temperature variations and maintain broader thermal tolerances, Prochlorococcus shows specific vulnerabilities at high temperatures. At 30 °C, Prochlorococcus isolates from warm regions such as the Sargasso Sea and Red Sea show suppressed photosystem gene expression49 and disrupted circadian regulation50, both critical for carbon fixation. By contrast, Synechococcus thrives at high temperatures, probably owing to proteomic adaptation that helps them minimize oxidative stress51 and resource reallocation strategies that maintain growth as temperature increases52. These physiological differences stem from divergent evolutionary trajectories: Prochlorococcus underwent genome streamlining, shedding many stress-response genes to minimize resource requirements while optimizing performance within a narrower environmental range. Synechococcus, however, maintains a more complex cellular machinery that, although costlier to maintain, provides greater resilience across variable conditions, including high temperatures. This evolutionary trade-off explains why Prochlorococcus, despite its dominance in stable nutrient-poor regions, may be more vulnerable to warming than Synechococcus. These evolutionary trade-offs raise the critical question of whether Prochlorococcus can overcome its thermal limits in the near future. Despite its remarkable genetic diversity across ecotypes12, the streamlined genome that enabled Prochlorococcus to dominate nutrient-poor waters may now limit its capacity to adapt to rapid warming, as evidenced by its reduced abundance in the warmest ocean region (Fig. Our model incorporating a hypothetical warm-adapted strain (with a 2 °C increase in thermal optimum) shows that adaptive evolution could partially buffer Prochlorococcus populations against warming impacts. However, even with this adaptation, significant declines are still projected in tropical regions, highlighting the limitations of evolutionary rescue when faced with rapid environmental change. For approximately 150 Myr, Prochlorococcus has evolved to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, minimizing cell and genome sizes to reduce resource requirements, the very genomic streamlining that may now constrain its thermal adaptability. While Prochlorococcus probably persisted through past extreme climate events, such as the Early Eocene Climate Optimum when tropical seawater temperatures reached 35 °C (ref. 53), it probably did so by shifting polewards to cooler waters, a strategy that our ecosystem simulation also predicts for future warming (Fig. Whether beneficial mutations could sweep through global populations within the timeframe of projected warming remains uncertain, especially given the unprecedented rate of anthropogenic warming and potential fitness trade-offs associated with thermal adaptation. While our analysis provides evidence for thermal limits in Prochlorococcus, we must acknowledge several methodological limitations that complement the evolutionary considerations discussed above. Our field observations capture integrated responses of mixed communities rather than individual ecotypes, potentially masking the performance of rare, heat-tolerant variants. Strains with higher thermal tolerance may exist but remain uncommon owing to environmental trade-offs. Our sampling also presents geographic limitations. Laboratory studies disproportionately represent easily cultured ecotypes, with those from the warmest tropical regions remaining underrepresented (Extended Data Fig. Similarly, while our field measurements spanned various ocean regions, many consistently high-temperature tropical areas remain unexplored. Despite these sampling limitations, our observations across the tropical Pacific consistently show reduced division rates at temperatures above 28 °C. The consistency of this pattern across diverse natural communities suggests a fundamental thermal limitation rather than an artefact of sampling bias. This thermal vulnerability demands serious consideration given Prochlorococcus's global significance. Prochlorococcus's thermal limitation potentially has profound implications beyond the species itself. The predicted decline of Prochlorococcus could trigger cascading effects throughout marine food webs, particularly given the lack of functional redundancy within the Prochlorococcus ecological niche54. While our model predicts some compensatory response from Synechococcus, the overall community shift would be substantial. As warming oceans favour larger phytoplankton expanding into the ecological niche currently occupied by Prochlorococcus (Fig. 3e,f,o,q and Extended Data Fig. 7), this fundamental shift at the base of the food web could alter the composition and abundance of grazers, impacting predators higher in the food chain55, including fish populations56. In addition, a reduction in Prochlorococcus populations may disrupt mutualistic relationships with other organisms such as SAR11 (ref. 57), the ocean's most abundant heterotrophic bacteria, potentially destabilizing the microbial community58 and altering carbon cycling59. Ultimately, a decline in Prochlorococcus production could have far-reaching consequences beyond a simple shift in species abundance, revealing the complex and interconnected nature of microbial communities. These findings underscore the importance of considering thermal constraints when projecting marine ecosystem responses to climate change, as our results suggest that Prochlorococcus, despite its ecological success and numerical dominance, may be sensitive to the temperature increases projected for tropical oceans in coming decades. We deployed the SeaFlow shipboard flow cytometer16 on 90 cruises from 2010 to 2023. The instrument continuously sampled seawater from the ship's underway intake, located at 3–8 m below the surface. Seawater was pumped through a 100-µm stainless steel mesh filter to prevent clogging of the 200-µm sampling nozzle. We continuously injected 1-µm yellow-green Fluoresbrite microspheres (Polysciences) into the flow stream for scattering and fluorescence signal normalization. Particle emission was detected using two position-sensitive detectors for optimal focus determination. We measured red fluorescence (692/40 nm bandpass filter), orange fluorescence (572/28 nm bandpass filter) and forward light scatter (457/50 nm bandpass filter). Data were stored in 3-min intervals, yielding a sampling resolution of approximately 1 km along the cruise track (based on a ship cruising at ~ 20 km h−1). Raw data were processed to identify in-focus optimally positioned particles within the SeaFlow virtual core17. Optimally positioned particle analysis was performed using the R package Popcycle (version 4.7.3) available on GitHub. We defined five sets of gates based on forward light scatter, red fluorescence and orange fluorescence to identify 1-µm beads, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and small eukaryotic phytoplankton (<5 µm). Gate coordinates for each file were saved and stored in a structured query language (SQL) database. The equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) of each cell was estimated from forward scatter using the Mie light scatter theory. We then converted the ESD to carbon quotas using volume-to-carbon relationships for small phytoplankton17. Prochlorococcus size distributions were obtained by combining data collected every 3 min over each 1-h period (n = 12,814 hourly binned data points) to ensure robust statistical representation of the particle size distribution, with each hourly bin typically containing measurements from more than 10,000 individual cells. Throughout our sampling campaigns, we validated SeaFlow cell abundance measurements against conventional flow cytometry (that is, BD Influx) for samples collected from both high- and low-temperature regions (n = 683; Supplementary Fig. These validation efforts showed a good agreement between methods for Prochlorococcus abundance measurements across the temperature range, showing that dim Prochlorococcus cells in nutrient-poor warm waters were sufficiently resolved by our instrumentation for the purpose of this study. SeaFlow data were complemented with underway sea surface temperature measurements from shipboard thermosalinographs. These measurements were either broadcast in real time over the ship's network or retrieved from the Rolling Deck to Repository. The temperature data recorded simultaneously with SeaFlow measurements are available along with the SeaFlow data on GitHub (https://github.com/seaflow-uw/seaflow-sfl/tree/master/curated). We complemented cell abundances derived from SeaFlow data with the Global Cyanobacteria dataset hosted on the Simons Collaborative Marine Atlas Project60 (CMAP) database (that is, the tblFlombaum table), which contains global observations of Prochlorococcus abundance collected from 103 cruises14. As this dataset contains satellite-derived sea surface temperature data, we selected only samples from the upper 10 m to ensure appropriate temperature matching and excluded all zero values and empty entries (n = 5,125). We also incorporated two additional cruises in the Indian Ocean23,43 (n = 261) which included temperature data from the shipboard thermosalinograph. For these additional Indian Ocean datasets, we included all depth measurements with available temperature data. We applied a size-structured matrix population model following the approach described in a previous study18, to estimate phytoplankton division rates. This category of model has shown its suitability for estimating in situ phytoplankton division rates for Prochlorococcus18,20, Synechocococus19,61 and mixed populations of small eukaryotic cells22,62 in a wide range of environmental conditions, from estuarine to coastal to open ocean environments, and validated using culture experiments18, cell cycle analysis20 and dilution experiments19. The latter indicates that the effects of size-specific mortality agents, if any, on the relative cell size distribution do not affect cell division estimation. The size-structured matrix population model mechanistically simulates the evolution of the size distribution over a day–night cycle. The model discretizes cell counts across size classes and time using the parameter Δv and time using the parameter Δt. It quantifies the rates of the three key biological processes (cell division, carbon fixation and carbon loss), which are represented by the parameter vector θ = (θδ, θγ, θρ, ω0). These parameters, along with a concentration parameter σ (which allows for overdispersion in the data), determine the dynamics of the model. Below is a breakdown of the modelled processes: Cell division (δ): Division rates are size dependent, reflecting the probability of cells transitioning to subsequent life-cycle stages. The model assumes a monotonically increasing division rate as a function of cell size. Carbon fixation (γ): Carbon fixation rates are determined by light availability (PAR measurements) and cellular carbon content. This captures diel cycle dynamics and phytoplankton growth rates. The model incorporates a power–law relationship between carbon fixation and cell size. Carbon loss (ρ): The model accounts for carbon loss through respiration and exudation, estimating rates separately for each size class. This reflects cell shrinkage due to metabolic processes other than division. Prochlorococcus size distribution was obtained by combining data collected every 3 min over each 1-h period. These distributions were then discretized into 30 size classes based on the log of their carbon quotas, ranging from 80 fgC to 260 fgC per cell. This range was selected to fully encompass the variation in Prochlorococcus cell size observed in the SeaFlow dataset. We chose the volume bins and a time step of 10 min to ensure that cells would probably undergo only a single transition at a time within the model. We used Bayesian inference, implemented through the Stan software package and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, to process the data. A total of 6 Hamiltonian Monte Carlo chains were run for 2,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations. This approach strikes a balance between computational efficiency and the complexity of our model. A list of model parameters and priors is available in Supplementary Table 1. We implemented rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability of our model estimates. Model convergence: Samples with poor model convergence (R-hat > 1.1) were excluded, as this indicated potential unreliability of model-derived estimates63. Sample adequacy: Samples with insufficient cell counts (total number of particles counted over 1 h <10,000) were excluded from analysis. Data completeness: We excluded datasets with large gaps in temporal coverage (>4 h). Data integrity: We excluded 24-h periods containing abrupt shifts in cell size distributions. As phytoplankton cells typically increase their size by no more than a factor of two during a complete day–night growth cycle (that is, cells divide when they reach a critical size), larger or sudden changes in mean population size strongly indicate that we were sampling different populations with inherently distinct cell size characteristics. We detected these shifts using a change point detection method specifically developed for environmental flow cytometry data64. While most of these shifts are usually filtered by our model convergence criteria, this additional step provided additional assurance that our estimates reflected genuine biological processes rather than sampling artefacts. Biological consistency: We examined the correlation between carbon fixation patterns estimated by the model and division rates. As carbon fixation during daylight hours drives cell growth, which subsequently enables division, samples showing weak or absent correlations between these processes were flagged for potential anomalies, as this might indicate that factors other than normal physiological processes were affecting the size distributions. Prochlorococcus division rates were complemented with dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations (nitrate plus nitrite and phosphate). For division rates obtained from the SeaFlow data, nutrient data were obtained mostly from Mercator-PISCES biogeochemical model forecasts (¼° resolution), with 21 out of 180 data points from in situ measurements collected during research cruises in which the SeaFlow instrument was deployed. The PISCES model is a widely used tool for simulating marine biological productivity and the biogeochemical cycles of key nutrients (carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen, silicon and iron) in the global ocean, and has been extensively validated against a wide range of available observations, including in nutrient-poor regions65,66. Both in situ observations and model estimates are hosted in the CMAP database60. The specific CMAP datasets for measured nutrient values were the following: and Mercator_Pisces_Biogeochemistry_Daily_Forecast_Nut for modelled data. We extended our SeaFlow-derived Prochlorococcus division rates with a data compilation of in situ dilution experiments24,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 and cell cycle analysis20,23,24,25 (Extended Data Fig. This dataset represents 114 estimates of Prochlorococcus division rates. For 65 out of 114 of these data points, measured environmental variables, including temperature, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, and PAR values, were provided directly within the compiled studies, based on field observations rather than model estimates or remote sensing data. These complementary datasets expand our geographic coverage beyond the North Pacific region where most SeaFlow deployments occurred, providing broader representation of different oceanic regimes. We incorporated publicly available data on Prochlorococcus division rates derived from 13 different isolates cultured under nutrient-replete conditions37,38,39 (Extended Data Fig. These isolates represent various ecotypes including both high-light- and low-light-adapted strains from different ocean regions. Of these 13 isolates, 2 originated from regions where annual mean sea surface temperatures exceed 28 °C, while others were isolated from cooler regions. This compiled dataset includes over 702 estimates of division rates under various temperature and light conditions. While isolate-based estimates are often lower than rates measured in situ, they provide valuable insights into physiological responses under controlled laboratory conditions and are used to test assumptions regarding how division rates respond to environmental variations. The change in the cell division rate (μ) with temperature was characterized with either an exponential function (Eppley equation), an exponential function with mortality (Eppley–Norberg equation) or a metabolic theory of ecology (Hinshelwood equation), as described previously67: where T represents the temperature and a represents the maximum division rates at T0 (typically 20 °C), b is the exponential change in division rate with increasing temperature, Tc corresponds to the maximum of the quadratic portion of the equation, w is the thermal niche width (that is, the range of temperatures over which the division rate is positive), R is the gas constant (8.315 J mol−1 K−1), A1 and A2 are related to entropy and E1 and E2 are related to enthalpy. To parametrize the coefficients, we fitted the 99th quantile regression to capture the division rate maxima at a given temperature. The 99th quantile is commonly used studying phytoplankton response to temperature, as it helps identify the upper limits of its thermal tolerance41,68. Parameters were estimated using a least squared approach and a differential evolution algorithm for optimization, using the Deoptim package in R69. The Hinshelwood and Eppley–Norberg approaches yielded similar curves (Supplementary Fig. Our goal was to evaluate whether the observed decline in division rates at higher temperatures was primarily driven by temperature or by other covarying factors. The data were binned by 0.25 °C intervals of seawater temperature, and we analysed the 80th percentile division rate across each bin. The 80th percentile was chosen over the 99th percentile to increase the sample size for statistical analysis while still focusing on the upper range of division rates. We used two complementary statistical models: A generalized linear model was constructed using the glm function in R, incorporating polynomial terms for temperature, PAR, nitrate and phosphate. This allowed us to capture potential nonlinear relationships between these factors and division rates within a linear framework. Before the model fitting, all environmental factors were rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one to facilitate the comparison of their relative importance on division rates. To assess the robustness of model results, we applied a bootstrapping technique with 1,000 replicates, generating standard deviations for the model coefficients. Model fit was assessed using standard diagnostic plots and summary statistics. A generalized additive model was constructed using the mgcv package in R, incorporating smooth terms (that is, estimated degree of freedom) for temperature, PAR, nitrogen (nitrate and nitrite) and phosphorus (phosphate) concentrations. A simulation-based test with 1,000 replicates indicated sufficient basis dimensions for all smooth terms, suggesting that the model adequately captured the complexity of the relationships. Model selection was performed using restricted maximum likelihood, and the basis dimension (k) was checked to ensure adequate model complexity. We used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) marine ecosystem model (Darwin), including the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron and oxygen through inorganic, organic detritus and 50 plankton types, modified from previous studies45,70. The model includes 31 phytoplankton types, analogues of the pico-cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, 2 sizes of green algae (picoeukaryotes), 5 sizes of coccolithophores, 5 diazotrophs, 9 diatoms and 8 mixotrophic dinoflagellates (Supplementary Fig. To represent the wide range of phytoplankton sizes, we defined 14 size classes ranging from 0.6 µm to 104 µm ESD, evenly distributed on a logarithmic scale. The model also captures trophic interactions through 3 size classes of heterotrophic bacteria (0.4 µm to 0.9 µm ESD) that remineralize the organic matter and 16 size classes of zooplankton (4.5 µm to 1,636 µm ESD) that graze on prey following a Holling type II function71. Phytoplankton growth parameters are allometrically defined with functional group specifics72. Growth rates are influenced by multiple potentially limiting nutrients (dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, iron and silicic acid) using Liebig's law of the minimum (growth limited by the scarcest resource) and parameterized with a Monod function (a mathematical relationship describing nutrient-limited growth). Nutrient half-saturation coefficients are allometrically assigned, favouring smaller phytoplankton with the highest nutrient affinity. Phytoplankton growth is also a function of spectral light and photoacclimation72,73 with functional groups showing distinct absorption patterns based on their specific pigment composition. Temperature affects all biological rates, including phytoplankton growth rates, zooplankton grazing rates and other loss rates. While these rates incorporate Q10-based temperature dependencies, whose uncertainties and impacts on projections have been assessed in previous studies42,45, our analysis shows that the choice of thermal response functions (that is, with or without thermal limits) represents a more significant source of uncertainty. This is particularly evident for Prochlorococcus, in which we evaluated two distinct thermal response curves: a conventional exponential function (solid blue curve; Supplementary Fig. 3) and a metabolic function incorporating thermal limits (dashed blue curve; Supplementary Fig. 3), both derived from in situ and laboratory studies (Fig. For Synechococcus, we use an exponential thermal response curve (black curve; Supplementary Fig. 3) derived from in situ dilution experiments27 and laboratory studies42. For all non-pico-cyanobacteria, we use exponential thermal growth functions (Supplementary Fig. 3 and parameters in Supplementary Table 4) derived from laboratory observations45. Our study integrates the biological and biogeochemical components of the Darwin ecosystem within an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM)74,75,76. The IGSM couples the MIT general circulation model77, a three-dimensional ocean circulation model at a coarse resolution configuration (2° by 2.5° horizontally, 22 vertical levels that range from 10 m at the surface to 500 m at depth)76, with a simplified representation of the atmospheric dynamics, physics and chemistry, terrestrial water, energy and biogeochemical processes78. The Darwin model is run in ‘offline' mode using physical ocean fields (for example, circulation, mixing, salinity and temperature) from representative members of an ensemble of IGSM simulations. The ocean component of the IGSM shows a realistic climatology and year-to-year variability (for example, El Niño-Southern Oscillation) with frequency, seasonality, magnitude and patterns in general agreement with observations75. As is typical with climate change studies, the IGSM performed a ‘control' simulation in which greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations were held constant at 1860 levels. This pre-industrial control shows interannual variability but lacks any long-term warming trends or circulation changes. In addition, the IGSM performed a transient simulation from 1860 to 2100 under observed pre-industrial changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations followed by two future greenhouse gas and aerosol emission scenarios, a moderate and high scenario similar to Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change RCP 4.5 and 8.5. These simulations have been previously described and evaluated in detail75. Following the approach in a previous study45, we conducted paired ecosystem model experiments (20 years each) to contrast pre-industrial and projected future ocean conditions (Extended Data Fig. This capitalized on the significant differences in ocean physics between the pre-industrial control run of the IGSM and its end-of-century moderate and high warming scenarios. We initialized each simulation with nutrient and detritus fields from previous transient simulations79, ensuring consistency with pre-industrial or future conditions. Plankton types were initialized at low abundances, and robust ecosystem structures were established within 3 years. Our results represent averages over the past 10 years of each simulation. This averaging mitigates the impact of interannual variability on the comparison between pre-industrial and future conditions. We perform a series of simulations varying both physical conditions and the thermal response function used for Prochlorococcus (Supplementary Table 4). We refer to simulations with constant 1860 greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations (control run) as ‘pre-industrial' and those based on projected end-of-century physical conditions as ‘2090–2100'. Simulations in which Prochlorococcus maximum division rates follow an exponential temperature function are termed ‘exponential', while those using a metabolic function with an upper thermal limit are termed ‘metabolic'. Our initial set of six simulations (two paired experiments; Supplementary Table 5) are the ones discussed in the main text: ‘exponential' pre-industrial, moderate and warming scenarios, and ‘metabolic' pre-industrial, moderate and high warming scenarios. Phytoplankton distributions and production in pre-industrial simulations align well with real-world observations (Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8), as shown in previous studies45,70. While the computational demands of this global three-dimensional ecosystem model preclude comprehensive parameter sensitivity analyses, we note that the projected changes between ‘pre-industrial' and future climate simulations exceed the model's interannual variability by an order of magnitude (Supplementary Table 6). This, combined with the model's demonstrated skill in reproducing present-day distributions, provides confidence in the robustness of our key findings. To isolate the direct impact of temperature change on Prochlorococcus, we conducted two additional simulations. In these experiment, we maintained pre-industrial circulation patterns and nutrient concentrations to control for changes in nutrient supply, while allowing biological rates (including Prochlorococcus growth rate) to respond to projected end-of-century warming for both climate scenarios (Supplementary Table 5). In the main text, we compare the results of the 2090–2100 simulations to their paired pre-industrial counterparts (Figs.

Temperature and nutrient supply to the sunlit layers of the ocean are two key environmental factors influencing phytoplankton division rates. a, c, e, g, i. Temperature (°C) in the upper 10 m for pre-industrial conditions (a) and the 10-year average from 2090-2100 under moderate (c) and high warming scenario (e), with a black contour indicating 28 °C, a critical temperature for Prochlorococcus. Change in temperature (°C) between these periods (positive = warming) (g, i). b, d, f, h, j. Physical supply rate of nitrate to the upper 50 m (mol N m−2 y−1) under pre-industrial conditions (b) and future scenarios (d, f). Change in supply rate between these periods (negative = decreasing supply rate in the future) (h, j). Nutrient supply rates include lateral and vertical advection and mixing (metabolic simulations). In the tropics and subtropics, macronutrient supply decreases due to increased stratification and circulation changes. In polar regions, reduced sea ice leads to deeper mixing and increased nutrient supply. In some temperate waters, increased biological rates and nutrient trapping allow for higher supply rates in the future. Depth-integrated biomass of different phytoplankton types under pre-industrial conditions and percent difference from a high warming scenario for the period 2090-2100. Two different thermal response functions for Prochlorococcus are used: metabolic (columns 1 and 2) and exponential (columns 3 and 4). Pre-industrial biomass (10-year mean, mgC m2) for various phytoplankton types and total biomass, using the metabolic (column 1) and exponential (column 3) functions for Prochlorococcus. Percent change in biomass between pre-industrial and future conditions under a high warming scenario, using the metabolic (column 2) and exponential (column 4) functions. Positive values indicate an increase in biomass in the future scenario. Increases in biomass for specific phytoplankton types suggest niche shifts, with some groups outcompeting others. We compare modelled biomass production (gC m−2 y−1) under pre-industrial conditions using either metabolic (left column) or exponential (right column) thermal response functions for Prochlorococcus. a, b, Prochlorococcus production, c, d, Synechococcus production, and e, f, production by all other phytoplankton. The color scale in panels e and f is supersaturated to enhance visibility of patterns in panels a-d. Note that maximum production rates in some region exceed 100 gC m−2 y−1. The percentage change in production between pre-industrial and future conditions is shown in Fig. Latitudinal change (%) in depth-integrated biomass production for Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and the combined total of all other phytoplankton. Results are based on the metabolic thermal response function for Prochlorococcus. Grey line (T + N-) represents changes due to the combination of temperature and nutrient shifts between pre-industrial and future conditions. Black line (T + ) represents changes due solely to temperature shifts, with circulation and nutrient concentrations held at pre-industrial levels (Methods and Supplementary Table 5). Shading represents the longitudinal variation from the mean (SD). Percentage change in depth-integrated annual biomass production for Prochlorococcus (a-d), Synechococcus (e-h), and all other phytoplankton (i-l) comparing the standard metabolic reaction model (left column) with a warm-adapted variant (right column) for Prochlorococcus. Both projections use the same future climate scenarios (2090-2100) and pre-industrial baseline (1860) as Fig. White areas indicate that the phytoplankton type does not exist in those regions in either pre-industrially or by end of century.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Archaeologists discovered clues to a fire in Guatemala from between 733 and 881 AD that they say represents a key turning point in Maya rule—a very public turning point. “Rather than examine this fire-burning event as a bookend to Maya history, we view it as a pivot point around which the K'anwitznal polity reinvented itself and the city of Ucanal went on to a flourishing of activities.” The new leadership regime welcomed a non-royal leader called Papmalil, and there is little in the written record indicating how he came to power. The study's authors, led by Christina Halperin at the University of Montreal, state that Papmalil appears to have ushered in an era of prosperity. That new era may have had a dramatic beginning. Included with the bodies were 1,470 fragments of greenstone pendants, beads, plaques, and mosaics, along with large blades—all representing a “single burning event.” The quantity and quality of the burnt and broken ornaments indicate they came from a royal tomb, likely belonging to multiple individuals. The authors state that the event “appears to have bene an act of desecration: it was dumped at the edge of a crude wall used as a construction pen and no effort was made to protect the fragmented bones and ornaments from the tomb blocks deposited on top of them as construction fill.” It all likely made for a “dramatic public affair” meant to be charged with emotion. “It could dramatically mark,” they wrote, “the dismantling of an ancient regime.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. You probably walked by it a bunch of times today. The oil-based product is now embedded in Earth's geologic layer as a new sedimentary rock known as “plastistone.” And the average adult human brain likely contains up to a spoon's worth of microplastic. If it's scaled up efficiently, scientists say the “bio-oil” from plastic could feed directly into energy-hungry technologies that require fuel to produce heat and electricity, such as boilers, furnaces, and turbines, as well as diesel for trucks, trains, and ships. This is a global effort, and scientists working on the problem hope to create an innovative process that will satisfy multiple petroleum-based needs—and encourage less reliance on fossil fuels that are wrecking the environment. However, the current method is arguably inefficient and still needs to be proven. Recently, researchers from Yale University may have made a dent in that inefficiency. They successfully tested a novel way to produce more bio-oil at less cost. It shows promise for scaling up production in the future, which is a crucial step for making plastic trash a viable source of energy. The chief method of pulling off this chemical wizardry starts with pyrolysis, which applies heat to a material in the absence of oxygen. These are organic compounds made mainly of carbon and hydrogen atoms and are the basic molecule required for creating fuel energy. Results vary, but pyrolysis usually turns about 60 percent of plastic into bio-oil. Various bio-oil production methods exist, but they typically use a catalyst, such as the mineral zeolite, to enhance the breakdown of materials and increase yields. “Whenever you talk about catalysts, they're very expensive and you have a lifetime issue because catalysts will eventually die by different means,” he said. The key to this innovation was creating a three-section 3D-printed carbon column reactor, with each section containing a different pore size. So they experimented with constructing their reactor using readily available carbon felt, a high-temperature resistant, flexible material. Even without determining ideal pore sizes, they still achieved a high yield, of around 56 percent. Their work so far shows that advanced recycling via pyrolsis still has room for sustainability and efficiency improvement. While increasing yields of bio-oil and making pyrolysis cost effective is important, scaling up also comes with some problems of its own that scientists must overcome. Experts speaking with the independent, investigative nonprofit news organization ProPublica called the broader pyrolysis concept “a fairy tale,” a convenient story often touted by oil companies and plastic producers so they can keep relying on fossil fuels. However, as scientists continue to pursue creative innovations, like Hu and his team's, they could one day turn this “fairy tale” into a real solution to the world's ever-growing plastic crisis. With the world is producing more single-use plastic than ever before, it's clear that—at least for now—the best kind of plastic is still one that's never made in the first place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bear suffered a fracture to its frontal bone, and there were marks on its teeth from chewing at the bars of a cage. Gladiatorial spectacles often involved some of the most fearsome creatures Romans could get a hold of, like lions and bulls. “Previous research suggests animals killed in the arena were butchered nearby, their meat distributed, and bones discarded close to the amphitheater—not buried in a formal animal graveyard,” Markovic said. The Viminacium amphitheater was known for hosting a range of animal-based spectacles in the mornings, from animal fights to simple hunts. The animals were even sometimes used to execute convicts. While gladiator events were known to introduce wild boars, bulls, panthers, dogs, and lions to events, according to a post by Antiquity, in the spectators' search for an increased level of blood and violence, the brown bear became one of the most prominent animals in the historical record of Roman gladiator stories. Bears were believed to have been brought in from Lucania, Caledonia, North Africa, and the Balkans for Roman pleasure. “This indicates the bear was indeed captured for use in spectator fights, likely near to Viminacium, and sustained injuries fighting against armed venators, who fought wild animals for entertainment,” the authors wrote. Despite so much having been written about animal use—especially of bears—in Roman events, the authors said this is the first definitive fossil evidence of the capture and use of brown bears in a gladiator setting. “It shows the significance of brown bears in spectacles across the wider empire and provides a fascinating insight into ancient relationships between humans and wild animals.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

Roberts, who completed a PhD in chemistry in 2011 at the University of Manchester, UK, surveyed 3,000 women about their careers and found that 85% could benefit from using LinkedIn more. To do so, Roberts recommends that researchers devote an hour per week to career-development activities, and make a special effort on LinkedIn as part of this (see ‘Six LinkedIn lessons from those in the know'). She suggests: “Set a timer for 15 minutes and connect with ten relevant people for your next job step”, whether that be making partnerships, finding collaborators or raising your profile to help secure future roles. “Pick a strategy for the next six months,” advises science-careers coach Hannah Roberts, who is based in Macclesfield, UK. You don't have to stick with it forever, just choose what feels right for now. Your personal page on LinkedIn is what potential collaborators and employers will see. “Ensure that all the sections of your LinkedIn profile are complete and up to date,” says Roberts. Follow people who are relevant to your line of work, but be judicious about who you connect with, says Ruth Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Those connections determine what shows up in your feed, she says, “If I'm randomly connecting with people, that's a problem — because garbage in, garbage out.” For some, this means scheduling posts to ensure a regular output. For Elena Hoffer, who runs a professional-resources business in Stockholm, it means wading into conversations on her posts. “Putting yourself out there” is key on LinkedIn, says Sharon Obasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney — although this is something scientists aren't always trained to do. When connecting with someone you don't know, try to build a relationship before asking for anything. Nothing has been built up, and instantly they will ping me a message about something that's irrelevant, or ask me for a job,” says Roberts. “It's a bit like jumping to ‘will you marry me?' She also suggests commenting on five posts each week, so that “people see your name, your picture and your LinkedIn headline”, adding: “If you're employing that strategy every time you go on LinkedIn, you can massively extend that network in a short space of time. Once you've built up a strong network of connections, Roberts says that more behind-the-scenes networking can begin, including informal conversations and making yourself known to organizations that interest you the most. How I put LinkedIn to work for my career as a scientist and entrepreneur How I put LinkedIn to work for my career as a scientist and entrepreneur Hoffer, who has a PhD in medical sciences from the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, and more than 100,000 LinkedIn followers says: “I always say, ‘do what fits you'. Ruth Gotian, whose 2022 book The Success Factor investigates how to achieve peak business performance based on her discussions with astronauts and Nobel laureates, doesn't recommend setting yourself targets for LinkedIn activity. Instead, she suggests fitting it in where you can around your existing work: “I tell people to definitely do it during their non-peak performance hours,” says Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. “Networking is so weird, because it's awkward,” says Vanesa Ayala-Núñez, an oncology researcher at the St Gallen branch of Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. She mirrored this approach on LinkedIn, being guided by people's names, or where they studied. Writing messages to potential connections in Spanish and highlighting the things they had in common helped Ayala-Núñez to build a strong professional network. If I'm going to meet with someone, I need some background information, and the first place I go to is LinkedIn, because what I want to do immediately is establish a connection with someone.” She might find common ground on the basis of someone's education, hometown or work history, “and that just kicks the conversation off”. Ruth Gotian is chief learning officer at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.Credit: LinkedIn Gotian emphasizes that developing personal connections is key to professional networking. When approaching people, “you don't want to sound like a salesperson, and you certainly don't want to sound transactional. This direct approach might make some researchers uncomfortable, but Gotian says it's just like building a friendship. “Just because it's working well for someone else on LinkedIn, it doesn't mean it's going to translate for you.” For Lawrence, who switched to science communication after completing a biomedical science degree at Nottingham Trent University, UK, in 2015, her authenticity comes from a genuine enthusiasm for the science that she writes about. “I grew my account to about 14,000 followers in three years just by being me and talking about things that I think are really interesting. Being passionate about his research area also helped electrochemist Jyotisman Rath to reap benefits on LinkedIn. Rath posted daily for 100 days on topics ranging from a battery trivia challenge to sustainability, climate change, energy and the broader field of electrochemistry during his master's degree at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Bhubaneswar, India, hoping that the daily target would help him stick to posting. The task revealed to him just how many scientists are active on LinkedIn. Daily posting enabled him to initiate conversations in comments and private messages, prompting discussion by asking others their opinions on the things he was posting about. It offers a small stipend and training on how to build engaged communities. For some, being authentic means being open about your personal life, even on a platform that is considered more professional than, say, X or Instagram. Siddharth Kankaria, a social-sciences researcher and science communicator in Kolkata, India, says LinkedIn is now his “primary social-media outlet”, making him inclined to share personal content there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The northeastern U.S. is a brilliant melange of science and history. But why, exactly, is this area of the country blessed with such stunning fall colors? First, it helps to know exactly why the leaves of deciduous trees change colors. As days begin to get shorter, trees receive a kind of signal to start preparing for the winter ahead. While people typically think that leaf-peeping season starting in late September, this process can actually start as early as late July in the northern-most latitudes. Once trees “know” that summer time is coming to a close, cool, early autumn nights will stimulate cells at the base of each leaf stem, causing them to dry out. This essentially cuts off water to the leaf and puts a stop to the export of carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. Once that production shuts down, the underlying pigments (which are always present in the leaves, but are hidden by chlorophyll production) become visible. These include pigments such as xanthophyll, carotene, and anthocyanin. And this is where a bit of history comes in. Although autumn seasons in pre-colonial America were still magnificent, the widespread presence of this conifer likely created a different autumnal impression. Eventually, European colonists began harvesting the white pine for building homes, furniture, and ships, and according to Harvard Forest, a mixture of broadleaf species (i.e. your colorful, fall trees) like maples, oaks, birches, and ashes took its place. And because this tree contains all three aforementioned pigments, its leaves run the full spectrum of colors throughout the fall season. Warm (but not too warm) and wet (but not too wet) summers combined with cool, dry winters provide the perfect setting for this colorful display. If the region experiences a “Goldilocks” year, where all these attributes work together perfectly, then autumn colors will be particularly spectacular. However, as you likely guessed, climate change complicates matters, as a more extreme climate and the introduction of pests and diseases means more stress on trees in general, meaning less colorful fall displays. The trees also need cool fall nights in order to produce vibrant colors, and places like Burlington, Vermont, are some 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer during these nights than they were in 1970. In 2025, leaf estimates are looking somewhat dour, as a deluge of May rains occurred just as leaves were budding, which led to fungus and mildew that impacted New England broadleafs, according to Boston.com. “When trees are stressed, they just don't have the energy to allocate into like leaf production and like maintaining and, honestly, just being their best selves,” Stephanie Spera, a geographer from the University of Richmond, told Vermont Public last year. It is all of these things working together to create this season.” As climate change progresses, those coveted “Goldilocks” years could become few and far between—if not disappearing entirely.

Nature Materials (2025)Cite this article Anode-free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising candidates for high-performance energy storage applications. Nonetheless, their translation into practical applications has been hindered by the slow kinetics and reversibility of Li plating and stripping on copper foils. Here we report a two-dimensional polyamide (2DPA)/lithiated Nafion (LN) interphase layer for anode-free Li metal batteries. Through molecular engineering, we construct a 2DPA layer with a large conjugated structure and Li-ion adsorption groups that show efficient adsorption, distribution and nucleation of Li ions. 2DPA molecules assembled into two-dimensional sheets are further incorporated with LN to create an ultrathin interphase layer with high-rate, high-capacity Li plating/stripping. These 2DPA/LN layers have higher rate capabilities and maximal energy and power densities compared with alternative polymer interphase layers, enabling the fabrication of an anode-free pouch cell with high performance. Overall, our interphase engineering approach is a promising tool to push the translation of anode-free Li metal batteries based on two-dimensional polymer interphase layers into practical devices, and enable the fabrication of energy storage technologies with high energy and power densities.

Bacteria often encounter physico-chemical stresses that disrupt division, leading to filamentation, where cells elongate without dividing. Although this adaptive response improves survival, it also exposes filaments to significant mechanical strain, raising questions about the mechanochemical feedback in bacterial systems. In this study, we investigate how mechanical strain modifies the geometry of bacterial filaments and influences the Min oscillatory system, a reaction-diffusion network central to division in Escherichia coli. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining quantitative fluorescence microscopy, biophysical modeling, microfluidics, and patterned growth substrates, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli filaments undergo a growth-induced buckling instability. Moreover, we show that synergistic mechanochemical effects determine the location of the division site after stress relief, effectively creating a mechanical “memory” for cytokinesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of mechanical forces and geometric effects in bacterial filamentation and provide new insights into the functional implications of mechanobiology in microbial systems. Bacterial division has been extensively studied, typically under favorable growth conditions1,2,3. However, bacteria frequently face environmental stresses of diverse kinds, both physical and chemical, that require phenotypic adaptation4,5,6. Filamentation, a phenomenon in which bacteria stop division, but neither genetic replication nor elongation (that is, growth), is a common adaptive response to various stressors, including antibiotic exposure7,8,9,10, nutrient depletion11, oxygen deficiency12, and temperature changes13. The filamentation phenotype provides bacteria with advantages, such as colonizing heterogeneous adhesive surfaces14 or facilitating cell-to-cell dissemination during host invasion15; but it also poses challenges to bacterial cells. Thus, cells must cope with sizes up to hundreds of micrometers16,17 (in contrast to a size of a few microns when cells do not filament). Consequently, bacterial filaments withstand significant mechanical stresses18, compared to those in regular-sized cells, leading to increased susceptibility to bending and buckling forces19,20. The interplay between mechanical forces and signaling pathways, i.e., the mechanosensing properties, of bacteria during filamentation remains an unresolved question21. Notably, in filaments of rod-shaped bacteria, such as E. coli and B. subtilis, the cell wall growth rate has been shown to depend on mechanical stress, and evidence suggests that MreB (an actin homolog) acts as a membrane curvature sensor18,22,23. However, how mechanical stimuli and curvature modulate other key signaling processes at the core of the filamentation phenomenon, such as the division machinery, is unclear. The regulation of cell division has been extensively studied in E. coli24,25,26. In particular, the positioning of prospective septa, i.e., the so-called Z-rings27,28, is controlled by the Min oscillatory system (MinC, MinD, and MinE proteins), which follows a reaction-diffusion scheme29,30. Thus, when E. coli undergoes filamentation, the Min system exhibits a standing-wave, multinode pattern, whose potential division sites are located at the minima of the time-averaged Min signal27,31,32. Interestingly, experiments in deformed spheroplasts33, in E. coli with aberrant shapes34,35, and on patterned substrates36, suggest that MinD localizes in regions of high curvature. While the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is, to the best of our knowledge, still under debate, a plausible reason is the reported positive feedback loop between the local membrane curvature and protein concentration37. This is supported by models in cocci-shaped bacteria, where slight deformations cause a micron-scale change in global membrane curvature during cell elongation, which may act as cues to select the plane of division38. These facts raise the intriguing question of whether or not, in bacterial filaments, prone to bend and buckle, Min patterning is influenced by mechanical stress and curvature (or the other way around). Moreover, given that Min patterning determines the prospective locations for cell cleavage, does mechanical stress and changes in the filament's geometry condition the division sites in filaments when environmental stress ends and cytokinesis resumes? Herein, we address these questions using a multidisciplinary approach that combines quantitative fluorescent time-lapse microscopy, micro-patterning of growth substrates, biophysical models, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) analyses, and microfluidics. Our results reveal that bacterial filaments undergo growth-induced buckling instability that leads to a mechanochemical interplay between the Min oscillatory system and the curvature, preceded by the positioning of FtsZ rings. Further, we explore the post-stress consequences of such an interplay and conclude that it sets preferential division sites. Altogether, our study sheds light on the mechanobiology of bacterial filaments and their functional role. In our experiments, we used the antibiotic aztreonam to induce E. coli filamentation. Antibiotic-induced filamentation is widely used as a model to study bacterial adaptation under stress39,40. In clinically relevant settings, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by pathogenic E. coli, antibiotic treatments trigger filamentation via SOS response activation and division inhibition by SulA17. Furthermore, during infection, filamentation may occur through alternative pathways to that of SulA, such as the DamX-mediated pathway41. In this work, we chose aztreonam, which specifically inhibits FtsI - the cell division protein responsible for catalyzing peptidoglycan cross-linking at the septum42. At sub-lethal concentrations, aztreonam maintains membrane integrity and allows Z-ring assembly while preventing cell division, thereby inducing filament formation9,43. In our case, E. coli cultures were grown in M9 minimal medium to an OD600 of 0.3 before inoculation onto 2% agarose pads containing 10 μg/ml of aztreonam (Methods). Under these conditions, time-lapse microscopy revealed cell filamentation (Fig. Growing filaments exhibited a buckling instability, which became more likely for filaments longer than  ~10 μm (Supplementary Fig. In our study, we utilized the DH5α strain, which exhibits a lower Young's modulus compared to K1244, thereby potentially facilitating the buckling phenomenon. This instability is, at first, counterintuitive, since cell elongation could be thought as a tensile stress, whereas buckling develops due to compressive stresses37. In that regard, our estimation of the critical load required to induce filament buckling is on the order of \({{\mathcal{O}}}\left(1{0}^{1}\right)\) nN (Methods). Buckling led to high curvature values with radii smaller than the characteristic length of non-filamentous E. coli cells: ∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1 (Fig. In this context, we used ∣κ∣ as a proxy for mechanical strain. A Phase contrast images of a representative E. coli filament growing on 10 μg/ml aztreonam agarose pads. At a given location (e.g., yellow point) the curvature, ∣κ∣, is computed as the inverse of the radius of the circumference that is tangent to that point (green circle): ∣κ∣ = 1/R. As time progresses and the filament grows, the snapshots reveal a buckling instability where large values of ∣κ∣ are reached by the central region of the filament (see E). B Cartoon of the mechanical toy model. Forces are exerted by a chain of connected springs (black). Nodes (grey circles) are subjected to elastic and bending forces. Due to cellular growth, the elastic energy relies on the time-dependent distance, L(t), between consecutive nodes (Methods). Bending energy depends on the angle θ as determined by neighboring segments. C Snapshots of a simulated growing filament (initial length: 50 μm; doubling time: 50 min). Color scales for each time point indicate the elastic (top) and bending (bottom) energies using pair-wise moving average coordinates (Methods). As time progresses, elastic energy accumulates by the central region. Buckling leads to a relaxation of the elastic energy at the expense of an increase of the bending energy (black triangles). D Ratio of the total energy between soft and stiff filaments (soft: \(\widetilde{\Omega }=0.9\); stiff: \(\widetilde{\Omega }=2\); sample size: n = 100 simulations). As time progresses, the panel shows that stiff filaments that are not able to buckle increase their energy. E Density histograms of the curvature of filaments as a function of the relative position as obtained in experiments (left) and simulations (pair-wise moving average coordinates; right). The color scale represents probability. Larger curvatures (buckling) accumulate in the central region of the filament. To understand this phenomenon, we developed a mechanical toy model. The model consists of a 2D chain of massless nodes connected by linear springs. Segments connecting nodes are also subjected to bending forces (Methods, Fig. The springs were assumed to be identical (i.e., same elastic and bending constants). In the model, we neglected inertial effects and included energy dissipation. The theoretical analysis and our simulations confirmed that, as expected, if the equilibrium length of the springs, l0, is kept constant, then the simulated filaments reach a straight configuration regardless of the initial condition (Methods). However, if growth is included such that the equilibrium length depends on time, i.e., \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)\), then buckling develops (Supplementary Movie 2). Consequently, our model argues in favor of cellular growth as the driving force underlying buckling in agreement with recent studies on bacterial chains45. On the other hand, springs located by the poles of the chain find less opposition to growth. As a result, elastic energy accumulates at the central region of filaments (compressive stress), and energy relaxation can only be achieved by buckling. This buckling dynamics is revealed in our model by bending events at different length scales. Thus, local stresses at a scale of few nodes cause zig-zag configurations in the chain of springs. In addition, at a larger length scale, there is macroscopic buckling as revealed by the changes of the local curvature of the midline as experimentally shown (e.g., Fig. In order to distinguish between these different, yet complementary, phenomena, and properly compare simulations and experiments, we implemented a moving average approach (Methods). 1C, our model reproduces that the accumulation of elastic energy (compressive stresses) due to growth decreases at the expense of an increase of the bending energy. The total energy decrease due to the buckling instability can be observed in Fig. 1D by comparing filaments with different (dimensionless) bending moduli: \(\widetilde{\Omega }=0.9\) (soft filament) vs. \(\widetilde{\Omega }=2\) (stiff filament). Thus, as time progresses, the simulations show that stiff filaments that are not able to buckle heap up energy with respect to soft filaments. The model also predicts that since compressive stresses accumulate at the middle of the filament, buckling is more likely to develop at that location. 1E also allows us to estimate the onset of buckling for ∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1, as these values are reached only at the central region of the filament. In summary, the mechanical model explains the buckling phenomenon observed in growing E. coli filaments. Buckling events are more likely by the central region because the filament ends are able to elongate freely, whereas the middle section must exert larger forces in order to push and displace the rest of the filament. This mismatch between the growing dynamics of different regions of the filament leads to an accumulation of compressive stresses that ultimately cause the filaments to buckle. In order to study how buckling-induced mechanical stress affects signaling proteins related to the filamentation phenomenon, we focused on the Min system. The MinCDE oscillatory system prevents FtsZ polymerization and, consequently, plays an important role in the filamentation and cell division processes46,47,48. In particular, MinD protein localizes either at the cell membrane or in the cytosol, depending on its ATP activity and it is a proxy for the activity and localization of MinC and MinE (see Supplementary Fig. In our study, we used an E. coli strain that expresses the recombinant fluorescent protein YFP:MinD (Methods). We tracked and measured, simultaneously, MinD and the curvature of the middle cell axis of E. coli filaments by quantitative time-lapse microscopy (Fig. In our analyses, we focused on growing filaments exhibiting two key characteristics: (1) constant MinD concentration (intensity per unit area) over time, and (2) persistent standing wave patterns. As for (1), since our analyses rely on fluorescent microscopy data quantification, we assume that all MinD molecules fold correctly and are fluorescent-active. We note that constant MinD concentration indicates a constant MinD production as the body mass increases in agreement with recent results49 (see Supplementary Fig. Furthermore, the maintained standing wave oscillations (see below) suggest a stable MinE/MinD ratio during the observation period50. This standing wave pattern allowed us to pinpoint the location of the non-functional FtsZ septa during filamentation (regions with a sustained low concentration of MinD). Interestingly, we observed that MinD concentration (i.e., the amplitude of the pattern) was dependent on the level of curvature, Fig. In particular, the average intensity of the MinD signal seemed to increase in buckled regions and, concurrently, the imaging data suggested that the nodes of the MinD pattern (i.e., local minima) tallied with large curvature peaks. A Fluorescence channel (YFP, false color scale) of the illustrative filament shown in Fig. 1A (average Z-projection of the last 5 min). The zoomed region (circle) highlights the increase of MinD in buckled regions. In addition, the white arrows indicate the anti-correlation effect between MinD and locations with a high curvature. B Top: Kymographs of the filament shown in (A) representing curvature (top) and MinD intensity (middle) profiles along the filament middle axis as a function of time. Color scales account for the curvature (μm−1) and for MinD concentration (arbitrary units). Bottom: Overlay of the time average of MinD and curvature profiles. Black arrows highlight the locations pinpointed in (A) by means of white arrows. Averages are computed within the region delimited by the white dashed lines. C Violin plots showing the distribution of values of the Pearson's correlation coefficient between MinD and curvature (sample size: n = 19 filaments where high and low curvature regions were analyzed separately, Supplementary Fig. Black solid lines represent the mean (Low: 0.22; High: −0.14). D Normalized MinD intensity (mean and standard deviation) as a function of the curvature in non-patterned agarose pads (same dataset as in (C)) and in micro-patterned growth substrates (n = 20 filaments). Solid lines are, in both cases, a logarithmic fit: Eqn. Inset: Illustrative phase contrast image of an E. coli filament growing in a micro-patterned agarose pad (scale bar: 10 μm). To quantitatively assess the interplay between MinD patterning and buckling, we computed kymographs and performed temporal averages of MinD and curvature profiles (Fig. However, other properties of the pattern, such as the wavelength (at any given time) and the period (at any given location) were not affected by buckling (Supplementary Fig. Further, these values were fairly conserved among filaments: \({{\uplambda}}=\left(7.6\pm 1.0\right)\,\mu {{\rm{m}}}\) and \(T=\left(55\pm 10\right)\) s (Supplementary Fig. Our analysis confirmed that MinD peaks avoided regions with high curvature (∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1). To deepen into this effect, we computed the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the averaged MinD and the curvature profiles (Methods) and differentiate between regions with high (∣κ∣ > 0.5 μm−1) and low (∣κ∣ < 0.5 μm−1) curvature values (Supplementary Fig. 2C, revealed a significant anti-correlation in high-curvature regions and a positive correlation in low-curvature regions (Mann-Whitney U test: α = 5 ⋅ 10−2 significance level). As for the quantitative relationship between MinD concentration and buckling, we computed the value of the normalized intensity (per filament) of the wave envelope as a function of the curvature, Fig. The analysis confirmed an increase in MinD as a function of the curvature, which reaches a plateau for curvature values above 0.5 μm−1 (Fig. In order to verify that the phenomenon of MinD correlation and accumulation as a function of the curvature is independent of MinD concentration, we performed experiments decreasing the plasmid induction 10 fold (Supplementary Fig. Our results support that the phenomena observed for the previous plasmid induction are also valid at this MinD concentration. Likewise, we also tested whether the mechanical instability and its effects on MinD patterning are strain-dependent. For this, we replicated the experiment using a K12 strain (Supplementary Movie 4) that confirms the results obtained previously for Dh5α. Given that our results indicate that buckling instability naturally develops in the central region of filaments (Fig. 1E), we further tested whether MinD accumulation preferentially occurs at regions of higher local curvature versus at locations by the middle (where growth-induced compressive stresses accumulate). To that end, we designed micro-patterned growth substrates (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 6), where we externally control the bending and curvature of the filaments along their body length (inset Fig. Our analysis of MinD intensity as a function of the curvature revealed in this case a similar trend (Fig. We notice that micro-patterned pads could not be used to perform a MinD-curvature correlation study (i.e., Fig. As mentioned above, that analysis requires to achieve local curvatures above 0.5 μm−1. However, we observed that E. coli filaments would escape the regions of the guiding growth patterns with curvatures larger than 0.4 μm−1. Therefore, our data support that MinD accumulation is driven by local curvature rather than by growth-induced mechanical strain, and, overall, the existence of a modulation of Min patterning due to curvature effects. These findings align with previous studies conducted on non-filamentous E. coli cells37 (Discussion). Previous studies have shown that membrane curvature and mechanical stress alter the assembly dynamics of proteins as well as their diffusive properties37,51,52,53,54,55. In that regard, since local changes in protein dynamics lead to local modifications in protein concentration, we wondered whether the modulation of the MinD pattern in buckled regions is driven by this physical phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we performed Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) assays and numerical simulations. Given the oscillatory behavior of MinD, we devised a methodology of FRAP data that weights up the standing-wave patterning properties of the signal (Methods, Fig. Our analysis relies on the fact that a standing wave can be decomposed as the sum of two waves traveling in opposite directions with phase velocities c = λ/T. To characterize the effect of buckling in protein dynamics, we photobleached MinD and computed the dimensionless ratio between the fluorescence recovery speed, vr, and c. Here, vr is defined as vr = d/tr, where d is the distance from a MinD peak in the non-photobleached domain (emitter) to the location where the recovery (≥ 30%) of the MinD signal is observed (receiver), and tr is the recovery time following photobleaching (Methods, Fig. We note that the normalization of vr with respect to c accounts for possible differences (i.e., variability) among filaments with respect to their wave properties. A Cartoon illustrating the FRAP experimental quantification (see text). B Top: Composite of bright-field and MinD fluorescence of a filament before photobleaching. C Violin plots showing the dimensionless velocity recovery, vr/c, of the pulse's recovery for straight (n = 17) and buckled (n = 8) filaments. Black lines account for the mean (Straight: 1.40; Buckled: 1.18). Buckled filaments reveal a larger recovery, thus indicating a slower diffusive transport. To test this approach, we performed several control experiments (Supplementary Fig. In the case of non-filamentous bacteria showing one pole-to-pole MinD pulse, photobleaching the pulse precludes recovery within the temporal observation window (~2.5 × T, Supplementary Fig. However, photobleaching one cell pole while there was a signal outside the photobleached region led to MinD recovery within the observation window (Supplementary Fig. This hints that signal recovery requires MinD traveling from a non-photobleached region within the filament. To further investigate this, we conducted the same experiment using short filaments. Consistent with the previous results, when we photobleached all of the MinD (Supplementary Fig. 7C), we observed no signal recovery. However, when we photobleached one of the pulses, while leaving at least one other MinD pulse intact, recovery was detected (Supplementary Fig. We applied the aforementioned methodology to buckled (∣κ∣max > 0.5 μm−1) and straight (∣κ∣max < 0.5 μm−1) filaments. 3B, indicate that buckling slows down the velocity recovery vr/c, therefore suggesting either a decrease in protein diffusivity or a change in the attachment/detachment kinetics in curved regions, as previously shown53,54,55,56,57,58,59. To further clarify our findings from the FRAP experiments, we conducted numerical simulations. In that regard, since the cross-sectional shape of the bacterial filaments remains unchanged due to bending/buckling, we do not expect that the transport properties of MinD in the cytoplasm are affected60. Consequently, we focus in our simulations on the effect of curvature on membrane diffusivity and on the binding kinetics of Min proteins. Our approach is based on a signaling model that accounts for the main molecular interactions of Min species, including oligomerization and the MinE-mediated hydrolysis of MinD-ATP (Fig. A Cartoon of the Min oscillatory system model, adapted from61. B Spatio-temporal evolution of MinD obtained in simulations of a growing filament. Top: Kymograph of a filament with an initial length of 50 μm growing for its doubling time (50 min). For \(t\in \left(0,20\right)\) min (dashed purple line), no buckling is implemented. For \(t\in \left(20,50\right)\) min (solid purple line), the membrane diffusion coefficients of proteins are set to a 30% of their values within a 3 μm-wide band (Methods). Bottom: Temporal averages of MinD (arbitrary units) for a period of 20 minutes immediately before (dashed purple line) and a period of 30 minutes immediately after (solid purple line) the diffusion drop within the region delimited by the white dashed lines shown in the kymograph. In our simulations we implemented an exponential growth of the filaments (i.e., elongation) and the aforementioned changes in protein dynamics in a 3 μm region —approximately the width of a MinD peak— where ∣κ∣ ~1 μm−1 (Methods). As for the effect this has on membrane diffusivity on Min proteins, we estimated that such curvature implies a  ~30% decrease of its original value54. Under those conditions, the MinD accumulation pattern in buckled regions observed in our simulations resembled the experimental results (cf. As for the effect on patterning caused by changes in the binding rate of Min proteins to the cell membrane, previous experiments in septins have shown that going from a flat filament to the simulated curvature implies an approximate 100% increase in the binding rate (see Fig. Under these conditions, our simulations indicate that Min patterning is disrupted (Supplementary Fig. 8A), which contrasts with our experimental observations (Fig. In fact, the same experimental figure suggests that the binding rate remains constant for ∣κ∣ ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 μm−1, for which we already see MinD accumulation in our experiments (Fig. To investigate whether a specific range of binding rates could lead to accumulation, we tested values down to a 10% increase, finding this to be the minimum increase that does not disrupt MinD patterning and resembles the scenario we observe experimentally (Supplementary Fig. In summary, FRAP experiments and numerical simulations support the idea that buckling modifies the membrane diffusivity of Min proteins, which in turn causes protein accumulation. Herein we have shown that curvature peaks positively correlate with sustained MinD signal minima (i.e., as shown in Fig. 2C, high curvature —indicating large mechanical strain— and MinD maxima are anti-correlated). This observation prompted us to investigate whether Min patterning and mechanical effects might synergistically determine preferred division sites in post-stress conditions. To verify this, we conducted microfluidic experiments adapting the protocol established by Wehrens et al.32 (Methods). Cells were initially cultured in M9 medium under normal growth conditions, then switched to stressor medium (M9 + aztreonam) for 3 − 5 hours to induce filamentation. During this period, we observed progressive cell elongation followed by buckling. Division was restored by returning cells to pure M9 medium, at which point the filamented bacteria resumed cytokinesis16,32,62 (Fig. After 1 h, aztreonam was added to the culture medium to induce filamentation. 5 h later, aztreonam was removed such that filaments resumed cytokinesis, and the curvature at the division locations was calculated. B 5 min average of phase contrast and fluorescent channels showing the location of MinD pulses just before the first division. C Probability density functions of the curvatures for filaments at the division points (in blue) and for the whole filaments just before the corresponding divisions (in yellow). The means of the distributions are 0.6 ± 0.4 and 0.3 ± 0.3 μm−1, respectively (sample size n = 125). D (left) Kymograph representing FtsZ fluorescence from a single cell to a filament. E Probability density distribution of lag times between FtsZ ring appearance and a buckling event. On average, FtsZ precedes bending by 22 min, and the most probable value is 63 min. Each bin corresponds to 9 min (sample size n = 19). F 5 min average of fluorescent channel showing DNA distribution, avoiding curvature peaks (highlighted with white arrows) in a filament in the microfluidic device. G Violin plots showing the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the DNA signal and curvature. The correlation was calculated separating the buckled region (high) and the non-buckled regions (low) as done with MinD in Fig. Under these conditions, we selected buckled filaments with a maximum curvature exceeding 0.5 μm−1 and characterized the curvature at the division sites, ∣κ∣div. For the analysis, we included divisions in filaments longer than 8 μm (either the originally selected ones or those resulting from divisions of longer filaments), ensuring that at least two division rings (or 3 sustained MinD pulses) were assembled in the cell (Fig. We note that the morphological differences observed in filaments growing in microfluidic traps compared to those on agarose pads are primarily attributable to the substrate. Filaments within microfluidic chips appear wider due to slight compression between the two rigid surfaces of the trap. Furthermore, these filaments experience greater frictional forces with the substrate (the two “sandwiching” stiff surfaces) than those growing on softer agarose pads, which favors the development of curvature, resulting in a more wiggly appearance63. 5C shows the probability density function (PDF) of the curvature at the division points (blue), revealing that filament division is more likely to occur at sites with ∣κ∣div.≥ 0.5 μm−1 (mean division curvature: \(\langle | \kappa {| }_{div. In contrast, the PDF of the curvature of filaments, ∣κ∣fil., just before cytokinesis (Fig. 5C, orange) shows a distribution shifted towards lower curvatures (\(\langle | \kappa {| }_{fil. Given that the threshold curvature value to observe a negative correlation between curvature maxima and MinD sustained minima is 0.5 μm−1, we calculated the fraction of divisions occurring above this threshold. Our results, revealed that 60% of divisions were above the threshold. In this context, we also analyzed Z-ring dynamics (Supplementary Movie 7). To this end, we employed the MG1655 strain expressing gfp::ftsZ (Methods). Given that FtsZ forms a dynamic Z-ring that disassembles (FtsZ depolymerization) before the onset of buckling, we computed the lag time to account for a potential temporal delay, as shown in Fig. Our results indicate that regions of high curvature are preceded by Z-rings by an average of 22 minutes. Importantly, the findings from these experiments suggest that divisome dynamics contribute to an increase in curvature (see Discussion). The role of the Min oscillatory system in influencing chromosome positioning and segregation has been a topic of debate64,65. In that regard, we additionally checked whether DNA segregation within the filaments followed the pattern dictated by MinD pulses, i.e., whether the DNA avoided the curvature peaks in filaments. To that end, we labeled and tracked the DNA in living filaments using SYTOX Orange (Methods). We found that DNA was distributed in a discrete manner along the filament avoiding curvature peaks, Fig. This avoidance became more pronounced as curvature increased (see Supplementary Fig. These locations putatively mark the positioning of division septa when cytokinesis resumes32,62. To quantitatively assess the relationship between DNA distribution and the curvature of filaments, we computed the correlation of their profiles (Fig. Our results revealed a significant anti-correlation (Mann-Whitney U test: α = 5 ⋅ 10−2 significance level). This demonstrates that either the absence of DNA facilitates bending or that curvature can influence chromosomal positioning, in line with previous studies showing that DNA can “sense” the curvature of the cell walls and adjust accordingly38,64. Consequently, these findings endorse the view that regions of high curvature, and thus mechanical strain, play a crucial, functional role in determining preferential division sites in post-stress filaments. Previous investigations have studied E. coli filamentation and have established that Z-ring positioning is reallocated in response to the filament size32. Our study builds on this understanding by revealing how mechanical forces develop during E. coli filamentation resulting in an increase in curvature, which affects the Min system —the protein complex responsible for positioning the division ring. In particular, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for filament buckling, linking three key factors: (1) FtsZ ring positioning, (2) local DNA depletion, and (3) mechanical strain accumulation. This spatiotemporal relationship emerges naturally from energy minimization principles: as filaments grow, elastic energy accumulates, which is subsequently reduced through bending events. In this context, previous studies have shown that E. coli filaments exhibit elastic behavior when subjected to transient external forces. However, sustained external forces lead to significant cell wall synthesis, resulting in plastic deformations in which the localized activity of MreB plays a key role19,20,66. Additionally, hydrodynamic and adhesion forces have also been shown to influence filament shape43. A point warranting discussion is the role of the 2D constrained growth employed in our experiments in the observed buckling phenomenon. Confinement undoubtedly exacerbates buckling, as a 3D environment typically offers more space for stress redistribution, potentially leading to a more gradual dissipation of instabilities63. However, buckling has also been observed during 3D bacterial growth, as evidenced, for instance, in UTIs caused by pathogenic E. coli17. We also emphasize that 2D confined growth of bacteria occurs naturally in various settings, such as the early stages of biofilm development63. This evidence suggests that a comprehensive quantitative description of the mechanical properties of filaments would require incorporating mechanisms and processes that were excluded from our model, as we deemed them unnecessary given the convincing results achieved using only a linear elastic theory. Regarding the impact of the buckling instability and curvature on Min signaling, we demonstrated that MinD can adjust in response to both naturally occurring curvatures and controlled curvatures induced by patterned growth substrates. Specifically, MinD accumulates in regions of increasing curvature, and for curvatures exceeding 0.5 μm−1, our data indicated that MinD maxima avoid curvature peaks. This phenomenon may be attributed to the increased surface-to-bulk ratio characteristic of high-curvature regions, which can induce geometry-dependent behavior in mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems27,67,68,69. In fact, previous studies suggested that increased protein binding leads to increased membrane occupancy, thereby reducing the diffusion of proteins across the membrane70 and that curvature changes the binding affinity of membrane proteins affecting their diffusion71. This, together with our simulations, points to a decrease in diffusion as the primarily responsible of the accumulation of MinD in regions of high curvature. Our FRAP experiments are consistent with this hypothesis. However, the observed differences in the FRAP results are not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test: α = 5 ⋅ 10−2 significance level), probably because despite having attempted to mitigate variations between filaments by normalizing the data considering each filament's wavelength and period, this approach required these parameters to remain consistent before and after photobleaching, which was not always the case. In that regard, it is worth mentioning that some studies have reported that cumulative light excitation slowed down GFP:MinD oscillations by about 10 s, potentially influencing FRAP results72. Due to these challenges, we got a low number of bona fide replicates among all the samples taken. Thus, given the limited statistics, the FRAP results should be considered as an indication, rather than as clear evidence, to support the modification of the membrane diffusion parameter in the signalling model. We also note that Min patterning modulation may be influenced by mechanisms beyond slower diffusion in buckled regions. In that regard, some studies have shown changes in the membrane association and dissociation kinetics of some proteins due to membrane curvature effects58,59. However, to the best of our knowledge, in the case of Min proteins the only documented changes of the binding affinity are related to membrane composition in the context of synthetic vesicles73. To further assess the role played by changes in the binding rate, we performed numerical simulations (Supplementary Fig. We concluded that mild changes in the binding rate constant disrupts MinD patterning, further supporting the idea that the main contribution to MinD accumulation is caused by a diffusion drop due to an increase in curvature. Our study also explored the implications of our findings in post-stress conditions that lead to the resumption of cytokinesis in filaments. Given MinD's role in inhibiting the divisome assembly in E. coli, and the observed tendency of Min to avoid curvature peaks, we hypothesized that Z-rings that assemble at these peaks would operate preferentially. Indeed, in our microfluidic experiments, when the stressor medium was removed —once the filaments reached high curvature values— the majority of division events occurred at curvatures exceeding the mean filament curvature. Additionally, the cross-correlation analysis between the FtsZ signal and the curvature profiles indicates that Z-ring formation preferentially precedes regions of high curvature, suggesting a contribution of the division machinery to the enhancement of curvature. Thus, mechanical buckling conditions Min patterning such that the standing wave nodes avoid regions of high curvature and favors Z-ring assembly, which in turn eventually contributes to increased curvature (arguably because the subsequent depolymerization of FtsZ and peptidoglycan remodeling softens the cell wall). Furthermore, this observation aligned with our characterization of DNA distribution within the filaments, which also avoided curvature peaks. Thus, in agreement with the current knowledge about the causality relationship among all the components mentioned in our work, the Min system acts first, the nucleoid occlusion then refines the permissive region from MinCDE by ensuring Z-ring formation happens only after chromosome segregation begins74. The absence of DNA in turn facilitates bending driven by compressive forces because the cell is “emptier” in those regions (i.e., softer). Ultimately, these results suggest the existence of a mechanical “memory” for cytokinesis, where the interplay between mechanical strain and signaling mechanisms defines the preferential division sites. In a broader context, Min's sensitivity to the shape of its “container” is not unique to E. coli56,71. For example, in B. subtilis, an analogous complex to Fts, known as DivIVA, localizes to regions of highest curvature due to MinD's preference for flatter membrane regions67. In Staphylococcus aureus, a cocci-shaped bacterium, some models suggest that a modification in membrane curvature during elongation is used by DivIVA to recognize the next division plane38. Mechanical deformations in minimal systems, such as liposomes containing Min proteins, have also been shown to alter Min patterning68. Specifically, MinE has been observed to distribute asymmetrically in response to liposome deformation. Interestingly, MinE accumulation and liposome deformation appear to mutually promote one another, suggesting a positive mechanochemical feedback loop that may play a role in our system. Finally, while our study focuses on Min, other components of the divisome could be affected by changes in cell geometry and mechanical stress in the membrane. In fact, a previous study has reported that MreB is correlated with the nucleoid position in E. coli unperturbed cells, but this correlation decreases when the cell geometry changes75. Thus, studying other components involved in the elongation, division, and regulation of the mechanical properties of cells is crucial for the complete understanding of the relationship between signaling, filamentation, and cytokinesis, and its implications for bacterial adaptation and antibiotic resistance76. Also, in this study, we have focused on antibiotic-induced filamentation mediated by activation of the SOS response, leading to division inhibition via SulA. However, during UTIs, other pathways, such as those involving DamX41, have been shown to regulate bacterial cell shape. This raises the intriguing question of how filamentation in certain clinical contexts, which do not necessarily involve alterations in membrane composition, differs from the phenomenon described here. Notably, our results demonstrate that the underlying physical mechanism driving buckling still applies when using bacterial strains with varying membrane stiffness. Nonetheless, in UTIs where filamentation is actively regulated by DamX or alternative mechanisms, the buckling process may also be subject to active control. Future studies could shed light on how these regulatory pathways influence buckling dynamics, potentially guiding the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat UTIs. Experiments were conducted using the Escherichia coli strain DH5α (NZYTech), transformed with the plasmid pYLS68 (Plac-yfp::minD minE::cfp), generously provided by Dr. Shih77. Overnight cultures were initiated from a single colony and grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. After overnight growth, cultures were diluted to a final OD600 of  ~0.01 in minimal M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose, 1 mM thiamine hydrochloride, 0.2% casamino acids, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 100 μM IPTG for plasmid induction (except for Supplementary Fig. 5 where 10 μM IPTG was used). These cultures were incubated under the same conditions as the overnight cultures until they reached an OD600 of 0.2−0.3. Subsequently, they were further diluted to OD600 ~0.005 to prepare the working cell culture. Low-melting-point agarose pads were prepared following the protocol described in ref. 78 using M9-supplemented medium and 10 μg/ml aztreonam to induce bacterial filamentation as previously described43. Subsequently, 2 μl of the working culture were inoculated onto the agarose pads. The pads were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then dried in a desiccator for 20 min. Once placed in the microscopy dish (IBIDI μ-Dish 35 mm, low), they were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow the cells to develop the filamentation phenotype. To pattern the agarose growth substrates, master mold structures were fabricated on standard silicon samples. The fabrication process employed electron-beam direct writing on a Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist film. The electron-beam exposure, performed with a Jeol JBX-8100FS tool, was optimized to achieve the desired dimensions using an acceleration voltage of 100 keV and a beam current of 20 nA. After developing the PMMA resist using a conventional 1: 3 MIBK/IPA developer, the resist patterns were transferred onto the silicon samples using an optimized Inductively Coupled Plasma-Reactive Ion Etching process with fluoride gases (SF6, C4F8). The remaining resist was removed with oxygen plasma. The etched silicon patterns were used as molds for fabricating complementary patterns on PDMS. The silicon structures were silanized in gas with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (97%, stabilized with copper) for approximately 27 h by placing a droplet of the silanizer near the sample in a vacuum desiccator. A mixture of silicone elastomer base and curing agent (in a mass ratio of 1: 10) was poured onto the silanized silicon pattern and cured in an oven at 90 °C for 1 h. The cured PDMS stamp was cooled for 20 min at room temperature before being carefully peeled off from the silicon mold. This PDMS stamp contained a pattern complementary to that of the silicon mold. To prepare the patterned agarose substrates, 2.5% low melting point agarose in culture medium with 1 μg/ml aztreonam was poured onto the PDMS stamp and covered with a 2 × 2 cm coverglass. Finally, 2 μl of cell culture with an OD600 of 0.2–0.3 was inoculated on the agar pad. The agar pads were dried in a laminar flow hood for 15 min before being transferred to a glass-bottom dish (IBIDI μ-Dish 35 mm, low). The same PDMS mold could be reused after proper cleaning: it was immersed in 100% ethanol, sonicated for 15 min, rinsed thoroughly with DI water, and dried in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h. The patterns were designed using the open-source mask design tool Nazca Design79. Four designs were created to control the curvature of the filaments (Supplementary Fig. 6): three based on curved channels and one based on a lattice of pillars. The “wave” pattern featured a sequence of “s” curves formed by connecting three half-circular bends, each with a different radius of curvature (Supplementary Fig. The “snake” pattern consisted of a sequence of “s” curves, where each “s” was formed by two half-circular bends, with the radius of curvature alternating every half rotation (Supplementary Fig. For both patterns, the radius of curvature ranged from 0.35 μm to 12 μm. The “spiral” pattern was composed of half-circular bends with a radius of curvature increasing from 0.8 μm to 10.4 μm in increments of 0.8 μm per half rotation (Supplementary Fig. The width of the channels for these three patterns ranged from 0.7 μm to 1.1 μm. The fourth design was a triangular lattice of circles, each equidistant from its neighbors, with connected spaces in between. Images were acquired using a Leica Thunder inverted microscope, equipped with a HC PL-APO CS2 63 × /1.40 oil objective and a CMOS camera (Leica DFC9000 GTC). Köhler illumination was applied to optimize image contrast in transmitted light mode (phase contrast). Fluorophore excitation was performed using the Spectra-X Light Engine LED lamp, which features 8 solid-state LEDs. The Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) software was used for microscope control and image acquisition. All experimental procedures were conducted at 37 °C with temperature regulation provided by the IBIDI heating system. Unless otherwise specified, time-lapses were acquired with an interframe time of 10 s over a 30-min duration, using 20% light source power (Spectra-X nominal output power 500 mW), 30 ms exposure time, and 2 × 2 binning. While our plasmid produces upon induction MinE:CFP and YFP:MinD protein fusions, images were only taken in the YFP channel (MinD) due to the high photobleaching and phototoxicity when trying to get a signal in the CFP channel (MinE) at the desired image acquisition rate during our long-term experiments. For MinD membrane localization, a Z-stack was acquired with a HC PL-APO 100 ×/1.40 oil objective. The Z-stack resolution was 0.27 μm for a total range of 2.43 μm. To remove out-of-plane light effects, a Leica Thunder Small-Volume Computational Clearing filter was applied to the stack. To characterize the fluorescence profile, a line was drawn with Fiji80, and the function “Plot profile” was used. Using Fiji80, the background was removed from all images with a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels in the fluorescent channel. The brightness and contrast of the phase-contrast images were adjusted to maximize contrast based on the characteristics of each image. However, the levels of the fluorescence images were consistently adjusted between 200 and 5000 to ensure comparability. The resulting segmentation masks were then used to analyze both phase-contrast and fluorescence images with the MicrobeJ plugin82, allowing us to extract quantitative data. The output is a list of point pairs representing curvature and normalized length. To verify the curvature results, the known curvature of the agarose-patterned substrates was used as a control. To reduce noise, curvature data were smoothed using 5-min time-averages. Additionally, the curvature profile was further smoothed when the maximum filament curvature was  < 0.3 μm−1 to decrease noise. For filaments displaying buckling, this step was unnecessary as their curvatures typically reached  ~1 μm−1, with a noise level of ~0.1 μm−1. To estimate MinD's concentration as a function of time, we quantified its cumulative fluorescent intensity in filaments (i.e., the total fluorescent signal of MinD in a filament) normalized by the area of the filament (Supplementary Fig. The value of MinD concentration, ρMinD, results from a balance between different processes: the (unknown) MinD's production, \(f\left({\rho }_{MinD}\right)\), the degradation (exponential), μ ⋅ ρMinD, and the protein dilution due to the increasing body mass, (1/V)(dV/dt)ρMinD (where V is the filament volume). That is, in general terms, the rate of change in MinD concentration as a function of time reads, \(d{\rho }_{MinD}/dt=f\left({\rho }_{MinD}\right)-\mu \cdot {\rho }_{MinD}-\left(\log \left(2\right)/\tau \right){\rho }_{MinD}=f\left({\rho }_{MinD}\right)-\alpha {\rho }_{MinD}\) where α is a constant (τ being the replication time) and where we used the fact that filaments increase their body mass exponentially32. Consequently, since our data indicates that dρMinD/dt ~0, i.e, \({\rho }_{MinD} \sim {{\rm{const. We note that this methodological approach of using the fluorescent signal to measure protein concentration has been used in the past and confirmed with Western Blot analyses49. MinD intensity profiles obtained from MicrobeJ were analyzed to perform Fourier analysis of MinD oscillations in both space and time. These profiles were also used to compute the Pearson correlation between MinD intensity and curvature profiles using Mathematica. High- and low-curvature regions were defined using a curvature threshold of 0.5 μm−1. High-curvature regions were defined from the left valley of the first peak, where curvature exceeded 0.5 μm−1 to the right valley of the last peak, exceeding this threshold (Supplementary Fig. Low-curvature regions were defined from the filament poles to these valleys. The correlation function was applied separately to each of these three regions (i.e., low curvature–high curvature–low curvature) for every filament. To analyze the relationship between MinD intensity and filament curvature, MinD intensity profiles were processed to determine the MinD envelope (Supplementary Fig. This approach avoided the influence of MinD pulse valleys. The maxima of MinD pulses were identified using the ‘FindPeaks' function in Mathematica, followed by interpolation of these points and discretization to recover the original number of points. This process yielded a new MinD profile, representing the envelope of the original MinD signal. At each point along the filament's arc length, s, the MinD intensity was normalized as: Curvature profiles were processed similarly, but without normalization. Curvature values were then grouped into the following bins:[0, 0.05), [0.05, 0.15), [0.15, 0.25), [0.25, 0.35), [0.35, 0.45), [0.45, 1), and [1, ∞). These bins, along with their corresponding MinDnorm. values, were fitted to the function: where κ is the curvature. saturates and does not follow Eqn (1). From the fit, we obtained a = 0.69 ± 0.07 and b = 0.08 ± 0.04 with R2 = 0.9. For agarose patterns, the last two bins were absent, as filaments did not reach those curvature values. The bacterial strain was grown, and agarose pads were prepared as described in “Strain and growth conditions” and “Agarose pads and patterned growth substrates”, respectively. Images were acquired using a ZEISS LSM 980 super-resolution confocal microscope equipped with a PLAN-Apochromat 63x/1.4 DIC M27-Oil lens, an Airyscan detector, and ZEN software. All experiments were performed at 37 °C using the built-in incubation system. Images were captured every 3 s for a total duration of 2.5 min. A 488 nm laser was used at 0.5% power (nominal output power 500 mW) with a 57 μm pinhole. Photobleaching was initiated after the fifth frame (15 s) by increasing the 488 nm laser power to 50% for 10 ms. The photobleached area was manually drawn using the polygonal selection tool to ensure it encompassed an entire MinD pulse. Recovery of fluorescence was monitored for a duration of 2.5 min, as photobleaching from repeated imaging precluded longer observations. Photobleaching was performed on regular-length cells and filaments under various conditions. For regular-length cells, two scenarios were considered (Supplementary Fig. 7): when MinD was fully concentrated at one bacterial pole, with no fluorescence at the opposite pole (Supplementary Fig. 7A), and when fluorescence was transitioning between the poles, with fluorescence visible at both poles (Supplementary Fig. For filaments showing three MinD pulses, photobleaching targeted the central pulse when MinD fluorescence was fully concentrated there, with no fluorescence at the poles (Supplementary Fig. For filaments showing more than three pulses, photobleaching was performed on a pulse located away from the poles (Supplementary Fig. To assess MinD diffusion in filaments, photobleaching areas were drawn to cover approximately half of the filament. Filaments were categorized as either straight (maximum curvature  < 0.5 μm−1) or buckled (maximum curvature  > 0.5 μm−1). In straight filaments, the analyzed pulse was the second pulse from this origin, whereas in buckled filaments, it was the first pulse located after the buckling region. Typically, this pulse was the second photobleached pulse, but depending on the filament's geometry, it could also be the first or third pulse (Fig. 3 A & B, orange and blue dots). The analysis of the selected pulse was conducted in Fiji by defining a circular region of interest (ROI) and plotting the Z-axis profile. Recovery time was defined as the first frame in which the fluorescence intensity of the photobleached pulse recovered to at least 30% of its pre-photobleaching intensity. The MinD oscillation period was measured by analyzing pulses in the non-photobleached regions of the filament and performing a Fourier transform to determine the oscillation period. Recovery time (tr) was normalized by dividing it by the characteristic MinD oscillation period (T) for each filament, yielding a dimensionless recovery time. 3A, blue and orange dots) was measured using the segmented line tool in Fiji and normalized by the characteristic wavelength of each filament (λ). Recovery velocity was computed as the ratio of the dimensionless distance to the dimensionless recovery time, yielding a dimensionless velocity (vr/c). This methodology allowed for the comparison of MinD dynamics between straight and buckled filaments, highlighting how mechanical deformation influences protein diffusion and recovery behavior. A microfluidic CellASIC ONIX2 BA04A03 system was used to study filament division after removal of the filamentation stressor. For each experiment, a single row of the device was utilized, pre-emptying wells 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. E. coli cells were grown as described in “Strain and growth conditions”, and 50 μl of culture was transferred to well 8 of the microfluidic device. Well 2 was filled with 200 μl of M9-supplemented media, while well 1 contained the same media supplemented with aztreonam at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μg/ml. To operate the device, a custom sequence was used: 1. Media from well 2 was flowed at 5 psi for 5 min to pre-clean the device. Cells were loaded by flowing E. coli (well 8) at 2 psi. After loading, media from well 2 was flowed at 1 psi for 30 min to 1 h to stabilize the cells. Media containing aztreonam (well 1) was then flowed at 1 psi for 3 to 5 h. 5. Finally, the flow was switched back to aztreonam-free media from well 2 for 3 h to observe filament division points under the microscopy system described in “Microscope settings”. Division points were manually identified using the phase-contrast channel of microscopy time-lapses. Curvature at each division point was calculated for the frame immediately preceding division using the code described in ‘Image and data analysis'. The probability density function (PDF) of curvatures at division points was obtained using MATLAB84 (‘histogram' function using the ‘pdf' normalization option). To compare this with the overall filament curvature, a second PDF was calculated for all curvatures of a filament. In this case, curvatures were smoothed using the MATLAB ‘smooth' function. For this analysis, only filaments with a maximum curvature  > 0.5 μm−1 and a minimum length of 8 μm were considered. To characterize DNA distribution within the filaments, the same microfluidic setup and loading protocol were followed. After cell loading, just media was flowed at 1 psi for 30 min. Media containing aztreonam was flowed at 1 psi for 3 h. 2. Aztreonam media supplemented with SYTOX Orange (Invitrogen) was flowed for 30 min to 1 h to stain DNA. Same media without SYTOX was then flowed at 5 psi for 5 min to remove excess background fluorescence. Time-lapses were acquired for 5 min (10 s interframe time) using phase-contrast and fluorescence channels with the microscopy set-up described in “Microscope settings”. Correlation between SYTOX intensity and filament curvature profiles was calculated using a customized MATLAB script, following the same protocol applied for MinD (see “Microscope settings”). The poles of filaments (1 μm from each end) were excluded from the analysis due to chromosome-free regions at the cell poles, consistent with previous findings62. To characterize FtsZ distribution within the filaments, the same microfluidic setup and loading protocol were followed using E. coli MG1655 (Ptrc99A-mut2gfp::ftsZ). Media was flowed at 1 psi for 30 min. Aztreonam media was flowed for 3 h to promote filamentation. Media without aztreonam was then flowed at 1 psi for 5 h. Time-lapses were acquired with 3 min interframe time using phase-contrast and fluorescence channels with the microscopy set-up described in “Microscope settings”. To characterize the temporal relationship between FtsZ and curvature, we calculated the cross-correlation between these two magnitudes for each point along the filament using the ‘xcorr' function in Matlab with the ‘coef' normalization. Prior to cross-correlation analysis, both the FtsZ and curvature signals were interpolated to have a common axis across the filament's body. Then, both signals were binarized. The FtsZ signal was binarized using the ‘findpeaks' function in Matlab. Peaks were identified by setting the ‘MinPeakHeight' parameter to the mean fluorescent signal intensity of the entire filament at a given time point and the ‘MinPeakProminence' parameter to 200. The values corresponding to these identified peaks were set to 1, while all other fluorescent values were set to 0. For the curvature signal, values greater than or equal to 0.5 were set to 1, and values below 0.5 were set to 0. Following binarization, the ‘xcorr' function with ‘coef' normalization was applied to determine the lag time between the appearance of an FtsZ ring (represented by a value of 1 in the binarized signal) and the occurrence of a curvature value ≥ 0.5 (also represented by a value of 1 in the binarized signal) for every spatial point along each filament. Since the delay difficults the direct correlation between Z-ring location and curvature value due to filament growth during that period, the position along the filament was normalized by its length at a given time (Fig. Time-lapse movies were acquired at 5 min intervals with an interframe time of 10 s. These time-lapses were projected into a single image that represents the average intensity of the signal of all frames using the ‘z project function' in Fiji, using the average intensity option. Then, this projected image was thresholded to isolate the filaments, resulting in a binary mask. The MicrobeJ plugin was used to process this mask and obtain the medial axis, as described in “Image and data analysis”. Using the medial axis data, custom-written Mathematica code was employed to calculate the maximum curvature of each filament profile. These curvature values were then compared to the corresponding filament lengths, which were also obtained using MicrobeJ. The length of the filaments at which buckling started, \(\hat{L}\), was chosen to be 10 μm (see Supplementary Fig. For the Dh5α strain used in our experiments, E is reported to range between 2 and 3 MPa44. For a thin hollow cylinder with radius r and wall thickness b, the second moment of inertia, I, can be expressed as I = πr3b86. Previous studies have reported a wall thickness of b = 4 nm for E. coli19,87. Using a radius of r = 0.5 μm88, we calculate a flexural rigidity of EI = 4.7 ⋅ 10−21 N ⋅ m2. Substituting these values into Eqn. (2), we obtain a critical loading force of F = 7.4 nN. E. coli filaments were modeled as a 2D chain of initial length L0 = 50 μm, defined by N = 161 nodes. Each node, i, was represented by Cartesian coordinates ri = (xi, yi) using a custom code written in R89. The characteristic distance between consecutive nodes was \({l}_{c}=\frac{{L}_{0}}{N-1}=0.31\) μm. This resolution was chosen to ensure approximately six nodes per 0.3 μm radius, corresponding to a maximum curvature of 3 μm−1. The initial coordinates for the chain were set as \({{{\bf{r}}}}_{i}=\left(i-1,i-1\right)\), with i ranging from 0 to N − 1. A random perturbation was applied to the yi coordinates, such that \({{{\bf{r}}}}_{i}=\left(i-1,i-1+{{\mathcal{N}}}\left(0,0.5\right)\right)\), where \({{\mathcal{N}}}\left(0,0.5\right)\) denotes a normal distribution with 0 mean and 0.5 variance. Two active forces were incorporated into the model: elastic and bending. For the elastic term, nodes were connected by linear springs with an elastic constant K and an equilibrium length \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)\) that depends on time to simulate filament growth. The elastic energy for a node i, \({E}_{{{{\rm{elastic}}}}_{i}}\), is given by: The bending energy, which promotes filament flattening, depends on the angle formed by three consecutive nodes. Normalized vectors \({\hat{{{\bf{R}}}}}_{j}={{{\bf{R}}}}_{j}/| {{{\bf{R}}}}_{j}|\) were used to ensure that the bending energy remains independent of the distances between nodes: Thus, the bending energy reaches a minimum when the angle formed by three consecutive nodes is 180° and its maximum when the angle is 0°. To perform the simulations we implemented a dimensionless form of the energy, \(\tilde{{E}_{i}}={E}_{i}/{E}_{c}\), defined as a function of the characteristic energy \({E}_{c}=K{l}_{c}^{2}\): The equation for the dynamics of a node reads \(m{\ddot{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{i}=-\nabla {E}_{i}-\gamma {\dot{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{i}\), m being the “mass” of a node and γ a friction coefficient (energy dissipation). Disregarding the inertia term (low Reynolds number) we finally obtain that \({\dot{{{\bf{r}}}}}_{i}=-\frac{1}{\gamma }\nabla {E}_{i}\) or, as a function of dimensionless units: \({\dot{\tilde{{{\bf{r}}}}}}_{i}=-\tilde{\nabla }\tilde{{E}_{i}}\); where a characteristic time tc = γ/K, linked to the dissipation of the elastic energy, was defined. Filament growth was implemented by increasing the preferred length between nodes, \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)\), as a function of time exponentially: \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)={l}_{0}\cdot {2}^{t/\tau }\), τ being the doubling time. The curvature at node i was defined as the inverse of the radius of the circle passing through nodes i −1, i, and i + 1, resulting in N − 2 curvature points. Statistics were generated by conducting 100 simulations with random seeds to initialize the perturbation of the y-coordinates. Simulation results were registered every 10 s to align with the experimental time-lapse interval. In simulations, to properly compare with the experiments, we implemented a pair-wise moving average that connects the middle points of adjacent springs connecting a node. Let us consider a chain of N (even) nodes as described in the previous section. For simplicity, the nodes are constrained to move along the x-axis, and only elastic energy is considered. Consequently, \({\left\vert {x}_{i+1}-{x}_{i}\right\vert }_{t=0}={l}_{0}\left(0\right),\) indicating that the system is initially in mechanical equilibrium. Due to the symmetry of the problem, the dimensionality of the system can be reduced to N/2, as \({x}_{1}\left(t\right)=-{x}_{N}\left(t\right)\), \({x}_{2}\left(t\right)=-{x}_{N-1}\left(t\right)\), and so on. This linear system can be solved, and it can be shown that \({\left\vert {x}_{i+1}-{x}_{i}\right\vert }_{t} > 0\,\forall \,t\). As expected, the exponential growth of the equilibrium length, \({l}_{0}\left(t\right)={l}_{0}{2}^{\frac{t}{\tau }}\), leads to increasing separation of the nodes over time. For instance, in the simplest case of N = 4 (one central spring surrounded by two springs at the ends), the ratio of the lengths between the end spring and the central spring over short times is given by: This implies that, regardless of the spring constant K, the dissipation coefficient γ, or the doubling time τ, elastic energy preferentially accumulates in the central spring due to growth. A signaling model based on that of Walsh et al.61 was used for the simulations presented in Figs. The model captures the most fundamental processes about the biochemistry of MinD and MinE species (including olygomerization of species and the MinE-mediated hydrolysis of MinD-ATP) and their transport properties. The model considers that proteins can be in different cellular interacting compartments (cytoplasm bulk, cytoplasm vicinity of the membrane, and the membrane) of exponentially growing filaments. In these equations Dz and \({E}_{{2}_{z}}\) represent MinD and MinE species either in the bulk of the cytoplasm (z = b) or in the vicinity of the cell membrane (z = m), whereas d, d2, e2, and d2e2 represent species in the membrane (see61 for details). This model differs from that of Walsh and coworkers by explicitly defining different regions in the cell cytoplasm. The model equations are integrated in a one-dimensional exponentially growing spatial domain (doubling time td) using a custom-made Mathematica83 code. The parameter values used in our simulations are (see61): The parameter ωbm is defined by the diffusivity properties of species in the cytoplasm and determines the rate to travel among different cytoplasmic regions as follows (see Table 2). The characteristic time related to a diffusive transport process is given by \(\tau={l}_{c}^{2}/{{\mathcal{D}}}\), where lc is a characteristic length scale and \({{\mathcal{D}}}\) is the diffusion constant. In our case, \({l}_{c} \sim (1{0}^{-1})\mu m\) (i.e., E. coli cell radius) and \({{\mathcal{D}}} \sim {{\mathcal{O}}}(1{0}^{1})\mu {m}^{2}\cdot {s}^{-1}\) (i.e., the cytoplasmic diffusivities of MinD and MinE). Thus, \(\tau \sim {{\mathcal{O}}}(1{0}^{-3})s\) and, consequently, we estimated the rate as ωbm ~1/τ ~103 s−1. To simulate a specific degree of curvature in our in silico filaments within an experimentally observed arc-length of s = 3 μm, we used the fact that s = θ ⋅ R = θ/∣κ∣, where θ and R are the angle and the radius of curvature, respectively. By imposing that ∣κ∣ = 1 μm−1, it follows that the simulated bending angle is θ ≃ 172° (see inset of Fig. To determine how the membrane diffusivity of species changes due to this simulated bending, we used a logarithmic dependency. This relationship dates back to the foundational work by Saffman and Delbrück and has been experimentally and numerically validated by posterior studies that also linked curvature with protein accumulation in agreement with our data54. Consequently, the diffusivity if ∣κ∣ = 1 μm−1 compared to the diffusivity at ∣κ∣ = 10−1 μm−1 (a value experimentally determined to be residual and indistinguishable from zero) reads \({{{\mathcal{D}}}}_{m}{| }_{| \kappa |=1}\simeq 0.7\times {{{\mathcal{D}}}}_{m}{| }_{| \kappa |=0.1}\) (i.e., ~30% decrease). As for how the MinD membrane binding rate, ωbd, changes as the curvature increases (∣κ∣ = 10−1 μm−1 ⟶ ∣κ∣ = 1 μm−1) we use values obtained from septins (membrane-binding nanoscopic proteins), see Fig. Following that study, in our case we implemented a two-fold change (i.e., 100% increase): ωbd∣∣κ∣=1 ≃ 2 × ωbd∣∣κ∣=0.1 (Supplementary Fig. We then tested different values of ωbd down to 10%, the minimum increase which did not disrupt MinD patterning (Supplementary Fig. In our simulations we integrated the equations for 10 min in a non-growing filament until a steady standing-wave formed. From this point, we integrated the equations for td = 50 min in a growing filament. Membrane diffusion drops or MinD binding increases due to curvature (i.e., filament bending) were implemented after 20 min of growth. In the in silico kymographs shown in this study, MinD accounts for the total concentration of MinD regardless of its cellular localization (i.e., both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound) or the olygomerization state (i.e., monomeric, multimeric, or MinE bound)54,55,92,93. Statistical analyses were performed using Mathematica and no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Filaments in contact with each other were discarded for the analysis of Fig. 1E (left) to analyze only those whose curvature appears naturally. 2 and 5, only filaments that grow and present a standing wave MinD pattern were selected. 3, those filaments whose MinD pattern was altered (or disrupted) after photobleaching were discarded. Representative images of filaments (Fig. 5F) are examples of the sample size indicated in their corresponding analyzed plots. Low-curvature and high-curvature correlation data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test in Fig. 5 (p  = 0.001) with statistically significant results. Straight and buckled filaments in Fig. 3 (p  = 0.5) were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test with no statistically significant results. p  < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. First, let's talk about Mars and its surprisingly lumpy interior. Late last month NASA shared what its now-defunct InSight lander found out about the Red Planet's insides. According to the new study the Martian mantle is full of large lumps, some as big as 2.5 miles across. According to a study published last Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine a common nasal spray could provide some protection against COVID.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Now, this study was fairly small, and it's also important to note that the research was funded by a German pharmaceutical company that made the azelastine spray used in the study. So for now the best way to prevent a COVID infection is still vaccination, including getting an annual booster to maintain your protection. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his FDA commissioner have stated that anyone who wants a shot will be able to get one, many Americans might now only be able to access COVID boosters as an off-label medication, which would likely mean insurance wouldn't cover the vaccination. And potential confusion over who's paying for the jab and how would surely make it harder to just stroll into a pharmacy for one. [CLIP:Joseph Ladapo speaking at a news conference: “The Florida Department of Health, in partnership with the governor, is going to be working to end all vaccine mandates in Florida law.” Feltman: That means children in Florida would be able to attend public school without receiving any immunizations. While all states currently allow exemptions from school vaccine mandates for medical reasons and most offer religious or personal exemptions, if not both, Florida would be the first state to do away with mandates entirely. In a press release published last Wednesday, the trio cited concerns that the CDC now “peddles ideology instead of science” and pledged to work together to develop immunization guidelines based on the advice of medical experts. We'll be talking more about fall vaccinations and how to get them in a future episode, so let us know if you have any questions. You can email us about COVID vaccines (or anything else) at ScienceQuickly@sciam.com. And if you are looking for more information on recent shakeups in public health leadership in the U.S., check out last Friday's episode. A study published last Wednesday found that people who used smartphones while on the toilet had a 46 percent higher risk of hemorrhoids. That's after the study authors controlled for other possible risk factors such as age and fiber intake. According to the Mayo Clinic, sitting for prolonged periods of time, and especially doing so on the toilet, is associated with developing hemorrhoids. The new study only surveyed 125 adults, but this isn't the first research that's come out linking scrolling with anal and rectal ailments. A study published in the Turkish Journal of Colorectal Disease back in 2021 looked at 882 people admitted to an outpatient clinic with hemorrhoids and compared them with a control group of 802, asking both to report on their bathroom and cell phone habits. Other studies have found that cell phones are often bacterial hotbeds, at least in part because of our tendency to surf the Web while pooping. Speaking of bacteria: a study published last week in Cell sheds new light on mammoth microbiomes. Researchers analyzed microbial DNA found on the bones and teeth of 483 specimens. The studied mammoth remains come from various parts of the world and range in age from more than one million years ago to just a few thousand. Once the researchers filtered out microbial species that would plausibly move in on the tooth and bone samples after an animal's death, they identified six microbial groups that likely paired up with mammoths in life. One genus they found is closely related to a pathogen that recently plagued African elephants. Another strain was reportedly determined to be a distant relative of a microbe that causes tooth decay in humans today. We'll wrap things up with one more animal story. A study published last Thursday in Science investigates how having thumbnails—as opposed to claws or hands with no thumbs at all—gives some rodents an evolutionary advantage when it comes to acquiring food that could help explain how these mammals spread all over the world in so many different varieties. By studying 433 rodent genus groups using specimens from Chicago's Field Museum, the researchers found that modern rodents can likely trace their short, nut-friendly thumbnails to a single common ancestor. That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday to talk about the infamous red meat allergy that's spreading via tick bite.
