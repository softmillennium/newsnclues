                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps Fred Vasseur was full of praise for the Ferrari fans at Monza, as Lewis Hamilton experienced his first Italian Grand Prix with the Scuderia. While the Scuderia could not deliver a podium for their fans at their home race, Charles Leclerc managed to come home fourth and Hamilton sixth – the latter improving from P10 on the grid after taking a five-place penalty. For Hamilton, it was his first taste of the Italian Grand Prix as a Ferrari driver, something he said he had been looking forward to all season long. "I don't know if it was expected from him or I don't know what he was expecting from this, but it was something mega and I think this gave him an extra boost all over the weekend. “Even tonight when he went to the fans to say hello and the Tifosi was something mega. “We didn't do the race of our life, we were expecting to be at least on the podium, we are not, but they are still there, they are still enthusiastic, still pushing and it's why I'm a bit disappointed that we were not able to give them a podium this weekend. Ferrari looked on the pace from the start at Monza, with Hamilton topping FP1 from his team mate. “Honestly, I think this started in Zandvoort last week. “During the race, he was fighting with Russell until Lap 30, that means that he was back in a better position.” Sixth was Hamilton's best Grand Prix finish since his fourth at Silverstone, and ended a run of two races outside the points. He has yet to finish on the Grand Prix rostrum this year, but Vasseur is convinced that is going to change in the last eight races. "Russell was a couple of times on the podium, [so] yes we can expect him to be on the podium.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Italian Grand Prix: Piastri and Leclerc battle it out for P3 in the opening laps There were mixed fortunes for Williams in the Italian Grand Prix as Alex Albon walked away from Monza with a hatful of points, while team mate Carlos Sainz was left frustrated by a difficult afternoon that saw contact and a battery issue derail his challenge. Following a difficult Qualifying that saw both cars exit in Q2, Williams opted to split strategies for Sunday's Grand Prix – starting Albon on the hard tyre and Sainz on the mediums. Even after he pitted, Albon managed to hold onto a points paying position and was rewarded with seventh at the flag – finishing as the lead midfield car. “Fantastic strategy and great car pace, I think those two together, you are going to have a good time of it,” Albon explained as he reflected on his race. “Honestly… It was meant to be a tough race on paper but actually we were the first hard car once everyone pitted. One of the best Sundays balance-wise I've had all year. “It always seems when we run the low downforce cars, our balance improves as well. “It proves we have a consistent car, it has been one of the biggest focus points for us last year and this year," Albon continued. But while Albon was left overjoyed with how his race unfolded in Italy, the same could not be said for his team mate. “Quicker than Bearman in front, quicker than Bortoleto, we were going to start passing at that stage but when I went for a move with Ollie, unfortunately we touched. “We also ran into some battery issues so a difficult day in the office.” Sainz has more than once this year found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time – just last week he was penalised after contact with Liam Lawson, he made contact with Charles Leclerc at Silverstone while brake and gearbox issues prevented him even starting the race in Austria. Sainz was asked what he can do to arrest his bad luck, with the Spaniard replying: “Keep pushing, like my Qualifying pace is there, my race pace is there so at some point it will finish.</p>
