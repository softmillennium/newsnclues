Exploring our solar system and returning pieces of it to Earth is a central part of the existential quest to search for life beyond our home planet.

Understanding the biosafety and biocontamination implications of landing on a planetary body or in bringing pieces of our solar system back to our home planet are the two themes that are central to planetary protection, a discipline that is unique to spacefaring nations.

The nature of planetary protection is twofold: (1) to ensure that we minimize our own terrestrial microbial footprint on other planets and moons (planetary bodies) in our solar system (forward contamination), and (2) to ensure that we minimize the potential impact of returning samples from another planet or moon to Earth (backward contamination).

The discipline of planetary protection focuses on who is the biological ‚Äúinvader‚Äù and when does their arrival indicate an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù? The degree to which there is potential for biological or organic interactions that result in biocontamination or changes in biosafety posture is the central topic of this work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russell Crowe earned three Oscar nominations between 1999 and 2001, but he's since entered a different phase of his career, starring in a wide variety of films each year. This leads him to uncover a secret the Vatican has kept buried for years. The Pope's Exorcist is streaming on Hulu in America but on Netflix globally, where it's entered the top 10 in several countries, including the Philippines. Crowe's charm mostly landed with general audiences, though. Despite negative critical reception, fans were extremely curious to see how Crowe's turn to the horror genre would be received, which led to the film finding massive financial success. It grossed $76 million at the box office against a modest $18 million budget, meaning it more than doubled its break-even point. Avery had previously worked with Sylvester Stallone on Samaritan, the critically panned superhero movie that's currently streaming on Prime Video. Russell Crowe will next star alongside Rami Malek and Michael Shannon in Nuremberg, which is coming to theaters on November 7, 2025. Richard E. Grant, Colin Hanks, John Slattery, and Leo Woodall have also been cast in the film, which wrapped production more than a year ago and has been seeking distribution since. James Vanderbilt, best known for his work as a scribe on Zodiac and The Amazing Spider-Man, is writing and directing Nuremberg. Check out The Pope's Exorcist on Hulu in America and Netflix globally, and stay tuned to Collider for more streaming updates.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I've been in fandoms my entire life, starting with The Vampire Diaries. I was content with my private little bubble of enjoying things. That all changed last year, when I became obsessed with AMC's small-screen adaptation of Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire and started seeking out connection again in online spaces, eager to recapture those same experiences I had as a high schooler on Tumblr. Now, modern fandoms are littered with harassment, doxxing, and racist attacks that target Black, trans, and/or otherwise marginalized users who speak up against policing ‚Äî and it's not showing signs of stopping any time soon. It starts with specific rhetoric, planting the seed of fear into young, insecure minds. A specific group of people is painted as the enemies, dehumanized, and dogpiled with harassment. I set out to investigate if other people were having the same experience. Mica*, who prefers to remain anonymous for fear of doxxing, first joined fandom spaces at eight years old with Neopets before going on to be a part of the Harry Potter, Marvel Cinematic Universe, Homestuck, and even SuperWhoLock (Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock) communities. ‚ÄúI feel as if fandom has largely lost a lot of its earnestness and creative drive, and has instead become largely reactionary, with non-creatives becoming BNFs [big name fans] based on takes and policing fandom,‚Äù they admitted. Similar to my own experience, Mica came up in the ‚ÄúDON'T LIKE, DON'T READ‚Äù era of fandom, where shipping non-canon gay pairings was seen as provocative and morally wrong. One fan group, Critics United (described as a ‚Äúvolunteer fandom police‚Äù), mass-reported specific stories they deemed inappropriate by leaving abusive comments. As a person of color, Mica had experiences with other fellow fans, often other POCs, harassing and doxxing them for perceived injustices over fictional characters. ‚ÄúInstead of reading anything I said as good faith, it became carte blanche to harass and bully me.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe argument we made is that people who otherwise would have been writing about this as a social issue have been scared away, or they've been locking their stories because we couldn't see those stories in our methods. Those other people are still posting them, but there was a real dramatic shift and the proportions of those stories changed,‚Äù Stanfill said. Like so much of fan culture, I think that's always been there, but it's just more visible,‚Äù said Dr. Ben Litherland, lecturer in Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Huddersfield, researcher, and co-host of the Ill Effects podcast. Algorithms play a huge role in this, one that entirely includes the collapse of context. People don't search hashtags on TikTok, Instagram, or Twitter anymore to find content; they let the platforms deliver the content to them. [Where you're] performing your fandom in front of the whole world, potentially. ‚ÄúIn the past, there wasn't so much discourse. People would argue, but it didn't launch entire bullying campaigns. You wouldn't harass them and encourage others to do [it], too. You'd argue in reblogs or asks, and that'd be it,‚Äù Dakota* said. Even a fandom known for its in-fighting and controversies, like Supernatural was back in the day, doesn't compare to what we're seeing now, but why? Dakota believes it's because of the political climate Gen Z and younger have grown up in. ‚ÄúThe pressure to be so woke that it's performative, coupled with the hive mind and groups ganging up on folks, even making up things to justify such behavior, is just wild. Ash, also known as @thisredwine on Twitter, has personal experience with this uglier side of fandom. While he got his fandom start dabbling in media like Star Wars, Vampire Academy, and First Kill, he's recently become more active in the Interview with the Vampire fandom, posting his thoughts after Season 2 of the show began airing from his perspective as a Black biracial trans person. ‚ÄúGetting to talk to so many people has been amazing ‚Äî especially other Black and trans folk who've been in touch ‚Äî but I've also been harassed really severely in the past few months,‚Äù Ash said. Within the IWTV fandom, Ash has been called anti-Black slurs, misgendered, and deadnamed several times on X in the last six months alone. He believes it's because he chooses to discuss the show from a race-centric perspective ‚Äî which IWTV invites its viewers to do, considering the AMC adaptation changed the story's main character, Louis de Pointe du Lac, from a white slave owner to a Black Creole man. ‚ÄúBIPOC having honest, good faith conversations about fandom racism and implicit bias isn't ‚Äòstarting drama' or supporting censorship, but unfortunately, a lot of people operating in bad faith try to frame it that way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe just want people to be more conscientious of how they might be perpetuating different forms of bigotry ‚Äî whether that's implicit bias, microaggressions, racist stereotypes or tropes, or enabling outright hate campaigns and macroaggressions ‚Äî and make an effort to do better.‚Äù ‚ÄúTheir ‚Äòanti-censorship' framework boils down to ‚Äòit isn't OK to harass me or my friends for the fictional material we enjoy, but it's ok if we harass others and doesn't take into account how marginalized groups are always the ones affected first and worst by censorship,‚Äù Ash said. It's internal, inspired by systems that restrict people in their everyday lives outside the internet. They've theorized this phenomenon is due to ‚Äúcontext collapse,‚Äù a term used most commonly in social media academic research where online spaces have become more singular experiences, existing outside established context. In real life, people know how to behave at work versus at home, for example, but online spaces are different now, with everyone co-existing together, Stanfill pointed out. ‚ÄúCommunities used to be in little enclaves, [with] the people writing these [explicit] stories and the people who just wanted to have nice fuzzy stories, didn't they interact with each other. One fan artist, Jay*, who preferred to speak under condition of anonymity, describes their online fandom experience as more annoying than enjoyable. They describe interacting in fandoms as constantly walking on eggshells. ‚ÄúIt feels more negative and less fun each day. It's more about infighting than actually appreciating the original media. There is less analysis, less fan works, and more discussions about the moral aspects of fan work and moral interpretations,‚Äù they said. Having grown up in a religious community, it was hard for Jay to ignore the fact that a lot of fandoms have adopted many of the same conservative talking points, like the notion that violent video games and movies equate to violent actions. ‚ÄúDepictions of violence are seen as negative, despite these being fictional. ‚ÄúIn my community, we were discouraged from analyzing the messages of any media, and just judge based on their moral depictions of any topic, on a very superficial level.‚Äù This overcorrection problem in fandom is something Noor has seen, too. ‚ÄúI think there's been a rise in ‚Äòpuriteens,' a subset of fandoms that includes younger fans (not necessarily teens) who take umbrage with certain content ‚Äî sometimes it's sexual content where the reasoning is ‚Äòwhy is everything about sex?' but it's often also content where characters aren't portrayed as morally good all the time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt feels like, at some point, people began policing things that are ‚Äòproblematic,' which at first does not seem like a conservative way to approach fandom, but it eventually morphed into a prescriptive approach to fandom where there's a right and wrong way to engage with characters and ships.‚Äù Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. This is a really insightful article but I think it could go deeper honestly. I don't think laying the fault entirely at Gen Z's feet is fair, but can you blame them? At least millennials grew up having kid specific spaces online where we could learn about how to interact with other humans on the internet. And then they spent their most important adolescent years not even being able to see each other IRL. So it makes sense that the kind of interpersonal petty infighting they'd normally have with their real life friends are happening with strangers on the internet where, as the author rightly pointed out, they are clumsily still discovering their politics and points of view and are in a stage of psychological development where they have very strong opinions that they feel very passionate about. But the internet‚Äîand especially fast moving spaces like Twitter‚Äîare notoriously bad at giving people the grace and space to evolve and be wrong. It also feels VERY worth noting that this seems to have been written before SDCC when several IWTV fans, including one of the people interviewed here for having been doxxed, themselves doxxed a handful fans for, seemingly, not liking the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù ship. The SDCC incident involved a Black fan (who has been notorious in the fandom for previously doxxing other Black fans and calling them a number of anti-black slurs, again over which characters they ship) calling the San Diego convention center and other law enforcement to make a false charge that several fans who were attending the con were stalking one of the actors and intended him harm. With regards to your previous comment, black fans, and especially the one being interviewed in this article, did not doxx people at SDCC. That is a bold faced lie and its frankly in extremely poor taste to spread it on an article about someone being stalked, doxxed and harassed for almost a year straight. Blaming random black fans for doxxings is disturbing to say the least, especially when the fans have proven time and time again that they had nothing to do with the SDCC or any other doxxing and when many of the black fans you are describing have been doxxed themselves.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the neon-lit sprawl of a near-futuristic Tokyo, Tokyo Underground Killer immerses players in a gritty cyberpunk underworld. The story unfolds through nearly 100 pages of hand-drawn comic scenes, blending dark humor and existential yearning. This narrative, steeped in supernatural intrigue and Tokyo's criminal underbelly, sets a feverish tone, with the city's catacombs hiding secrets about a demonic invasion by creatures known as Flatliners. The story's mix of violence and introspection creates a compelling backdrop, reminiscent of the cyberpunk noir found in Katana ZERO, though with a distinctly Japanese flavor. The game's world exploration is a love letter to Tokyo's iconic districts. Between intense missions, Kobayashi's apartment in Kabuki-Cho, Tokyo's infamous red-light district, serves as a personal hub where players can unwind. The catacombs, a labyrinthine network beneath the city, add layers of mystery, encouraging exploration to uncover narrative clues and hidden upgrades.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indulging our imaginations and looking for explanations beyond the conventional isn't uncommon, even among those of us who might self-describe as a materialist, that is, someone who puts all their stock in physical matter and rejects the notion of the spiritual world. In many cultures these days, materialism tends to be the prevailing mode of thought. Not unlike the ancients who interpreted drought as divine punishment, we're naturally inclined to attribute agency to events that have no immediate or obvious explanation. It's why, on hearing a creaking floorboard in an empty house, your initial instinct might be to stop and listen for an intruder ‚Äî one that's physically present or visiting from the astral plane. "We like to have control in our environment, and so beliefs play a role that way," says Brian Laythe, director of the Institute for the Study of Religious and Anomalous Experience and co-author of the book Ghosted! "What they do is they provide you with a map of how you think the world is going to behave on a day-to-day basis. Placing people in environments where they don't know what's coming next almost immediately causes mental breakdowns. Furthermore, materialism is a relatively new philosophy that's working against millennia of accepted social behaviors. For most of the time that humankind has been attempting to make sense of the world, paranormal explanations were considered just as valid as any other. Here in the 21st century, thanks in part to the adoption of the scientific method, we have far more documented knowledge and instruments of observation and measurement at our disposal than at any point in human history. "One of the things I keep highlighting for my students is this whole idea of confirmation bias because we keep running into it. "It's why people watch really engrossing fantasy movies," he says. "But we also have to note that enchantment can be positive or negative, right? Is all that to say, then, that humans' enduring interest in the supernatural comes down to our desire for a little more mystery in the world? That it's a byproduct of some remaining ancient mental wiring pushing us toward those conclusions? That it's explained by our stubborn insistence on simple explanations? In Ghosted!, Laythe and his co-authors raise the concept of Haunted Person Syndrome and propose that there could be a number of factors at work ‚Äî some psychological, some less clear-cut. That lack of definitiveness probably won't be enough to win over many skeptics, but it might offer some hope to the sizable portion of belief-leaning respondents in the Gallup survey. They were the most rejected group among skeptics and believers alike. The original print version of this article was headlined "Seeing Ghosts?"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One company sniffles, and someone declares it woke. Just look at what happened with American Eagle and Cracker Barrel over the summer. Americans are seeing everything as politically coded, even when it's not. Corporate America has played a role in fostering all of this culture war tea-leaf reading. Over the past decade or so, more firms have waded more explicitly into politics, often because it seemed good for their bottom lines, and now many are trying to reverse course. Companies are backing away from any moves that might rock the boat and taking a real "nothing to see here" approach to their messaging. "People are putting a political overlay to everything," says Kevin Lane Keller, a marketing professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. The United States is turning into a nation of conspiracy theorist consumers. We're doing QAnon, but for capitalism ‚Äî and people of all political stripes are strapping on their tinfoil hats. Trying to explain the dustup over Sydney Sweeney's ad campaign for American Eagle in July makes me feel a little bonkers. The actor was featured in spots declaring that "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," the play on words being that she also has great "genes," as in, she's good-looking. Conservatives swept in to defend Sweeney and claim her as one of their own. August's blowup over Cracker Barrel's new logo made the American Eagle tussle look like small potatoes (which, to be fair, it was). The restaurant scrapped the old guy leaning on a barrel from its corporate logo, opting for what I'm sure some consultant told them was a sleeker, more modern look. The right, however, decided it was a signal that Cracker Barrel had gone woke and that the decision to abandon its old aesthetic reflected an abandonment of traditional values. Cracker Barrel tried to explain that it was just a simple branding tweak. After about a week, the company said it would change its logo back. Calvin Klein commercials in the '90s were criticized for being too sexy. But historically, outside a few fringe culture warriors, the public conversation has been more "this is ugly" than "this offends or aligns with my deeply held political sensibilities." The mood around these corporate quarrels became noticeably more intense in recent years ‚Äî and explicitly partisan. The Bud Light controversy of 2023 wasn't political. "Everyone is looking now at brands and reading these brand moves and trying to suss out what it's signaling and if the brand is trying to send a message or trying to shift their purpose or signal a change in their identity or the audience they're going after." It's no secret that Americans tend to wrap up their identities in the things they buy. As the country has become more politically polarized, we've started to graft politics onto our purchasing habits, too. People have increasingly sorted their brand preferences in a partisan manner, says Oded Netzer, a business professor at Columbia Business School. His research finds that since the 2016 elections, brands' online followings have become more split along partisan lines. That was especially the case for Democrats after their first loss to Trump: Many started seeking "Democratic" companies to buy from, even if the companies themselves didn't change. After Trump lost in 2020, Republicans started picking their own corporate champions more. It's a form of "compensatory consumption," Netzer says, when people buy things to make up for some sort of perceived deficit or reinforce their identities. "Our political identity is much stronger than it was before. Ten years ago, the Cracker Barrel branding change probably wouldn't have made the same waves as it has today, he says, "because we are all living with a political identity that is much more salient." Companies have always done politics to some extent ‚Äî making donations, lobbying for lower taxes, etc. But they were generally pretty quiet about their activities. Elisabeth Kempf, an associate professor of finance at Harvard Business School, says businesses' recent, more public engagement with political topics may have had the "unintended consequence" of changing people's perceptions of corporate America. Companies talk about politics more, and people have gotten used to it. When companies have taken political stances in the past, many of them didn't really mean it. It just looked good to say they supported Black Lives Matter in 2020 or were serious about corporate responsibility and ESG after major investment leaders, who also happened to be massive shareholders of public companies, made a fuss about it. It's another piece of evidence that the talk has been more about winning than believing. And partisanship aside, brands have done a lot of legwork to develop and reiterate identities over time that consumers are constantly reading into. When company logos have little Easter eggs in them and commercials come with winks and nods, people start to map a deeper meaning onto things. I sincerely doubt anyone on the American Eagle marketing team thought they were sending a subliminal message about Nazism, or anyone at Starbucks was out to take down Christmas when they gave plain red cups the go-ahead for the 2015 holiday season. For older brands such as Cracker Barrel, heritage is always a "double-edged sword," Keller says. "It helps you in the way of a lot of emotional attachment and feelings, but at the same time, you're not maybe seen as relevant. Brands have to move forward and become more modern, especially as their original customer bases age. Angry letters have always existed, but now some clout-chasing guy can post that letter on TikTok and X and try to get others to cosign. There's money to be made in manufacturing outrage. Partisan media ecosystems thrive on ginning up anger over contrived controversies. There's a financial payoff for influencers who blow whatever whistle of the day. Some companies may make the calculation that it's just best to forge ahead in this environment, but a lot of that depends on understanding who their customers are. American Eagle has said its Sydney Sweeney campaign ‚Äî plus a collaboration with Travis Kelce, the NFL star who's Taylor Swift's new fianc√© ‚Äî has been a boon. "The first thing is to realize that you do live in a different world where you are going to be interpreted politically," Netzer says. Keller says this level of hyperreactiveness among consumers has led him to shift his thinking on ad testing. It used to be that if you knew your customer well enough beforehand, you could be creative in crafting an ad and send it out with confidence. "The money you spend on that is well worth spending versus having your brand dragged through a bunch of negative mud and everything, however long," Keller says. Good business leaders are accustomed to undertaking financial calculations ahead of any ad campaign or brand change. Now, they've got to make some political calculations, too. It's easy to look back at Pizzagate and laugh. At one point, a guy showed up at the restaurant with a gun to "self-investigate" the obviously false claims. The conspiracy theories about the relatively bland antics from corporate America may not be as outlandish or the consequences as scary, but an increasing number of people are seeing codes and signs where they're not. Politics feels inescapable and hopeless at the same time, and so buying something, or getting mad at a company that sells something, is the best approximation some people have to doing something. Like, don't be the guy at the party everyone low-key avoids because he gets weird and annoying really fast. And right now, a lot of us are being that guy. By all means, shop your values, but within reason. Ads and redesigns often don't have deeper meaning; a brand would just like to sell you things and remind you that it's there. And remember that companies really have only one core value: making money for shareholders.

Polish border guards reported the discovery of debris from an unidentified flying object in a village near the border with Belarus, police said late on Sunday, the latest in a series of similar incidents in the NATO-member state.

"Today, before 10:00 PM, the officer on duty at the Terespol police station received a report from Border Guard officers about the discovery of debris from an unidentified flying object near the Terespol border crossing in Polatycze," local police wrote on Facebook.

"We are securing the site of the discovery. No one was injured in the incident."

Poland has been on high alert for objects entering its airspace since a stray Ukrainian missile struck a southern Polish village in 2022, killing two people, a few months into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

On Saturday, an object likely to be a smuggling drone fell in eastern Poland, a defence ministry spokesperson said.

In August, a drone crashed into a cornfield in eastern Poland, scorching crops and shattering windows in nearby homes. A prosecutor investigating the incident said at the time it appeared to have entered Poland from the direction of Belarus, an ally of Russia.

Military drones have also crashed in Romania and the Baltic states.
