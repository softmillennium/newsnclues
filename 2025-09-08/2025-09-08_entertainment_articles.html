Likewise, none of the gimmicky themed realms that Joan is offered to “live in” — Capitalist World, Studio 54 World, Weimar World, (“Now with 100% less Nazis!”) — feel like the kind of place you'd want to spend more than a few hours, let alone several billion years. “‘Til death do us part” is romantic, practical, and offset by the backdoor insurance policy of divorce. “‘Til the sun explodes, and then maybe even longer after that” is an ungodly prison sentence. Freyne's hyper-agnostic film may not believe in heaven or hell, but it has some pretty vivid ideas of what the latter could look like.A more ambitious — and less conservative — movie might have used this premise to dig a bit deeper into the commitments that people make to each other on this mortal coil, but “Eternity” is content to circle the idea that life is beautiful and worth treasuring because it doesn't last forever. That much is clear from the moment Freyne and Pat Cunnane's high-concept script (a real Black List special) first drops us into the Hyatt-like Junction where souls process what's happened and have seven days to pick their final destinations from a variety of convention floor displays. It's enough to make us yearn for the gender reveal party where Larry choked to death on a pretzel; at least that came with the promise of an ending. Related Stories Benny Safdie and Dwayne Johnson Are Already Trying to Reunite — This Time Adapting a '70s Book About Lizard Musicians from Space ‘Nuremberg' Review: Yes, It Seems the World Still Needs to Be Reminded of the Horrors of WWII But the film's characters are too caught up in their post-mortem love triangle to realize they're essentially fighting over what meal Joan should choose to eat every single day of her infinite afterlife: her favorite comfort food, or a rare delicacy she's been fantasizing about ever since her last taste of it in 1953. Larry is the first dead person we follow into the Junction, and like everyone else his physical form reverts to reflect how it looked when he was at his happiest, which for him was in his mid-30s after he first got married. The kind of nondescript everyman who loved to complain even though he walked through life without much want or trouble, Larry feels like a guy you'd meet in the buffet line on a cruise ship. He's as nice as he is nondescript, and the jaded but personable Afterlife Coordinator assigned to his case (Da'Vine Joy Randolph as Anna) can't wait to meet and forget her next client.That changes, and how, when Anna realizes that the Junction's handsome local bartender is Joan's first love, and that Joan is the reason he took a service job in purgatory rather than choose a permanent vacation in paradise; Luke has been pouring beer and scrubbing glasses for more than half a century in the hopes that he and Joan might be reunited when she dies. Which, conveniently enough, she does just a few moments before Larry is meant to board a train for the godforsaken eternity he's chosen for himself (Beach World). Suddenly, and to the great delight of both Anna and her fellow AC, Ryan (John Early), there's some real juicy drama in the Junction. Like a metaphysical riff on Netflix's “The Ultimatum,” she'll get a trial run with both of them before having to make up her mind. “Eternity” does what it can to leverage its heady concept into a heart-stirring tale of love and longing, but the world-building — or lack thereof — invariably gets in the way of the emotion that Freyne is hoping to generate from it. While the movie's three-sided romance is never quite as artificial as the Junction where so much of it takes place, its angles lose their sharpness over the course of a story that has so much scenery to attend to, and each of its main characters is left to fight an uphill battle against the archetype that threatens to define them. Teller's upbeat, go-with-the-flow charm makes him easy to accept as a simple guy who just wants — and expects — his afterlife to resemble the one he left on Earth, and the fact that he's more of a leading man than a characer actor lends an extra zing to the constant jokes about how much hotter Callum Turner is, like any of us could hope to compete with the future Mr. Lipa (someone in the movie compares Luke to Montgomery Clift, and Turner channels that matinee idol energy to a tee). While Joan flip-flops about her feelings more often than John Kerry on the campaign trail (a painfully outdated reference that's still a few decades too recent for Larry to use or Luke to understand), her anguish is palpable enough to anchor the movie to something real as it runs between different fantasy worlds. For their part, Early and Randolph both feel held down in a less fortunate way; much as this gifted pair compensates for the comedy that “Eternity” can't wring out of its leads (and have solid chemistry to boot), you can almost feel them being smothered by the schematic nature of a story that doesn't have room for them to cut loose. It's a story that's better told by its setting than with its action — one that doesn't really go anywhere, and still takes the scenic route to get there. In that light, Zazu Myers' production design probably deserves top billing here. We don't get to see enough of the Junction to disabuse us of the sense that it's a glorified Broadway backdrop (complete with painted skylines and cloth scrims to indicate whether it's day or night), but the well-observed tackiness of its mid-century aesthetic, and the related impression that purgatory didn't exist until Don Draper invented it as an advertising opportunity, helps underscore the idea that life in any realm is only as tolerable as the people with whom you choose to spend it. In doing so, it somewhat forfeits the film's prevailing message — that life is beautiful as a result of its brevity and occasional bitterness — in favor of a more digestible morale about the paradises we create for ourselves here on Earth. It's a fitting compromise for such a pleasantly unobjectionable rom-com; one that's scared of forever, but takes almost just as long just to end up back where it started.

Coming very quickly off Johnson's awards buzz for “The Smashing Machine” and Safdie's Best Director win at Venice where the film made its world premiere, Safdie and Johnson are reuniting again for a package that would star Johnson and that Safdie would write and direct, an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire. The film is called “Lizard Music,” and it's based on a 1976 young adult science fiction novel by author Daniel Pinkwater. Suffice it to say, the premise is bonkers. As he tries to learn more about them, he meets The Chicken Man (Johnson), who is aware of the lizards and may be from outer space and about to lead an invasion. The official logline does little to make it more sensical: Related Stories ‘Eternity' Review: Elizabeth Olsen Has to Choose Her Own Heaven in an A24 Rom-Com That's Stuck in Purgatory ‘Nuremberg' Review: Yes, It Seems the World Still Needs to Be Reminded of the Horrors of WWII His search for answers leads him to the eccentric and whimsical Chicken Man and his beloved companion, a seventy-year-old chicken named Claudia — two kindred spirits who have also glimpsed the impossible. United by this shared vision, they set off on an adventure that begins as a hunt for a hidden society but blossoms into something far greater: a voyage through invisible worlds, unexpected harmonies, and the unbreakable bond between lost souls who discover magic not only in what they find, but in each other. The Rock playing an MMA fighter in a biopic seems within the realm of possibility, but whatever this is definitely appears to be taking him out of his wheelhouse. Johnson would also produce the film through his Seven Bucks Productions, and he'd be teaming with Safdie and “Smashing Machine” producer David Koplan. Reviews for “The Smashing Machine” were strong, with IndieWire writing that the film is a “sweet duet between a remarkably unembellished Johnson and a blazingly good, blue-collar and freshly blown-out Emily Blunt.” And though its not your typical awards bait, we also told you to believe the hype The Rock was cooking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate has put in motion a sequel to The Last Witch Hunter, to star Vin Diesel in a reprise of his role as Kaulder, the immortal Witch Hunter. The film is being developed along with Diesel's One Race Films and Lionsgate, with all parties eyeing a fast path to production. While a deal has not been finalized, Michael Caine is attached to reprise his role as Dolan in the new film. The move goes with Lionsgate strategy to grow IP with staying power and sci-fi fantasy spectacle elements that can overperform in the ancillary markets and create long-term library value. The pic has performed consistently in ancillary markets and re-emerged as a streaming hit this year; it ranks among the five most-viewed movies on Netflix. Said Adam Fogelson, chair of Lionsgate's Motion Picture Group: “The Last Witch Hunter has grown since its theatrical release into a global fan favorite, with audiences continuing to discover and re-watch it across every platform over the past decade. That enduring enthusiasm made clear there is an appetite for more stories set in this world. Vin and I have partnered many times over the years, and he is a true force in our industry. I'm thrilled to be reuniting with him as he returns to this iconic role, and excited by how advancements in filmmaking technology now allow us to economically deliver a sequel on an even more ambitious scale.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Michael is gonna come out of retirement for this? Michael Caine missed receiving his Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters because he was filming Jaws 4 and getting $1 million dollars for 2 weeks work. I bet he's getting the equivalent of that today, $3 million for a quick week's work. That doesn't mean the film will be good, in fact it will probably be pretty terrible, and a lot worse than the original film that sucked. The bar is pretty low for what Diesel fans expect these days, so it'll probably be a cheap b-movie with an extreme straight-to-streaming look. Vin's career is on the way down the ladder, but he's got enough of a fan base that he'll avoid having to sell his soul to the likes of Corey Large and Edward Drake like some other's have. Michael Caine on Jaws 4: Caine famously admitted to never having seen Jaws: The Revenge, calling it one of the worst movies he ever made, but defended the decision by saying it was worth it to buy the house for his mother, which he described as “marvelous”. Remmember he also did Jaws Revenge for paycheck. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jay Harrington and Patrick St. Esprit are set to reprise their original roles from CBS' S.W.A.T. Exiles, reteaming with Shemar Moore in the pilot episode. The news will be a welcome surprise for fans, who have been heartbroken and outspoken since their early exits from S.W.A.T., and learning later from Harrington that he was unaware of the offshoot until a day before the media announcement, when Moore texted him. 'Exiles': Sony Pictures Television Is "Figuring Out" If Other 'S.W.A.T' Stars Will Join Spinoff 's Jay Harrington Says He Was Disappointed At The Way The Spinoff Was Announced But "You Don't Get Owed Things Just Because You Put In Your Time" I've also had a great time directing over the years, and I'll be open to that possibility if that call [to direct] comes as well. Sony Pictures TV boss Katherine Pope, around the time of the fan backlash, teased that franchise favorites could return in Exiles. Whether Harrington and St. Esprit will appear in further episodes remains unclear. Exiles is set after a high-profile mission goes sideways, pulling Sgt. Daniel ‘Hondo' Harrelson (Moore) out of forced retirement to lead a last-chance experimental S.W.A.T. unit made up of untested, unpredictable young recruits. Jason Ning serves as showrunner and executive producer. Additional executive producers include Neal H. Moritz and Pavun Shetty of Original Film, as well as Moore, James Scura, and Jon Cowan. Sony Pictures Television produces and distributes the 10-episode series globally. Harrington is best known for his roles in S.W.A.T. He can previously be seen recurring in ABC's Desperate Housewives and the medical drama series Private Practice, as well as CBS' Code Black. He is repped by UTA, A Management Company, and Brecheen Feldman Breimer. St. Esprit has recurred on TV shows including The Shield, Saving Grace, Chicago Code, Revolution, Scandal, Sons of Anarchy, NCIS: LA, Narcos, Ballers, and Unsolved.

That said, Harrington is too good an actor for this material. I was hoping this would give him the opportunity to really act in something good.

Those trials were vividly brought to life in Stanley Kramer's 1961 classic “Judgment at Nuremberg,” which notably included real footage of the Nazi concentration camps to illustrate some of the horrors that were perpetrated by the accused (and, of course, later convicted).

As with Kramer's film, the footage nearly stops time, astonishing and horrifying and revolting, as the courtroom and its many inhabitants attempt to process what they are seeing. It's the darkest moment of a film that shouldn't need to crib liberally from its predecessor to make its mark, and yet does just that, repeatedly, and in a multitude of ways. In both feel and form, “Nuremberg” is either classic or staid, depending on your stomach for such films. If there are people who still need to be convinced that the Holocaust did indeed happen — and, tragically, yes, that seems to be the case these days — bits of “Nuremberg” might battle back their woeful misunderstandings. But in trying to sell the idea that what happened during World War II is timely above all else, the historic tragedy itself is forgotten. That the film is so deeply rooted in reminding people of the perils of politicizing hatred is a cruel irony; by making this about today, we lose the potent lessons of yesterday. The war is, in many respects (but crucially, not all), over. Hermann Göring (a deeply invested Russell Crowe) — the highest-ranking German military official of all time, a man so powerful in the Nazi party that he was given the title of Reichsmarschall, a designation created entirely for him and that made him superior to every single German military officer — has been arrested. And he, along with two dozen or so major Nazi players, has been thrown into a secret military prison as the Allies determine what they will do with them. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson (a restrained but still powerful Michael Shannon) has an idea: a trial, a tribunal, in which the Allies will come together to try and convict the Nazis. Jackson's idea (the film doesn't try to make the trial entirely his concept, but comes damn close) doesn't have much legal precedence, but he's convinced it's the only way to not only punish these evil-doers, but make them such pariahs that Germany wouldn't dare to rise again (just as they had after World War I and its own kind of punishments). But Kelley approaches the task with a twofold plan: He'd like to eventually write a book about what he discovers about his patients (like Göring, the good doctor was, at heart, pretty ambitious), one that will help everyone “dissect evil” so that we might battle it better. But while Jackson and Kelley should feel aligned in their aims, “Nuremberg” keeps them far apart and at odds, instead turning its attention on the growing bond between Kelley and Göring. That Kelley and Göring become something like friends is essential to the entire thrust of the film and Kelley's eventual findings — there's nothing inherently different about these evil men, and they may even be able to sway good men to their side through charming chatter and shared experience — but it's delivered in the most plain-faced way possible. Kelley goes all-in too early (only a scene-stealing Leo Woodall, as an American solider with a secret, brings the appropriate level of dubiousness to the pair's exchanges). Early wins for Kelley (ah ha, Göring does understand English!) Instead, we watch the two men chatter and bicker, playing games both of the head and board variety, waiting for something — anything — to change between them. As Jackson and his team assemble a case and courtroom just feet from the war criminal's cells, “Nuremberg” tries to build its own arguments (the courtroom and cells, it must be noted, look fantastic, thanks to production designer Eve Stewart). The Nazi leaders didn't know anything? Once Kelley starts visiting Göring's wife and daughter, getting cozy, teaching Göring's cute kiddo magic kids, and ferrying messages back and forth to boot, things get really sticky. What exactly is Kelley getting out of this? We're long past the doc ingratiating himself with Göring for information — and how silly to assume that either man was stupid enough to ever forget the very real power dynamics in their interactions — and so these visits seem to exist simply for discomfort's sake. That the real Kelley was married during this period is never mentioned (Kelley, in many ways, is wholly unknowable to us). That perhaps he missed his own wife (with whom he would go on to have three children) and wanted some temporary domestic comforts is never considered. Easy enough characterization, likely true, and yet fully skated over here. Malek is quite good in the role, thin as it might be, bringing real curiosity and confusion to Kelley, portraying him as someone inscrutable who really didn't want to be. There are little asides about Göring's self-obsession that scan as funny (when he surrenders to the military, he only asks them to carry his luggage, hardy-har-har) and sequences that only flow because of snappy overlapping dialogue (“We'll never get Russia on board!” cut to “Sir, Russia is on board!”). By the time Vanderbilt unspools that same iconic, wrenching footage that Kramer used decades ago, its potency feels different. But in the space between those two statements, “Nuremberg” can't find much new to say. Saying something old is certainly better than not saying anything at all, but how, at this moment, can we still be leaning on the old words and the old ways? “Nuremberg” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. Sony Pictures Classics will release the film in theaters on Friday, November 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the KPop Demon Hunters smash reigns, Carpenter's "Tears" debuts at No. KPop Demon Hunters has also become the first soundtrack to generate four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s over the chart's 67-year history. The songs place in the bracket for a third week, with Saja Boys' “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” each down a spot from their respective Nos. Also in the Hot 100's top 10, Sabrina Carpenter charts two songs: “Tears” launches at No. Both tracks are from her new album, Man's Best Friend, which blasts in as her second No. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Sept. 13, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Sept. 9. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 34.5 million official streams (down 2% week-over-week), 22.1 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 13%) and 9,000 sold (up 4%) in the United States Aug. 29-Sept. 4. The track secures a seventh week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; rises 29-24 on Radio Songs — as it hits the top 10, lifting two spots to No. 10, on the Pop Airplay chart; and adds a second week at No. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.) “Golden” becomes just the second such song to post at least four weeks at No. Plus, “Golden” ties for the fourth-longest Hot 100 command for a song by an all-female group of three or more members, dating to the first four-week No. Sabrina Carpenter scores two songs in the Hot 100's top five: “Tears” debuts at No. Both cuts are from her new album, Man's Best Friend, which arrives atop the Billboard 200. “Tears” starts with 26.3 million streams (good for a No. 2 premiere on Streaming Songs), 11.9 million in airplay audience and 2,000 sold. Carpenter collects her fifth Hot 100 top 10, all since April of last year. It charges 25-5 on Streaming Songs, which it led for one week, and climbs 5-3 for a new high on Radio Songs. Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. Below Carpenter and Saja Boys' two Hot 100 top 10s apiece, Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, slides 3-7, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” falls 6-8 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. Below HUNTR/X's “How It's Done,” which concurrently adds a 10th week at No. 1 on the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart, Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and went on to become the year's No. It logs a record-extending 107th week on the chart overall and a record-furthering 77th week in the top 10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over 1,300 filmmakers, actors, and other industry professionals have pledged to boycott Israeli film institutions that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” That figure comes from the advocacy group Film Workers for Palestine, which shared the pledge on Instagram today alongside an open letter elaborating on its aim to “‘do everything humanly possible' to end our complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza.” Many high profile names have signed on, including Ava DuVernay, Ayo Edebiri, Boots Riley, Brian Cox, Gael García Bernal, Hannah Einbinder, Javier Bardem, Josh O'Connor, Joshua Oppenheimer, Mark Ruffalo, Melissa Barrera, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Susan Sarandon, Tilda Swinton, and Yorgos Lanthimos. In a press release, Film Workers for Palestine explained that the pledge was inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, a 1987 movement kicked off by Jonathan Demme, Martin Scorsese, and “100 other prominent filmmakers” to demand that the U.S. refuse to distribute films in apartheid South Africa. “As filmmakers, actors, film industry workers, and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions. “We pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions—including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies—that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” The letter further clarifies that “examples of complicity” include “whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.” Many of these signatories also added their name to a mass call on SAG-AFTRA to instate protections for actors speaking out in support of Palestine last year. Other signatories include Adam McKay, Aimee Lou Wood, Benedict Wong, Brian Eno, Cynthia Nixon, Debra Winger, Emma Seligman, Ilana Glazer, Lukas Dhont, Morgan Spector, and Paapa Essiedu. You can read the full text of Film Workers for Palestine's open letter below: As filmmakers, actors, film industry workers, and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions. The world's highest court, the International Court of Justice, has ruled that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza, and that Israel's occupation and apartheid against Palestinians are unlawful. Inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid who refused to screen their films in apartheid South Africa, we pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions—including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies—that are implicated* in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people. * Examples of complicity include whitewashing or justifying genocide and apartheid, and/or partnering with the government committing them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hangout shows usually apply to comedies like Seinfeld, Friends, Happy Endings, and, most recently, Adults. The hook here isn't the whodunit; it's spending time with Mabel Mora (Selena Gomez), Oliver Putnam (Martin Short), and Charles Haden Savage (Steve Martin). Any narrative flaws as they go around confronting killers and recording a podcast about it are easy to forgive amidst all of their banter. After all, Mabel, Oliver, and Charles have gone from neighborly acquaintances battling loneliness to being the subjects of a Hollywood movie in no time, brushing shoulders with fans and celebrities along the way. Now, in a repetitive yet enjoyable fifth season, they come face to face with the mafia, wealthy CEOs, and a robot with potentially nefarious intentions. But it doesn't matter how many well-known faces join the cast (including Oscar winners Christoph Waltz, Renée Zellweger, and Dianne Wiest this year), how far the show's scope expands (from Long Island to Los Angeles), or how many bodies drop. And season five is no different, with debates about everything from The Godfather to therapy. In fact, with enough time under their belts in these roles, Gomez, Short, and Martin have never been better together, even if the material itself loses steam. ), and the list of people who could've bludgeoned Lester (Teddy Coluca) quickly becomes robust, especially once the three of them discover that a missing Staten Island gangster (played by Bobby Cannavale) and his wife, Sofia Caccimelio (Téa Leoni), might be involved. In this case, he means tech whiz Bash Steed (Waltz), cocky pharma dude Jay Phlug (Logan Lerman), and Manhattan real-estate tycoon Camila White (Zellweger), as each of them has sordid ties to the Caccimelios and the Arconia. The series has unveiled secret passageways and elevators, a west tower for renters, and a basement with an incinerator hidden within this complex. Even more historically relevant (and stunningly designed) spots get discovered in season five that, as Brazzos would say, send the investigation in a whole new direction. Compelling aspects of Lester's murder or Nicky's vanishing act are marred by the wacky pacing. Major plot twists introduced in the fourth outing annoyingly don't get picked back up until much later. The new faces this season drop in infrequently, so Sofia, Bash, Camilla, and Jay just feel like half-baked red herrings instead of fully-formed figures. Then again, who cares about a serviceable whodunit when we get scenes of Martin and Richard Kind making bird noises or Streep (committed to pulling off the funniest accents) and Zellweger sipping drinks in a casino? Season five achieves this through flashbacks of Oliver's troubled teen years, Mabel's history with the Arconia, and a dissection of why Charles is “attracted to psychos.” The show's appeal also stems from its unique lens into NYC's quirks. That's why a Lester-focused and -narrated second episode about doormen is OMITB‘s finest since season one's “The Boy From 6B.” In a lot of ways, season five harkens back to what made the series tick when in the first place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a string of departures, Saturday Night Live has confirmed its Season 51 cast, with Bowen Yang, Kenan Thompson, and Weekend Update co-hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che among those set to return. According to multiple reports, much of last year's main cast will be back at Studio 8H this fall, including Ego Nwodim, Chloe Fineman, Marcello Hernandez, Andrew Dismukes, Sarah Sherman, and James Austin Johnson (who, of course, handles the show's all-important Donald Trump impression). Two of last year's new featured players, Ashley Padilla and Jane Wickline, are also returning, though it's unclear if they've been promoted to the main cast. The confirmation that Jost and Che are returning, as well, comes after a lot of speculation that Season 50 might be their last. Jost has been working at SNL since 2005 when he was hired as a writer, and he's been a cast member for 12 seasons now, making him the fourth longest-serving cast member in the show's history. Che, meanwhile, joined SNL in 2013 as a writer and was named Jost's co-anchor the following year. SNL is also set to welcome many new featured players this year, including Tommy Brennan, Jeremy Culhane, Kam Patterson, and Veronika Slowikowska. Ozzy Osbourne VMAs Tribute: Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Yungblud Bark at the Moon Person With all these new additions, SNL also saw a number of departures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few people can claim the kind of virtually universal appeal enjoyed by Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks. Following a West Point Academy alumni group's cancellation of an award ceremony honoring Hanks — a longtime advocate for veterans — Trump celebrated the snub, decrying the actor as “destructive, WOKE,” and unworthy of the honor. “Our great West Point (getting greater all the time!) has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks,” Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social. “We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! West Point's alumni association announced to members that Hanks would not be receiving its Sylvanus Thayer Award — which honors non-alumni who embody the academy's motto of “duty, honor, country” — in an email obtained by The Washington Post on Saturday. “This decision allows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world's most lethal force, the United States Army,” wrote  West Point Association of Graduates President Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger. The award has been bestowed on former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, Hank's Forrest Gump co-star Gary Sinise, Ross Perot, and Henry Kissinger. The actor has ostensibly liberal politics, and has appeared in Saturday Night Live sketches that parody Trump's supporters, angering some of his base. QAnon conspiracy adherents have spread baseless claims that Hanks and other celebrities were involved in a secret child sex abuse ring. Ozzy Osbourne VMAs Tribute: Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Yungblud Bark at the Moon Person Fox News weekend host turned Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has led a purge of the school's faculty and administration — as well as the school's curriculum and policies — aimed at fulfilling Trump's demands that American military academies “are prohibited from promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories,” including that “America's founding documents are racist or sexist; and ‘gender ideology. Somehow, the presence of Hanks, dubbed “America's Dad” by his legions of fans at home and abroad, runs counter to the administration's political priorities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One month into the Jonas Brothers' 20th anniversary concert tour, the beloved trio has already thrilled fans with surprise guest appearances from celebs including Demi Lovato, Switchfoot, Jesse McCartney, Hoobastank, JP Saxe, JoJo, and the Plain White T's. Best known for his soaring ballads and for shining a light on serious topics like civil rights, as he did in his Grammy-winning “Glory” from the 2014 movie “Selma,” Legend let loose with the Jonas Brothers and social media lit up with videos of them all having a blast performing together. “We have something in store for you tonight that is legendary,” Nick teased the crowd, as seen in the fan video above. And I thought to myself, ‘Well, that is a different kind of voice, a different kind of storyteller, someone who is truly connected to something profound.” He played me a song that he wrote with this person and, honestly, I was pretty jealous, not gonna lie. He rubbed it in and I played the song on repeat for months.” After chuckling with his brother Joe about how jealous he'd felt, Nick shared how grateful he was to later get the chance to work with Legend on “The Voice.” “You know, we got to know this person over the years and, eventually, I got to do a TV show right here in Los Angeles where we kind of battled back and forth, all in good fun,” Nick told the crowd. Nick concluded, “And, man, I can't believe I'm about to say these words, but Los Angeles, please welcome our friend and your friend, Mr. John Legend.” 😍 #johnlegend #jonasbrothers #jobros #jonasbrothersconcert #kevinjonas #joejonas #nickjonas #riristea #rivetsoro @Jonas Brothers @John Legend In a rare casual look, Legend strutted out onto the stage wearing jeans and a hoodie, and gave all three brothers hugs as the crowd screamed. One fan wrote on Instagram, “All of them singing together was so beautiful to hear in person! Someone else wrote on one video, “The colab I did not expect 😭😭😭😭😭 this is giving me so much FOMO. Meanwhile, Legend is on his own 20th anniversary tour through early December and will be back on season 29 of “The Voice” in the spring of 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Psycho and The Manchurian Candidate to The Waterboy and Momma's Man, momma's boys have been an onscreen staple for decades. And Daniel Sanderson (Mary & George's Laurie Davidson), the med-student son of Robin Wright's glamorous gallerist Laura in Prime Video's The Girlfriend, is a textbook case—so much so that when we first meet the close mother-son duo, affectionately wrestling in the indoor pool of their posh London home, you'd be forgiven for assuming they were lovers. Cherry Laine (Olivia Cooke) is Daniel's new girlfriend, and Laura doesn't approve: not of her name (admittedly stripper-worthy), not of her low-cut red dress (admittedly inappropriate for meeting the parents), and not of her son's hand that Cherry allows to creep scandalously high on her thigh in the middle of dinner. Even when Laura does try to get to know the maraschino-haired young woman, she's left with even more questions and concerns. That red dress Cherry wears to meet Daniel's folks? She can't actually afford it and panics when Laura spills coffee on the garment, which still has its tags on it. You see, while Laura's moneyed life is as carefully curated as one of her galleries—from her artfully minimalist wardrobe to the family's sunny vacation home in Spain to even the mistress she allows her husband Howard (Waleed Zuaiter) to keep on the side—Cherry's working-class background is far less tidy, one marked by scrappy determination and social ambition. A hurtful slight that one finds significant enough to linger on is barely mentioned in the other POV, showing how each mindset, memory, and even ego can bend and buckle the truth. It's a clash the two actors clearly relish, each gamely playing victim or villain depending on which outlook is at the forefront. It's in this deliberate gray area that The Girlfriend succeeds: Is Laura simply being protective—an understandable byproduct of tragically losing her first child, Daniel's sister Rose—or is she paranoid to the point of no return? And while Wright and Cooke are given abundant material to work with as each woman descends further and further into monsters-in-law madness, the rest of the cast is left wanting (though Zuaiter does have several quietly devastating moments as a father dulled by grief). Davidson's Daniel has boyish charm and Paul Mescal-esque good looks, sure, but the character is so blandly written and improbably oblivious (the dude is supposed to be surgeon-level smart, mind you) that you have to wonder why two alpha females like Laura and Cherry would be at each other's throats over the dimple-cheeked dolt. Unburdened by that additional story weight, the increasingly outlandish actions of our leads do keep things light, lean, and moving swiftly along, a plus when the mystery has largely been removed from the narrative. Cherry and Laura's feud alone is juicy enough to warrant a bite.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexia Umansky, daughter of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Kyle Richards and real estate mogul Mauricio Umansky, has officially tied the knot. Alexia married her longtime love, Jake Zingerman, in a Los Angeles ceremony on Sept. 6, surrounded by family and friends. The celebration was a true family affair, with Alexia's sisters—Farrah Brittany Aldjufrie, Sophia Umansky, and Portia Umansky—serving as her maids of honor. Photos from the evening showed the bride's vision of an “enchanted evening garden” came to life with rich tones, sparkles, and eclectic touches, which she had described just days earlier during a livestream with her mother. Later in the evening, Alexia swapped her gown for a short lace minidress and danced alongside Jake as guests celebrated into the night. According to The Daily Dish, the wedding, originally planned for Aspen, was moved to California after the couple decided a destination event was too “stressful.” Richards and her husband, Mauricio Umansky, were in attendance to support their daughter on her big day. Both Kyle and Mauricio have shared their admiration for Jake over the years. Mauricio also spoke warmly about Jake in a past interview with Us Weekly, saying, “He's awesome. We love him.” Their approval has been clear throughout the couple's engagement and wedding journey. In a recent Amazon Live appearance, Alexia revealed she will hyphenate her last name to Umansky-Zingerman. “We're not gonna go right away,” Alexia explained. With a strong foundation of family support and a shared life already in place, Alexia and Jake are entering this next chapter with plenty of love around them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As NBC's “Sunday Night Football” kicks off on September 7, 2025, it will begin for the 13th year in a row with country superstar Carrie Underwood singing the latest version of the theme song, “Waiting All Day For Sunday Night.” A post shared by SNF on NBC (@snfonnbc) The “Sunday Night Football” theme song changes slightly with every new NFL matchup across 18 Sundays, according to the New York Times. But because the primetime lineup can change later in the year, depending on which games are likely to draw the most viewers, producers have to be prepared for the intro song to pump people up for a variety of possible team and player matchups. That means Underwood recorded dozens of permutations of the rock song, standing in a dark Nashville studio in her bare feet, the outlet reported. Underwood was given multiple different lines to record, with the freedom to change words here and there if the lyrics don't feel quite right. “You get in there and sometimes you'll sing something and it sounded clunky, and then somebody will be like, ‘Why don't you switch the names or switch the order? A post shared by SNF on NBC (@snfonnbc) 2025 marks the 20th season of “Sunday Night Football” on NBC. Tripp Dixon, creative director for the opener, told NBC Insider they wanted to give Underwood's theme song a special sound for the occasion.</p>

Bruno Mars & ROSÉ's smash “APT.” (which peaked at No. “Someone asked me the other day what my fear in life was and I was quite shocked at my own response. I told them I feared that somewhere along this journey of pursuing my dreams I might hit a wall and disappoint my 16-year-old self who grew up always an oddball among society, who wished someday she could be herself and pursue her dreams like anyone else I saw on television.” Holding her speech and the Moon Person, she declared, “Twelve years later I dedicate this award to my 16-year-old self who dreamed and to all those who have watched me grow into the artist I am today. Every single one of you has put me here…. Now I believe there is no imposter in the world when MTV has given me this award at the VMAs.” “This is a really big moment for 16-year-old me and anyone else who has dreamed of being accepted equally for their hard work,” she said. “As my therapist tells me to do every day, I'd like to thank myself for not giving up even in the toughest of times.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
