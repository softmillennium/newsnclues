By digging into Draper's tactical tendencies, Ruud arrived on court with a clear plan and the confidence to execute it under pressure. ‚ÄúHis typical left-handed approach to the clay game is penetrating your opponent's backhand with [the] forehand,‚Äù Ruud said of Draper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With four Grand Slam champions in 2025 and no single player able to dominate, the season now shifts to its decisive phase. Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka are among the many players who face different tests. Just like that, the Grand Slam season is behind us. 1 Aryna Sabalenka finally winning her first Slam of 2025 in New York, a victory that steadied her season and raised the stakes for the final stretch. Can Iga Swiatek chase down Sabalenka for the year-end No. Is Naomi Osaka's resurgence about to level up, or will it settle back into something steadier? And which of the newer faces can turn promise into staying power? Here are three storylines from each of our writers we will be watching most closely in the final stretch: 1 chaseWho will finish as the year-end World No. The direct rivalry between Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka has mostly taken a back seat in 2025 so far -- they've played just once, in the Roland Garros semifinals. Instead, both players' narratives involved bouncing back from more general setbacks to win one major each, Swiatek at Wimbledon and Sabalenka in New York. Those results have put the pair in a strong position to battle it out for Player of the Year honors -- maybe even through an on-court meeting or two. Keep an eye on players who have missed chunks of time with injury (Czech comeback queens Barbora Krejcikova, Marketa Vondrousova and Karolina Muchova) as well as a few who haven't been winning matches at their usual rate, and still have a few things to prove in 2025 (Diana Shnaider, Daria Kasatkina). Three Asian players who turned heads in North America -- the Philippines' Alexandra Eala, Japan's Aoi Ito and Indonesia's Janice Tjen -- should be well placed to take momentum into their home continent. Two teenagers, Canada's Victoria Mboko and the Czech Republic's Tereza Valentova, will also be contesting the Asian swing for the first time and will be worth keeping an eye on. If the regular season ended today, the following players would qualify: Coco Gauff (5,184), Amanda Anisimova (4,908/5,608), Madison Keys (4,450), Jessica Pegula (4,209), Mirra Andreeva (4189), Elena Rybakina (3,751). But with WTA 1000 events coming up in Beijing and Wuhan, WTA 500s in Guadalajara, Seoul, Ningbo and Tokyo there are opportunities. Next in line: Jasmine Paolini (3,526), Ekaterina Alexandrova (2,871), Elina Svitolina (2,606), Clara Tauson (2,553), Emma Navarro (2,310) and Naomi Osaka (2,244). Can Andreeva catch fire again?No one was hotter than Mirra Andreeva through the middle of the season. Still only 17, she won back-to-back WTA 1000s in Dubai and Indian Wells. She beat Iga Swiatek in both tournaments and took down Aryna Sabalenka and Elina Rybakina in Indian Wells. But after getting to the quarters, she's been quiet. Now 18, Andreeva has played only five matches since Wimbledon, going 3-2. Looking for her to get going again in Asia. Which new names will stick?Which of the newbies who vaulted into the Top 100 will finish strong? Alexandra Eala had a scorching run to the Miami semifinals and lost in the finals at Eastbourne, but has won only one WTA-level match since. The 20-year-old Filipina is fresh off a WTA 125 title in Guadalajara, Maya Joint, 19, won that Eastbourne final ‚Äì her second ever, after winning the title in Rabat. Joint has only four wins in six events since Eastbourne. Dogged by an adductor injury, she's 0-2 since. The surprising hire of biomechanics expert Gavin Macmillan. (Though there's certainly no shame in losing to an in-form Naomi Osaka.) Will we start to see her serve improve after more time with Macmillan? Can she repeat at the WTA Finals in Riyadh? And most importantly, can she get her confidence back? It certainly appears so, though we need more of a sample size to be sure. After hiring Tomasz Wiktorowski last month, all the four-time Grand Slam champion has done is win 11 of 13 matches, reach the final in Montreal and come within a set of returning to the US Open final. But more important than the numbers and accolades is how locked in she's looked, and how much joy she seems to be playing with (a wonderful sight to see). We'll find out later this month, in Beijing. Will a fifth major winner emerge?Had Aryna Sabalenka lost the US Open final, I would have wondered if she would cement her status as the world's top player in Riyadh despite falling short at the majors. Will a fifth emerge victorious at the WTA Finals? I'm looking at you, Jess Pegula, Mirra Andreeva, Amanda Anisimova, Jasmine Paolini ... or perhaps someone else? With four Grand Slam champions in 2025 and no single player able to dominate, the season now shifts to its decisive phase. Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka are among the many players who face different tests.</p>

Novak Djokovic and Alex de Minaur also made gains during their campaigns at the year's final major in New York. Felix Auger-Aliassime - 10th (2,705 points), +8 After a strong early-season that included titles in Adelaide and Montpellier, Auger-Aliassime looked well-positioned for a Nitto ATP Finals spot. A patchy mid-season dimmed these hopes, but his US Open resurgence has firmly put him back in the mix. View the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin Novak Djokovic - third (4,180), +2 Novak Djokovic continued his ultra-clean Grand Slam season, advancing to a fourth straight major semi-final in New York before bowing out to eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz. The record seven-time Nitto ATP Finals champion, who also won his 100th tour-level trophy this year in Geneva, climbed two spots to third in the Live Race. Alex de Minaur - seventh (3,145), +1 Last year, De Minaur made his debut at the Nitto ATP Finals, becoming the first Australian to qualify since Lleyton Hewitt in 2004. Lorenzo Musetti - eighth (3,070), +1 After a slow start to the North American swing, Lorenzo Musetti turned things around in New York by reaching his first major quarter-final on hard courts. Musetti holds a 30-13 record this season, highlighted by semi-final appearances at all three-clay court ATP Masters 1000 events and Roland Garros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After suffering his seventh defeat in his past eight Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings with Carlos Alcaraz ‚Äî a loss that also cost him the World No. 1 ranking ‚Äî Jannik Sinner admits it's time for a change. The 24-year-old Italian fell in four sets to Alcaraz in the US Open final on Sunday and, reflecting on the trajectory of their rivalry, he vowed to shake things up. Speaking in his post-tournament press conference, Sinner acknowledged he had become too ‚Äòpredictable' and stressed the need to evolve his game if he hopes to turn the tables. ‚ÄúI was very predictable today on court. That's also his style of how he plays. Now it's going to be on me if I want to make changes or not,‚Äù Sinner said after his 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 defeat. ‚ÄúThat's definitely [what] we are going to work on. ‚ÄúIt also depends on how you arrive to play against Carlos. One thing is when the scoreline [or] matches before are comfortable but you always do the same things, like I did, for example, during this tournament, I didn't make one serve-volley, didn't use a lot of drop shots, and then you arrive to a point where you play against Carlos where you have to go out of the comfort zone. You May Also Like: Alcaraz takes US Open crown, No. Sinner had been virtually untouchable on hard courts in recent years, arriving in the final at Flushing Meadows on a 27-match unbeaten streak at majors on the surface. Yet Alcaraz has now defeated him four straight times on what has long been Sinner's strongest ground. The foundation of Sinner's dominance has been his ability to blast through opponents from the baseline, a weapon he used to defeat Alcaraz for his first Wimbledon title in July. I felt like [he] was a bit cleaner today. The things I did well in London, he did better today,‚Äù Sinner said, comparing their battles at Wimbledon and the US Open. I felt like he was doing everything slightly better today, especially serving, both sides, both swings very clean. I'm still proud of myself, about the season I'm playing and making, but yeah, he played better than me today.‚Äù ‚ÄúOverall, the season result-wise, amazing,‚Äù said Sinner. ‚ÄúFour Grand Slam finals of the year. ‚ÄúSometimes adding just something, and I think that's going to be or that's going to make a difference from my personal point of view that I can say that I'm going to become a better tennis player,‚Äù said Sinner. ‚ÄúI'm going to change a couple of things on the serve, just small things, but they can make big differences. I'm looking forward to playing these matches again. Something new is now I'm not No. 1 anymore, so it also changes a little bit that you chase.‚Äù Sinner will leave New York with a 37-5 record on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Although he is now 2,590 points adrift of Alcaraz in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, the reigning Nitto ATP Finals champion will look to close the gap in the season's final stretch as their battle for ATP Year-End No. No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>
