                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The House Oversight Committee has received its first documents from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including the so-called “birthday book” – a reported collection of letters gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday that included a note bearing President Donald Trump's name. Trump has repeatedly denied writing the letter and sued The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on it, for defamation. Deputy White House chief of staff Taylor Budowich said on X that “it's not his signature,” in response to the image released by Democrats, alongside several images bearing the president's signature. Republicans and Democrats on the panel said they plan to make additional documents public after taking time to review what was turned over by the estate. It was not immediately clear when more documents would be made public. A House Oversight Committee aide said that in addition to the “birthday book,” the estate turned over “the last will and testament of Epstein immediately preceding August 8, 2019; the September 24, 2007 non-prosecution agreement between the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida and Epstein; entries from Epstein's address/contact books from January 1, 1990 through August 10, 2019; and information about Epstein's known bank accounts.” Attorney Daniel H. Weiner, a representative for the estate, confirmed to CNN that an initial document production had been transmitted to the panel and said “the Co-Executors will continue to produce on a rolling basis documents responsive to the Committee's subpoena.” Lawyers representing the estate noted in a letter obtained by CNN accompanying the document production that there are certain redactions in the book, which was reportedly compiled by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, that comprises three volumes. “Please note that, in an abundance of caution, we have redacted names and faces of women and minors who appear in the book (other than Ms. Maxwell, public figures, and family or class photos) to ensure that no potential victims are publicly identifiable,” Weiner and attorney Daniel Ruzumna wrote. Speaker Johnson walks backs comment that Trump was an ‘FBI informant' in Epstein case In response to the committee's request for “a potential list of clients involved in sex, sex acts, or sex trafficking facilitated by Mr. Jeffrey Epstein,” in the subpoena, lawyers for Epstein's estate said they “are not aware of the existence” of such a list. As CNN previously reported, a bipartisan group of staffers on the committee is expected to travel to New York City later this week to meet with lawyers representing the estate and view unredacted documents related to the investigation. Democrats on the panel criticized that document production, however, saying that it contained little new information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump launched a vitriolic attack against Tom Hanks for supposedly being “destructive” and “woke” after one of America's most beloved actors was snubbed without much explanation by West Point last week. On his social media site on Monday, the US president applauded the alumni association of the US Military Academy (or West Point) for abruptly calling off a ceremony honoring Hanks, twice an Academy award winner who has played numerous military characters and also has a long history of advocating for veterans. Trump wrote: “Our great West Point (getting greater all the time!) has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks. We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hanks had been scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award later this month for his “service and accomplishments in the national interest”. Hanks has previously endorsed Democratic candidates including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He has already been inducted as an honorary member into the US Army's Ranger Hall of Fame. Among his military portrayals are Capt John Miller in Saving Private Ryan, the Vietnam war soldier Forrest Gump (for which he won the Oscar for best actor), and Cmdr Ernie Krause in Greyhound, for which he also wrote the screenplay. His work has made him one of the US's most decorated actors, with seven Emmy awards to go alongside the five Academy award nominations for best actor, which he won twice in a row. Trump, who has dabbled in acting including a cameo in Home Alone 2, has regularly complained about never winning an Emmy for his reality television show The Apprentice, lamenting that he “should have gotten it”, that he “got screwed out of an Emmy” and that “the Emmys are all politics”.</p>

If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Major Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems has reportedly shut down a U.K. facility after it was repeatedly targeted by Palestine Action activists, in a major victory for the group that was recently banned by the U.K. government. “We need to remind ourselves that Elbit (Systems) is one of the two most important Israeli arms films, along with [Israel Aerospace Industries], that is it is obviously a key component of Israel's military industrial complex,” global arms trade expert and South African politician ​​Andrew Feinstein told The Guardian. Elbit denied closing the plant due to protests when contacted by Haaretz, saying the “site is temporarily inactive for commercial reasons.” UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese named Elbit as a major company making up the “economic backbone” of Israel, which she said is dependent on the military industrial complex. Elbit has been subject to protests in its branches across the world. Law enforcement in the U.K. have arrested dozens of activists with Palestine Action for protesting Elbit. Anti-Elbit protesters in the U.S. and Germany have also faced arrest. The U.K. declared Palestine Action a terrorist group in July, in a move widely decried as an attempt to silence and criminalize pro-Palestine activism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Letitia James's intervention increases the likelihood SCOTUS will weigh in on shield laws and telehealth abortions. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that she will defend her state's abortion protections in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas. James' involvement sets up the first interstate fight over abortion laws since the fall of Roe v. Wade, opening the door for the Supreme Court to weigh in on a key legal mechanism that has helped people in states with bans access abortion. Carpenter lives and practices in New York, where abortion is legal; in Texas, where her patient received the health care, there is an almost total ban on abortion. New York is one of several states where abortion providers are protected by shield laws — statutes that ban cooperation with other states' attempts to enforce abortion bans. The law prohibits New York law enforcement officials from arresting or extraditing health professionals who provided abortions that are legal in New York; law enforcement also cannot cooperate with investigations or punishments of such procedures. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. This month, James, the first woman and first Black person to serve as her state's attorney general, will argue in legal filings that the Empire State has the right to pass laws protecting its residents from another state's abortion bans. “Texas has no authority in New York, and no power to impose its cruel abortion ban here,” James said in a statement. Since Roe's undoing, tens of thousands of people living under abortion bans have relied on telehealth to get care. Health providers living in states with legal abortion consult with them virtually and then have abortion pills mailed to them to take from home. Supporters of the practice argue that, because the medical providers are practicing in their home states where abortion is legal they are not violating any laws. Several cases are pending that address abortions allegedly provided over telehealth to patients in states with bans, including a criminal case brought by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and two civil cases both filed by anti-abortion lawyer Jonathan Mitchell. Then in July, Paxton sued the Ulster County, New York, clerk for declining to enter the Texas judgement against Carpenter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French lawmakers voted to oust Prime Minister François Bayrou Monday, plunging the country into a new political crisis and leaving it without a government at a time of increasing economic strain and geopolitical tensions. A total of 364 MPs voted against Bayrou and 194 voted for him after he called the vote in a bid to push through an unpopular €44 billion ($51 billion) savings plan that included scrapping two public holidays and freezing government spending. Bayrou will now be forced to step down after just nine months in office, following in the footsteps of his predecessor Michel Barnier, who lost a no-confidence vote last December. The prime minister's departure leaves Macron with few palatable options. Yields on French government bonds – or the interest rate demanded by investors – have risen above those of Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bonds, which were once at the heart of the eurozone debt crisis. A possible downgrade of France's sovereign debt rating review Friday would deliver another blow to its economic standing in Europe. “We broke the social contract” with younger generations, Bayrou added. The political instability can be traced back to Macron's own dramatic decision last year to call a snap election. Even before the vote, the prospect of Bayrou's downfall sparked calls for the president to step aside, though he has vowed to serve out his term. Far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen has demanded he dissolve parliament, but fresh elections would almost certainly strengthen her party and fracture the French parliament further. Another path would be for Macron to appoint a caretaker government while looking for a new prime minister, with Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu and Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin among the frontrunners for what is likely to be a poisoned chalice. The trouble for Macron is that, after three failed centrist prime ministers, the opposition parties are in no mood to give another one a chance. Both the far right and far left have signaled they would immediately call for a vote of no confidence if another such premier were appointed. Naming a prime minister from another political camp is, in theory, an option, but a choice on the right would be blocked by the left, and vice versa. In the event of another snap parliamentary election, a recent Elabe poll suggests the National Rally would emerge on top, with the left coming in second and Macron's centrist bloc a distant third. Many now assume the far right will eventually take power – if not now, then after the 2027 presidential election – though few believe such an outcome would solve the country's problems. Public trust in the political class has collapsed and anger is set to spill onto the streets: the far left has called nationwide protests for Wednesday, under the banner “Bloquons tout” (“Let's block everything”), with trade unions planning another mobilization on September 18. All of this comes at the worst possible geopolitical moment, with wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. Instability in Paris is a gift to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump, who share a common delight in mocking Europe's weaknesses. CNN's Joseph Ataman and Lauren Kent contributed to this report.</p>

The government will take steps to develop “world-class genomic medicine,” according to a draft basic plan for medical measures that utilize genomic data. The draft is set to be submitted to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's Health, Labor and Welfare Division on Tuesday, with Cabinet approval sought by the end of this year. It is the first such draft to be formulated under the genomic medicine law, which was enacted in June 2023. Genomic medicine utilizes genetic information to treat diseases, and expectations are high that genome analysis could lead to the development of drugs and ways of identifying causes of diseases such as cancer. On the other hand, there are concerns that genomic medicine could lead to discrimination, as an individual's genetic information can be used to predict their future health status, as well as that of their family. Included in the draft is the overall goal of “contributing to public health by promoting genomic medicine while respecting individual rights and interests.” Regarding the activities to raise awareness, the draft states that the government will establish a service for consultations about genomic medicine through the Justice Ministry's consultation system for issues related to human rights and through labor standards inspection offices, among others, within fiscal 2025. For the medical service delivery systems, the government aims to establish an environment in which patients can easily access genomic medicine by improving medical institutions, which play a central role in delivering genomic medical services, with national and other public hospitals thought to be in mind. It will also work on building a cooperative network between medical institutions. For research and development, the draft states that the government will work to develop a framework for establishing a database of genomic information, as well as nurturing personnel related to genomics. It will also help the personnel hone their expertise. Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A deputy chairman of the Slovak parliament and member of the ruling Smer party, Tibor Gaspar, compared Ukraine to the Hamas militant group and said Russia had been provoked to launch its full-scale invasion, Slovak media outlet Aktuality reported on Sept. 7. Gaspar made the comments during a televised debate, echoing Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's repeated claims that while Russia violated international law, it had "reasons" to attack Ukraine. "Robert Fico has repeatedly spoken about how he perceives Russia's actions. The lawmaker went further by equating Ukraine to Hamas and its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. "This is the same kind of provoked conflict as when terrorists from Palestine attacked Israel. The comparison distorts reality by likening Ukraine, a sovereign state defending itself against Russian invasion, to Hamas, a militant group designated as terrorist by multiple countries, that massacred civilians and took hostages. Since returning to power in 2023, Fico and his Smer party have ended military aid to Ukraine and questioned EU sanctions on Russia. He has also vowed to block Ukraine's NATO accession. During his meeting with Fico in Beijing on Sept. 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin praised Bratislava's stance as an "independent foreign policy" that brings "positive results."

After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China considers Taiwan – self-ruled since 1949 when nationalist forces retreated after losing the Chinese Civil War – as part of its territory under the One-China principle. It also claims the strait as its own. While neither Canada nor Australia formally recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, many, including the US, Canada, the UK, France, and Australia, view the strait as an international channel and conduct regular transits. China said its forces tracked and warned the vessels, describing the operation as “trouble-making and provocation.” An Australian Defense Department spokesperson said Brisbane made a “routine transit” with the Canadian ship from September 6 to 7. Canadian Joint Operations Command declined to comment on the transit, saying the Ville de Quebec was deployed on Operation Horizon, Canada's Indo-Pacific mission aimed at promoting “peace and stability.” Beijing rejected this, denouncing the exercise and accusing Manila of colluding with Western powers to undermine regional stability. The Taiwan Strait, one of the world's busiest shipping routes, remains a vital corridor for global trade and a flashpoint between China and Western navies. Earlier this year, another Canadian frigate, HMCS Montreal, also transited the strait in what Ottawa called a routine passage. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ANDREI KOLESNIKOV is a columnist for The New Times and Novaya Gazeta. But as Stalin became entrenched in power, Bukharin found that he was no less vulnerable to the dictator's wrath than anyone else. Accused of conspiracy in 1937, Bukharin was executed the following year. Bukharin is credited with a grim joke: “We may have two parties—one in power, the other in prison.” He might have added, “or dead.” By the time of Bukharin's arrest, Stalin was systematically replacing the people who had secured his ascent to power with a new generation of young and ambitious politicians and officials for whom total loyalty to the leader would be everything. Among elites in Russia today, something like Bukharin's story is happening once again. On July 7, Roman Starovoit, the minister of transport, killed himself with a firearm a few hours after being sacked by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Badalov was only the latest of a series of top officials in the oil and gas sector who have been purged or died mysteriously since Putin's “special military operation” in Ukraine began in 2022. According to Novaya Gazeta, the independent Russian newspaper, there have been 56 deaths of successful businesspeople and officials under strange circumstances since February 2022. In 2024, the Ministry of Defense was hit with a sweeping corruption crackdown. Shoigu's deputy Timur Ivanov was less fortunate: he was arrested on large-scale corruption charges and, in July, sentenced to 13 years in prison—one of the longest sentences for any current or former high-ranking Russian official since the end of the Cold War. Since then, there have been many more arrests—especially of regional functionaries at various levels. As the Putin regime turns on its own people, it, too, has begun to replace them with a new breed of loyalists, people whose primary qualifications are their apparent fealty to the leader, and sometimes their participation in the war. After more than three and a half years of war and mounting economic challenges, Putin's aim is not to fight corruption. With the demise of Starovoit, a trusted Putin official, a feeling has emerged among Russian elites that no one is protected and that loyalty alone is not always enough to survive in the system. As in the Stalin era, it is not clear who might be next. On the one hand, he had not yet been charged with anything, but on the other, it was clear that he had chosen death over prison. Nonetheless, several important figures, including St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov, attended Starovoit's funeral; earlier, a number of members of the government and deputy prime ministers appeared at a memorial ceremony for Starovoit in Moscow. But later, they were forced to retract those reports. All this may have caused a feeling of awkwardness and fear among those who attended: Had they done the right thing to pay last respects to a man who had lost the president's trust? Starting in December of that year, a number of Starovoit's former colleagues and subordinates were implicated in embezzlement of military funds—including 19 billion rubles (around $250 million) that had been allocated for defenses along the Ukrainian border. These are the kinds of things that Putin does not forgive. And shortly before Starovoit's suicide, the vice governor of the Leningrad region was found dead with a gunshot wound in a country house. Until now, corruption has rarely attracted much attention in Putin's system. This has been confirmed not only by the purges of defense ministry officials and Starovoit's death but also by the arrest of officials in Belgorod and Bryansk, two other regions bordering Ukraine. Ivanov, the fabulously wealthy former deputy defense minister who was responsible for military construction projects, among other things, received his harsh prison sentence for allegedly embezzling more than four billion rubles ($52 million) through foreign bank transfers. But the recent arrests are not only related to military graft; some appear to be part of a broader purge of regional officials with connections at the federal level. Fear does not play a determining role in the lives of ordinary Russians. Many Russians are convinced that the silencing of Putin's opponents, and now the widening arrests of officials, are bells tolling for someone else; they do not concern them. People know they need to behave cautiously, but their conformist behavior is shaped more by learned indifference and anticipatory obedience to everything they cannot influence. Any unpleasant government decision—such as the August order blocking voice calls on WhatsApp and Telegram, on the pretext of preventing scams and terrorist activity—tends to be perceived mostly with passive discontent and immediate adaptation with the search for alternative practical solutions. For the political bosses, oligarchs, bureaucrats, and business executives who constitute Russia's elites, however, it is an altogether different story. For them, fear has become a highly effective means of control. The problem for them is that they own their wealth only as long as the state allows them to do so. After more than three and a half years of war, the Kremlin is in dire need of additional funds—informal income streams from big business and “patriotic” investments in industries that are important for the state. Lately, the government seems determined to nationalize any privately owned asset or company it can easily get its hands on. In Putin's system, it turns out that joining or maintaining a place in the establishment—whether close or more distant to the regime—is dangerous. Much of this system is still in place, but it no longer works properly. For example, it was widely understood that Starovoit was under the protection of the Rotenberg brothers, Boris and Arkady, billionaires who have been close to Putin since their youth. But in the end, it didn't help him. Mini-patrons, it appears, are no longer able or willing to protect their vassals. Yet no one from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs—the so-called trade union of oligarchs that represents major businesses—publicly stood up for him. But influential conservative forces close to the Kremlin have long sought to tarnish his liberal legacy, and “patriotic” influencers and quasi-public organizations have been allowed to discredit and interfere with the work of the Yeltsin Center. Now, the legal case against Telen, a former liberal journalist, signals that this campaign is transitioning to a more formal legal and administrative level. What Telen reposted on Facebook was an antiwar message written more than three years ago by Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Yumasheva. For Russian elites, there is another important lesson in Starovoit's demise. In this approach, ever higher levels of the military, federal, and regional elites are gradually implicated, layer by layer, like slices of salami. Or perhaps it is a self-developing process: the system has begun to devour itself as it did in the Stalin era. And many officials now know they could well end up as the next slice. Officials were dismissed in waves even from the very source of repression—the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs—as new commissars arrived to replace them. But the point is the principle: Putin has now indicated that he trusts, at least for the moment, those who “protect” Russia, and that means new career prospects for these people—including special retraining programs, incentives to adapt to civilian life, and preferential access to education and employment. For instance, the state pays for the education of “participants in the special military operation” and their children, and universities are required to allocate at least ten percent of their places for them. As of mid-August, 28,000 people were enrolled in Russian universities in 2025 under the preferential quota for special military operation participants and members of their families—a nearly 75 percent increase over the previous year. But he will be able to promote a few, positioning them for leadership roles in the distant future. (Putin has no intention of going anywhere any time soon.) An enduring mystery to many Western observers is how Russia has been able to remain relatively solvent despite the extraordinary pressures of three and half years of war. Putin's system would have collapsed long ago if it weren't for the remnants of the market economy, including adaptive small and medium-sized businesses, as well as competent monetary and budget policy. Since the “special operation” began, Nabiullina has managed to keep the financial system relatively stable despite extraordinary levels of military spending, in part by keeping interest rates very high: in July, they were lowered to 18 percent, after reaching a peak of 21 percent last year. In doing so, she has put a break on inflation (which is nevertheless nearly approaching a double-digit figure on an annual basis). So far, Russia's financial technocrats have not been fired because Putin seems to recognize that he needs them. But if the system continues to deteriorate, perhaps they will become scapegoats, as well, and he will replace them with voodoo economists. If that happens, the country will almost certainly face an economic crisis, including a runaway budget deficit, unabated inflation, and recession. (Economists are already now arguing whether the Russian economy has entered a period of technical recession, implying a decline in GDP for two consecutive quarters.) This scenario may seem far-fetched, but the effects of degrading expertise have already been shown in other domains, even as the problems that Russia must deal with are far more complex than before: shortages of doctors, teachers, and public-transport drivers; collapsing city and regional budgets; slowdowns in factory production; and demographic decline. For now, members of the new military elite are being assigned insignificant positions such as deputy mayor for youth affairs and patriotic education. But the picture could look different if they begin to fill more important administrative posts. In 2022, his son was killed fighting in the Sparta Battalion, an anti-Ukrainian militia in the Donetsk Republic, and shortly afterward, Putin met with Zhoga to award his son a posthumous Hero of the Russian Federation medal. Under Zhoga's leadership, the region's somewhat liberal governor, Yevgeny Kuyvashev, was forced to resign. Putin then appointed Zhoga to serve as a nonpermanent member of Russia's National Security Council. Although the position is largely ceremonial, this meteoric rise has set a precedent—showing that it is possible to make a career in Putin's system by performing one's fealty. In any case, the existing elites can no longer rest easy. Having reconciled themselves to the regime's radicalism, they may have now sealed their own doom. Many members of Putin's aristocracy continue to hold out hope that after the end of hostilities, everything will become, if not different, then at least milder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“When I played against him, I hated that sucker,” former Toronto Maple Leaf Mr. Henderson said Sunday, two days after Mr. Dryden's death at the age of 78. They became friends in 1972 when both were members of Team Canada during the historic Summit Series against Russia. “We were losing 5-3 after the second period,” he recalled on Sunday. “I went to Ken and told him that he couldn't give up another goal – that if he did we would never win. Mr. Dryden waves to the crowd at Toronto's Nathan Philips Square during a 2012 event to recognize the players of Team Canada 1972 before their group induction into Canada's Walk of Fame.Peter Power/The Globe and Mail Mr. Dryden had a long and fruitful posthockey career as a lawyer, sports executive, member of Parliament, cabinet minister and author. After his death Friday of cancer, an illness few outside his inner circle knew he had, many in the hockey world said they remember him for his greatness on the ice as well as off it. Cathal Kelly: Ken Dryden was a national hero. They bumped into one another in a hotel lobby and grabbed some chairs and chatted for more than a half-hour, Mr. Henderson recalled. On Saturday, tributes to Mr. Dryden poured in from hockey and other quarters. Prime Minister Mark Carney posted this on social media: “Few Canadians have given more, or stood taller, for our country. Ken Dryden: It does matter, in the end, if you win or lose. In a statement, Geoff Molson, president of the Canadiens, said, “We mourn today not only the loss of the cornerstone of one of hockey's greatest dynasties, but also a family man, a thoughtful citizen, and a gentleman who deeply impacted our lives and communities across generations. “Ken embodied the best of everything the Montreal Canadiens are about, and his legacy within our society transcends our sport.” He was revered as the game's greatest goaltender. Unlike most NHL netminders of the day, who were acrobatic and smallish, Mr. Dryden was a towering presence at 6 foot 4. When he would skate out of the goal crease a bit to challenge a shooter, Mr. Henderson said, there was little chance the puck could get past him. “It was pretty much, ‘Good luck with that,'” Mr. Henderson said. Mr. Dryden was selected the NHL's top goalie five times. He won his first Stanley Cup as a rookie in 1971 and was named the most valuable player during the playoffs that same year. And then he did much more to distinguish himself. “For me, it was an obsession,” Mr. Walsh said Sunday from Los Angeles, where he runs an agency that represents professional hockey players. He'd had an appendectomy, but his appendix burst during surgery. When he woke up, his dad was leaning over the bed. Somehow or other, his father made it work. He reached out to the Canadiens, told them about his son and they in turn got in touch with Mr. Dryden. “He invited me to a Canadiens practice,” Mr. Walsh said. “Then he brought me into the dressing room and he introduced me one by one to all of the players.” After that, he took the young Mr. Walsh into Scotty Bowman's office so the seven-year-old could chat up Montreal's head coach. “As a goalie there was nobody like him. He also sent Mr. Dryden a birthday wish last month. “There are a lot of friends that I haven't heard from that reached out to me as soon as they learned Ken died,” Mr. Walsh said. Kevin Lowe, a six-time Stanley Cup winner and Hall of Fame defenceman, recalls seeing Mr. Dryden in the second NHL game he ever attended. Mr. Lowe, who is from Quebec, is a former general manager for the Edmonton Oilers and knew Mr. Dryden through hockey circles. “One thing that stands out for me is that he was booed in Game 1 in Montreal of the 1979 Stanley Cup final,” Mr. Lowe said. “He stood on his head in Game 2 and they won four straight.” “He was much more than a hockey player.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine expects a strong response from its international partners, particularly the United States, in the wake of Russia's latest record-breaking mass strike, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Sept. 7. The previous night, Russia assailed Ukraine with over 800 drones and a barrage of missiles, killing four people and injuring over 40. "We are counting on a strong reaction from America. The president thanked world leaders who have condemned the attack and said he had spoken with French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte regarding Europe's role in ramping up pressure on Moscow. Zelensky also said increasing Ukraine's long-range strike capability would mount pressure on Russia. In response to Russia's attack, U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg called the strike an "escalation" and said it showed Moscow was not interested in a diplomatic end to the war — though he stopped short of condemning Russia. He stressed, however, that Europe would need to play a part in the pressure campaign. U.S. President Donald Trump said he was ready to enter a new phase of sanctions against Russia, but declined to give any further details. Zelensky's address comes two days before the upcoming Ramstein-format summit in London, where Kyiv's allies will gather to coordinate military support for Ukraine. Zelensky said Ukraine's focus at the summit will be defense technology and long-range operations. In his remarks, Zelensky said that nearly half of the 800 drones launched at Ukraine during Russia's attack were decoys, cheap Shahed imitators designed to overwhelm Kyiv's air defenses.
