                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research indicates that many patients who undergo surgery with the intent to cure early-stage cancer continue or start opioid prescriptions in the year following surgery. To assess the situation, investigators examined rates of new persistent opioid use in the year following surgery for stage 0 to 3 cancers among 9,213 U.S. Veterans who were opioid-naïve (not on prescribed opioids the year prior to their cancer diagnosis). The team found that potentially dangerous co-prescription of opioid and benzodiazepine (a central nervous system depressant that treats anxiety, insomnia, and seizures and should not be combined with opioids) medications occurred in 366 (4.0%) Veterans during follow-up. A higher intensity of exposure to opioid prescriptions during treatment was associated with these outcomes. People with a prior history of chronic pain, greater comorbidities, lower socioeconomic status, and who received adjuvant chemotherapy were at especially high risk of opioid use in the year after surgery. This is important as many patients are living longer after a cancer diagnosis and treatment." Marilyn M. Schapira, MD, MPH, lead author, University of Pennsylvania Schapira, M. M., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clinical data presented today demonstrates the combination of tarlatamab with anti-PD-L1 therapy as first-line maintenance has an acceptable safety profile and resulted in unprecedented overall survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Paulson, MD, Providence-Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, Wash., presented new safety and efficacy data from the phase 1b DeLLphi-303 trial evaluating tarlatamab in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy as first-line maintenance treatment for ES-SCLC at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in Barcelona, Spain. Tarlatamab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®) immunotherapy designed to direct cytotoxic T cells to target and destroy cancer cells expressing delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3). Previous studies have shown tarlatamab prolongs overall survival in the second-line SCLC setting. The phase 1b trial enrolled 88 patients with ES-SCLC who had completed 4–6 cycles of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy and anti-PD-L1 (unless unavailable) without disease progression. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 6% of patients. Importantly, treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events decreased over time, demonstrating long-term tolerability. The combination of tarlatamab with anti-PD-L1 therapy as first-line maintenance demonstrates a manageable safety profile and unprecedented overall survival in this patient population. These results support further evaluation of this combination in the active phase 3 DeLLphi-305 trial (NCT06211036) as a promising therapeutic strategy in first-line ES-SCLC."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multi-center, randomized phase III trial has found that a three-week hypofractionated radiotherapy (HypoRT) schedule with concurrent chemotherapy provides similar survival outcomes and reduced toxicity compared to the standard six-week conventional fractionated radiotherapy (ConvRT) schedule for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). In hypofractionated radiotherapy for lung cancer treatment, clinicians deliver fewer radiation treatments (fractions) at higher doses per session compared to standard radiotherapy schedules. The study, conducted across 16 hospitals in China, randomized 530 patients to receive either HypoRT (45 Gy in 15 daily fractions over 3 weeks) or ConvRT (60 Gy in 30 daily fractions over 6 weeks), both given with concurrent cisplatin/carboplatin-etoposide chemotherapy. Patients receiving HypoRT experienced significantly fewer severe treatment-related adverse events including lower rates of hematologic toxicity, lymphopenia, and radiation pneumonitis. Our findings suggest that hypofractionated radiotherapy can provide a shorter, more convenient treatment course with fewer side effects while maintaining comparable survival outcomes to conventional radiotherapy. This approach could be an important option for patients, especially in settings where reducing treatment time and toxicity is a priority." The investigators note that further research is warranted to explore HypoRT in combination with immunotherapy given its potential immune-sparing benefits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a landmark study of Hispanic and Latino adults, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have identified a link between self-reported cognitive decline and blood-based biomarkers, which could pave the way for a simple blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This approach could be faster, less-invasive and more affordable than existing screening tools. The results are published in JAMA Network Open. We need ways to identify underlying neurodegenerative diseases earlier in patients with cognitive symptoms. This study highlights the promise of blood-based biomarkers as a more accessible and scalable tool for understanding cognitive decline, particularly in populations that have been underserved by traditional methods." There is currently only one blood test approved by the Food and Drug Administration to assist in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. While this test, the Lumipulse G pTau217/Aβ42 plasma ratio, can detect proteins associated with Alzheimer's in the blood, it is currently very expensive and only available in specialized care settings. Whether or not blood can be reliably used for early Alzheimer's detection on a larger scale is still unknown. This clinical study assessed neurocognition in a subset of participants from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, the largest, most comprehensive long-term study of Hispanic and Latino health and disease in the United States. "Hispanic and Latino adults are thought to be more likely to get Alzheimer's and related dementias, and this group is projected to have the largest increases in disease prevalence over the coming decades," said senior author Hector M. González, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine. "Despite this, they're still significantly underrepresented in Alzheimer's and dementia research, which is something our study aimed to address." They also assessed participants for subjective cognitive decline, which refers to a decline in cognitive status that the individual themself perceives. In addition to providing evidence that blood-based biomarkers can be used to detect Alzheimer's and related dementias early, the researchers also note that a strength of their study is its diverse population. "By including participants from underrepresented communities, we're able to better understand how social determinants of health and comorbidities may influence cognitive trajectories and dementia risk," added Márquez. "This makes our findings especially relevant for real-world settings." However, the researchers also caution that it will take further research for this approach to make its way into widespread clinical practice, and that even when this happens, the test will still be just one tool in a clinician's diagnostic arsenal. It's important to note that there's still a lot we don't know about the utility of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's detection," said Márquez. "These tests have tremendous potential, but they should complement existing approaches, not replace them."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interim results from the NADIM ADJUVANT Phase III trial, led by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (GECP), suggest that adjuvant chemo-immunotherapy may reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with completely resected stage IB–IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Between January 2021 and December 2022, 206 patients from 30 hospitals across Spain were randomized 1:1 to receive either adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC5 plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m² every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) followed by observation (control arm) or the same chemotherapy plus nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (experimental arm). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed using circulating tumor DNA (Guardant Reveal). Mariano Provencio, MD, PhD, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, reported that median DFS was not reached in either arm after a median follow-up of 34 months and the DFS first quartile was 30.98 months (experimental) vs. 17.01 months (control). Dr. Provencio also reported that the postoperative MRD associated with significantly worse DFS in the experimental arm (HR = 5.7, p = 0.045) and grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events: 26.2% (experimental) vs. 14.5% (control) during adjuvant phase. The interim results of NADIM ADJUVANT suggest that adding nivolumab to adjuvant chemotherapy can reduce recurrence risk and may offer meaningful clinical benefit for patients with completely resected stage IB–IIIA NSCLC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients diagnosed with recurrent or progressive extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) may benefit from treatment with ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7-H3–directed antibody–drug conjugate, according to data presented today at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) in Barcelona, Spain. Patients with ES-SCLC face poor prognoses and have limited treatment options. B7-H3 is overexpressed in all subtypes of SCLC, and its overexpression is associated with worse clinical outcomes, making it an attractive target for novel therapies. This analysis of IDeate-Lung01 included patients treated with I-DXd 12 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks during the dose optimization and extension parts of the study. At the March 3, 2025 data cutoff, 137 patients had received I-DXd after one (23.4%), two (54.7%), or three (21.9%) prior lines of systemic therapy. For example, among the second-line subgroup (n=32), ORR was 56.3% and PFS and OS were numerically longer than in the overall population. Adjudicated treatment-related interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis occurred in 17 patients, of which 6 cases were grade ≥3 severity. These results demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of ifinatamab deruxtecan in patients with ES-SCLC population who have a substantial unmet need. The manageable safety profile and high response rates support further investigation of I-DXd[RL1] in small cell lung cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uric acid builds up in the blood when the body cannot excrete it efficiently, leading to painful gout attacks, kidney stones, and other complications. Current treatments often rely on drugs that block uric acid production, but these can have side effects and do not work for everyone. For many years, uric acid degradation is known as occurring mainly through an oxidative pathway, in which uricase enzymes use oxygen to break the purine ring and convert uric acid into allantoin. Humans and higher primates lack functional uricase, which is why they are particularly prone to uric acid accumulation and gout.A new study published in Life Metabolism reports an alternative "reductive pathway" that functions without oxygen. In this route, uric acid is first reduced to a newly identified metabolite, "yanthine", and then further broken down by a sequence of reductive dearomatization and ring-cleaving reactions, ultimately yielding small molecules such as pyruvate and ammonia. This discovery revises the long-standing view of purine catabolism and highlights the metabolic versatility of gut bacteria in anaerobic environments.Importantly, the study also detected "yanthine" circulating in human blood, with significantly higher levels in patients with gout compared with healthy individuals. This suggests that "yanthine" could serve as a biomarker for diagnosing or monitoring uric acid-related disorders. In a uricase-deficient mouse model of hyperuricemia, oral administration of this engineered strain significantly lowered blood uric acid levels, alleviated kidney injury, and remained stably colonized in the gut.Together, these findings establish the reductive uric acid pathway as a major addition to the known repertoire of microbial metabolism. The work not only advances fundamental understanding of purine degradation but also points towards practical applications in biomarker discovery and the development of probiotic-based strategies to help control gout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), iza-bren (BL-B01D1), demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy results in previously treated patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to findings presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC). The drug was evaluated in two Phase I/II studies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including EGFR-mutated NSCLC. The most frequent hematologic treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were anemia (90.6%), leukopenia (80.7%), neutropenia (78.4%), and thrombocytopenia (74.3%). The most frequent non-hematologic TRAEs included nausea, alopecia, and asthenia. Only 1.2% of patients were discontinued due to TRAEs, and no treatment-related death was observed. This early data suggests iza-bren may offer a promising treatment option for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Phase III registrational study of iza-bren as monotherapy in EGFR-mutated NSCLC after progression on a third generation TKI is ongoing in China."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adding ivonescimab, a first-in-class bispecific antibody targeting both PD-1 and VEGF, to chemotherapy significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations whose disease progressed on third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Results from the global Phase 3 HARMONi trial were presented today by Jonathan Goldman, UCLA Health, Los Angeles at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC). The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 438 patients worldwide, including 38% from North America and Europe, with a median age of 62 years. Nearly one-quarter (24.7%) had brain metastases at study entry. Patients received ivonescimab (20 mg/kg) or placebo in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin for four cycles, followed by maintenance therapy. At the primary analysis (N=345; median follow-up 22.3 months), ivonescimab plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 48% compared to chemotherapy alone (HR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.41–0.66; P<0.001). VEGF-related events, including reversible hypertension and proteinuria, were more frequent with ivonescimab but generally manageable. Ivonescimab plus chemotherapy provided a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival while maintaining a favorable safety profile in this difficult-to-treat patient population. The benefits were seen regardless of brain metastases status or geographic region and were supported by a positive overall survival trend."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) validates the use of Sybil, a deep learning artificial intelligence model, for predicting future lung cancer risk in a predominantly Black population. While prior United States Sybil validations were conducted in cohorts that were more than 90% White, this new analysis focused on a population where 62% of participants identified as Non-Hispanic Black, 13% Hispanic, and 4% Asian. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for lung cancer risk up to six years after a single low-dose CT (LDCT) scan. This study confirms that Sybil performs well in a racially and socioeconomically diverse setting, supporting its broader utility for lung cancer screening. It shows promise as a tool for improving early detection and addressing disparities in lung cancer outcomes." If a lung cancer screening model has an AUC of 0.94, that means there's a 94% chance the model will correctly rank a randomly chosen patient who develops cancer in the future as higher risk than a randomly chosen patient who does not develop cancer in the near future. She reported that the results remained strong when restricted to Black participants and after excluding cancers diagnosed within three months of screening. According to Pasquinelli, the study affirms Sybil's clinical generalizability and suggests that the model may be unbiased with respect to factors like race and ethnicity, demonstrating strong performance in underrepresented communities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Specifically, having hypertension or elevated blood pressure as a child may increase the risk of death by 40% to 50% over the next five decades of an individual's life. Our results highlight the importance of screening for blood pressure in childhood and focusing on strategies to promote optimal cardiovascular health beginning in childhood." Previous research has shown that childhood blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood, and a 2022 study found that elevated blood pressure in older children (average age of 12 years) increased the risk of cardiovascular death by middle age (average age of 46 years). Clinical practice guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend checking blood pressure at annual well-child pediatric appointments starting at age 3 years. "The results of this study support monitoring blood pressure as an important metric of cardiovascular health in childhood," said Bonita Falkner, M.D., FAHA, an American Heart Association volunteer expert. "Moreover, the results of this study and other older child cohort studies with potential follow-up in adulthood will contribute to a more accurate definition of abnormal blood pressure and hypertension in childhood." Falkner, who was not involved in this study, is emeritus professor of pediatrics and medicine at Thomas Jefferson University. Blood pressure measured in the children at age 7 years were converted to age-, sex-, and height-specific percentiles according to the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guidelines. The analysis accounted for demographic factors as well as for childhood body mass index, to ensure that the findings were related to childhood blood pressure itself rather than a reflection of children who were overweight or had obesity. After follow-up through an average age of 54 years, the analysis found: "Even in childhood, blood pressure numbers are important because high blood pressure in children can have serious consequences throughout their lives. It is crucial to be aware of your child's blood pressure readings," Freedman said. In addition, participants in the CPP were primarily Black or white, therefore the study's findings may not be generalizable to children of other racial or ethnic groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) compared to open lobectomy had a significantly improved overall survival rate, according to a meta-analysis presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC). Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is currently the most common approach to perform pulmonary lobectomy in early-stage lung cancer. Advantages include reduced pain, fewer complications, faster recovery and improved quality-of-life. The adoption of VATS lobectomy is based on proven non-oncological benefits. According to Dr. Jacie Jiaqi Law, Royal Brompton Hospital, United Kingdom, none of the three largest contemporary randomized trials completed have been powered to detect a difference in overall or disease-free survival. To answer this important question, Dr. Law and fellow researchers sought to identify randomized trials comparing VATS and open lobectomy in early-stage lung cancer and obtain individual patient data from these trials to conduct a meta-analysis. Of the 556 potential studies identified, only three were randomized trials that met the eligibility criteria: Bendixen et al. from Denmark (NCT01278888), Long et al. from China (NCT01102517) and Lim et al. from the United Kingdom (NCT03521375). The primary analysis indicated significantly improved overall survival for patients randomized to VATS compared to open lobectomy, pooled hazard ratio (HR) 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.96), representing a 21% reduction in the risk of death in the VATS lobectomy group. There was no difference in disease-free survival, pooled HR 0.91 (95% CI 0.75-1.12). For the first time, we provide evidence that a simple change in surgical access to VATS reduces the overall risk of death by 21% without any compromise to disease-free survival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan's capital city that she never would have expected. Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a "Black Lives Matter" sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women's Center staff reported being harassed. A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by "First Amendment auditors" outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said. Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Researchers at American University's Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, "hate is intersectional." (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL's director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of "A Minecraft Movie" prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people. The team defines extremism as the belief that one's group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination. Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they're on their own. Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center's deputy director of prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that's rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust? They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. "We're not about, 'How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?'" Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL's deputy director of regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen. Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer's covid lockdown directives. Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about "how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible." The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved. The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one. Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flood the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. It's "providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward," she said. It's a way to channel energy "and feel like you can actually create change with community." Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities. In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book "They She He Me: Free to Be!" Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. "It's really important that rural communities not be left behind," Flanagan said. "They persistently are in America, and then they're often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges." The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children's Hospital's Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City's Citizens Crime Commission. And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism. Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, "I would say now it has been completely shattered." Violent extremists now feel "unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long-term use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs may help older adults fall asleep, but new research shows they alter sleep architecture and brain activity in ways that could undermine memory and next-day functioning. Study: Effect of chronic benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use on sleep architecture and brain oscillations in older adults with chronic insomnia. In a recent study published in Sleep, a group of researchers tested whether chronic benzodiazepine (BZD) and benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use alters sleep architecture and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) oscillations in older adults with insomnia. Insomnia affects approximately one-third of older adults, and benzodiazepines (BZDs) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs, or “Z-drugs”) are frequently prescribed. These medications can reduce sleep onset latency and improve sleep continuity, but their long-term use is associated with risks such as falls, cognitive impairment, and residual daytime sedation. Slow-wave sleep and its associated neural oscillations are central to memory consolidation and cognitive function. Chronic sedative use may disrupt these processes, highlighting the need for further research on how specific drugs and doses affect sleep architecture and brain activity in aging populations. Older adults aged 55-80 years were classified as good sleepers (GS), individuals with insomnia disorder (INS), or individuals with insomnia plus chronic sedative use (MED). All provided consent and completed polysomnography (PSG). Participants in MED continued their prescribed medication (BZDs or BZRAs). An electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from 13 scalp electrodes. Spectral power was estimated with fast Fourier transformation and Welch's method and summarized as relative power in slow oscillation (SO), delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta bands. Slow oscillations were detected using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter; coupling between SO and spindles was quantified with phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), modulation index (MI), and preferred coupling phase (CP). Group differences were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and non-parametric tests with false discovery rate control. Exploratory analyses related to medication dose (diazepam equivalents) and duration to sleep metrics were performed, and BZD versus BZRA users were compared. The study analyzed 101 participants (mean age 66 years; 73% women): GS n=28, INS n=26, and MED n=47 taking nightly sedative-hypnotics for more than three nights per week. Compared with GS, both INS and MED showed lower sleep efficiency, more wake after sleep onset, and altered stage distribution. Chronic medication use was linked to lighter, less restorative sleep. The MED group spent more time in stage N1 (the lightest stage of NREM sleep) and less in stage N3 (deep slow-wave NREM sleep) than both GS and INS, with stage N2 (intermediate NREM sleep) also prolonged versus INS. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration did not differ across groups, although REM latency (trend; not significant after multiple-comparison correction) tended to be longer in MED. In the spectral analysis, the MED group showed lower NREM theta power compared with GS, and lower REM theta power than GS and INS. During NREM sleep, frontal sigma power was higher and frontal low-beta power lower in MED relative to GS. The delta-to-beta ratio, an index of cortical arousal, was reduced in MED compared with both GS and INS. Analysis of discrete oscillations revealed selective changes: frontal spindle density was higher in MED than in INS, while SO density and amplitude did not differ across groups. Critically, the temporal alignment of rhythms was altered in MED. MI was lower in MED compared with GS, and the preferred CP occurred later in MED compared with GS and INS, a profile unfavorable for memory consolidation. However, restorative deep sleep was reduced. After adjusting for dose, outcomes did not differ between BZDs and BZRAs. Age was regressed out of all sleep measures, and insomnia severity scores were higher in INS and MED than in GS, with MED slightly lower than INS. No group differences were observed for SO delta or alpha power; the coupling metrics did not scale with dose. Together, the macro- and micro-level signatures indicate that chronic sedative-hypnotic use is associated with poorer sleep regulation in late life and may help to explain, though the study did not directly test, reports of next-day grogginess and cognitive decline by disrupted oscillatory coupling. In older adults with insomnia, chronic BZD and BZRA use is associated with more light sleep, less deep sleep, reduced theta activity, altered spindle dynamics, and weaker, delayed coupling between slow oscillations and spindles, mechanisms linked to memory. These objective changes may help explain reports of next-day grogginess and cognitive decline in long-term users and support cautious, dose-aware prescribing. Expanding access to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and developing alternatives that preserve brain rhythms could improve sleep and protect cognition today. A., Cross, N. E., Weiner, O.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A simple EEG scan can reveal hidden memory problems in just three minutes, giving doctors a powerful new tool to detect dementia earlier and more accurately. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause, accounting for 32 million cases globally. A recent paper in Brain Communications presents Fastball, a new electroencephalography (EEG) method that aims to measure recognition memory and diagnose mild cognitive impairment, an interim stage between normal cognition and dementia that is often an early manifestation of AD. Up to 75% of dementia is caused by AD, indicating the urgent need for better and earlier diagnostic tools. These would facilitate earlier treatment and enable patients to make proper arrangements for future care once the disease progresses. Amnestic MCI patients mainly suffer memory loss, while non-amnestic MCI patients have standard memory despite issues with attention or visuospatial processing. The former progress to dementia at 10%-17% a year, with 38% showing signs of dementia at 2.5 years and up to 60% after four years. Biomarkers like amyloid and tau protein deposition are used for biological AD testing, but they are expensive, invasive, and restricted in availability. Unfortunately, amyloid deposition is not inevitably a sign of cognitive decline, and vice versa. Blood biomarkers promise earlier detection of these abnormal proteins and could help predict changes in brain structure. Researchers seek reliable methods to judge cognitive function based on these brain markers. Cognitive impairment symptoms appear only 10-20 years after amyloid-tau deposition begins to occur. Cognitive testing helps assign clinical stages, but various demographic and cultural characteristics, including education and culture, can bias the results. Language impairments make these tests even less reliable and more complicated to apply. A sensitive and unbiased measure of cognitive function is needed, one that can be combined with amyloid-tau biomarkers to improve both early diagnosis and accurate staging of the disease. EEG directly measures brain activity during tasks that involve thought. Still, it is not widely adopted to diagnose or screen individual patients because of the long duration of the test and variability between subjects. Fastball (fast periodic visual stimulation, FPVS) is an EEG method that can potentially be a sensitive, easily administered, inexpensive test for AD. Healthy older adults typically show impaired recollection of details but preserve familiarity, meaning they often cannot recall exact information yet still recognize a stimulus as previously encountered. Both AD and MCI patients have impaired recollection, while familiarity trends are more variable. However, amnestic MCI is more consistently associated with familiarity deficits. This area is selectively impacted in amnestic MCI patients who are developing dementia. The researchers tested amnestic dysfunction (failure of memory recall) in MCI patients. The study included 54 healthy older people and 53 MCI patients. All participants completed a three-minute task consisting of watching images flashing by as Fastball monitored them. The EEG recorded how well they could automatically differentiate previously seen images from new, unfamiliar ones. All tests, including Fastball, were repeated after a year to validate Fastball's reproducibility and capture its sensitivity to reduced cognitive function after one year. Analysis of their responses showed that the alterations in Fastball responses selectively identified patients at risk of losing recognition memory. In contrast, behavioral accuracy predicted both memory and attention performance, showing it was less selective than the EEG-based Fastball measure. While amnestic MCI patients had less accurate recognition responses than healthy older people, the latter were comparable to non-amnestic MCI participants. For reaction times, amnestic MCI patients were slower than both groups. Fastball also picked up a trend towards lower Fastball recordings at baseline in the MCI patients who developed dementia over the follow-up year (n=6). However, the authors caution that numbers were small and too low for meaningful statistical comparison, so this cannot yet be taken as predictive, pending further follow-up. This pilot study thus established Fastball as a method to test recognition memory in patients with cognitive impairment. “Fastball is a viable functional biomarker that can help to advance cognitive assessment in MCI.” It is convenient, non-invasive, easy to use, inexpensive, and scalable, not requiring the patient's cooperation. The responses are reliable, with little variability across sessions. The authors say, “We do not propose that Fastball could, or even should, replace standard pen and paper cognitive testing. Rather we propose that an implicit neural measure has many potential practical advantages and with sufficient technological development could be delivered and interpreted as easily as an electrocardiogram, which is routinely delivered economically, at scale, with minimal training required.” Further follow-up is planned to establish the prognostic value for AD when Fastball is used as a baseline measure.

She has counseled hundreds of patients facing issues from pregnancy-related problems and infertility, and has been in charge of over 2,000 deliveries, striving always to achieve a normal delivery rather than operative.

GMP certification in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina covers the top three most populous countries in South America, representing 71.4 % of the continent's population. BioDlink's manufacturing facilities span 50,000 square meters and have passed antibody drug and ADC EU-QP inspection (including zero-defect) five times in the past four years. Both nations see a trend toward an increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer. The launch of bevacizumab injection seeks to lower the cost of treatment for both public health systems and patients, while maintaining rigorous global quality standards. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is widely used in the treatment of various cancers, including metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC). According to industry estimates, bevacizumab injection achieved global sales of USD 8.5 billion in 2023. Cancer incidence is rising sharply, especially colorectal cancer, which has seen a global increase in early-onset cases in middle- and low‑income countries. Since BioDlink signed an international commercialization agreement with Kexing BioPharm in early 2022, both parties have achieved an efficient closed-loop “R&D-manufacturing-access” model. BioDlink focuses on ensuring international manufacturing and supply chain robustness, while Kexing BioPharm leverages its global channels to drive localized market access efficiently.
