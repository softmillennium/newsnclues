                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guillermo Ochoa's AEL Limassol debut ended in disaster, as the Mexican goalkeeper conceded five goals in a heavy 5-0 loss to Omonia on Monday. The setback capped a turbulent summer in which Ochoa served as a Gold Cup backup and saw a move to Spanish side Burgos collapse before landing in Cyprus to chase regular minutes. It took Ochoa four long months to step back onto a professional pitch, but his long-awaited debut in Cyprus turned out to be a disaster. His last official appearance dated back to May, when he played for AVS in Portugal's Primeira Liga — a 3-0 defeat to Moreirense that closed his chapter in that league. Ochoa held firm for just 21 minutes in his first start for the club, his seventh in Europe, before Senou Coulibaly opened the scoring with an unstoppable strike. Early on, the veteran showed poise and barked instructions to organize his back line, but repeated defensive lapses left him exposed and chasing the game. Ochoa made several saves to keep the score from growing even worse, but the lopsided result underscored a rocky beginning to his Cypriot adventure. He joined AEL Limassol in an effort to earn consistent minutes and regain rhythm as he hopes to convince Mexico coach Javier Aguirre that he belongs on Mexico's roster in next summer's tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The past week was full of action for U.S. Men's National Team players. From Christian Pulisic's dominant brace in AC Milan's Serie A win to Tim Weah's goal for Olympique de Marseille in the UEFA Champions League, Americans made their mark in the biggest moments across the globe. In AC Milan's 3-0 victory against Udinese, Christian Pulisic accounted for two of those goals. It was the USMNT veteran's fourth goal in five matches this season across all competitions. His three Serie A goals lead the league. The score also put the winger ahead of USMNT legend Clint Dempsey with most all-time goals scored (59) by an American in Europe's top five leagues. Tim Weah began the UEFA Champions League campaign with new club Olympique de Marseille in style, scoring the opening goal in the opening group match against Real Madrid. The goal came in the 22nd minute as Weah's teammate Mason Greenwood slyly stole the ball from a Real Madrid defender and began a break that culminated in an assist to Weah. It was Weah's second UCL goal and his first with Marseille. Real Madrid won the match 2-1 after two penalties by Kylian Mbappé. The EFL Cup match between South London rivals Crystal Palace and Millwall was one of those moments. While Millwall equalized just before the final whistle in stoppage time, Palace advanced in the tournament in a penalty shootout, where Richards calmly netted a kick from the spot. He made two saves in the match against Charlotte including denying a penalty kick in the 69th minute. Malik Tillman delivered a standout performance for Leverkusen in the 1-1 draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach and fellow USMNT players Joe Scally and Gio Reyna. Following a saved header attempt by his Lyon teammate, Tessmann reacted quickly to slam home the rebound in the 65th minute. It was his first goal of the 2025-26 season and his second total for Lyon since joining the French squad in 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Italy deals with a general strike in protest at the situation in Gaza, FIGC President Gabriele Gravina warns boycotting the World Cup qualifier ‘would only favour Israel.' The global condemnation against the on-going blockade in Gaza is growing, with a UN Human Rights Council report accusing Israel of committing genocide. There is pressure on UEFA and FIFA to suspend Israel from global competition, following the actions taken against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Italy's trade unions have staged a general strike today in protest at the situation, blocking public transport, universities and roads. It all creates a difficult situation for Italian football to deal with, as they are set to host Israel in a 2026 World Cup qualifier in Udine on October 14. “It would be a terrible mistake to think we could boycott the game against Israel,” Federation President Gravina told reporters at the Premio Prisco event. “We would be awarded a defeat, meaning we'd miss out on the World Cup, and the result would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament.” Football is doing something, we activated a project within the UEFA foundation to help children in need. “I denounce the scenes of great suffering that we unfortunately see every day, but the responsibility must not be on the Federation, but those higher up than us who will soon have to give answers. “I feel indignant as a man at all we are seeing, there is nobody who could be indifferent to this feeling of suffering and pain.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rule change that could redefine the history of soccer is reportedly under discussion at FIFA. Former Spanish referee Eduardo Iturralde revealed on Cadena Ser's Carrusel Deportivo that FIFA's head of referees, Pierluigi Collina, is pushing an idea that would radically change the way penalties are executed. The attacking player would no longer be able to follow up on a rebound. Instead, the defending team would restart play with a goal kick. Should the proposal gain approval, it would not take effect until after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada from June 11 to July 19. 1 in FIFA rankings: When they were last on top and why it's a big deal The IFAB is made up of eight members: four from FIFA and one each from the four British football associations (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland). Because soccer originated in the UK, these associations retain equal voting power. For any rule change to pass, at least six votes are required. FIFA's four votes give it the effective power of veto: if all four FIFA representatives oppose a proposal, it cannot move forward, even if the British associations vote in favor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some big names delivered as the USMNT's Europe-based contingent featured in domestic action in their respective leagues over the weekend. Whether it was Christian Pulisic dominating or Malik Tillman progressing, here's how they fared. Christian Pulisic is no stranger to breaking records. And on Saturday, after his double helped Milan to a 3-0 win away at Udinese, he ticked over another milestone. That brace took Pulisic to 59 goals in those top five leagues (Pulisic has played in the Bundesliga, Premier League and Serie A), meaning he eclipsed Clint Dempsey, who held the previous record with 57. The Italian media were quick to offer their plaudits. He's always the one scoring,” wrote La Gazzetta dello Sport. 2 & 1 – Christian Pulisic is the second #USMNT player to record 2 goals and an assist in a match in the top 5 European leagues over the last 20 years (Jordan Pefok for Rennes vs. Nîmes in 2018). Corriere dello Sport were equally enamoured: “Back as a starter and an absolute protagonist of the match. Two goals, one assist, and the opponents were almost always forced to stop him with fouls. After Pulisic started the previous two league games on the bench, it now seems clear that new Milan manager Max Allegri knows the American is a player upon whom he can always rely. The midfielder scored the goal that looked like ensuring a win for Kasper Hjulmand's side, only for visitors Borussia Monchengladbach to equalise in added time. So he will be disappointed that Gladbach, featuring Joe Scally at right-back, grabbed a late point. Tillman had endured a tough night last week in Leverkusen's 2-2 Champions League opener with Copenhagen, and was taken off five minutes after the break. “We have to remember that this is not only Malik, it's also players like Eli (Ben Seghir), other players like (Ernest) Poku, Claudio (Echeverri),” Hjulmand said in his press conference after that draw on Thursday. “That's one of the great things about this squad. But you cannot expect it just to be like that from the beginning. Aside from reigning champions Liverpool, only one other team are yet to lose a game in the Premier League. The defender was superb against West Ham — whether it was the goal-line clearance from Lucas Paqueta, or nipping the ball from Callum Wilson as West Ham tried to break at pace. After they saw out a nervy win, Palace manager Oliver Gasner joked that the players need to look after his heart. But with Richards in his ever-reliable back three, he can at least have faith nobody will breach the Eagles defence easily. Some wrote Brenden Aaronson off early this season. As Leeds United look to stay in the Premier League, the naysayers claimed manager Daniel Farke would need better quality in midfield. But he did not let that narrative get him down, and he has now started the last two games in a wide-midfield role. On Saturday, Aaronson played 90 minutes in that position and Leeds finally clicked, coming from behind to defeat Wolves 3-1. “We know Brenden has challenges in his offensive game in terms of decision-making, being a bit clearer and more straightforward,” he told the Yorkshire Post. “This is something we speak a lot about. “It's important not to put too much weight on his shoulders. Sometimes, the feeling with Brenden is that we are a bit over-critical in public. In training, we bring him more into positions where he has to make decisions. But it's not helpful if everyone is always criticising him.” In Italy, Weston McKennie must have thought he'd done enough to win back his own starting place after starring in Juventus' recent win over Inter and the frenetic Champions League draw with Dortmund. But he was back on the bench for Saturday's 1-1 draw at Hellas Verona, and coach Igor Tudor did not see fit to use him as a substitute, either. See if Pulisic can help Milan progress in the Coppa Italia on Tuesday. Last term, they lost the final 1-0 to Bologna, and this time around, they face Lecce in the second round (12pm, Paramount +). Tanner Tessmann was the star as Lyon beat Angers 1-0 last Friday in Ligue 1, scoring the game's only goal and shining in central midfield. Watch if he can maintain that fine form in the Europa League as his side take on Utrecht on Thursday (3pm, Paramount +) Saturday sees two Americans go head-to-head in the Bundesliga, as Tillman's Leverkusen face James Sands' St Pauli (9:30am, ESPN+). The latter was booked as St Pauli lost their unbeaten start with a 2-0 reverse at Stuttgart on Friday, but has otherwise had a strong start to the season after recovering from injury. He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso has clarified that Jude Bellingham's position in his team will be as an attacking midfielder. Following the acquisition of Kylian Mbappé in the summer of 2024, Carlo Ancelotti shifted Bellingham into a more withdrawn midfield position, prompting his goal tally to drop from 23 to 14 despite playing 600 more minutes across his second campaign. Alonso, who hurriedly replaced Ancelotti ahead of the Club World Cup, spent the summer tournament openly experimenting with a range of formations. Bellingham started all six matches as Madrid made it to the semifinals while operating in a vast array of roles, shifting between one of the most attacking outlets to one of the more defensive. Shoulder surgery forced Bellingham to miss Madrid's first five fixtures of the new campaign before making his long-awaited return as a late substitute against Espanyol on Saturday. Madrid have made a perfect start to the season under Alonso, collecting six wins from six, but the Spanish coach insisted that Bellingham would be warmly welcomed back into the first-team setup. Exactly where that would be on the pitch was also cleared up. “Jude's position is as an attacking midfielder,” Alonso told assembled media over the weekend. Recently departed Real Madrid cult hero Lucas Vázquez replied to Bellingham's post hailing his return with the simple line: “Star is back.” Who is overshadowed by this blinding beacon remains to be seen. Aurélien Tchouaméni is the only midfielder to start all six games this season and has effectively locked down the central defensive role. Arda Güler would be the most obvious figure to make way for Bellingham. The ever-improving Turkish playmaker has received warm praise from Alonso after bulking up over the summer to add some gusto to his innate grace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a disastrous start, Italy's qualifying campaign for the 2026 FIFA World Cup finally kicked into gear during the international break, with Gennaro Gattuso managing to stamp his authority over his newly inherited side. Things couldn't have got off to a worse possible beginning, though, when the Italians were thumped 3-0 by Norway in Oslo, a result that cost former manager Luciano Spalletti his job. In his first game in charge, Gattuso managed to mastermind a 5-0 drubbing of Estonia, with the Azzurri shedding their low-scoring skin at halftime to net five unanswered second-half goals. Then, Italy continued in their newfound high-scoring ways, winning a 5-4 thriller against Israel thanks to Sandro Tonali's last-gasp goal. Now, the four-time world champions are back in contention, and the excitement of an epic comeback is beginning to build in Bel Paese. But it isn't just in Southern Europe where anticipation ahead of next summer's North American spectacle is reaching a fever pitch. Not only have the Socceroos already punched their tickets to the FIFA World Cup after finishing as runners-up to Japan in their qualifying group, but now their esteemed online casinos are rolling out some epic football-themed slot games in a bid to get Aussies in the mood for next June and July. Inspired by the planet's biggest sporting event, the popular IgnitionCasino Australia has developed a range of games that have resonated strongly with its dedicated user base. Titles such as “Hat Trick Hero” have become particularly popular among both fans and slot enthusiasts alike, with the accessibility of these games drawing significant praise: They can be enjoyed at any time on a smart device with a stable internet connection. For Italy, their bid to end a 12-year World Cup qualifying drought is alive and well, but how did their last two ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaigns begin in comparison to this year's? Eight years ago, in qualifying for Russia 2018, that wasn't the case. Italy would back that up with a draw against heavyweights Spain in Turin, thanks to a late equalizer from Daniele De Rossi, and further positive results would follow. Immobile struck a 92nd-minute winner on the road against North Macedonia, as well as goals in the victories against Liechtenstein (twice) and Albania. La Roja ran out 3-0 victors when they welcomed Italy to the Bernabeu, putting them in pole position. Italy then dropped further points in their home game against North Macedonia, officially consigning them to the playoffs. epa09847646 Italy's forward Domenico Berardi in action against North Macedonia's defender Ezgjan Alioski during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off qualifying soccer match between Italy and North Macedonia at the Renzo Barbera stadium in Palermo, Sicily, Italy, 24 March 2022. Despite missing the 2018 World Cup, Roberto Mancini managed to shockingly lead Italy to European Championship glory in the summer of 2021, with his side famously beating hosts England at Wembley on penalties. Back-to-back 2-0 away victories at Bulgaria and Lithuania then put the Azzurri in pole position. But following those triumphs, back-to-back slip-ups cost Mancini's men dearly. Another draw between those two sides, this time a 1-1 finish in Rome, meant that qualification would be decided in the final qualifier. Italy headed to Northern Ireland knowing that a win would be enough. This time, they were stunned by North Macedonia, with Aleksandar Trajkovski's last-minute winner allowing them to progress and ensuring the Azzurri's wait to feature on the grandest stage that the beautiful game has to offer would extend beyond a decade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Nicol criticises Mikel Arteta for an overly conservative approach in Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Manchester City. The South African Football Association says it is unconcerned by FIFA's decision to open disciplinary proceedings against them for fielding suspended midfielder Teboho Mokoena in a FIFA World Cup qualifier against Lesotho. FIFA confirmed this week it had opened a case after South Africa used Mokoena in their 2-0 win over Lesotho in March, despite the midfielder having accumulated two yellow cards earlier in the qualifiers, which should have triggered an automatic one-match suspension. "We've received communication from FIFA about the investigation that they have launched in terms of the Lesotho match that Teboho Mokoena was fielded," SAFA chief executive Lydia Monyepao confirmed to reporters on Thursday in South Africa. "We are preparing our response to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee because that is what ultimately is required from us as an association." "They have started a process that should have started maybe a little earlier and we now await the outcome. "But for us, our focus remains on making sure that the Super Eagles can win their remaining two games and see what happens after that." Monyepao, who played for SA's women's national team Banyana Banyana, said SAFA would focus on making the consequences of that investigation moot but winning their remaining qualifying fixtures. She added: "We are not really worried about that. I think our focus right now is to ensure that Bafana Bafana gets maximum points come October because whatever happens, whether there is docking of points or whatever you're saying out there, if we get six points come October, nothing else is going to matter." If South Africa are sanctioned, it would dramatically alter Group C in African qualifying. Bafana Bafana currently top the group with 17 points, three ahead of Benin and six clear of Nigeria and Rwanda. Crucially, the West Africans would go top of the group with a superior goals difference of +4, as Bafana would drop from +8 to +2, with two matches to play next month. Bafana coach Hugo Broos even said at one point he thought they had gotten away with it. "We did something bad, we did something we shouldn't do, but there was no complaint," Broos told reporters in the pre-match press conference before the last round of matches. Benin coach Gernot Rohr, whose team is chasing South Africa at the top of the standings, criticized FIFA's silence. But nobody knows why they did not take this decision. FIFA should now very quickly give the decision." In 2018, when he was Nigeria coach, the Super Eagles were docked the points and goals for using Shehu Abdullahi against Algeria while suspended. Ultimately, the lapse did not cost Nigeria qualification, as the Super Eagles had amassed more than enough points. Cape Verde also suffered a similar fate when they lost out of the 2014 playoffs for fielding an ineligible player against Tunisia, handing their spot to the North Africans, that they had beaten in a huge upset win. This time, although SAFA have admitted their error, they are banking on results on the field to render any punishment irrelevant, just like Nigeria in 2018.</p>
