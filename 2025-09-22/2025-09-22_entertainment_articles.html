                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinclair Broadcast Group plans to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! on its ABC affiliates when the late-night host returns on Tuesday, but says that its talks with the network are ongoing. “Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Sinclair has the largest number of ABC affiliates among station groups. It owns or controls 39 ABC-affiliated stations across the country, including one of the most lucrative for reaching those in power: WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C. RELATED: FCC Chairman Says His “Easy Way Or The Hard Way” Comment About Jimmy Kimmel Wasn't Meant As A Threat To Pull Licenses If ABC Didn't Fire Him Last week, during his monologue, Kimmel said, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” FCC Chairman Brendan Carr warned the network and its stations: “Frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. RELATED: FCC Chairman Says His “Easy Way Or The Hard Way” Comment About Jimmy Kimmel Wasn't Meant As A Threat To Pull Licenses If ABC Didn't Fire Him Hours later, Nexstar said that it was pulling Jimmy Kimmel Live! from its ABC stations, and soon after, the network said that Kimmel was being taken off the air indefinitely. It called on the late-night host to issue a direct apology to the Kirk family and make make “a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA.” RELATED: Trump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President “Sinclair will not lift the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! on our stations until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability,” the company said last week. Sinclair also said that it planned to air a Charlie Kirk tribute special in Kimmel's time slot on Friday. But it instead moved that special to its YouTube channel and aired ABC's programming instead, a rerun of Celebrity Family Feud. Nexstar has not yet announced whether it will air Kimmel but is said to be monitoring the situation. Nexstar and Sinclair together represent about one-quarter of ABC's reach to households. RELATED: Jimmy Kimmel Impasse Follows Years Of Growing Tensions Between Local TV Stations And Broadcast Networks Sinclair has also been exploring a major transaction, while advocating for the ownership rule change.

Without Nexstar & Sinclair ABC affiliates, Kimmel is simply doing an afternoon stand-up routine at the El Capitan If an ABC station refuses to air Kimmel. ABC can offer the show to other stations in those markets. ABC should pull all their programming until they relent. See how things go when people don't get their Monday Night Football. Not unless ABC wants to be sued for breach of contract. They definitely need to pull MNF from Sinclair stations. He was simply saying that the alleged killer is MAGA. Kimmel didn't take a position on what he was. Dude was raised by an entire MAGA, gun loving family. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it. Does he say that the killer was MAGA? They did the same thing when Vance Boelter was on the loose, and some still pretend he was a Democrat even though he killed Melissa Hortman, her husband, and their dog because he was fanatical in his pro-life views. They cling to Tim Walz appointing Boelter to some lowly position on the Workforce Development Board, while ignoring the obvious. Don't get me wrong, I lean left, and we're just as guilty of pointing fingers and crying MAGA when there's a shooting. Both sides need to learn that these are the actions of crazed individuals who don't represent every person from their preferred political party. All we know is he comes from a self proclaimed MAGA family. It's less likely he was liberal given his background. lol, wow, I guess you've been living in a Faraday cage the past two weeks Taco had an entire press conference about autism today that was a lie, and a more dangerous one, shall we pull him off the air for good? Cause that lie will actually be harmful to humans. The only saving grace is that Disney can put him on Hulu, this might workout for Disney with more Hulu subscribers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The young couple welcomed a baby girl through adoption earlier this summer. Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi's new daughter was born to be Jon Bon Jovi‘s grandbaby. About a month after the Stranger Things actress and Rockbottom actor announced they'd welcomed a baby girl through adoption, the rock icon gave an update on life as a new grandpa while appearing on Bunnie xo's Dumb Blonde podcast. “[It's] crazy, but great,” he began of gaining a new family member. Brown and Bongiovi announced on Aug. 21 that they were now parents, writing in a joint statement, “This summer, we welcomed our sweet baby girl through adoption.” “We are beyond excited to embark on this beautiful next chapter of parenthood in both peace and privacy,” the pair continued. “They got married very young, but we blessed it because we get it,” Bon Jovi told Bunnie xo, who is married to country star Jelly Roll. Bon Jovi's Dumb Blonde debut comes as his band is gearing up to release Forever (Legendary Edition), a revamped edition of their 2024 album that will feature collaborations with Avril Lavigne, Bruce Springsteen, James Bay and more. Jelly also makes a cameo on the Oct. 24-slated LP, adding vocals to “Living Proof.” Listen to Bon Jovi's full interview with Bunnie xo below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Wall Street Journal, its parent company and Rupert Murdoch asked a federal judge to dismiss Donald Trump's $10 billion defamation lawsuit over the publication's report on the president's past connections to Jeffrey Epstein. “By its very nature, this meritless lawsuit threatens to chill the speech of those who dare to publish content that the President does not like.” The attorneys also challenged the notion that the article could have damaged Trump's reputation, noting that he had “publicly admitted to ‘locker room talk' and has made numerous bawdy public statements,” as well as to his relationship with Epstein. Read the Wall Street Journal motion to dismiss Trump's lawsuit. RELATED: White House Continues To Insist Trump Didn't Sign Epstein Birthday Letter In his lawsuit, Trump's legal team claimed that “no authentic letter or drawing exists.” The Journal‘s attorneys also wrote, “Even if it had reported that President Trump personally crafted the letter — and it does not — there is nothing defamatory about a person sending a bawdy note to a friend, and the Article cannot damage Plaintiff's reputation as a matter of law. As the Article reports, three months before the Birthday Book was gifted to Epstein, a New York magazine article quoted Plaintiff as saying that he had known Epstein for “15 years” and that Epstein was a “terrific guy,” “a lot of fun to be with,” and “likes beautiful women as much as I do.” President Trump has also publicly admitted to ‘locker room talk' and has made numerous bawdy public statements. The Article is therefore consistent with President Trump's self-described reputation.” In fact, the Journal‘s attorneys cited Trump's past comments captured on the infamous Access Hollywood tape, in which he told Billy Bush “when you're a star, they let you do it. In his lawsuit, Trump's attorneys wrote, “Hundreds of millions of people have already viewed the false and defamatory statements published by Defendants. And given the timing of the Defendants' article,which shows their malicious intent behind it, the overwhelming financial and reputational harmsuffered by President Trump will continue to multiply.” The Journal motion also sought attorneys fees and costs, as attorneys cited the anti-SLAPP statute in New York and Florida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney has reached a formal decision to bring Jimmy Kimmel back to the ABC airwaves on Tuesday night, just one week after his indefinite suspension following statements he made on Jimmy Kimmel Live! about Charlie Kirks' assassin and after a threat from President Trump's FCC chair. “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” the Walt Disney Company said in a statement. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,” he said, “and doing everything they can to score political points from it”. “Companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” “I got to say that's right out of Goodfellas,” said Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who rarely disagrees with MAGA world in public. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner chimed in as well. “Where has all the leadership gone?” he asked on X. By-the-way, for the record, this ex-CEO finds Jimmy Kimmel very talented and funny.” Earlier today, Howard Stern, a longtime friend of Kimmel, blasted Disney on his SiriusXM show, and said he canceled his Disney+ subscription in protest. “You can't support this kind of a move,” Stern said. “I don't care whether you like Jimmy or not. If ABC wanted to fire Jimmy because they didn't like him, or he had low ratings — they didn't want to fire him. Tom Holland Suffers Injury on ‘Spider-Man: Brand New Day' Set, Pauses Filming Charlie Kirk Memorial Showcases the Union of Trump, Republicans, and Conservative Christianity Adding to the pressure was an open letter from the ACLU signed by over 400 celebrities, including Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Selena Gomez, Tom Hanks, Olivia Rodrigo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Keaton, Regina King, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Natalie Portman, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short, and Kerry Washington. The campaign clearly reached Disney since they ultimately suspended Kimmel for under one week. And when he comes back to the air, expect record ratings. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson‘s knack for casting is one of his (many) strong suits as a creator. From recognizing the dramatic brilliance of someone like Adam Sandler, consistently finding new dimensions of repeat stars like Julianne Moore and John C. Reilly, and discovering brand-new stars like Alana Haim, PTA has one hell of an eye for star power (and all credit to his long-running partnership with casting director Cassandra Kulukundis, who has cast nine of 10 ten films). For his latest, “One Battle After Another,” PTA again assembles an enviable cast: Oscar winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro, and continuing collaborator Sean Penn, plus Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall making their PTA debut, and breakout star Chase Infiniti. Related Stories Scarlett Johansson Broke Box Office Records and Made Her Feature Directing Debut in the Same Year — Here's How Finding the Horror in Sports: Justin Tipping on ‘Him' As IndieWire's own David Ehrlich noted in his glowing review of the film, Infiniti is “magnetically self-possessed” and an “instant movie star.” (Having seen the film yesterday: when he's right, he's right.) After a special screening of the film in VistaVision held in New York City on Sunday afternoon, DiCaprio, Taylor, Infiniti, del Toro, Hall, and Penn stuck around to chat about the feature in a wide-ranging Q&A. DiCaprio shares plenty of screen time with the young star and was eager to talk about her performance, both on and off the screen. “It was beautiful to watch Chase come into an ecosystem like this, because I remember my first feature-length film and trusting so much in the director, the director is literally everything to you, and that bond started immediately with the two of them,” DiCaprio said. DiCaprio's first role was — and this is true! — in the direct-to-video sequel “Critters 3,” but he quickly followed that up with roles in two still-signature films for him: “This Boy's Life” (directed by Michael Caton-Jones) and “What's Eating Gilbert Grape” (directed by Lasse Hallström). They had this sort of unspoken relationship that was beautiful to witness. It reminded me of when I was younger and my first film.” Asked about her experience, Infiniti was quick to note the support she received from everyone, which engendered a level of trust that seems common on a PTA set. Warner Bros. will release “One Battle After Another” in theaters on Friday, September 26. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

It's been an extraordinary journey: eleven years since my promotion to President of Epic Records and six years since my appointment as Chairwoman and CEO. This role at Epic represents the third time in my career that I've been the first woman and first Black person to serve as CEO of a major record label owned by a Fortune 500 company. I've always been surrounded by excellent teams, but our current one at Epic is extraordinary. Spanning multiple generations, our team understands music's history, finds meaning in complex data, and anticipates emerging trends. While helping artists maintain authentic fan connections, our team guides them through partnerships in video, fashion, gaming, and content innovation. This moment of my transition invites reflection on a journey that has been wide-ranging in its scope and impact. Following my graduation from The Wharton School, I started as a secretary at Buddha Records and after working my way up through radio promotions, I was privileged to be appointed SVP of Black Music at Atlantic Records. Those times feel like yesterday, working with Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, En Vogue, LeVert, Brandy, Adina Howard, Troop, DAS EFX, Snow, MC Lyte, Kwamé, Miki Howard, Gerald Albright, The System and Ice Cube's Lynch Mob and Yo-Yo. Through our Ruthless Records deal, we also released The D.O.C., JJ Fad, Michel'le, and Easy-E. In July 1994, I was appointed Chairwoman of Elektra Records, where we orchestrated a cultural renaissance that still resonates today. From Pantera's intensity to Phish's improvisational spirit, from Tracy Chapman's truths and Anita Baker's soul to Tamia's powerful vocals — each artist flourished on their own frequency. Third Eye Blind, Yolanda Adams, Silk, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Gerald LeVert, Keith Sweat, Natalie Merchant, The Cure, Björk, Staind, Better Than Ezra, The Afghan Whigs, and Jason Mraz all found their home in our musical family, creating moments that transcended mere entertainment. Then came my chapter at Motown, where the label's iconic history and its future converged under my leadership as Chairwoman and CEO. It was an honor to record Stevie Wonder's last full-length studio album while simultaneously collaborating with artists like Nelly, Erykah Badu, Kid Cudi, and Akon. We also extended hip-hop's global reach by distributing Cash Money Records' roster — elevating Baby, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Drake. I am blessed to have worked with some of the most brilliant and influential artists in the history of recorded music. Right now, when music's DNA is being reimagined, when artists face existential challenges, and when all of us are building the future in real time, there is little that is more profound. Looking back on my Epic era fills me with great pride. To my team of creative champions, you now hold the reins, and I know your best work lies ahead. I'm grateful for Zeke Lewis, Rick Sackheim, Sandra Aflorei, Tyler Pittman, John Shoup, Dave Bell, Lisa Kasha, Shannon Mingal, Margeaux Watson, Justin Duran, Chelsea Donnarumma, Brooke Marcimo, Mez Tara, Gina Harrell, Melissa Victor, Traci Adams, Scott Dimig, Dontay Thompson, Jennifer Goicoechea, Patrick Afeku, John Kirkpatrick, Michael Petullo, Max Sholl, Hector Rosario and the countless other executives who made Epic Records home. I thank my daughter Quinn for her unconditional love and my late parents Marie and Bob Rhone for their heroic support. And I am forever grateful for my prior teammates from over the years. I have worked in our industry since vinyl ruled, and women were rarely if ever in line for C-level or even vice-presidential roles. The many individual honors I've received — from Billboard, Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women, Essence, Variety, Ms. Magazine's Woman of the Year, and the recent honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music — serve as grace notes on my years of dedication. But they pale beside what we've all built together. They pale beside the glory of our musical culture.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Time is a thief, and Jelly Roll and wife, Bunnie XO are feeling a little pick-pocketed right now after watching Jelly's daughter Bailee Ann head off to her very last high school homecoming dance. The first-ever artist-in-residence on “American Idol” has been open about how hard he's worked to develop a bond with his daughter since getting out of jail. In the caption, she wrote, “Don't mind me.. crying in the car 😭 (also don't mind my beauty bar- I've been traveling & need to organize it) 😭” Proud dad Jelly Roll was right there with her, commenting, “BRB- crying – and dealing with early Empty Nest syndrome. This is [her] last one of high school. Bunnie XO continues, “Please tell me how to deal with this. I remember getting [Bailee] ready for her daddy/daughter dance in sixth or seventh grade. Now it's Senior Homecoming, and then she's gonna leave? Then she's gonna be leaving for fricking college, and it's like, bro. I did not think it was gonna hit this hard.” She adds gold strappy high heels and jewelry. While Jelly Roll's career continues to skyrocket, the singer says fatherhood is his biggest blessing. On Father's Day, Jelly put up a post on his Instagram account explaining how he feels about his role in his children's lives, writing, “The greatest gift god has ever given me was becoming a father. All these songs I hear people write about their children are really lovey-dovey, and sometimes I felt like I was the only parent in the world who was petrified of passing my generational curses onto my kids. And I didn't think anyone had written a song about that, so to all the fathers out there who have worried that your trauma would affect your child I dedicate this to you today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are some impressive set pieces in The Mandalorian And Grogu teaser (like Mando jetting out from inside an AT-AT walker before it falls slowly and magnificently off a cliff), but let's be real. The appeal here is Grogu toddling around, being absolutely adorable. (In a nod to the Internet's christening of the character, Babu Frik at one point tells Grogu, “Good shot, baby!”) He's so sweet and fun, it almost makes us believe that the Star Wars theatrical experience could be saved on the power of cute puppets alone. This movie also scored a major star in Sigourney Weaver, but even she knows who The Mandalorian And Grogu‘s true scene-stealer is. Like Werner Herzog before her, Weaver couldn't get enough of the little guy, telling Extra that acting opposite the puppet was “terribly exciting.” “He really is the most exquisite combination of different things to just make you fall in love—his voice, his ears, his eyes, his little suit. Jon [Favreau] did a brilliant thing,” she gushed. “As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu.” A true-crime phenomenon sits for an interrogation in the riveting Predators By Brent Simon September 19, 2025 | 6:00am Rick Flag Sr. finally gets his mitts on Chris in a frustrating Peacemaker By Jarrod Jones September 18, 2025 | 10:00pm Him fumbles its football horror story By Natalia Keogan September 18, 2025 | 1:00am</p>

Howard Stern Says He Has Canceled Disney+ In Protest of Jimmy Kimmel Suspension 'Last Week Tonight' Host John Oliver Passionately Defends Jimmy Kimmel and Free Speech in Wake of Late-Night Suspension Kimmel was suspended following a comment in his monologue about MAGA's reaction to the murder of Charlie Kirk that went viral and FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action” against the talk show host. Carr's threat was followed by affiliate owners Nexstar and Sinclair says they would preempt the show, which spurred ABC to suspend Kimmel “indefinitely.” “We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech. Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country. Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power — because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.

The Variety profile (published in early September) noted that Tatum walked “with a pronounced limp” and was facing “intensive physical therapy.” He explained to the outlet that he'd taken the day off his pain medication “so I wouldn't be falling asleep on you and drooling. My body doesn't do well with codeine—and those painkillers the U.K. docs gave me were strong.” That movie and Brand New Day overlapped for some of the filming in London. Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton is taking the helm for the fourth Spider-Man movie, and Holland expressed his excitement for getting back to some “old-school filmmaking” on location.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few television roles have defined an actor quite like Charlie Hunnam's portrayal of Jax Teller in “Sons of Anarchy.” For seven seasons, the British actor led Kurt Sutter's gritty FX biker drama, transforming from a little-known performer into the face of one of the most popular shows on cable television. When the series ended in 2014, Hunnam admitted that saying goodbye to Jax wasn't easy. Because I'd been living with him for eight years, you know, trying to bring him to life,” Hunnam told Cinema Blend in 2017 while promoting “King Arthur.” He described the process as a form of grief. So they'd let me onto the set, and I'd just walk around at night because I wanted to be in that environment and go through a personal process of saying goodbye.” “I think I went into ‘Sons of Anarchy' being a pretty unaccomplished actor in terms of my skill set,” he admitted. “I wasn't one of these people that were born enormously and innately talented. He compared his seven years on set to a college education. “I cultivated a lot of my skill set by going to work and shooting 10 pages a day for seven years. But as much as the series gave to him, Hunnam consistently said there was one thing he would never do—return to Jax. “I would never, ever put that cut back on,” he said. He wouldn't even wear the character's rings for Halloween. “I lived with that character inside me for years, in a very real way. That meant no cameo on the FX spinoff “Mayans MC,” either. “I had become that character, had become so deeply integrated into who I was, I literally didn't realize until the day we wrapped and we put him to rest … I went through a period of two or three weeks of, like, real bereavement.” Now, though, Hunnam seems to be softening his stance. In 2023, during an interview with Access Hollywood, he hinted that he was considering a return to the role that defined his career. “Since you asked, I have an idea that I'm exploring in its infancy where [Jax's return] could be a possibility,” Hunnam said. Charlie Hunnam will next appear in “Monster: The Ed Gein Story,” premiering October 3, 2025, on Netflix.</p>

The “Star Wars” alien who launched a million gifs, Grogu, a.ka. “Baby Yoda,” is back in the first teaser for Jon Favreau‘s “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” hitting theaters May 22, 2026. This'll be a big moment for Lucasfilm, as it'll be the first “Star Wars” theatrical release in six and a half years… and a big test for the staying power of its Disney+ streaming series. A kind of “Star Wars” version of “Lone Wolf and Cub,” with the title character warrior (Pedro Pascal) taking in an infant from the same species as Yoda and eventually adopting him as his own, “The Mandalorian” was launch content for Disney+ in 2019 and created by this movie's helmer, Jon Favreau. It's been a pioneering series in many respects, especially for its breakthrough use of an LED Volume for creating realistic backgrounds on-set while actors are shooting as opposed to compositing in visual effects later. The tech has been adopted by many other series, including the whole suite of “Star Trek” shows on Paramount+.
