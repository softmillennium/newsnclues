Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson‘s knack for casting is one of his (many) strong suits as a creator. From recognizing the dramatic brilliance of someone like Adam Sandler, consistently finding new dimensions of repeat stars like Julianne Moore and John C. Reilly, and discovering brand-new stars like Alana Haim, PTA has one hell of an eye for star power (and all credit to his long-running partnership with casting director Cassandra Kulukundis, who has cast nine of 10 ten films). For his latest, “One Battle After Another,” PTA again assembles an enviable cast: Oscar winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro, and continuing collaborator Sean Penn, plus Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall making their PTA debut, and breakout star Chase Infiniti. Related Stories Scarlett Johansson Broke Box Office Records and Made Her Feature Directing Debut in the Same Year — Here's How Finding the Horror in Sports: Justin Tipping on ‘Him' As IndieWire's own David Ehrlich noted in his glowing review of the film, Infiniti is “magnetically self-possessed” and an “instant movie star.” (Having seen the film yesterday: when he's right, he's right.) After a special screening of the film in VistaVision held in New York City on Sunday afternoon, DiCaprio, Taylor, Infiniti, del Toro, Hall, and Penn stuck around to chat about the feature in a wide-ranging Q&A. DiCaprio shares plenty of screen time with the young star and was eager to talk about her performance, both on and off the screen. “It was beautiful to watch Chase come into an ecosystem like this, because I remember my first feature-length film and trusting so much in the director, the director is literally everything to you, and that bond started immediately with the two of them,” DiCaprio said. DiCaprio's first role was — and this is true! — in the direct-to-video sequel “Critters 3,” but he quickly followed that up with roles in two still-signature films for him: “This Boy's Life” (directed by Michael Caton-Jones) and “What's Eating Gilbert Grape” (directed by Lasse Hallström). They had this sort of unspoken relationship that was beautiful to witness. It reminded me of when I was younger and my first film.” Asked about her experience, Infiniti was quick to note the support she received from everyone, which engendered a level of trust that seems common on a PTA set. Warner Bros. will release “One Battle After Another” in theaters on Friday, September 26. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trailblazing executive, who is leaving her post as chair/CEO of Epic after 11 years at the company, penned a heartfelt goodbye to her record label "family." Her trailblazing career has seen her become the first Black executive and first woman to chair a major record company, having been appointed to oversee Elektra Entertainment Group in 1994. In 2023, she was named Billboard's Women in Music executive of the year, where she was feted as “a force, an alchemist, a savant of creative artistry and an inspiration to all women for the glass ceilings you have conquered.” Read both of Rhone's notes in full below. As I step away from this role that has defined so much of my journey, I am filled with pride in the extraordinary tapestry we've created together. From Future to Travis Scott to 21 Savage, Meghan Trainor, Tyla, Madison Beer, Giveon, Zara Larsson, Mariah the Scientist, Absolutely, ScarLip, BIA, UMI, Real Boston Richie, Eddie Benjamin, the late, great Ozzy Osbourne and more. Together, we've scored the soundtrack to countless lives. Thank you for trusting me with your brilliance. Thank you for making every day feel like the first-time music was invented. It's been an extraordinary journey: eleven years since my promotion to President of Epic Records and six years since my appointment as Chairwoman and CEO. This role at Epic represents the third time in my career that I've been the first woman and first Black person to serve as CEO of a major record label owned by a Fortune 500 company. I've always been surrounded by excellent teams, but our current one at Epic is extraordinary. Spanning multiple generations, our team understands music's history, finds meaning in complex data, and anticipates emerging trends. While helping artists maintain authentic fan connections, our team guides them through partnerships in video, fashion, gaming, and content innovation. This moment of my transition invites reflection on a journey that has been wide-ranging in its scope and impact. Following my graduation from The Wharton School, I started as a secretary at Buddha Records and after working my way up through radio promotions, I was privileged to be appointed SVP of Black Music at Atlantic Records. Those times feel like yesterday, working with Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, En Vogue, LeVert, Brandy, Adina Howard, Troop, DAS EFX, Snow, MC Lyte, Kwamé, Miki Howard, Gerald Albright, The System and Ice Cube's Lynch Mob and Yo-Yo. Through our Ruthless Records deal, we also released The D.O.C., JJ Fad, Michel'le, and Easy-E. In July 1994, I was appointed Chairwoman of Elektra Records, where we orchestrated a cultural renaissance that still resonates today. From Pantera's intensity to Phish's improvisational spirit, from Tracy Chapman's truths and Anita Baker's soul to Tamia's powerful vocals — each artist flourished on their own frequency. Third Eye Blind, Yolanda Adams, Silk, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Gerald LeVert, Keith Sweat, Natalie Merchant, The Cure, Björk, Staind, Better Than Ezra, The Afghan Whigs, and Jason Mraz all found their home in our musical family, creating moments that transcended mere entertainment. Then came my chapter at Motown, where the label's iconic history and its future converged under my leadership as Chairwoman and CEO. It was an honor to record Stevie Wonder's last full-length studio album while simultaneously collaborating with artists like Nelly, Erykah Badu, Kid Cudi, and Akon. We also extended hip-hop's global reach by distributing Cash Money Records' roster — elevating Baby, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Drake. I am blessed to have worked with some of the most brilliant and influential artists in the history of recorded music. Right now, when music's DNA is being reimagined, when artists face existential challenges, and when all of us are building the future in real time, there is little that is more profound. Looking back on my Epic era fills me with great pride. To my team of creative champions, you now hold the reins, and I know your best work lies ahead. I'm grateful for Zeke Lewis, Rick Sackheim, Sandra Aflorei, Tyler Pittman, John Shoup, Dave Bell, Lisa Kasha, Shannon Mingal, Margeaux Watson, Justin Duran, Chelsea Donnarumma, Brooke Marcimo, Mez Tara, Gina Harrell, Melissa Victor, Traci Adams, Scott Dimig, Dontay Thompson, Jennifer Goicoechea, Patrick Afeku, John Kirkpatrick, Michael Petullo, Max Sholl, Hector Rosario and the countless other executives who made Epic Records home. I thank my daughter Quinn for her unconditional love and my late parents Marie and Bob Rhone for their heroic support. And I am forever grateful for my prior teammates from over the years. I have worked in our industry since vinyl ruled, and women were rarely if ever in line for C-level or even vice-presidential roles. The many individual honors I've received — from Billboard, Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women, Essence, Variety, Ms. Magazine's Woman of the Year, and the recent honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music — serve as grace notes on my years of dedication. But they pale beside what we've all built together. They pale beside the glory of our musical culture.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York, said he's pulling out of a planned WABC-TV town hall this week due to its parent company's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live following a Trump administration threat. Mamdani's campaign confirmed he would not participate in a town hall that was to be aired on WABC-TV on Thursday. “I am withdrawing not as an indictment of the local affiliate or the hard-working journalists there, but rather in response to the corporate leaders who have put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press,” Mamdani said at a press conference at New York's Four Freedoms Park on Monday. It is not the government's job to tell us what we can and cannot talk about,” he said. ABC pulled Kimmel on Wednesday, hours after FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened the network and its stations over comments that the late-night host made earlier in the week. The network's decision has triggered a backlash and a renewed focus on free speech rights, as well as corporate capitulation in the face of Trump administration threats. Before ABC announced that it was pulling the show, Nexstar said that it was taking Kimmel's show off its ABC affiliates. Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for a merger with Tegna, something that won't be possible unless the agency repeals or revises a media ownership rule that limit the number of stations any one company can hold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Selena Gomez, Olivia Rodrigo and hundreds of other artists are speaking up after Jimmy Kimmel Live! In an ACLU letter signed by more than 400 entertainers, some of the most famous names in pop culture rallied together to show support for Jimmy Kimmel following the suspension of his late-night program on ABC. “Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation,” it continues. “In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives and entertainers across the board.” Ben Platt, Cyndi Lauper, Debbie Gibson, Joe Keery, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Rufus Wainwright, Sheryl Crow and Tom Morello were also among the musicians who signed the letter, which ended with a call to action to “fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights,” regardless of political affiliation. Actors such as Meryl Streep, Joaquin Phoenix, Florence Pugh, Adam Scott, Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Lena Dunham, Mark Ruffalo and Natalie Portman also added their names. The letter comes less than a week after ABC announced that it was indefinitely suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! (The Walt Disney Co. owns ABC, Hulu and ESPN, among other media properties.) “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel had said on the program. Rodrigo — who appeared on Kimmel in 2021 and 2023 and teamed up with the program to surprise trick-or-treaters last year — shared her own personal statement denouncing the suspension on Instagram Stories shortly afterward. “So upset over this blatant censorship and abuse of power,” the pop star wrote Sept. 20.

In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. The letter does not name Donald Trump or his FCC chair, Brendan Carr, but they are cited in a website introduction. The letter notes, “We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.” “Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country,” the letter states. “We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.” Others signing the letter include Robert DeNiro, Selena Gomez, Kerry Washington, Jason Bateman, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ariana DeBose, Jane Fonda, Jim Parsons, Joaquin Phoenix, Frances McDormand, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Regina King, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jean Smart, Noah Wyle, Diego Luna, Natalie Portman, Olivia Rodrigo, Martin Short and Ramy Youssef.

On his show last Monday, Kimmel said during his monologue, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Kimmel was going to get canned anyway, they just did it earlier than expected. Where was this furor when Bidens admin treated Facebook lol Do you REALLY not know the difference between conduct violations and squashing 1st amendment rights? But if this is ‘the moment', then go back apply to the people who were canned but you stayed silent on. Agreed what the FCC and Trump are trying to do is embarrassing.

Howard Stern Says He Has Canceled Disney+ In Protest of Jimmy Kimmel Suspension 'Last Week Tonight' Host John Oliver Passionately Defends Jimmy Kimmel and Free Speech in Wake of Late-Night Suspension Kimmel was suspended following a comment in his monologue about MAGA's reaction to the murder of Charlie Kirk that went viral and FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action” against the talk show host.

The film about the historic Nineties festival is being distributed by ABC New Studio, whose parent company Disney continues to deal with the fallout over its decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel for his comments on Charlie Kirk's death. Puck‘s Matt Belloni also reported that Olivia Rodrigo, who appears in the documentary as well, was meant to be a surprise guest. She continued: “If Lilith taught me anything, it taught me there is a great strength in coming together to lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. So I really hope this documentary inspires everyone to continue to try and create positive change in your communities, to keep lifting each other up, keep championing the causes you believe in with kindness and empathy because ultimately, we're all in this together.” Tom Holland Suffers Injury on ‘Spider-Man: Brand New Day' Set, Pauses Filming Charlie Kirk Memorial Showcases the Union of Trump, Republicans, and Conservative Christianity “I know you're expecting a performance tonight, and I'm so grateful to all of you for coming, and I apologize if this is disappointing, but we have collectively decided not to perform but instead to stand in solidarity in support of free speech,” McLachlan said. “I know you're expecting a performance tonight, and I'm so grateful to all of you for coming, and I apologize if this is disappointing, but we have collectively decided not to perform but instead to stand in solidarity in support of free speech,” Sarah McLachlan said breaking… pic.twitter.com/CteaSYysnl McLachlan joins many artists who have stood in solidarity with Kimmel, show was taken off air after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they wouldn't air his show in the wake of his comments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stern, who was off last week, addressed the still-simmering controversy when he returned to his SiriusXM show Monday, Sept. 22, saying, “When the government says, ‘I'm not pleased with you, so we're going to orchestrate a way to silence you,' it's the wrong direction for our country. It Isn't good” (via Billboard and USA Today). Jimmy Kimmel Live is still off the air after being pulled “indefinitely” last Wednesday following an uproar from conservatives over a joke Kimmel made about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk. Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, had called on licensed broadcasters to stop airing the show, and not long after, Nexstar and Sinclair — which own myriad ABC affiliates around the country — announced that they would preempt his program. ABC made its decision to pull the show soon after. “I don't care whether you like Jimmy or not. If ABC wanted to fire Jimmy because they didn't like him, or he had low ratings — they didn't want to fire him. Stern said the situation was especially “painful” because he's a longtime friend of Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney. “They're two of the funniest people I have ever met.” At that time, the agency went after Stern over material they deemed indecent, as opposed to anything overtly political, though there are some echoes with the current situation. For instance, the FCC not only fined Stern's former parent company, Infinity Broadcasting, millions over the content of his shows, but threatened to revoke its broadcasting license, and even held up its acquisition of three radio stations. Nexstar, the first company to say it would preempt Kimmel, is currently seeking to pull off a $6.2 billion merger with Tegna, which will require the FCC's approval. Tom Holland Suffers Injury on ‘Spider-Man: Brand New Day' Set, Pauses Filming Charlie Kirk Memorial Showcases the Union of Trump, Republicans, and Conservative Christianity “The basis of this country is the government doesn't tell you what to say,” he said, adding: “Someone's got to stand up and be fucking saying, ‘Hey, enough, we're not gonna bow. In an op-ed for Rolling Stone, comedian Billy Eichner wrote, “Jimmy Kimmel‘s suspension under these circumstances is a fundamental attack on each individual American, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of whether or not you even vote. That might sound hyperbolic to some people, but I don't think it is.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few television roles have defined an actor quite like Charlie Hunnam's portrayal of Jax Teller in “Sons of Anarchy.” For seven seasons, the British actor led Kurt Sutter's gritty FX biker drama, transforming from a little-known performer into the face of one of the most popular shows on cable television. When the series ended in 2014, Hunnam admitted that saying goodbye to Jax wasn't easy. Because I'd been living with him for eight years, you know, trying to bring him to life,” Hunnam told Cinema Blend in 2017 while promoting “King Arthur.” He described the process as a form of grief. So they'd let me onto the set, and I'd just walk around at night because I wanted to be in that environment and go through a personal process of saying goodbye.” “I think I went into ‘Sons of Anarchy' being a pretty unaccomplished actor in terms of my skill set,” he admitted. “I wasn't one of these people that were born enormously and innately talented. He compared his seven years on set to a college education. “I cultivated a lot of my skill set by going to work and shooting 10 pages a day for seven years. But as much as the series gave to him, Hunnam consistently said there was one thing he would never do—return to Jax. “I would never, ever put that cut back on,” he said. He wouldn't even wear the character's rings for Halloween. “It was a very deep experience,” Hunnam explained. “I lived with that character inside me for years, in a very real way. That meant no cameo on the FX spinoff “Mayans MC,” either. Now, though, Hunnam seems to be softening his stance. In 2023, during an interview with Access Hollywood, he hinted that he was considering a return to the role that defined his career. “Since you asked, I have an idea that I'm exploring in its infancy where [Jax's return] could be a possibility,” Hunnam said. Charlie Hunnam will next appear in “Monster: The Ed Gein Story,” premiering October 3, 2025, on Netflix.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel's sister has shown her gratitude to actor Mark Ruffalo for standing up for her brother following ABC‘s suspension of ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!‘ after the host's controversial remarks about Charlie Kirk's passing. Jill Kimmel, 54, a producer and actress known for her work on ‘TMI Hollywood' and ‘Sunday Night Circus,' responded to a post Ruffalo made on social media in which he suggested the show should not be cancelled. Taking to his threads profile, where Ruffalo has 3.7 million followers, the star of ‘I Know This Much Is True' responded to a post about Disney's stock dropping 7% since ABC — the flagship property of the Disney Entertainment division of The Walt Disney Company — suspended ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Ruffalo wrote, “It's going to go down a lot further if they cancel his show. Disney does not want to be the ones that broke America.” Kimmel's sister wasn't the only one to thank Ruffalo. Someone else showed their appreciation by replying, “Mark, it's well known that you get pretty large checks from Disney. With Marvel Studios being owned by The Walt Disney Company, it's a bold move by the actor to speak out against them. — nor is he the only Marvel Cinematic Universe star to do so. Fellow MCU Hulk Tatiana Maslany — who, of course, plays She-Hulk in the hugely popular franchise — took to her Instagram account to post a story in which she wrote, “Cancel your @disneyplus @hulu @espn subscriptions!” Moreover, in addition to those thanking him for standing up for Kimmel, several of the users who responded to Ruffalo's Threads post made their thoughts on Disney very clear. Another user wrote, “Cancelling now as I text this lol. Time to invest in a DVD player again.” However, the company may be forced to think twice about a permanent cancellation of the show if the fan backlash is anything to go by — especially if more stars of Mark Ruffalo's stature speak out against it.

The “Star Wars” alien who launched a million gifs, Grogu, a.ka. “Baby Yoda,” is back in the first teaser for Jon Favreau‘s “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” hitting theaters May 22, 2026. This'll be a big moment for Lucasfilm, as it'll be the first “Star Wars” theatrical release in six and a half years… and a big test for the staying power of its Disney+ streaming series. A kind of “Star Wars” version of “Lone Wolf and Cub,” with the title character warrior (Pedro Pascal) taking in an infant from the same species as Yoda and eventually adopting him as his own, “The Mandalorian” was launch content for Disney+ in 2019 and created by this movie's helmer, Jon Favreau. It's been a pioneering series in many respects, especially for its breakthrough use of an LED Volume for creating realistic backgrounds on-set while actors are shooting as opposed to compositing in visual effects later. The tech has been adopted by many other series, including the whole suite of “Star Trek” shows on Paramount+.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stern opened Monday's show by breaking his recent vow to not talk about politics after vehemently speaking his mind during the most recent presidential election, saying, “I can no longer keep my mouth shut.” “I feel obligated to say something, because s–t's getting outta control,” said Stern, who has famously been a free speech advocate for more than half a century amid his own battles with censorship and government entities threatening to curtail his right to speak freely on the airwaves. Stern, who said he considers Kimmel one of his closest showbiz friends and who frequently has the comedian on his SiriusXM show, said on a personal level the network's decision was painful to him because he loves Kimmel and wife Molly McNearney, whom he called “dear dear friends.” They're two of the funniest people I have ever met,” Stern said, noting he's so enamored with the couple's comedic chops that he “shuts down” around them so as not to try to compete with their quick wit. Noting that many people have written to him asking “what should we do?,” Stern said he is doing something. “I feel all of this is a smokescreen to stop talking about what's really going on. We got a problem with inflation, gas prices, groceries, there's all kinds of problems,” said Stern, who said he's spoken to Kimmel but did not ask if the suspension — which was applauded by President Trump, who also encouraged NBC to do the same to Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers — is permanent or if the veteran late nighter fears he might get fired. Stern was able to survive that battle, but he said now ABC, as well as many universities, broadcasters and social media company owners, were being put in the same position, and, he said, “they all bent the knee and they all cower.” While he said he feels for ABC and their tough position, “someone's got to step up and be f–kin' saying, ‘hey, enough, we're not gonna bow. “It's a scary time when the government starts threatening you, which is not right,” Stern said. “And I don't think ABC should have to be in this position. But I know most broadcasters would agree with me. I don't care what they broadcast, whether they're these right-wing types, or left-wing types, whatever type you are we can't have the government in this country dictating [speech].” Stern had been off the air since the Kimmel suspension was announced last week, but in his first chance to weigh in, he said it was chilling to read that ABC's action came after FCC chairman Brendan Carr made what sounded like a threat to the network during an appearance on a right-wind podcast last week. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.” The latter was widely interpreted as a threat by Carr to launch investigations and regulatory action against licensed broadcasters who air Kimmel's show; shortly after, the owners of dozens of local ABC affiliate stations said they would be be pre-empting Kimmel. While many democrats and free speech advocates interpreted Carr's comments as an attempt to chill free speech, even such stalwart Trump supporters as Republican Sen. Ted Cruz — who leads the FCC oversight committee — characterized Carr's statement as a dangerous slippery slope. Another staunch conservative, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, called Carr's comments “absolutely inappropriate. The FCC does not have legal authority to censor what Kimmel says on his show and many critics have said that Carr's comment amount to an illegal action called “jawboning,” which is the improper use of threatened government action to influence a private entity. Whether or not you like Kimmel, Stern said, “it's about freedom of speech. It's one thing if ABC wanted to fire Jimmy because they didn't like him, or he had low ratings… They didn't want to fire him. Well aware that the Kimmel headline will be quickly pushed off the top of news feeds by the next outrage, Stern encouraged fellow defenders of free speech to bond together and accept that “each of us are obligated to be the watchdog for each other's rights and freedoms… we can't turn our heads, we can't pretend this didn't happen.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“My first major arena tour, I was invited to no longer be a part of,” Church told Jimmy Fallon of the Rascal Flatts trek, although he didn't mention the artist by name. But when I was no longer invited to be a part of it, it was at Madison Square Garden here. The following day Church got a call from Swift. Swift told Church she hoped there was no bad blood between them and that she loved what he did. “I said, ‘This is going to really be great for you and you owe me your first gold record when this happens.' Here's what's crazy: It took, like, seven days.” He recalled being at a music festival “not even 30 days later” when Swift walked on to his tour bus with the gold record for her debut LP. “She walks up and she inscribed it, ‘To Eric, thanks for playing too long and too loud on the tour. “They don't let me have it,” Church quipped. Earlier this year, Church revealed he was once roped into a Taylor Swift copyright lawsuit after the superstar mentioned his song during a deposition. Back in 2017, Swift was sued by the songwriters behind 3LW's “Playas Gon' Play” for using the lyrics “players gonna play, haters gonna hate” in her hit “Shake It Off.” The lawsuit sparked a years-long legal battle that was ultimately voluntarily dismissed in late 2022. But during her deposition months earlier, Swift claimed she first knew of the lyric from Church's song “The Outsiders.” Tom Holland Suffers Injury on ‘Spider-Man: Brand New Day' Set, Pauses Filming Travis Kelce Hit With Hefty Fine for ‘Obscene Gesture' During NFL Game “In her deposition, when [talking about the line] ‘players gonna play, haters gonna hate,' she says, ‘The first time I heard that phrase was in Eric Church's song ‘The Outsiders,'” Church told Rolling Stone. “She was saying she never heard it on the [original song], which is what they were suing her for. And two weeks later, I got served by the people that were suing her!” But I was like, ‘How did this even happen? Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hugh Jackman gave fans an unforgettable and wholesome night on September 20 at Radio City Music Hall when he brought out Pink and her 14-year-old daughter, Willow Sage Hart. Jackman had teased the appearance weeks earlier in a playful Instagram video. Together, the trio delivered a show-stopping performance of “A Million Dreams” from The Greatest Showman and Pink's beloved hit “Who Knew.” Dressed in a striking red ballgown, Willow confidently took center stage, leading the chorus of her mom's 2006 track from I'm Not Dead and earning cheers from the crowd. Pink later shared clips of the special moment on Instagram, where celebrity vocal coach Eric Vetro praised the teen's talent. Willow, you really have your mom's magical and powerful vocal cord genes!” he wrote, applauding her budding star power. Before the show, Pink shared a behind-the-scenes video of herself and Willow driving to Radio City. “Hi everybody, we're on our way to Radio City to sing with Hugh Jackman,” Pink said as she asked her daughter if she was nervous. Jackman noted that it was the first time both Pink and Willow had performed at Radio City Music Hall. The moment added even more excitement to Jackman's From New York, With Love concert series, which began in January and will wrap up with three final shows on October 3 and October 4.
