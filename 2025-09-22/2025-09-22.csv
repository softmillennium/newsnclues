            The White House has answered what had been one of the major outstanding questions regarding its pending deal to transfer TikTok's US operations to a majority American ownership group: Under the agreement, the app's algorithm will be operated in the United States and overseen by Oracle.
    


            The detail was confirmed by a senior White House official in a call with reporters on Monday. If completed, the deal will transfer control of TikTok's US operations, along with a copy of the algorithm, to a new joint venture based in the United States. That ownership group will have majority American investors and run by a majority American board of directors, the official said.
    


            Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake will be among those investors, along with US and global firms who are already invested in TikTok parent company ByteDance and a number of new investors. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that tech and media leaders Michael Dell and Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch may also be part of the new ownership group. A source familiar with the matter clarified to CNN that Fox Corp. would be one of the investors, not the Murdochs individually.
    


            ByteDance will retain a less than 20% stake in TikTok US following the deal. The full investor group has not yet been finalized, the official said.
    


            The new information comes as the White House pushes ahead to finalize the TikTok sale, after Trump said he made progress toward the deal in a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday. The deal is still awaiting some formal regulatory approvals from China, the White House official said Monday, although US leaders have expressed confidence that the agreement will be completed.
    


            “We are 100% confident that a deal is done,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Saturday, adding that it would likely be signed “in the coming days.”
    


            Trump is set to sign an executive order later this week stating that the deal constitutes a qualified divestiture as required by the ban-or-sale law that passed last year, the official said. He will also extend the pause on enforcing the law by another 120 days so that paperwork and regulatory approvals for the deal can be completed. At the same time, the official said, ByteDance is expected to sign an agreement laying out the framework of the deal with one or more of the new investors.
    


            Trump last week extended the ban until December 16, meaning the deal is likely to be formally completed early next year. That would conclude the yearslong effort to place TikTok under American control, over US officials' concern that its China-based parent company posed a national security risk.
    


            The fate of the algorithm had remained a major question, because the content recommendation engine plays a big role in the app's popularity but is also behind the national security concerns. US officials worried that ByteDance could be forced to manipulate the algorithm on behalf of the Chinese government to influence or generate dissent among Americans. The TikTok ban-or-sale law prohibits “any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm” between ByteDance and a new potential American ownership group.
    


            Under the deal, the new ownership group will receive a copy of the algorithm code from ByteDance, review it and retrain it on US user data. Oracle will continuously monitor how it's pushing content to users, according to the senior White House official.
    


            The new ownership group will control the algorithm only for US users — again raising the question about whether American users will have to download a new, separate app after the deal is complete.
    


            The deal will expand Oracle's involvement with TikTok, building on an existing partnership with ByteDance to store TikTok's US user data domestically as part of an earlier effort to address national security concerns. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison is also close with Trump.
    


            In a surprise move on Monday, Oracle announced that its CEO Safra Catz will step down from her role, to be replaced by co-CEOs Clay Magouyrk, previously president of Oracle's cloud infrastructure unit, and Mike Silica, previously president of Oracle Industries. Catz will become vice chair of Oracle's board of directors. It's not clear if the transition is related to the TikTok deal; however, the move could free up Catz, also a Trump ally, to take on a leadership role in the new joint venture.
    


            The White House has not yet finalized whether it will take a fee for negotiating the TikTok deal, which is expected to be worth billions of dollars, according to the official. However, the White House will not have a “golden share” or other equity stake in the new company.

            English singer and songwriter Harry Styles ran the Berlin Marathon in under three hours on Sunday.
    


            Organizers confirmed to The Associated Press that Styles took part. Local newspaper Der Tagesspiegel was the first to report his participation.
    


            The 31-year-old former member of the One Direction boy band was among some 55,000 runners taking part in the race on what is widely regarded as the fastest marathon track in the world.
    


            Styles – using the pseudonym Sted Sarandos and wearing a headband and sunglasses – completed the route in 2 hours, 59 minutes, 13 seconds. A sub-3 hour marathon is a coveted mark for many marathon runners.
    


            Der Tagesspiegel reported that Styles was already spotted running in Berlin in preparation for Sunday's race.
    


            Styles was in a photo at the finish with Richard Whitehead, a two-time gold medal winner over 200 meters at the Paralympic Games. Whitehead, who is on a quest to run 20 marathons this year, posted the photo on Instagram.
    


            Styles' debut album, “Harry Styles,” topped the album charts in the U.S., Britain and several other countries, while the second, “Fine Line,” appeared in 2019 and included the Grammy-winning “Watermelon Sugar.”

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's approval rating has fallen to a historic low, according to a new poll released on Sunday.

An INSA survey commissioned by the Bild newspaper found that 62% of respondents said they were unhappy with Merz's performance, a three-point increase in a month, while 63% expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition of the center-right CDU and the Social Democrats. Only 26% of respondents approved of Merz's performance, and just 23% backed his government.

A separate study by the insurance company R+V Versicherung, published last week, found that Germans are most concerned about the rising cost of living, the immigration and refugee crisis, as well as high taxes and potential welfare cuts, which Merz has insisted are necessary.

Merz, who took office in May, has also pledged to revive the stagnant economy, strengthen the military, help secure continued US support for Ukraine as well as significantly cut the German welfare state. 

The right-wing, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has strongly criticized the government's decision to allocate taxpayer money to Ukraine instead of addressing domestic needs. The AfD is currently the second-largest force in the Bundestag and is leading in national polls.

By Timofey Bordachev, Program Director of the Valdai Club

The demonstrations in London earlier this month – up to 150,000 people protesting immigration and government incompetence – drew attention in Russia and abroad. Some observers even wondered if Britain might finally be approaching a breaking point. Perhaps, like Nepal or France in past years, mass anger could reshape politics.



But such hopes are misplaced. Britain will never experience revolutionary upheaval. Its culture is not one of defiance but of endurance. The United Kingdom has, over centuries, become a bastion of injustice disguised as stability, where ordinary people are conditioned to accept their powerlessness. This cultural inheritance, once an imperial advantage, now guarantees slow decline.

Britain is unique in Western Europe: it was created not through union or invitation, but through conquest. In 1066 Norman knights crushed the native English and divided the land into fiefdoms. Unlike Russia, where foreign warriors were invited to defend the realm, or Hungary, where nomads fused with locals to form a people, England's story was one of subjugation.

That pattern hardened in 1215, when barons forced King John to sign the Magna Carta. Propaganda later elevated the charter as the foundation of English liberty. In reality it entrenched oligarchy: the power of the wealthy over crown and people alike. Where monarchs elsewhere often stood with peasants against feudal tyranny, in England the crown itself was shackled by landowners. Injustice became not an aberration but the system's operating principle.

Geography reinforced the pattern. For centuries there was no frontier of freedom. Only in 1620 did dissenters finally flee on the Mayflower, planting English settlements in North America. By then, 600 years of endurance had shaped a national character: patient, fatalistic, and resigned.

In Russia, by contrast, peasants had begun migrating east as early as the 11th century. Freedom was found in movement: new villages, new lands, and eventually a new people. This restless expansion created Russia's unique statehood and ethnic identity. The English, trapped on their island, cultivated instead a tradition of enduring injustice.

By the 18th century, Britain was sending its sons to wars around the world. They returned crippled, if at all – as Rudyard Kipling later immortalized. Yet they went meekly. A society drilled in obedience did not question orders, however insane. That made Britain dangerous abroad, but docile at home.

Popular uprisings were crushed without hesitation. Laws such as the Settlement Act of 1662, tying workers to their parishes, or the Poor Law of 1834, abolishing basic relief, stripped away rights. Only after 1945, under pressure from the USSR's example, did Britain adopt limited welfare protections. Even these are now eroding, with no real resistance.

English political thought gave this tradition a theory. Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan argued that justice is irrelevant – the strong impose order, and citizens must submit. This was the philosophical foundation of the English state: not a monarch above all, but oligarchs enthroned above monarch and people alike. Rousseau, in continental Europe, offered the opposite vision – government as the executor of the people's will.

In Russia, even the poorest peasant was equal before the tsar in principle, if not always in practice. In Britain, the wealthy were not equal before the state; they were the state. That remains the essence of British governance today.

These centuries shaped habits that persist. A German journalist once remarked that Britain is the only country where the elite can get away with anything. Brexit proved the point: through manipulation and distortion, the ruling class reversed the nation's strategic course and bound it permanently to the United States.

London retains its role as a financial hub, but capital flight is steady. Wealthy Britons leave even as the government insists on its “global” status. The common people, meanwhile, trudge on. They are heirs to a culture that equates submission with virtue. Protests may fill the streets, but the outcome is always the same: patient resignation, followed by business as usual.

This tradition once gave Britain its edge. Armies could be raised, colonies conquered, wars fought with little domestic dissent. But in the modern world, where political vitality depends on public will, the same habit of resignation has become a liability.

Unlike Russians, who carved out freedom by settling new lands, or French and Germans, who rebelled and migrated, the English learned to endure. Their legacy is a society where injustice is not challenged but accepted – and where any hope of transformation evaporates before it begins.

Britain's rulers remain reckless, and therefore dangerous abroad. They still pour resources into supporting Kiev while neglecting their own population. But the trajectory is clear: slow, irreversible decline born of strategic incompetence and a people conditioned to bear it.

That is why, whatever the size of the protests, Britain will never experience a revolution. Its people were conquered in 1066, bound by oligarchs in 1215, tied to parishes in 1662, stripped of relief in 1834 – and taught through it all that injustice is simply the way of things.

Today, as feudal habits finally wither across the world, Britain remains their museum piece. It will not explode; it will simply fade.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has hinted that the country has developed “secret weapons” to bolster deterrence against the US and its allies.

In a speech carried by the state-run KCNA news agency on Monday, Kim said Pyongyang must “continuously stockpile even more formidable forces capable of repelling all military threats,” and accused Washington and its allies of destabilizing the region by staging “provocative actions that further escalate tensions” and disregarding North Korea's security concerns.

To offset the perceived threat, North Korea has “acquired new secret weapons and has achieved a significant number of research achievements in defense science,” Kim said, without elaborating.

He added that Pyongyang also “successfully built a strategic axis for safeguarding maritime sovereignty by producing destroyers capable of performing various maritime military missions.”

His comments come after North Korea said earlier this month it completed the final ground test of a solid-fuel engine intended for the Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, a weapon that could potentially reach the continental US.

Last week, Kim also oversaw tests of tactical attack drones known as Kumsong and an unmanned strategic reconnaissance aircraft. In March, he observed tests of AI-powered “suicide drones.”

In his speech, Kim also reiterated his criticism of the concept of “phased denuclearization,” stressing that “we will never give up our nuclear weapons,” while noting that North Korea's nuclear status is a “national law.”

At the same time, he struck a peaceful tone, saying if the US abandons what he called a “vain obsession with denuclearization and acknowledges reality,” the two countries would have an opportunity to forge ties.

The vice-president JD Vance used his speech to call Kirk a ‘martyr for the Christian faith'. Plus, a behavioral scientist shares how she stays focused

Good morning.

Donald Trump told a crowd of tens of thousands at a memorial for Charlie Kirk that he “hates” his opponents, despite Kirk's widow saying she forgives the man charged with fatally shooting her husband.

The president gave the last of more than two dozen speeches at a public event that reflected on Kirk's impact within the Make America Great Again movement. He said Kirk told a staff member he was not afraid of students who disagreed with him in the crowd at Utah Valley University. “I'm not here to fight them – I want them to know them and love them,” Trump quoted Kirk as saying.

But Trump said he felt differently to the rightwing activist, adding: “That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents and I don't want the best for them, I'm sorry.”

What did JD Vance say? He used his eulogy to call Kirk “a martyr for the Christian faith”, despite no evidence that religion played a role in his killing. David Smith reflects that the speech may have been a canny attempt to lock in a new generation of young Christians before 2028.

The UK, Canada and Australia formally declared their recognition of Palestinian statehood on Sunday, becoming the first members of the G7 advanced economies to do so.

The recognition of Palestinian statehood is part of a wider strategy that aims to both isolate Hamas and challenge attempts by the Israeli government to erase the chance of a Palestinian homeland. Portugal also recognized Palestinian statehood late on Sunday.

How might it ostracize Hamas? The strategy, led by France, which plans to make the same move on Monday, aims to make recognition part of a wider process, including a reformed, democratically elected Palestinian Authority to supersede Hamas in Gaza.

Where is the US on this? A US state department spokesperson on Sunday dismissed the move to recognise Palestine as “performative”.

Two German Eurofighter jets were scrambled on Sunday to intercept a Russian military aircraft above the Baltic Sea, as Estonia said it would call an emergency meeting of the UN security council after Russian planes violated its airspace.

Germany's air force said the Russian Il-20M reconnaissance plane had switched off its transponders and ignored requests to make contact. The Eurofighters took off from the Rostock-Laage airbase to head off the aircraft as it flew in international airspace.

What is the latest? Sunday's move comes after a series of actions that European governments consider to be deliberate Russian provocations. On Friday, three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace in the Gulf of Finland. Moscow denies this.

What is the US's response? When asked if the US would defend EU countries from further Russian aggression, Donald Trump on Sunday said: “Yeah, I would. I would.”

Despite medical guidelines, Donald Trump's administration is reportedly set to link pregnant women's use of Tylenol to a risk of autism. Most scientists believe genes play a role in autism.

Tens of thousands of Brazilians have rallied to demand that the former president Jair Bolsonaro is not granted amnesty after he was convicted of plotting a coup.

The Taliban is trying to make religious studies the only education available to women and girls in Afghanistan, with some families reporting that they were told to send their daughters to a madrasa or lose food aid.

Tens of thousands of Filipinos protested on Sunday against government corruption after it was alleged that billions of dollars for flood relief projects had been siphoned off. The Philippine government estimates that the country's economy may have lost as much as $2bn over the last two years from corruption in flood control projects, while Greenpeace puts the figure much higher – at a staggering $17.5bn.

The behavioral scientist Zelana Montminy is worried that burnout has become normalised. She believes many of us are exhausted – not necessarily from doing too much, but “from being everywhere and nowhere all at the same time”. Sound familiar? Here's what she does to build focus in her daily life.

Governments around the world are increasing coal, gas and oil extraction to levels that will make achieving climate goals impossible, data has shown. Rather than “transition away from fossil fuels”, as countries pledged to do at UN climate summits, nations have stepped up their planned extraction compared with 2023. If it all goes ahead, the world will produce more than double the quantity of fossil fuels in 2030 than the amount that would make restricting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels possible.

Now here's a truly feelgood story: the Irish sport of road bowling is back with a bang, thanks in part to its popularity on TikTok. No longer a local affair, the annual King and Queen of the Roads tournament in the village of Ballincurrig this year drew international crowds and competitors, with the actor Bill Murray giving the sport a go during a visit to the village last week. Bill Daly, 68, who won the first tournament in 1985, said he loved that the sport had gone global, but that at heart the game remained unchanged: “It's the same magic.”

Both Republicans and Democrats spoke out against Trump's demand for attorney general to investigate his political opponents including Letitia James, Adam Schiff and James Comey

As we reported over the weekend, the president has ramped up his demands of attorney general Pam Bondi to use the Department of Justice to launch investigations into his political opponents.

On Truth Social, the president addressed Bondi directly and bemoaned the lack of investigations into longtime political adversary Letitia James, the New York attorney general, as well as California Democratic senator Adam Schiff and former FBI director James Comey.

“They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

On Friday, the president said he fired the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, Erik Siebert, for saying that there was insufficient evidence to charge James with mortgage fraud. “A Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job,” Trump said of Siebert.

In response, several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized Trump's politicization of the justice department.

In an interview with NBC News, Rand Paul, Republican senator of Kentucky, toed a line, and said that “lawfare in all forms is bad,” before insisting that Joe Biden was the “king of lawfare”.

Paul also noted that “we need to get politics out of the judicial system as much as we can”.

Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN that Trump's actions resembled “the path to a dictatorship”.

“It is so very, very frightening and damaging to our republic,” Schumer added.

Similarly, Chris Murphy, Democratic senator of Connecticut, denounced the president's demands of the justice department:

Donald Trump, because he doesn't care about the facts – all he cares about is the threat of imprisonment for his political enemies, so that it suppresses the speech of other people who might speak up – is now going to put his own political loyalist in charge of that investigation.

On social media, Trump said he would nominate Lindsey Halligan to replace Siebert. Halligan is an attorney and special assistant to the preisdent.

“Lindsey is a tough, smart, and loyal attorney, who has worked with me for a long time, including in the winning fight against the Weaponization of our Justice System by Crooked Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump wrote in his post.

Following the public memorial for conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk on Sunday, Leavitt characterized Erika Kirk's remarks, where she said that she forgives her husband's killer, as “one of the greatest acts of grace this world has ever seen”.

Notably, Leavitt incorrectly claimed that 96 Democrats voted “against a basic resolution condemning political violence” in Congress, following his murder.

On Friday, the House ultimately passed a resolution that praised Kirk as a “courageous American patriot” who sought to “elevate truth, foster understanding, and strengthen the Republic”.

Ninety-five Democrats voted to pass the measure, but 58 voted to oppose it, with several saying that they condemned his murder, but could not support Kirk's speech. Thirty-eight Democrats voted present and 22 did not vote on the resolution.

In a statement, New York Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that while “condemning the depravity of Kirk's brutal murder is a straightforward matter” Kirk's rhetoric and beliefs “were ignorant and sought to disenfranchise millions of Americans – far from ‘working tirelessly to promote unity' as asserted by the majority in this resolution.”

Karoline Leavitt just started the White House press briefing. She noted that the president will address the United Nations general assembly tomorrow in a “a major speech touting the renewal of American strength around the world his historic accomplishments in just eight months”.

We're due to hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shortly. We'll bring you the latest lines from the briefing as they happen.

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister, said he met with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, in New York today, where he says the two of them discussed a range of issues.

“Our conversation covered a range of bilateral and international issues of current concern,” Jaishankar wrote in a post on X.

Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said today that he expects to complete interviews of 10 of 11 candidates to replace Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, by the end of next week, including current Fed board members and regional bank presidents.

Bessent said he expects to begin narrowing the list of candidates after next week and that there may be two or three shortlists before recommending a candidate to Trump. Powell's term as Fed chair ends in May 2026.

Bessent again ruled himself out as a potential Fed chair, opting to stay at Treasury. He said that Trump “likes me where I am and I like where I am”.

Hundreds of Hollywood and Broadway stars – including Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Selena Gomez, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep – are urging Americans to “fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights” in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel's suspension.

More than 430 movie, TV and stage stars as well as comedians, directors and writers added their names to an open letter Monday from the American Civil Liberties Union that argues it is “a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation”.

The move comes less than a week after ABC suspended Kimmel's late-night talkshow following comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After a group of ABC-affiliated stations said they wouldn't air Jimmy Kimmel Live! the Walt Disney Co pulled the show on Wednesday just before its scheduled airing, prompting a firestorm of debate over free speech.

“Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country,” the letter says. “We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.”

The list of signatories includes recent Emmy winner Noah Wyle, Oscar-nominated Florence Pugh, comedian David Cross, Tony winner Kelli O'Hara and veteran actor Molly Ringwald. Pedro Pascal, Billy Crystal, Nathan Lane, Kerry Washington and Kevin Bacon are also among those who signed.

“This is the moment to defend free speech across our nation. We encourage all Americans to join us, along with the ACLU, in the fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights,” the letter concludes.

The US government is revoking the visas of Brazilian solicitor-general Jorge Messias and five other former and current Brazilian judicial officials, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters.

The move represents a significant escalation in the ongoing feud between the US and Brazilian governments that has intensified since the criminal conviction of former president Jair Bolsonaro earlier in the month.

Donald Trump and his political allies have denounced Bolsonaro's conviction as the fruit of a “political witch-hunt” and more broadly accused Brazil's judiciary of censoring conservatives.

Brazilian authorities have vigorously rejected those assertions. They say there is ample evidence that the right-wing former leader – a close ally of Trump – attempted to overturn his 2022 election loss to current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

In addition to Messias, the official said the Trump administration is revoking the visas of former solicitor-general José Levi, former electoral court justice Benedito Gonçalves, auxiliary judge and supreme court aide Airton Vieira, former electoral court aide Marco Antonio Martin Vargas, and Rafael Henrique Janela Tamai Rocha, another high-ranking judicial aide.

Tech giant Oracle, headed by Larry Ellison, will receive a copy of TikTok's algorithm to operate for US users, a senior official in the Trump administration told the Associated Press.

Determining next steps for the algorithm, currently owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance, has been one of the most watched issues during ongoing negotiations over TikTok's future. Oracle will now oversee the security of Americans' data and monitor changes to the popular social media platform's algorithm.

The official reportedly said they believe the plan will satisfy national security concerns over a Chinese company potentially manipulating what is being shown to US TikTok users.

The White House says doctors may be exempt from H-1B visa fees, according to reporting from Bloomberg.

“‘The Proclamation allows for potential exemptions, which can include physicians and medical residents,' White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in an email to Bloomberg News,” journalist Ed Ludlow wrote in a post on X.

Trump signed a proclamation on Friday introducing the application fee of $100,000 for the H-1B visa, 60 times the current cost, in a move designed to encourage companies to hire more American workers. Economists have warned that the move could hurt US economic growth.

We'll also be keeping an ear out at today's press briefing to hear the administration's reaction to several global allies' recognition of a Palestinian state.

A growing chorus of nations have pledged to recognize Palestinian statehood, in a move that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has branded as a “a huge reward to terrorism”.

Netanyahu has said, categorically, that a Palestinian state “will not be established west of the Jordan River”.

Last week, on the president's state visit to the UK, he acknowledged that statehood it was “one of the few things” that he and British prime minister Keir Starmer disagreed on. Over the weekend, Britain, Canada and Australia all formally recognized Palestinian statehood ahead of a high-stakes week at the United Nations general assembly. Trump will address the nations present on Tuesday, 23 September.

A reminder, that you can follow the latest developments in the Middle East at our dedicated blog below.

As we reported over the weekend, the president has ramped up his demands of attorney general Pam Bondi to use the Department of Justice to launch investigations into his political opponents.

On Truth Social, the president addressed Bondi directly and bemoaned the lack of investigations into longtime political adversary Letitia James, the New York attorney general, as well as California Democratic senator Adam Schiff and former FBI director James Comey.

“They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote. “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

On Friday, the president said he fired the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, Erik Siebert, for saying that there was insufficient evidence to charge James with mortgage fraud. “A Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job,” Trump said of Siebert.

In response, several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized Trump's politicization of the justice department.

In an interview with NBC News, Rand Paul, Republican senator of Kentucky, toed a line, and said that “lawfare in all forms is bad,” before insisting that Joe Biden was the “king of lawfare”.

Paul also noted that “we need to get politics out of the judicial system as much as we can”.

Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN that Trump's actions resembled “the path to a dictatorship”.

“It is so very, very frightening and damaging to our republic,” Schumer added.

Similarly, Chris Murphy, Democratic senator of Connecticut, denounced the president's demands of the justice department:

Donald Trump, because he doesn't care about the facts – all he cares about is the threat of imprisonment for his political enemies, so that it suppresses the speech of other people who might speak up – is now going to put his own political loyalist in charge of that investigation.

On social media, Trump said he would nominate Lindsey Halligan to replace Siebert. Halligan is an attorney and special assistant to the preisdent.

“Lindsey is a tough, smart, and loyal attorney, who has worked with me for a long time, including in the winning fight against the Weaponization of our Justice System by Crooked Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump wrote in his post.

The Trump administration has started recruiting hundreds of military lawyers to sit as immigration judges, presiding over what are often life-and-death federal decisions for immigrants in the US, as experts warn the White House strategy is high-risk and arguably unlawful.

The judgeships are temporary but renewable, and the government's goal is to fill an acute need for more immigration judges amid Donald Trump's mass deportation mission – which is now happening even as experienced immigration judges seemingly deemed to have fallen foul of the president's agenda are being purged from the courts.

Active-duty armed forces officers and reservists, part of the military's justice arm known as the Judge Advocate General's (Jag) corps, which has given rise to the lawyers there being nickname ‘Jags', are getting messages asking them to volunteer for the high-stakes immigration roles.

But experts warn that military lawyers do not have the specialized knowledge to perform the duties of an immigration judge and may only have gotten an hour or two of immigration law training – if that – during JAG school, while, further, their appointments would likely break the law.

“The military's mission is to kill people and break things – and Jags are trained to support that mission within the boundaries of military law. That's not the same as immigration law. So why would we be using those attorneys, of all the lawyers out there, to decide the fate of families seeking refuge?” said Shawn VanDiver, a navy veteran and immigration advocate. “It's just another way the Trump administration is trying to sow fear and keep people from coming here.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Talks on UN-led stabilisation force follow recognition of Palestine by France, Canada and the UK

Middle East crisis – live updates

Arab and Muslim leaders are to meet Donald Trump in New York to discuss their plan for a UN-mandated international stabilisation force in Gaza after France joined the UK, Canada and Australia in recognising Palestine as a state.

Israel has warned that it might respond to the recognition of Palestine by annexing the West Bank, citing claims from Hamas that recognition by allies of Israel was a victory for the terror group.

France has said the plan for a stabilisation force would marginalise Hamas by disarming the group and excluding it from power.

The proposal, which is due to be endorsed on Monday at a UN conference on Palestinian statehood, includes a UN-mandated force to provide security in Gaza as well as oversee the disarmament of Hamas and help train a Palestinian Authority (PA) police force.

The Arab League declared in July that Hamas must play no further role in governance, with power handed to a newly elected PA to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Hamas would be required to hand over its weapons to the authority.

The Trump meeting, scheduled after his address to the UN's general assembly, is the most direct engagement between the White House and Arab states on post-ceasefire plans for Gaza since he was elected president for a second time.

He is expected to meet leaders from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Nothing the president has done so far suggests that he shares the view held by the Gulf states that the PA is a viable alternative to Hamas, or should be considered a partner for peace. He has imposed sanctions on PA officials and banned Mahmoud Abbas, its 89-year-old leader, from coming to New York to speak to the UN.

Arab leaders see the meeting as a chance to pin down Trump on whether he supports the Arab League's proposals for Gaza's future, or even a variation put to him by a working group led by Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, and Jared Kushner, who is the president's son-in-law. Neither of the reconstruction plans proposes the mass expulsion of Palestinians, a proposal that Trump at times has appeared to support. The Blair plan does not clearly endorse the PA as the long-term administrators for Gaza.

The Arab states are likely to insist they will not join any international force unless the reformed PA is given a future role. They also want a roadmap to a two-state future that excludes further Israeli settlements or annexation of the West Bank.

The PA, which exercises limited civic rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was forced out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, has said it was ready to govern Gaza and the West Bank with international support.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has insisted that Israel must retain overall security control alongside an Arab-led civilian administration. However, others in his rightwing coalition want to annex Gaza. Israel has driven the PA close to bankruptcy by withholding monthly revenue transfers.

Lana Nusseibeh, a minister at the UAE foreign affairs ministry, said annexation would be a red line for the UAE since “it would strike at the heart of what the Abraham accords are trying to achieve”. The UAE signed the accords – deals brokered by Trump to normalise relations between Israel and the Arab states – in 2020 in return for Israel not annexing the West Bank.

UAE leaders, bidding to present themselves as the startup nation of the future, did not suggest they would leave the accords but instead said plans for greater regional integration would become a dead letter.

The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, urged Israel not to respond to the new recognitions by annexing parts of the West Bank.

France's foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said the recognition of a Palestinian state was a disavowal of Hamas since the plan called for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza. He pointed out that the general assembly had already endorsed a seven-page declaration this month outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution, while also condemning Hamas and calling for it to surrender and disarm.

The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said: “Any and all steps toward an illegal annexation of occupied territory also undermine the chances of resolving the conflict in a sustainable way. However distant it may seem at this moment, a negotiated two-state solution is the path that can enable both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security and dignity. Germany regards recognition of a Palestinian state as a step more at the end of the process. However, such a process must now begin.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

翻譯 Translation

Qingqing: Huahua, have you heard of “autumn tea”?

Huahua: I've heard of it, but I'm not really sure what kind of tea it is.

Qingqing: Autumn tea is picked in the fall, and it has a stronger aroma. I once heard a tea master say, “Spring water, autumn fragrance,” meaning spring tea emphasizes mouthfeel, while autumn tea emphasizes fragrance. Each has its own charm.

Huahua: That sounds interesting. I've had lots of tea, but I've never picked tea before.

Qingqing: I saw online that there are tea-picking events—you can even make your own tea by hand. But you need at least three people to join.

Huahua: Wow, sounds like fun. Should we ask some friends to come along?

Qingqing: Sure. I'll check with Xiaomei and Aquan to see if they're interested. I remember they like tea too.

Huahua: Then I'll look up the time and place of the event and let you know.

For the first time, Ukrainian forces hit two Russian Be-12 Chayka amphibious aircraft in occupied Crimea, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 22.

The attack was carried out on Sept. 21 by HUR's special unit Prymary (""phantoms""), according to the statement.

""This is the first-ever strike on a Be-12 in history,"" the agency said. The Prymary unit has been responsible for a number of successful drone strikes against Russian military assets during the full-scale war.

The Soviet-designed Be-12 Chayka (NATO reporting name Mail) is an anti-submarine amphibious aircraft equipped with high-value systems used for detecting and engaging submarines.

Introduced in the 1960s, the aircraft was used by the Soviet Armed Forces and later by the militaries of Russia, Ukraine, and other countries.

Separately, Ukrainian forces also struck one Russian Mi-8 helicopter, HUR claimed.

A day earlier, on Sept. 21, the agency reported it had destroyed three Russian Mi-8 helicopters and a radar station in Crimea.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims

Crimea, illegally occupied by Russia in 2014, has become a frequent target of Ukrainian strikes against military infrastructure since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

In the evening of Sept. 21, Ukrainian drones struck the Foros resort in the peninsula, causing damage and casualties, according to Russian proxies.

The alleged target, the Foros Sanatorium, is a luxury resort located near four Russian state dachas — country homes of Russia's political elite.

Earlier strikes against the occupied peninsula throughout August and September targeted Russian naval assets, railway infrastructure, and air defense radar systems.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sept. 22 that Russia is ready to respond to any threats as he accused the West of seeking superiority in the nuclear domain.

The comments come amid rising tensions between NATO and Russia, following the downing of Russian drones over Poland and airspace violations in Estonia.

Speaking at a Russian Security Council meeting, Putin said the expiration of the New START Treaty in February 2026 will mark the end of the last accord limiting U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals.

The New START Treaty, signed by Russia and the U.S. in 2010 and set to expire on Feb. 5, 2026, places mutual limits on strategic nuclear warheads and launchers.

Putin announced that Russia is willing to uphold the treaty's quantitative limits for another year and will decide on any future restrictions according to its own assessment.

""We believe this step will be only possible if the U.S. does the same,"" Putin said.

Russia suspended its participation in the treaty in February 2023 but did not fully withdraw, claiming to continue to uphold its quantitative limits.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who met Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, has said he wants to maintain the limits set by the New START agreement.

The Kremlin's chief further warned that Russia is ""ready to respond to any existing or emerging threats"" with ""military-technical means"" rather than just words.

Since launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has repeatedly issued veiled or overt nuclear threats against the invaded country and its Western partners.

During his address, Putin went on to accuse the West of ""destructive steps"" endangering the dialogue between nuclear-armed powers and said that Russia has confidence in its deterrent forces.

Russia possesses the largest nuclear arsenal in the world. According to estimates from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in 2024, the United States has 3,708 nuclear warheads, while Russia has 4,380, excluding retired weapons.

Satellite imagery published earlier this year showed that Russia has expanded and modernized at least five nuclear-related facilities near European borders in recent years.

Moscow has devised a plan to interfere in the Moldovan parliamentary elections and disrupt the country's path toward EU membership, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 22, citing documents it had seen.

Separately, a BBC investigation published on Sept. 21 uncovered that a secret Russia-funded network is attempting to influence the outcome of the upcoming vote.

The news comes before the Sept. 28 elections, in which a group of Russian-friendly parties will challenge the ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) with potentially major ramifications for Moldova's EU accession efforts.

The documents uncovered by Bloomberg outline a multi-layered strategy reportedly coordinated directly by the Kremlin. 

The goal is to undermine the chances of Moldovan President Maia Sandu's PAS party and ultimately remove her from power, the news outlet reported.

According to the documents, the Kremlin's tactics include recruiting Moldovan citizens living abroad, including in Russia, to vote at polling stations in the EU and other countries, organizing disruptive protests, and running a widespread disinformation campaign on social media.

Undercover reporting by BBC journalists also uncovered that a Russian-funded network offered payments to individuals willing to spread pro-Russian propaganda and fake news aimed at discrediting Sandu's party.

The BBC found that participants were paid to covertly recruit supporters of pro-Russian opposition parties and conduct so-called polls on behalf of a non-existent organization.

The BBC investigation also revealed links between the network and fugitive pro-Kremlin oligarch Ilan Shor and the non-profit organization Evrazia, which is associated with him.

In July, Shor announced that his Victory Bloc was planning to participate in Moldova's parliamentary elections.

Sandu's PAS faces a challenge from several groups, including the nominally pro-EU Alternative Bloc and a pro-Russian party led by former Moldovan President Igor Dodon.

According to separate documents reviewed by Bloomberg, Dodon allegedly asked security services to monitor political opponents while in office. Dodon denied any wrongdoing.

In an open letter posted on social media, the ex-president also accused the current government of illegally pressuring opposition parties.

Moldovan law enforcement agencies carried out more than 250 searches across the country on Sept. 22 as part of an investigation into plans to incite mass unrest and destabilization, Moldovan news outlet NewsMaker reported.

Chisianu has long warned against Moscow's attempt to destabilize Moldova. Last year, pro-EU Sandu secured re-election by a narrow margin against Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former top prosecutor backed by Dodon. The president said Russia attempted to interfere in the vote.

Sandu has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pushed for Moldova's EU membership. Russia, in turn, claims many Moldovans want to maintain ties with Moscow and accuses Sandu of fostering ""Russophobia.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged on July 4 that the European Union will help Moldova defend itself against hybrid threats by ""agents of autocracy"" as elections approach.

Current research uncovers how everyday lifestyle choices can influence aging.Ridofranz/iStockPhoto / Getty Images

Healthy aging has become an increasingly popular topic.

Due to the rise in life expectancy worldwide – and its accompanying increase in age-related chronic disease – healthy aging has become a strong public health focus. 

At the same time, growing research is uncovering how everyday lifestyle habits, such as diet, exercise, sleep, stress management and social engagement, can influence aging. 

Now, a new U.S. survey of health experts has reported the best – and worst – habits for healthy aging. 

Here's a look at the panel's top recommendations, plus missteps that can make you age faster. 

Healthy aging is generally described as maintaining physical and mental health, as well as social connections, that enables functional ability and wellbeing into older age.

These four healthy habits can boost cognitive function in older age, study finds

Researchers from Harvard University have defined healthy aging as reaching the age of 70 free of 11 major chronic diseases – including hypertension, heart disease, cancer and Type 2 diabetes – and without impairment in cognitive function, physical function and mental health.

The survey, conducted this past June and July by the U.S. News and World Report, asked 53 health experts, including medical doctors, registered dietitians, fitness specialists and pharmacists, about habits for healthy aging, as well as trends and expert insights. 

When asked to rank 18 factors for aging well, a healthy diet was identified as “most important” by 47 per cent of experts.

Want to reach age 70 without chronic diseases? Start now, with these foods

This reflects substantial evidence that strongly supports diet quality as a leading predictor of chronic disease risk. 

Higher quality diets focused on vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, pulses, fish and healthy fats are consistently associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and some cancers, as well as a reduced likelihood of premature death.

Regular exercise was deemed most important by 40 per cent of panel members. 

Plenty of studies have found that regular physical activity guards against chronic disease. 

Resistance training, strength training in particular, also helps preserve muscle mass and strength in older age. Resistance training reduces the risk of sarcopenia, a skeletal muscle disorder that can significantly impact quality of life and helps protect from falls. And it also has cognitive benefits.

Mediterranean diet may offset genetic risk of Alzheimer's, new study shows

The third pillar of healthy aging recognized as most important was good quality sleep. 

Insufficient sleep is tied to an increased risk of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. It can also impair cognitive performance, mood and immune function. 

To promote overall health and wellbeing, it's recommended adults get seven to nine hours of sleep each night.

When asked about healthy aging mistakes people often make, the experts put lack of exercise first on the list. Not getting regular exercise weakens muscles and bones and can compromise heart and brain health. 

Smoking was the next, followed by poor sleep hygiene and eating ultra-processed foods, which were both tied. 

Research strongly suggests a high intake of ultra-processed foods increases the risk of many chronic diseases, as well as premature death. The higher the intake, the greater the risk.

The experts were also asked which supplements they most recommend to support healthy aging. 

Vitamin D topped the list. 

The fat-soluble nutrient is critical for maintaining strong bones, supporting immune health and regulating muscle contraction. It also has anti-inflammatory effects in the body.

Taking vitamin D may slow biological aging, study suggests

Recent research also suggests that a daily vitamin D supplement (2000 IU) can help minimize the shortening of telomeres in cells, a marker of biological aging. (Telomeres are protective caps of DNA on the ends of chromosomes.)

A daily multivitamin and mineral supplement was also recommended to help bridge micronutrient gaps that can influence aging.

As well, omega-3 fatty acids were regarded important for healthy aging. Omega-3's in oily fish – docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA – can help improve blood vessel function, reduce inflammation, and regulate blood pressure and immune function. 

Over 50? Focus on getting enough of these four nutrients

DHA, in particular, is especially high in the retina and the brain where it supports vision and brain health.

If you don't eat fatty fish such as salmon, trout, Arctic char and sardines, you might consider an omega-3 supplement.

Turns out, and not surprisingly so, the most protective daily habits for healthy aging aren't that complicated. 

Even better, they're ones you can build on each day.

It was the biggest mega church in America, maybe in American history.

Part religious ceremony, part state funeral, part political rally, part revival meeting, part call to action, the memorial to slain Turning Point USA leader Charlie Kirk was a moment of a great awakening in American life. 

It was a spiritual reawakening for the millions of MAGA followers and a startling awakening for their opponents, who in an event stretching more than four hours were introduced to, if not reminded of, the power of the new conservatism. 

A bagpipe version of Amazing Grace opened an amazing juncture of religious faith and political force, an astonishing juncture in the American story: a celebration of a private figure who occupied an offstage presence in American culture for the early stirrings of the 13-year life of his organization only to come into prominence with the Trump movement, especially in the past several years, especially on the country's college campuses. 

It was the culmination of a moment when a movement that became a ministry – and that Secretary of State Marco Rubio called a “mission” – met its martyr.

U.S. President Donald Trump hailed slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a 'martyr for American freedom' on Sunday and vowed at his memorial service to carry on his work, while again accusing what he called the 'radical left' for Kirk's murder.

Reuters

Some of the tributes were personal (“We loved Charlie as a friend,” said Vice-President JD Vance). Some were spiritual (“He looked to politics as an on-ramp to Jesus,” said his pastor, Rob McCoy). Some expressed heartache (“at a level I didn't know existed,” said his widow, Erika Kirk, who in an affecting moment said she would “forgive” his killer). 

Some were pugilistic (White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller spoke of what he called the “righteous fury our enemies cannot see or understand”). 

Some issued comparisons between Mr. Kirk, who died at 31, and Jesus Christ, who died at 33 (Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son and nephew of victims of assassination, said both Christ and Charlie Kirk “changed the trajectory of history”). 

Charlie Kirk memorial service draws thousands

One of the eulogists was Donald Trump, who stood throughout much of the proceedings, swayed to the devotional music, and offered applause and presidential fist pumps and spoke of “a giant of his generation” who was cut down by a “radicalized cold-blooded monster.” He acknowledged Mr. Kirk's pleas to love his opponents, but the President said of himself that he hated his opponents.

But the greatest impact didn't come from the polished production values evocative of an American political convention, nor from the boldface names on the stage that served as a pulpit.

Those whose presence may be the most significant in their tribute to a political figure who never held political office were the nameless who, because they were part of a crowd of an estimated 200,000 – half in State Farm Stadium, half in overflow lots – were rendered faceless, though not powerless. 

It was those in what Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called “Charlie's church” who dressed in red, white, and blue and donned “I Am Charlie Kirk” T-shirts. It was the youth who Democrats thought they owned because of their commitment to diversity, and the non-voters political experts doubted would participate in elections, and the new activists energized by Mr. Kirk's life and, now, rededicated by his death to their movement.

That's because the Kirk assassination – and the funeral of the leader of Turning Point USA, which White House chief of staff Susie Wiles called “the most powerful youth movement of our time” – has had a transformative effect on the American scene. 

Together they provided a unifying moment for an otherwise fractured GOP, divided by style (old guard versus MAGA ascendancy), issues (the clamour for further disclosures involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein), potential new rifts (over vaccine mandates), and concerns about the future (with speculation about the 2028 presidential race). 

Top officials at the White House and other high profile supporters gathered to pay tribute to conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Sunday, whose assassination has intensified political tensions in the United States.

The Associated Press

They sent a wave of grief across university campuses where Mr. Kirk tested his often-provocative conservative creed even as he spoke out for the free exchange of ideas; created new tests of the country's freedom of expression, codified 234 years ago in the First Amendment; demonized those who didn't display sufficient grief or were perceived to be disrespectful only to have the same individuals become celebrated by others as sentinels of liberty; and spawned efforts like the one undertaken by New Hampshire state Representative Mike Belcher. Last week, he drafted a “Countering Hate And Revolutionary Leftist Indoctrination in Education (CHARLIE)” bill to fight “woke activists” he said were disseminating “Marxist ideology” to schoolchildren at taxpayer expense.

And they also promoted a surge of interest in Mr. Kirk's Turning Point USA movement, which reported that in the first six days since his slaying, more than 54,000 high-school and college students contacted the organization to join a chapter or to start one.

Charlie Kirk suspect's alleged trolling is the latest example of mass violence as a meme

Mr. Kirk's funeral has few if any precedents in American history – perhaps the throngs who stood in silent mourning and devout prayer as the funeral trains of Abraham Lincoln (1865) and Robert F. Kennedy (1968) passed, perhaps the procession from Atlanta's Ebeneezer Baptist Church to Morehouse College after the 1968 assassination of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., perhaps the crowd that watched the 1963 Washington procession of John F. Kennedy's coffin as it moved about the capital on a horse-drawn caisson. 

The only Canadian analogue may be the 115,000 who passed the open coffin of Montreal Canadiens star Maurice Richard in 2000. 

It was an outpouring of grief that Lysiane Gagnon noted in an account in The Globe was possessed of a subtle “political context” for a symbol of francophone pride and a hockey star whose 1955 suspension prompted an uprising known as the Richard Riot and often regarded as a spur to Quebec nationalism. 

In the Kirk funeral observance, which the Department of Homeland Security gave the same security rating as the three Super Bowls that were held in the same site, there were glancing but clearly implicit references to political violence fomented by left-wing activists.

The day's proceedings were evocative of the sentiment Taylor Swift expressed about her grandmother in her song marjorie:

If I didn't know better

I'd think you were still around

What died didn't stay dead

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","U.S. savers go all in on ‘cult of equity'","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-us-savers-go-all-in-on-cult-of-equity/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 13:04:54 GMT","

U.S. pension funds and households have never held more equities as a share of their overall assets, by some measures, raising questions about whether the long-term shift towards stocks has run its course or whether investors have truly undergone a paradigm shift.

There are compelling arguments on both sides of that debate, but what's not in dispute are the numbers.

The share of stocks in U.S. private sector defined contribution (DC) pension plans is now approaching 70 per cent, while equities as a share of U.S. households' financial assets is a record 45.4 per cent.

John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, notes that DC pension plans' equity exposure is the highest in at least 75 years. This largely reflects the decades-long shift away from defined benefit (DB) schemes, where the risk of retirement savings lies with the employer, and toward DC plans, where employees assume more of the burden.

Broadly speaking, DB plans tend to invest more in bonds, especially long-dated ones, to match the funds' longer-dated liabilities, while DC plans are equity-heavy, as individuals don't have liabilities to match and so will be more likely to lean towards stocks offering higher returns – and higher risk.

In the 1950s, more than 90 per cent of all U.S. pensions were DB plans, and less than 20 years ago the split was roughly 50-50. But now, almost 80 per cent are DC plans.

In that sense, investors are in a brave new world – and it could be an increasingly risky one, given that DC plans are so highly exposed to Wall Street at a time when U.S. stock market valuations are looking stretched.

From a returns perspective, overloading on stocks makes sense for long-term investors because equities usually outperform bonds, especially over the long run.

By some measures, that performance gap is widening, according to figures from Truist Advisory Services' chief markets strategist Keith Lerner and his team.

As of August, the S&P 500's trailing one-year annualized return was nearly 16 per cent, compared with the Bloomberg aggregate bond index's returns of just over 3 per cent. The 12.7 percentage point gap is in the 68th percentile going back seven decades.

Moreover, the S&P 500's returns advantage when measured on a rolling three- and five-year basis is in the 93rd and 95th percentiles, respectively.

How long can equities sustain that level of outperformance over bonds?

The answer may be “a while”.

The near 40-year bull market in bonds appears to be over. Worries about inflation remain, the U.S. federal deficit and public debt are rising, and pension funds' appetite for long-dated bonds may no longer be as voracious as it once was. In short, bonds don't appear quite so ‘risk-free' any more.

If stocks do continue to outperform over the long term, that's obviously great news for future retirees with portfolios heavily weighted in that direction.

The danger, of course, is the stock market can fall sharply and very quickly, wiping out large swathes of savings for people just about to retire.

It's also true that many people reduce their exposure to equities in favor of bonds as they near retirement, although that may become less prevalent in the context of a wider paradigm shift in how bonds are viewed.

There's no indication that any dramatic equity market correction is on the horizon, though investors are conscious of how expensive stocks are getting. Still, they keep buying.

Although valuations are “unambiguously high by historical standards”, Deutsche Bank analysts just raised their year-end S&P 500 target to 7,000 from 6,550 and next year's earnings per share forecast.

“High allocations to equities don't necessarily mean another major correction in the stock market is imminent. Indeed, our forecast is that the S&P 500 will make further gains this year and next, as enthusiasm for AI continues to grow,” says Capital Economics' Higgins. “But high allocations to equities may be flagging trouble ahead.”

That's true. But as long as equities keep providing the returns and outperforming bonds, prospective retirees will keep ploughing their pension savings into them.

As world leaders prepare to meet at the UN, a growing number of countries are planning to recognize Palestinian statehood. France and Saudi Arabia are leading the push to revive the two-state solution. DW has more.

Below you can read about developments in Israel, the Palestinian territories and the Middle East on Monday, September 22:

Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, touched down in New York to attend the UN General Assembly (UNGA). 

Al-Sharaa is set to become the first Syrian leader since 1967 to attend meetings at the UN.

At an event on the sidelines of the UNGA, he expressed hope for a security deal by the end of the year that would ease regional tensions.

""I hope that that will lead us to an agreement that will keep the sovereignty of Syria and also resolve some of the security fears of Israel,"" Sharaa told the Concordia Annual Summit.

But he dismissed the idea that Syria would join the US-brokered Abraham Accords, which saw the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco normalize relations with Israel in 2020, pointing out that ""Syria is different to those"" countries as they don't border Israel.

""Syria has been subjected to more than 1,000 Israeli raids, strikes and incursions from the Golan Heights into Syria,"" he said.

He also called on the US to lift sanctions in order to rebuild his country's economy.

""Syria has a diverse workforce. They love to work, it's in its genes,"" Sharaa said.

""So don't be worried,"" he added. ""Just lift the sanctions and you will see the results.""

Sharaa is also expected to meet with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio while in New York.

Palestinian Foreign Minister, Varsen Aghabekian, says the recognition of Palestinian statehood by a growing number of Western nations will not change things on the ground immediately.

But Aghabekian said it sends a clear message to Israel that the occupation of Palestinian territories cannot continue forever.

Thousands of workers and students across Italy have joined a general strike and staged rallies in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

A number of grassroots unions called for a 24-hour strike on Monday which affected transportation, schools and ports, among others.

More than 20,000 people attended a rally in front of Rome's central Termini railway station.

In Milan, protesters clashed with police at the city's central station. At least 10 people were arrested and around 60 police officers suffered bruising or more serious injuries, Italy's ANSA news agency reported.

Meanwhile, dock workers went on strike in the ports of Genoa, Livorno, Trieste and Venice, where police used a water cannon to break up protesters.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the clashes between protesters and police in Milan.

""(This was) violence and destruction that have nothing to do with solidarity and will not change the lives of people in Gaza by a fraction, but will have concrete consequences for Italian citizens who will end up suffering and paying for the damage caused by these hooligans,"" she said on social media.

Hebron is one of the largest Palestinian cities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. DW's Tania Krämer traveled there to ask human rights activist Issa Amro about what the recent push for a two-state solution means for the daily lives of Palestinians.

The UK, Canada and Australia have formally recognized a Palestinian state. The announcements came in the run-up to the UN General Assembly in New York, which begins Monday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the move will endanger Israel's existence and rewards Hamas terror.

DW News asked Mideast analyst Fawaz Gerges for his assessment.

Several Western countries want to recognize Palestine as a state at the UN General Assembly which begins on Monday.

While Germany is not among them, political pressure on the federal government is growing.

DW takes a closer look at Berlin's stance and how it's being met domestically as well as internationally.

Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an international human rights lawyer from the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, told DW that the UN conference on Palestinian statehood was ""momentous.""

""I think it is a significant, momentous first step in a long, long process which hopefully will lead to peace,"" Bar-Yaacov said, adding that ""a lot of mechanisms have to be put in place in order to ensure that two states will thrive as sovereign, contiguous, independent states side by side.""

""So there has to be urgent action to end the war. End the war now, release the hostages and pave a path to two states,"" Bar-Yaacov emphasized.

On the topic of what recognition of Palestinian state would mean, Bar-Yaacov said: ""it's a symbolic move, and it's a move that basically is meant to stop Israel annexing parts of the West Bank and Gaza.""

She highlighted that it was extreme elements within Israel's government that were pushing for annexation, specifically Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.

On Israel saying that recognition would be rewarding Hamas, Bar-Yaacov said: ""It's a question of interpretation, and of course Hamas will claim it as a victory, and I think we have to be honest about that.""

the human rights lawyer said it was up to Palestinians to elect their own government and that outcome would need to be respected.

France has said it will formally recognize Palestinian statehood. DW News spoke with French journalist Thibaut Madelin about why President Emmanuel Macron has decided to take the step.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have become the first major Western economies to recognize a Palestinian state.

The move comes ahead of the UN General Assembly's special summit on the war in the Gaza Strip, which starts on Monday.

Several countries have said they will soon join around 150 UN members that already recognize a Palestinian state. These include France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta.

Most of the recent European declarations on recognizing Palestinian statehood have come as a result of Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza.

But can the recognition of a Palestinian state bring peace? DW spoke with experts about whether these recognitions represent more than just symbolic gestures.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia are the latest Western countries to formally declare their recognition of Palestinian statehood.

Britain and Canada became the first G7 countries to take the step on Sunday. France has also said it plans to follow suit at the annual UN General Assembly, as world leaders gather in New York on Monday.

But the historic moves put these countries at odds with their allies, the United States and Israel.

On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to fight the Palestinian statehood initiative at the UN. 

Israeli officials have announced that the Allenby Bridge Crossing, the sole entry point between the occupied West Bank and Jordan, has reopened.

According to The Times of Israel, citing the Airports Authority, which manages the land border, the crossing is open again for passenger traffic but will remain closed to humanitarian aid shipments destined for Gaza following Thursday's attack on Israeli soldiers.

The crossing was shut on Friday, a day after a driver delivering aid from Jordan to Gaza killed two Israeli soldiers.

The border crossing is the main route for transporting commercial goods between Jordan and the occupied West Bank.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has given his support to begin efforts that culminate in a two-state solution in the Middle East.

""For Germany, the recognition of a Palestinian state is more likely to come at the end of the process,"" Wadephul said before departing for the UN General Assembly in New York.

""But this process must begin now,"" he emphasized.

Wadephul said the only way forward was for there to be an immediate end to fighting and for those still held hostage to be released.

""What the region needs now is an immediate ceasefire, significantly more humanitarian aid for the people in Gaza and the immediate, unconditional release of the hostages,"" Wadephul said.

The German diplomat also said any move by Israel to annex the occupied territories would threaten a peaceful solution: ""Any steps toward annexing occupied territories in violation of international law also undermine the chance of a lasting solution to the conflict.

""As far as it may seem at the moment, a negotiated two-state solution is the way to enable Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security and dignity,"" Wadephul said.

The German government has long advocated for this option, but has said it can only take place following a peace process.

Several countries are planning to recognize a Palestinian state at a summit at the United Nations headquarters in New York that is seeking to revive the two-state solution.

The UN summit ""for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution"" takes place ahead of the United Nations General Assembly, placing the matter firmly under the spotlight amid an intensified Israeli offensive in Gaza.

France's President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the UN conference jointly with Saudi Arabia, starting at 3 p.m. local time (1900 GMT), to promote the two-state solution.

""They want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them toward Hamas,"" Macron told CBS News's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

Macron said the move would help isolate Hamas, who led the attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023 in which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and over 250 were taken hostage.

Israeli military operations since then have killed over 65,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, in Gaza according to the Palestinian territory's Health Ministry.

The death toll, while not distinguishing between combatants and civilians killed, is considered reliable by the UN.

On Sunday, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia became the first major Western economies to recognize Palestinian statehood.
The move is facing strong opposition from the United States and Israel.

Israel's Foreign Ministry said the recognition moves do not ""promote peace, but on the contrary further destabilizes the region and undermines the chances of achieving a peaceful solution in the future.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Sunday that there would be no Palestinian state, and vowed to speed up the creation of new settlements.

Global leaders will meet at a United Nations conference in New York amid efforts to revive the two-state solution, with an increasing number of countries indicating that they will formally recognize a Palestinian state.

However, Israel and the US will not be attending, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing such a step as ""a reward for terror.""

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul will attend as a supporter of a two-state solution, although Berlin currently opposes formal recognition of Palestine, viewing it instead as the final step of a peace process.

Organizers estimated that around 130,000 turned out in Manila alone to protest alleged corruption over flood control projects. The protests were largely peaceful but police arrested 17 people after clashes.

Thousands of people in the Philippines took to the streets on Sunday to protest alleged corruption over bogus or substandard flood control projects.

Organizers estimated the turnout at around 130,000 people in the capital city of Manila alone, where protesters gathered at Luneta Park and the EDSA People Power Monument, which commemorates the mass uprising that ousted the father of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 1986.

Multiple politicians were in attendance at the rallies, some of which were even supported by the powerful Catholic Church.

""Our purpose is not to destabilize but to strengthen our democracy,"" said Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, the head of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines.

Authorities said they arrested 17 people who allegedly threw rocks at riot police and set fire to a barricade truck near the presidential palace.

A scandal has emerged in the Philippines after billions of dollars worth of flood-control projects were revealed to be either substandard or nonexistent, months after the country was ravaged by deadly monsoons.

The Department of Finance has estimated the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2 billion, €1.75 billion) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood control projects, while Greenpeace has suggested the number is actually closer to $18 billion.

Public outrage has grown in recent weeks after Ferdinand Marcos Jr. highlighted the scandal in a state of the nation address in July.

In September, the owners of a construction firm accused nearly 30 lawmakers and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials of taking cash payments.

Marcos said he did not blame the public ""one bit"" for protesting on Sunday but urged them to remain peaceful.

President Trump told the crowd at a Charlie Kirk memorial that the slain conservative activist was an American hero. Plus, a new $100,000 fee for skilled worker visa applications in the US sparks confusion. Follow DW.



US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk were among the speakers at Kirk's memorial service. 

The memorial on Sunday drew tens of thousands of people, including top members of the Trump administration and conservative celebrities. 

Plus, the White House clarified that a new $100,000 fee on visas for skilled workers only applies to new applicants and not to current visa holders.

Keep reading for the latest on Charlie Kirk's memorial service and other news related to the Trump administration on September 21:

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has urged the United States to stop insisting his country give up nuclear weapons as a recondition to resuming talks.

But in a speech on Sunday, Kim insisted that he will never trade away the nuclear arsenal to be free of sanctions, state KCNA media reported on Monday. 

Kim said that he had ""fond memories"" of US President Donald Trump, who he met three times during Trump's first presidency.

But if the US stopped what Kim called its ""absurd obsession with denuclearization, … there is no reason for us not to sit down with the United States,"" the North Korean leader was quoted as saying.

""The world already knows full well what the United States does after it makes a country give up its nuclear weapons and disarms,"" Kim said. ""We will never give up our nuclear weapons.""

North Korea has been under a series of economic sanctions and arms embargoes. 

But tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim has accelerated North Korea's weapons buildup and testing, aligned with Russia in the war in Ukraine and pledged deeper ties with China.

The Charlie Kirk memorial has wrapped up with a rousing rendition of ""America the Beautiful"" after Trump comforted Kirk's wife Erika on stage after his speech.

Giving a eulogy before Trump, Erika Kirk called for forgiveness for the man accused of shooting her husband. 

""I forgive him,"" said Erika Kirk. ""I forgive him because it was what Christ did and what Charlie would do. The answer to hate is not hate.""

This contrasted with words by Trump, who said Kirk ""was heinously murdered by a radicalized, cold-blooded monster."" 

Trump also used his speech to talk up his tariffs, boasted of his accomplishments and mock his predecessor, Joe Biden. 

He invited Erika Kirk back on stage at the end of the service, with the two exchanging a long hug as the music surged.

The memorial drew tens of thousands of mourners, including numerous senior figures in the Trump administration and conservative celebrities.

President Donald Trump called Charlie Kirk a ""martyr for American freedom"" as the memorial ceremony to commemorate the political activist wrapped up.

""Less than two weeks ago our country was robbed of one of the brightest lights of our times,"" Trump told the crowd. ""A giant of his generation and above all a devoted husband, father, son, Christian and patriot.""

""He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose,"" Trump said.  

""He's a martyr now for American freedom.""

Trump repeated that he would award Kirk a posthumous Presidential Medal.

Prominent speakers are paying tribute to Charlie Kirk, calling the right-wing activist a ""martyr"" whose work they must now advance.

""For Charlie, we will remember that it is better to stand on our feet defending the United States of America and defending the truth than it is to die on our knees,"" US Vice President JD Vance said. 

""My friends, for Charlie, we must remember that he is a hero to the United States of America. And he is a martyr for the Christian faith.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed that Kirk's voice ""inspired a movement."" 

His Turning Point USA movement told young Americans that the ""highest calling [was] to be in a successful marriage and raise productive children,"" Rubio said. 

""It also taught them that ours was not a great country, but the greatest most exceptional nation that has ever existed in the history of mankind.""

""He slayed ignorance,"" said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. ""He cut through lies.""  

An influential ally of US President Donald Trump, Kirk also attracted criticism because of his statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic.

FBI director Kash Patel has said the agency is looking at ""every facet"" of Charlie Kirk's killing.

In a post on X shortly before the memorial started, Patel said the FBI were investigating ""theories and questions."" 

These include ""the location from where the shot was taken, the possibility of accomplices, the text message confession and related conversations, Discord chats, the angle of the shot and bullet impact, how the weapon was transported, hand gestures observed as potential 'signals' near Charlie at the time of his assassination, and visitors to the alleged shooter's residence in the hours and days leading up to September 10, 2025.""

Patel it wasn't possible to release every piece of information to the public at the moment in order to protect the investigation. 

A 22-year old suspect was charged last week with murder, and prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty. 

A memorial service for the murdered right-wing influencer, Charlie Kirk, is underway at State Farm Stadium in Phoenix, Arizona. DW's Ines Pohl spoke with mourners gathering for the emotionally and politically charged event.

The Charlie Kirk memorial is about to begin with US President Donald Trump set to address tens of thousands of those in attendance.

Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead on a Utah campus on September 10.

The memorial service for Kirk has attracted tens of thousands of mourners, among them Vice President JD Vance and senior White House officials. 

Vance will speak at the event, as will Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.

""We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today,"" said Trump as he left the White House en route to Arizona.

The event is being held amid heightened security measures, with attendees reportedly being subjected to airport-style checks as they filed into the venue.

The US is on a ""path to a dictatorship,""  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday.

The New York Senator's remarks come a day after Donald Trump called for the Justice Department to take action against US president's foes.

Trump had urged the Justice Department on Saturday to take action against his perceived enemies.

Schumer told CNN that turning the agency ""into an instrument that goes after his enemies, whether they're guilty or not... is a real threat to democracy.""

Earlier this week, Trump suggested the licenses of TV networks that criticize him should be revoked.

A group of American lawmakers told China's Premier Li Qiang that both sides need to do more to ""break the ice"" during a rare visit to Beijing.

Delegation leader Adam Smith, a Democrat, said that both side were in agreement about the overarching aim of the visit.

""Certainly, trade and economy is on the top of the list ... (but also) we're very focused on our military-to-military conversations,"" he said in opening remarks.

The visit marked the first time a delegation from the US House of Representatives has visited China since 2019. In the meantime, high-ranking US officials have made multiple visits to Taiwan, angering Beijing.

""We need more of those types of exchanges, and we are hoping, to your words, that this will break the ice and we will begin to have more of these types of exchanges,"" Smith told Li.

Li also welcomed the engagement.

""It is important for our two countries to have more exchanges and cooperation, this is not only good for our two countries but also of great significance to the world,"" he said.

US President Donald Trump threatened Afghanistan of consequences if the Taliban-controlled country did not ""give Bagram Airbase back.""

""If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!"" the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.

The threat came just days after he proposed the idea of taking over the base once again while he was on a visit to the United Kingdom. US had left the base when its troops chaotically pulled out of Bagram in July 2021.

""We're trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,"" Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Responding to a question about sending US troops back to retake Bagram, Trump said, ""We won't talk about that, but we're talking now to Afghanistan, and we want it back and we want it back soon, right away. And if they don't do it, you're going ot find out what I'm going to do.""

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty have on several occasions raised concerns of systematic human rights abuses by US forces at Bagram, especially pertaining to detainees in Washington's ""War on Terror.""

US President Donald Trump on Saturday publicly urged the Justice Department to take action against his enemies, a move that critics say have crushed the institution's autonomy.

In an angry social media post addressing ""Pam"" (apparently Attorney General Pam Bondi) Trump called out the lack of legal action against California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats.

""We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,"" Trump said.

After firing Erik Siebert, the federal prosecutor who was overseeing the probe into James on Friday, Trump appointed his former attorney and White House aide Lindsey Halligan as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

""Pam Bondi is doing a GREAT job as Attorney General of the United States. She is very careful, very smart, loves our Country, but needs a tough prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, like my recommendation, Lindsey Halligan, to get things moving,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, announcing his decision.

The White House said that an agreement is likely to be signed with video platform TikTok in the coming days.

Details about TikTok's future in the United States ""have already been agreed upon,"" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told US broadcaster Fox on Sunday.

""Now we just need this deal to be signed and that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,"" Leavitt said.

TikTok's operations in the US have come under fire amid concerns about user data that critics of the app claim could be used by the Chinese government to influence public opinion and sway elections.

However, TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have rejected this.

Leavitt said that, under the deal, TikTok would be ""majority-owned by Americans in the United States. There will be seven seats on the board, that controls the app in the United States, and six of those seats will be Americans.""

""The data and privacy will be led by one of America's greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,"" Leavitt continued.

The killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has sent shockwaves through the US political landscape, galvanizing part of President Donald Trump's base.

Trump vowed to crack down on the ""radical left"" following Kirk's death, and also pledged to classify the ""Antifa"" movement as a terrorist organization.

Kirk, who Trump described as a ""martyr for truth,"" has also served as a rallying cry for far-right and right-wing populist parties around the world.

Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, blamed the death on the ""liberal-progressive left,"" declaring, ""We must stop the hate-mongering left!"", while Jordan Bardella of France's far-right National Rally spoke of a ""poison that eats at our democratic societies"" arising out of the ""dehumanising rhetoric of the left.""

Also in the aftermath of the killing, comedian Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was canceled by ABC after he suggested that the shooter may have been part of the ""MAGA"" Republican movement.

Trump has threatened to revoke broadcast licenses of TV stations he sees as adversarial towards his administration.

Other late-night comics have been particularly critical of the cancellation, with Stephen Colbert, whose own show will be discontinued in May 2026, referring to it as ""blatant censorship.""

India on Saturday expressed concern over US President Donald Trump's new plan to tighten US immigration policy by increasing application fees for H-1B visas that allow tech workers from India to work in the US.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs said Saturday that Trump's plan ""was being studied by all concerned, including by Indian industry.""

Skilled talent mobility and exchanges have contributed enormously to both the US and India, the statement said.

""Policy makers will therefore assess recent steps taking into account mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the two countries,"" it said.

The ministry warned that ""this measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families. Government hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities.""

Charlie Kirk was 31 years old when he was shot dead earlier this month. Here's what to know about his life and politics, as thousands of people prepare to gather to pay their respects at his memorial service.

“No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,” said the bill's sponsor.

The Trump administration says it will not comply with California's new law barring law enforcement officials from wearing masks, which goes into effect next year. Over the last several months, masked immigration officers have abducted people from courthouses, their cars, on the street, and at their workplaces. 

On September 20, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed the No Secret Police Act, which bars, with limited exceptions, local, state, and federal law enforcement officers from wearing “a facial covering that conceals or obscures their facial identity in the performance of their duties,” including a balaclava, tactical mask, gator, or ski mask. The prohibition does not apply to medical masks worn to prevent transmission of disease. Violation of the law is a misdemeanor and the officer is liable to the victim for no less than $10,000. 

California is the first state in the country to ban the practice, although similar legislation has been introduced in Illinois and New York, as well as at the federal level. 

“No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,” State Sen. Scott Wiener (D), the bill's sponsor, said in a statement. “As this authoritarian regime expands its reach into every aspect of daily life — including terrorizing people where they work, where they live, where they go to school, where they shop, where they seek health care — California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms.”

The Trump administration has indicated that it has no intention of complying with the legislation. 

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on X: “Good news for Americans and public safety: @ICEGov and @DHSgov law enforcement are part of the federal government. We don't need to abide by this garbage.”

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli posted on X that he had “directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations” and that “[o]ur agents will continue to protect their identities.”  

“The State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” Essayli said. “If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress.” 

The federal government is expected to challenge the law.

In an op-ed for the Sacramento Bee, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, argued that the legislation was constitutional. State and local governments, he wrote, “can require that federal employees comply with general laws unless doing so would significantly interfere with the performance of their duties.” 

“ICE agents wearing masks is meant to evoke the terror of being kidnapped,” he continued. “It serves no law enforcement purpose.”

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

PHILIP H. GORDON is the Sydney Stein, Jr., Scholar at the Brookings Institution. He was National Security Adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris and is the author of Losing the Long Game: The False Promise of Regime Change in the Middle East.

RYAN HASS is a Senior Fellow, Director of the John L. Thornton China Center, and Chen-Fu and Cecilia Yen Koo Chair in Taiwan Studies in the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution.

 The Island Remains Secure and Stable—for Now

 Philip H. Gordon and Ryan Hass

Over the past several years, few topics in international relations have gotten more attention than a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan. And for good reason: China has never given up its claim to the island; it is in the middle of one of the largest military buildups in history; it conducts regular incursions into Taiwan's airspace and maritime zones; and its president, Xi Jinping, has directed his military leadership to develop the capacity to conquer Taiwan by 2027 should he give the order to do so, according to senior U.S. government officials. For anyone skeptical that such an attack could take place in the twenty-first century, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was a sharp reminder that major war over territory is not a thing of the past. Russian President Vladimir Putin seized what he thought was an opportunity to take back what he considered a wayward territory that was slipping away. Sooner or later, Xi could very well try to do the same.

Other factors have also contributed to growing anxiety about Taiwan's future. Few doubt that China would try to use force to seize Taiwan militarily if it felt all other options to prevent permanent separation had been exhausted, but Beijing's strong preference would be to take it over peacefully—with the island's economy, technology, and human capital still intact. To achieve that goal, China is using a combination of relentless propaganda, infiltration, and military pressure to undercut U.S. support for Taiwan and to persuade Taiwan's residents that they have little choice but to accept a political accommodation that recognizes Taiwan as part of China's sovereign territory.

The past two months have produced growing concerns that Beijing is making progress on this front. Taiwan's politicians have inflamed partisan divisions with rhetoric accusing one another of undermining Taiwan's security, Taiwan's ruling party pushed a failed “recall” of opposition members that deeply divided the population, and President Lai Ching-te's popularity is collapsing. Taiwan's dealings with the United States, meanwhile, have become trickier. The Trump administration has refused Lai's routine transit through the United States, postponed efforts to reach a trade deal with Taiwan, halted some planned arms deliveries, and expressed harsh criticism about Taiwan's defense spending. Washington has also loosened high-tech export controls on China, which suggests that President Donald Trump puts a higher priority on reaching a trade deal and improving relations with Beijing than on steadfast support for Taiwan. The pessimism about Taiwan's future was best exemplified in August, when an article by a former Trump administration official went viral in Taiwan. It was called “How Taiwan Lost Trump.”

Concerns about Taiwan's future are understandable—but they are also overblown. Unlike many other U.S. partners that are worried about their futures, Taiwan has valuable cards to play. It is far less divided internally than its rough-and-tumble politics might suggest, and its democracy and civil society are robust. It is also home to the world's most advanced technologies, and its economy remains strong and resilient. Precisely because of those strengths, the island is finally making progress on the defense reforms and increased expenditures that will reduce its vulnerabilities to China even if U.S. support diminishes. If Taiwan plays those cards right, it can continue to prosper—and thwart Chinese military or political designs.

No one should underestimate the military threat Beijing poses to Taiwan, and few in Taiwan do. Especially since the summer of 2022, when then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China has been establishing what experts call a “new normal” in the Taiwan Strait. This has included more frequent air and naval crossings over the centerline of the strait, multiple live-fire encirclement exercises to simulate a blockade scenario, unprecedented missile tests over the island, and regular intrusions of Taiwan's air defense identification zone. Meanwhile, and in large part to deter the United States from getting directly involved in a conflict over Taiwan, Beijing has acquired more hypersonic and antiship missiles as well as ballistic missiles, doubled its nuclear weapons inventory over the past five years, and dramatically increased the size and capability of its navy.

But Taiwan has not been standing still. Over the past several years, Taiwan's political and military leadership has agreed to an asymmetric defensive strategy and aligned the Taiwanese military's doctrine, force structure, and spending decisions around it. Largely gone are the days of overinvesting in expensive, high-end military capabilities to confront Chinese forces at the centerline of the Taiwan Strait. Now, Taiwan is concentrating resources on making the island the equivalent of a porcupine—prickly to touch and impossible to swallow. Taiwan's defense innovations are also being turbocharged by lessons drawn from Ukraine's resistance to Russia. This includes launching a whole-of-society resilience campaign, simulating realistic scenarios of Chinese military attacks in defense training, expanding public participation in civil defense, and simulating responses to cyberattacks and gray-zone threats. In 2022, Taiwan formed the All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency to better integrate reserve forces for defense. Taiwan's defense leaders also are training and empowering field commanders to take initiative rather than wait for centralized directives.

Taiwan is retiring legacy systems, such as Cold War–era fighter jets and tanks, and instead deploying a variety of modern capabilities, such as HIMARS multiple-launch rocket systems and NASAMS 3 air defense systems, which have been effective in Ukraine. American companies and Taiwanese entities also are pursuing novel new partnerships to marry American defense innovation with Taiwan's world-class advanced manufacturing. Joint arms production is rapidly expanding. Advanced defense technology firms are working with Taiwan to expand the island's access to cutting-edge capabilities, such as loitering munitions, sea mines, unmanned aerial systems, unmanned surface vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and electronic warfare and communications equipment. There also is consensus across Taiwan's political spectrum to increase defense spending: Lai has pledged to lift defense spending to more than three percent of GDP next year and more than five percent by 2030.



Taiwan must follow up on these pledges, and further reforms are needed, with more urgency, to consolidate its defense preparedness. But it is moving in the right direction.

The United States and its partners also have taken steps to thwart China's military designs on Taiwan. In recent years, Washington has, for the first time, provided military aid to Taiwan by drawing directly from existing U.S. weapons stockpiles—a method previously reserved for urgent support to allies in active conflict. And it has authorized Taiwan for foreign military financing, which provides grants and loans so Taiwan can purchase American-made defense equipment. The United States and its partners—including Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam—are also advancing a “dispersal strategy” across the Pacific to support power projection from multiple sites, and the United States is pre-positioning munitions and other asymmetric capabilities at bases across the region to augment deterrence. Many of these regional partners are also building up their own advanced force projection capabilities and working more closely with Taipei on upholding freedom of navigation and maritime security.

Finally, for all Beijing's formidable and growing military strength, it still confronts important internal challenges. Many of China's top military officials have been purged during Xi's third term on charges of corruption or disloyalty. As Jonathan Czin and John Culver have written in Foreign Affairs, Xi does not have the military he wants and does not seem to trust that the military he has would deliver on his directives.

Taiwan is also better prepared for a Chinese infiltration campaign than many realize—including those in Beijing. China is devoting considerable resources to influence public opinion in Taiwan, including through cyberattacks, propaganda, acquisitions of Taiwanese media companies, and the use of social media platforms such as TikTok—all of which are designed to co-opt Taiwan residents with sympathies toward Beijing to promote eventual unification. China's goal is to induce the people of Taiwan to conclude that resistance is futile and thus consent to unification. But there is little evidence that these efforts are working.

The reason is simple. Very few people in Taiwan are susceptible to Chinese propaganda. Even as they are divided along partisan lines, Taiwan's public is unified and consistent in its strong opposition to communism and its desire to protect Taiwan's sovereignty and democratic norms. In fact, the more aggressive Beijing has become toward Taiwan, the more Beijing has repelled rather than attracted the people of Taiwan. As Lev Nachman and Wei-Ting Yen wrote in Foreign Affairs, “Many of Beijing's efforts to scare Taiwanese citizens invoke more cringe than panic.”

According to recent public opinion polls, over 90 percent of people in Taiwan feel either “Taiwanese” (63 percent) or “both Taiwanese and Chinese” (30 percent) as opposed to less than five percent who feel “Chinese.” The vast majority support upholding the cross-strait status quo, compared with less than eight percent who want unification with China “as soon as possible” (two percent) or even eventually (six percent), leaving Beijing little to work with. There is no doubt that Chinese efforts at infiltration combined with military pressure—such as cyberattacks or a naval blockade under the guise of customs enforcement—would be a major challenge to Taiwan, but such measures could just as easily foment hostility toward Beijing as weaken Taiwanese resolve.

The degree of polarization in Taiwanese politics can also be exaggerated. There are examples of troubling rhetoric, including Lai's recent reference to hammering “impurities” out of Taiwan's political system and an opposition politician's comparison of some of Lai's actions to “those of Nazi Germany.” But take a step back and Taiwan's politics appear rather consensual on the big issues. None of Taiwan's three main political parties—Lai's Democratic Progressive Party, the opposition Kuomintang, and Taiwan People's Party—support unification with Beijing. All are pro-democracy and anticommunist, all want to maintain ties with the United States, and none support immediate independence. The main distinction among the parties is over how best to preserve the cross-strait status quo, not whether to do so. The three parties agree on virtually all domestic issues, with the exceptions of nuclear energy and the death penalty. On most issues, their differences are more about personalities than ideology.

Compared with Taiwan's past and other advanced democracies today, Taiwan's politics are rather tame. Far from descending into deepening partisan divisions, Taiwan may be moving toward a new political equilibrium. Leaders of all three major parties acknowledge that they will need to compromise to move forward a special defense budget, which they all view as critical for Taiwan's security. There also appears to be a cross-partisan consensus that now is not a time to test global tolerance for Taiwan's independence but rather a moment to show Taiwan as a contributor to regional stability.

Given the stakes for Taiwan, which are nothing short of existential, complacency is not an option. To sustain its way of life in the face of China's rapidly expanding national power, Taiwan's leaders will need to act with urgency and shared purpose to shore up vulnerabilities. A path remains open for them to do so.

First and most important, Taiwan's leaders will need to adequately resource their national defense and resilience. This will require compromise among leaders who prioritize raising compensation for career soldiers and extending the service of conscripts and those who favor fielding new military capabilities. Taiwan also will need to make additional investments in mobile strike weapons, such as mobile rocket launchers, man-portable air defense missiles, and air defense systems. Small, expendable unmanned systems and mines could add a critical layer of defense while redundant communication networks and hardened cybersecurity infrastructure will bolster resilience. Pre-positioning munitions, as well as stockpiles of energy, medical, and food supplies, also could help disabuse Chinese leaders of the notion that Taiwan can be taken quickly and cheaply. All these steps are not only critical to Taiwan's ability to defend itself but also will help shield Taiwan from U.S. criticism that it is not pulling its own weight.

Taiwan also has an advantage that virtually every other American partner could only wish for: its economic strength, which can serve as the foundation for national security. By producing roughly 95 percent of the world's most advanced semiconductor chips, Taiwan's companies enjoy a monopoly position in the world economy. With the AI revolution taking off, Taiwan's centrality to global markets will only grow. This gives Taiwan the fiscal space to steadily increase defense spending and present it as a win for Trump.



It also means leading companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company can make investments in the United States that the Trump administration wants without compromising its competitive position. Even with major investments in plants in Germany, Japan, and the United States, TSMC's facilities in Taiwan still produce between 80 and 90 percent of the company's total chip output. There simply is no alternative anywhere in the world to the leading-edge chips that Taiwan's top companies produce. This means the United States will have an abiding interest in Taiwan's security for many years to come, even if the traditional democratic underpinnings of the U.S.-Taiwanese relationship continue to weaken under Trump's transactional presidency.

TSMC's dominance of the global chip market creates a position of strength for Taiwan that other countries can only envy. When word got out that the Trump administration was thinking of demanding part ownership of technology companies that take U.S. subsidies (as it did for Intel), TSMC made clear it would rather forgo the subsidies than dilute its ownership—and Trump backed down. When the time comes to finalize a U.S.-Taiwanese trade and tariff deal, TSMC's investments in the United States will provide leverage to Taiwan.

In short, by increasing defense spending, investing in the United States, and making a case that Taiwan is a steady partner in sustaining peace and stability in a key global hotspot, Taiwan has strong cards to play in managing relations with Trump. None of this, of course, provides a foolproof hedge against the risk of Trump making concessions on Taiwan in exchange for a trade deal or a better relationship with Xi. Successive Chinese leaders have sought and failed to get American leaders to take such a deal. Xi almost certainly will try to do so with Trump when they meet as planned this fall. He could ask Trump for commitments to reduce arms sales to Taiwan or to make clear officially that the United States opposes Taiwan's independence and supports eventual unification—and Trump might be tempted to do so to get the deal he covets.

But even in this scenario, Taiwan still retains significant agency and ample resources to shape its own future. Taiwan faces serious threats from China, growing uncertainty from Washington, and internal divisions. But there is every reason to believe that its leaders and people are well placed, if they make the right choices, to ensure it continues to not just survive but thrive.

 How Common Cause Against Russia Enabled an American Deal

 Thomas de Waal

On August 8, U.S. President Donald Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House for what Trump touted as a “historic peace summit.” As with the president's unsuccessful high-profile efforts to broker a truce between Russia and Ukraine, this might have seemed an extravagant overbilling. After all, for more than 30 years, the two South Caucasus countries have been implacable adversaries. They have fought two wars, and their populations are steeped in mutually opposing historical narratives. Just two years ago, Azerbaijan decisively seized control of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee.

Yet in this case, as much by luck as by skill, Trump may have pulled off something of great significance. After months of bilateral talks between the two countries, the moment was ripening for a provisional peace accord. Crucially, both sides did not want Russia, the traditional regional hegemon, to serve as the guarantor of a deal, which made Trump's offer to host a peace summit especially attractive. If you are going to break pledges you made to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Oval Office is a good place to do so.

At the White House, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed a brief but meaningful statement agreeing to avoid further conflict. They also initialed but did not sign a 17-point text of what observers are calling a “peace agreement” that normalizes diplomatic and political relations after years of conflict. And they jointly approved a plan for a new road-and-rail connection linking Azerbaijan with Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani exclave bordered by Armenia, Iran, and Turkey. Armenia has given development rights to this 27-mile transportation corridor across its territory to an American company while maintaining sovereign control of the passage, which is to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, and Azerbaijan will be given “unimpeded access” to and from Nakhichevan. Notably, the TRIPP plan supersedes a 2020 agreement between Aliyev, Pashinyan, and Putin that would have granted Russia control of the route.

For different reasons, both the Azerbaijani government in Baku and its Armenian counterpart in Yerevan are keen to free themselves from Moscow's grip. The Trump administration, for its part, is eager to sponsor a deal, in part because of potential commercial benefit for the United States but more because a lasting peace deal will burnish Trump's claim to be a global peacemaker. But the peace framework reached at the White House in August is still fragile. It will succeed only if the United States follows through on implementing the TRIPP and helping reopen other routes shut down by the conflict. To do so, it must work with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey to finance and build other links in an east-west transport chain across all three countries, which would make the Trump road an international highway and not just a local project.

The United States will also need to work closely with the European Union, which is investing far more in the South Caucasus, both politically and financially, than Washington. European support will be crucial in making a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan stick. Moscow, naturally, would like to see the U.S.-brokered rapprochement between Baku and Yerevan fail. But if Washington and its European partners stay engaged to implement the complicated transit accord and tackle the obstacles that domestic and foreign actors will inevitably raise, the South Caucasus could finally break out of a cycle of conflict that has held it back for decades.

The deal sketched out in the White House reflects Azerbaijan's emergence as the dominant player in the South Caucasus. This new reality first started to take shape after the second Nagorno-Karabakh war, which was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan over 44 days in 2020. After years of diplomatic stalemate, Azerbaijan resumed its fight with Armenia that year and managed to reclaim all the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh that it had lost in the 1990s. When Moscow brokered a cease-fire to the 2020 war, Nagorno-Karabakh itself remained a de-facto autonomous Armenian-controlled entity, but it was now dependent for its security on a newly deployed Russian peacekeeping force.

In 2023, however, with Armenia unable to defend the exclave and Russia distracted by its war in Ukraine, Azerbaijani forces took the opportunity to seize Nagorno-Karabakh. Almost overnight, the entire remaining Armenian population there fled. In the wake of this battlefield victory, Aliyev, who has been Azerbaijan's strongman president since 2003, negotiated with Armenia on a peace agreement but seemed to be in no hurry to conclude it, confident that his country had the upper hand in the regional balance of power.

Throughout his tenure, Aliyev has skillfully managed relations with Russia, which historically has long been an ally of Armenia. In 2022, he signed an interstate agreement with Putin just two days before the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine. In August 2024, Putin even visited Azerbaijan on a state visit. But since then, Baku's relations with Moscow have sharply deteriorated. In the last nine months especially, Aliyev has grown more wary of Russia and more inclined to pursue peace with Armenia.

Problems began in December, when a Russian antiaircraft missile mistakenly shot down an Azerbaijani passenger plane, killing 38 civilians. When Putin did not apologize, Aliyev issued an unusually blunt rebuke, asserting that Moscow had tried to “hush up” the issue. Then, this summer, Putin put Sergei Kiriyenko, a Kremlin hard-liner who has spearheaded the Kremlin's policy of integrating occupied regions of Ukraine into Russia, in charge of relations with the South Caucasus countries. In what looked like a deliberate provocation, police in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg rounded up local Azerbaijanis in June and accused them of crimes that were two decades old. Two Azerbaijanis ended up dead. Aliyev responded with fury, canceling Russian official visits and cultural events and leading a media campaign that accused Russia of neoimperialism. All of this signals that the Azerbaijani leader is now determined to keep Moscow out of any new regional settlement.



Notably, Armenia also has a Russia problem, which makes for a tactical convergence of interests with Azerbaijan. Since tsarist times, Russia has ensured Armenia's loyalty by promising to defend it against the Ottoman Empire (and then against its successor, Turkey) with sustained military support. But of late, Moscow has repeatedly failed to come to Armenia's aid, such as when it declined to honor its treaty commitment to defend Armenia when Azerbaijan staged a cross-border incursion into the country in 2022. Pashinyan, increasingly skeptical about Moscow's credibility as an ally, suspended Armenia's participation in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russian-led security bloc, in 2024. Instead, he has reached out to the United States and Europe for support. In January, shortly before Trump took office, the Armenian government signed a strategic partnership agreement with the Biden administration promising closer political and commercial ties, and the Armenian parliament adopted legislation in March calling on the government to begin seeking membership in the EU.

This led Russia to take ever more blatant steps to destabilize the Pashinyan government. In June, Pashinyan announced that a plot had been foiled to oust his administration. The Armenian authorities did not blame Moscow directly, but a leading Russian Armenian businessman in Yerevan, Samvel Karapetyan, was arrested. In an even more sensational development, two Armenian bishops with links to Russia were detained. The government publicized evidence of the plot, including a cache of weapons that had been found.

Pashinyan's willingness to confront the Armenian church, which has traditionally been close to Moscow, is a sign of how far he is willing to go to break Armenia's historic dependence on Russia. Shared defiance of Moscow thus spurred the two leaders into a rapprochement at a moment when Russian capacity in the Caucasus is checked by the war in Ukraine. The diplomatic overtures from Washington were therefore especially welcome. For Aliyev, a leader who is tightening domestic control and shutting down international organizations, Trump's offer of a “strategic partnership” with the United States—something that the Biden administration always made conditional on Baku's improving its worsening human rights record—is a gift. There was no demand from the White House at the August meeting that Baku release Azerbaijani political prisoners or Armenian detainees from custody. Indeed, the day before the meeting with Pashinyan, the U.S. oil giant ExxonMobil signed a bilateral agreement with the Azerbaijani state energy company SOCAR.

Much work needs to be done to make the deals made in Washington a reality. The 17-point agreement initialed by the two leaders is the key to normalizing relations and formally ending conflict. Important as it is, it is not a comprehensive peace deal between two warring nations. There is nothing in the text about the right of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians on both sides to return home. There is no accountability process for war crimes committed over decades of fighting. While talking peace at an elite level, Azerbaijan also keeps a young Azerbaijani peace activist, Bahruz Samadov, in prison—on charges of “treason” for having had contact with Armenian civil society activists.

The treaty could yet fail because Aliyev has said he will not sign and ratify it until Armenia changes its constitution to remove an indirect reference to its union with Nagorno-Karabakh. Changing the constitution would require a referendum that Pashinyan will probably try to push through before or after Armenia's next parliamentary election, scheduled for June 2026. That gives Pashinyan's nationalist and pro-Russian opponents a double target to mobilize voters against: a prime minister seeking a new term and a peace deal they want to sabotage.

The pact on a corridor connecting Azerbaijan and its exclave of Nakhichevan is also vulnerable. Baku and Yerevan have yet to agree on key details, such as the location of the new road and what security arrangements are needed for it. Exactly how the agreement will both enable Azerbaijani traffic to cross Armenia territory “unimpeded” while Armenian sovereignty is respected remains unclear.



And precisely because this slice of territory has such strategic and emotional value to so many, there is an incentive for spoilers to wreck a solution that they do not like. Iran, whose northern border runs from Nakhichevan to Armenia and then to Azerbaijan, is likely not pleased with the peace agreement. Tehran wants to maintain its current status as the transit country between the two parts of Azerbaijan and has consistently opposed any new arrangements that would station Western security forces along the route to Nakhichevan or hand too much control to its two unfriendly Turkic neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey. So far Iran's threats have been toothless, but that could change if its trucks and trains are cut out of a U.S.-run route.

The Kremlin could also try to stymie the Washington agreements. Russia still attaches strategic importance to this stretch of territory, since it had been pledged control of it after the 2020 war. Moscow believed that it would station Russian border troops along the route, win leverage over both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and secure a missing piece for its International North-South Transport Corridor, a long-sought road, rail, and sea project connecting Russia to the Persian Gulf. So far, the Kremlin's reaction to the accords has been cool and dismissive rather than openly confrontational. Moscow—and Tehran—will be cautious about openly disrupting a route that bears the name of the U.S president. But they will look for opportunities to discredit the deal if Armenia and Azerbaijan cannot agree on key details, or actively disrupt it when the Trump presidency is over.

The third neighbor in the region, Turkey, is a special case. Although it supports peace in the region and badly wants to see new transport routes across the South Caucasus to Central Asia, the fact that U.S. officials barely consulted their Turkish counterparts about the TRIPP went down badly in Ankara. This was unfortunate because Ankara has the biggest card to promote regional peace: it has the power to normalize relations and open its land border with Armenia, closed since 1993, which would free Armenia from a geographical straitjacket. On September 12, Turkey sent its envoy to Yerevan and announced new confidence-building measures, but in deference to its close ally Azerbaijan, it has prevaricated on declaring a full breakthrough. Meanwhile, U.S.-Turkish relations remain strained. A new line of diplomacy between Washington and Ankara is needed to reassure the Turkish side that it will benefit from the Trump route and U.S. plans for the region.

For decades, “historic” breakthroughs have been reported in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, only to see the two countries slip back into conflict. The Trump deal could suffer the same fate. For one thing, a whole generation of Armenians and Azerbaijanis has grown up shaped by the conflict. Politicians in both countries have instrumentalized the hostility to win legitimacy, selectively playing up grievances with the other side.

To his credit, Pashinyan—driven at first by dire circumstances, it seems, but now by what looks like genuine conviction—has set out to change this paradigm. Even if it requires major concessions, he is seeking agreements with both Azerbaijan and Turkey that will enable him to open up his country's borders and finally allow Armenia to loosen its dependence on Russia and become a self-sufficient nation-state. Aliyev needs a peace deal much less, having achieved almost all of what he wants on the battlefield. But he also seems persuaded, at least for now, that it is in his interests to support the embattled Armenian leader rather than see Armenia fall back under Russian dominance.



The current chaotic geopolitical landscape fuels contrary trends in the South Caucasus. On the one hand, the decline of multilateral institutions and European liberal norms made the three regional powers—Iran, Russia, and Turkey—more assertive. In 2021, they devised a “3 + 3” format to assert their right as the new shapers of order in the region. But as far as the other three in this equation—Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia—are concerned, the mightier three powers are also former imperial hegemons with outdated historical claims. That shared suspicion has in turn driven another trend: the aspiration of all three South Caucasus countries—an overdue aspiration, some would say, more than 30 years after they won independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union—to build strategically autonomous nation-states that are not reliant on any one external power.

This is where Trump can be an asset. The advantage of having the United States as a peace broker is that it is both powerful and disengaged from the region. Washington has the capacity to end Moscow's claim to be the region's arbiter—an instrument the Russians have used for years to try to exert control over both Armenia and Azerbaijan. At the same time, the days are over when the United States had a more ambitious agenda for this region, as when U.S. President George W. Bush visited Tbilisi and called Georgia a model “beacon of liberty.”

Trump enjoyed the flattering words of Aliyev and Pashinyan at the White House and their professed enthusiasm to jointly nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, but he has evidently has not devoted much attention to the South Caucasus. Indeed, soon after the White House meeting, he failed to pronounce the names of the two countries he had mediated between, calling them “Albania” and “Aberbaijan.”

Even so, Trump's backing gives Baku and Yerevan the courage to stand up to Moscow. Having brokered a provisional agreement between Baku and Yerevan—and lent his name to a crucial new transit corridor—Trump now needs to understand that he cannot do this on his own. Rather, he must invest in more old-fashioned American diplomacy to help bring lasting peace to the region.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Rural health clinics are closing after Trump's ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,' raising the legislation's political risks","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/politics/rural-healthcare-one-big-beautiful-bill","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 10:00:05 GMT","


            Exactly two months after President Donald Trump signed his policy megabill in a July 4 celebration at the White House, a Virginia health care company blamed the law for the closure of three rural clinics serving communities along the Blue Ridge Mountains.
    


            The closures, Augusta Medical Group said in its statement, were part of the company's “ongoing response to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the resulting realities for healthcare delivery.”
    


            Rural health providers that rely on Medicaid funding were already under strain before the bill cut federal health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. Now, Democrats are linking that crisis to Trump and Republicans in elections this year and next.
    


            Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger recently campaigned in Buena Vista, a 6,600-person town that is losing its clinic, as she tries to improve her party's standing with rural voters ahead of this fall's election. Candidates for governor, potentially faced with the job of navigating the cuts, have been among the most vocal about the threats to rural health care, including Keisha Lance Bottoms in Georgia, Rob Sand in Iowa, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York and former Biden administration Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in New Mexico.
    


            “Rural hospitals are closing, at the end of the day. We're seeing the tip of the iceberg here in Virginia, and it's a sign of what's to come,” said Marshall Cohen, a veteran Democratic strategist at the political firm KMM Strategies.
    


            Ken Nunnenkamp, executive director of the Virginia GOP, pushed back on criticism of the Augusta Health closures in a statement to CNN. Augusta Health, which declined to comment beyond its statement, noted in its announcement that patients at two of the clinics could be reassigned to other facilities less than 10 miles away and that it would use a mobile clinic to serve people affected by the third closure.
    


            “If two health clinics consolidate in order to provide better, more consistent, and more accessible service to the patients from both locations, that is a win for rural communities,” Nunnenkamp said in a statement.
    


            Under the legislation, Medicaid spending is set to fall by more than $900 billion over the next 10 years, according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. About 7.5 million more people would be uninsured in 2034 due to the policy changes, with 5.3 million of them being affected by the addition of work requirements for many low-income adult enrollees, according to the CBO's most recent analysis.
    


            The work requirements are likely to affect rural communities more, said Tim Layton, an associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia, because it's harder for residents in those communities to find employment.
    


            “You can expect those places to be impacted by now having people who don't even have Medicaid,” Layton said. “With fewer people to spread fixed costs across, it becomes harder and harder to stay open.”
    


            Rural health care providers disproportionately rely on Medicaid enrollees. They were already struggling with limited patient pools and long-term population loss.
    


            Researchers at the University of North Carolina, cited in a letter by Democratic senators opposing the GOP legislation, identified 338 rural health facilities nationwide endangered by the policy changes, including six total in Virginia.
    


            Candice Crow, a mother of four children who have autism, heavily relies on the Bon Secours - Southampton Medical Center in Franklin, Virginia, one of the facilities on the researchers' list. She's been raising concerns with local media and spoke to CNN.
    


            “The staff there are so kind and caring. They do go above and beyond. They're very accommodating for the special needs children and all their little medical complexities that they have,” Crow said. “Every minute counts when it comes to emergencies. This could cost someone their life, so you're taking away their lifeline.”
    


            To alleviate the impact of the cuts, Republicans in Washington created a $50 billion fund for rural health providers, inviting “all 50 states to apply for funding to address each state's specific rural health challenges.”
    


            “If we invest this money wisely, we won't just have health care systems barely hanging on in rural America,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “They'll start to thrive.”
    


            Nunnenkamp, the Virginia Republicans' executive director, called the fund “effectively the largest investment in rural hospitals in decades.” US Rep. Ben Cline, the Republican representing Virginia's 6th District, which includes the three closed clinics, also pointed to the fund and defended his vote for the bill.
    


            “Provisions like work requirements to root out waste, fraud, and abuse do not take effect until December 2026 or later. By making these reforms in cooperation with our health care providers, we can ensure that all Americans, especially those in rural areas, receive the high-quality health care they deserve,” Cline said in a statement.
    


            Layton said the rural health care fund was a “short-term patch,” noting that “$50 billion will go pretty quick.”
    


            The Kaiser Family Foundation, a national nonprofit focused on health policy, wrote in a July study that “federal Medicaid spending in rural areas is estimated to decline by $137 billion, more than the $50 billion appropriated for the rural health fund.”
    


            Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, has also proposed tapping the state's rainy day fund to help cover additional funding.
    


            “We want to make sure that whatever happens with Medicaid, we have the money here to help. We have the money and the budget to help. You know, we have put money aside for rainy day,” Sears said at an event in Marion, according to a report from Cardinal News. “The bank account has never been that full. And so we are ready for any changes that happen.”
    


            Spanberger says that rainy day fund – which outgoing GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin said last month held $4.7 billion – won't be enough.
    


            “This is not a rainy day. This is a bad bill that came out of Washington,” Spanberger said on the first day of early voting in Virginia at an event in Fairfax on Friday. “They are throwing those costs on the state, and in the interim, people will fall off of their health care, so the problem is immense.”
    


            Pete Barlow is a Democrat running to unseat Cline and lives in Augusta County, where two of the affected clinics are. “This administration has really taken a bloody ax to rural health care. It's incredible, and it's going to have downstream effects for years to come,” Barlow told CNN.
    


            He says that as he speaks to people in the community, they don't always immediately “connect the dots” about why they are losing services, but it's a recipe for eventually breeding deep frustration. “How is it making America great again for us to be cutting our rural health care? It blows me away,” he said.
    


            Lynlee Thorne, political director of Rural GroundGame, a group supporting Democratic candidates in Virginia, said Democrats are “willing to listen” as they engage with rural voters on the policy changes. According to CNN exit polls, Trump won two-thirds of rural voters in the 2024 election.
    


            “We're not simply coming in to tell people that they're going to be hurt, and we're not just pointing to bar graphs and charts to make our case through big numbers, but we're saying we care enough about you to be here and to hear how this is going to impact you,” Thorne said.
    


            The conversation doesn't stop there, she added.
    


            “We also need to talk about what it is we're going to do for people, how we're going to fight to fill that gap,” Thorne said.

Live Updates


            • France is expected to recognize the state of Palestine during a summit later today in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized Palestine yesterday.
    


            • US President Donald Trump will speak at the UN General Assembly tomorrow. The US remains vehemently opposed to the recognition of statehood and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


            • At least 50 Palestinians were killed yesterday in Israeli strikes on Gaza and the war has overall killed more than 65,000 people, according to the enclave's health ministry.
    


            Israel's deepening ground offensive in the Gaza City area has shut two hospitals, according to an aid group and the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
    


            The hospitals in Gaza City were forced to shut down Monday due to Israel's escalating military offensive, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
    


            CNN has contacted the Israeli military for comment on the closures.
    


            Continuous fire from Israeli quadcopters has made access to Al-Rantisi Children's Hospital and the Specialized Eye Hospital in the territory's largest city “impossible,” UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians said Monday.
    


                    “It is worth noting that Al-Rantisi Hospital was directly bombed a few days ago, causing extensive damage,” the ministry of health added in a statement. “There are no safe roads to all facilities and hospitals that enable patients and the wounded to reach them.”
                





            The Israeli military has also targeted and destroyed a high-rise building housing a medical relief center in the city, MAP said.
    


An intensifying campaign: Israel is attempting to take control of Gaza City, which it says is a Hamas stronghold. The Israel Defense Forces says more than 300,000 Palestinians have left Gaza City since it ordered civilians to evacuate.
    


            Newly confirmed US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz took the chair in the UN Security Council today to speak out against Russia's repeated incursions of NATO territory and urged Moscow to “negotiate directly with Ukraine” to end the war.
    


            In remarks at an emergency meeting of the UN body after Russian jets entered Estonian airspace, Waltz said the United States and its allies “will defend every inch of NATO territory.”
    


                    “This event, following on the heels of the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, creates the impression that Russia either wants to escalate and pull more countries into this conflict with Ukraine, or doesn't have full control of those who operate its fighter planes and drones,” he said. “Either scenario is very disconcerting, given that Russia is obviously a nuclear power with global reach.”
                





            Waltz, who was confirmed on Friday and sworn in on Saturday, urged Russia “as a permanent member of this Council, to uphold international peace and security, to respect the sovereignty of its neighbors, to cease violating their airspace.”
    


            Tens of thousands of protesters marched in more than 80 cities across Italy on Monday in support of Palestinians.
    


            The demonstrators have called for a halt to the flow of weapons to Israel through Italian ports, as well as demanding that the Italian government join countries like the UK, Portugal, Australia and Canada that have recently recognized a Palestinian state.
    

Tens of thousands of protesters marched in more than 80 cities across Italy on Monday in support of Palestinians.


            Palestinians in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem offered mixed opinions about the future after Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized a Palestinian state yesterday. France is expected to do likewise later today.
    


                    “It's futile. On the ground, nothing is changing. It's like they're making a fool out of us. It has no benefit,” Kamal Abu Kweidar, a Palestinian shopkeeper, told CNN. “We hope that it will lead to something good, but it feels impossible.”
                





            Another shopkeeper, Ishaq Hijzai, told CNN that Palestinians are “peace-loving people” but the situation on the ground is going “from bad to worse.”
    


                    “We used to live peacefully and in safety with Jews in the past. Today, there is no peace and no safety… From what I see, it is impossible to recognize a Palestinian state and it is impossible for a Palestinian state to exist at all,” Hijzai said.
                





            Meanwhile, Khaled Shweiki thanked those European nations who have moved to recognize a state of Palestine.
    


                    “We appreciate the countries recognizing us and supporting us – all those turning out on the streets in solidarity with the Palestinian cause and with the Gaza Strip, which is experiencing tragedy,” Shweiki said. “We are here, regardless of if all nations or no nations recognize us. At the end of the day, we are here,” Shweiki added.
                





            Luxembourg's Prime Minister Luc Frieden has been speaking to CNN today. He says that the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict needs a “second chance,” as his country prepares to announce formal recognition of the state of Palestine later today.
    


            “The only way forward is to make sure that now the two-state solution gets new energy (and) a second chance,” Frieden said.
    


            Luxembourg is set to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, along with France, Belgium, Malta and San Marino.
    


            Speaking from New York, Frieden stressed Luxembourg's decision did not show hostility toward Israel but was taken to oppose the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            He added that the rules-based international order established by the UN 80 years ago is under threat.
    


                    “We are not taking any decision against Israel. We are taking decisions against the actions of Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, with which we disagree, because those actions are against a rules-based international order.”
                


                    Luxembourg Prime Minister Luc Frieden
                


            “We believe that it is extremely important that we re-establish international law. Obviously, what's going on now in Gaza is a violation of international humanitarian law,” he added.
    


            Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the UK, Canada and Australia's recognition of Palestine by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


            “I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said yesterday.
    


            The Israeli leader said despite immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, he has prevented the establishment of what he called a “terror state” for years.
    


            “We did so with determination, and with diplomatic wisdom. All the more so, we have doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria — and we will continue on this path,” he said, deploying the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank.
    


            “The response to the latest attempt to force a terror state upon us in the heart of our land will be given after my return from the United States. Wait for it,” Netanyahu added.
    


            Tens of thousands of protesters have marched in more than 80 Italian cities today after unions called for a nationwide strike in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
    


            The demonstrators also called for Italy's government to join other Western nations in recognizing a Palestinian state, and to halt the flow of weapons to Israel through Italian ports.
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is under pressure to announce formal recognition of the state of Palestine after Britain, Australia, Canada and Portugal did so yesterday, piling pressure on Israel over its campaign in Gaza.
    


            Protesters are also attempting to block Italian ports, which have been used to ship arms to Israel.
    


            Dock workers left their posts in Genoa and Marghera to protest the transfer of arms to Israel and to support the Global Sumud Flotilla, a fleet of ships attempting to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza and carry aid to the enclave. The flotilla departed for Gaza last week, after gathering around 40 vessels between Sicily and Malta.
    


            USB, a trade union, called the general strike, which has affected public transport, railways, schools, ports and other public services. The union said the aim of the strike was to “break-off” relations with Israel, defend Gaza and support the flotilla.
    


            More than 30,000 people had gathered in front of Rome's Termini station by early Monday afternoon, local police said.
    


                    “It is no longer possible that a state (Israel) can do what it is doing in Palestine. It is truly shameful, unheard of, and no longer possible,” one of the protesters, a retiree, told CNN. “Thank goodness all these people are here; it means there is still a heart, a soul, and a humanity capable of deciding certain things.”
                





            After four Western countries formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, at least five others are expected to do so today, as the high-level week at the United Nations General Assembly kicks off in New York.
    


            France is expected to recognize the state of Palestine during a summit later Monday, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage.
    


Here are the latest developments:



• France-Saudi summit: France and Saudi Arabia will co-chair a summit at UNGA this afternoon, in which France – which has spearheaded Western efforts to revive a two-state solution – is set to announce formal recognition of Palestine.
    


• Western recognition: Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized the state of Palestine on Sunday, joining more than 140 UN members who already do so. Belgium, Luxembourg, San Marino and Malta are expected to announce recognition of Palestine later Monday, along with France.
    


• Israel's isolation: The diplomatic moves underscore Israel's growing isolation, and how its war in Gaza has alienated many of its closest allies. The United States, however, remains vehemently opposed to the recognition of statehood and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


• Impact of recognition: While the recognition of Palestine by Western countries marks a symbolic shift, the situation on the ground makes it hard to imagine that a two-state solution could become a reality anytime soon, according to analysts and activists. Read more here.



            • Protests in Italy: Tens of thousands of Italians have joined a nationwide strike  in support of Gaza. Protesters are calling for Italy's government to join other Western nations in recognizing a Palestinian state, and to halt the flow of weapons to Israel through Italian ports.
    


• Syria at UNGA: Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has arrived in New York and is set to become the first Syrian leader to attend UNGA since 1967. Al-Sharaa, once an al-Qaeda affiliate, swept to power in December after the regime of Bashar al-Assad crumbled.
    


• Gaza City offensive: Meanwhile, Israel is pressing on with its ground assault on Gaza City, which it is aiming to occupy fully. Hospitals in Gaza said they received nearly 50 bodies in the first 12 hours of Sunday.
    


            Here are the latest pictures from Gaza City, showing Palestinians leaving the area amid continuing Israeli strikes on buildings.
    


            Dozens of people were reported killed yesterday, as hospitals in Gaza reported receiving nearly 50 bodies in the first 12 hours of Sunday. More than half arrived at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, an indication of the current focus of Israeli operations.
    


            The Israeli military said its troops had dismantled Hamas' military infrastructure sites in the area and uncovered hidden explosives.
    


            We're looking ahead to a UN summit of world leaders - to be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia later today - aiming to revive the long-thwarted two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
    


            In July, French President Emmanuel Macron called for countries to join France in announcing their recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly this week.
    


            These are the countries expected to do so:
    


            They will join the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal in formally recognizing a Palestinian state.
    


            We've been hearing from French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. He has hailed Monday as a “historic day” ahead of a French and Saudi-led summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, when France and several other countries are expected to announce formal recognition of the state of Palestine.
    


                    “Today is a milestone for peace and a major diplomatic victory for France,” Barrot told France's TF1 broadcaster Monday.
                





            As we've been reporting, French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded Western efforts to recognize a Palestinian state and revive the push for a two-state solution.
    


            Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of Palestine on Sunday. France is expected to join them during a special summit Macron is co-chairing at UNGA with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
    


            Responding to criticism from the Israeli government that recognition of Palestine rewards Hamas for terrorism, Barrot said: “The recognition of Palestine represents a categorical rejection of Hamas and its definitive isolation. It also endorses those Palestinians who have chosen to renounce violence and terrorism.”
    


                    “Our plan, France's plan… aims for a two-state solution and includes concrete steps to prepare for the immediate post-war period… so that an international stabilization mission can come to Gaza to ensure the protection of both Palestinians and Israelis,” Barrot added.
                





            France's plan has been criticized by Israel and its ally, the United States. During a call earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed to Barrot the US' “strong opposition to any unilateral recognition” of a Palestinian state.
    


            Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has arrived in New York ahead of his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the first Syrian leader to do so since 1967, according to Syrian state-run SANA news.
    


            Al-Sharaa heads a high-level delegation that includes several Syrian ministers and senior officials, SANA reported yesterday.
    


                    “The visit marks a major diplomatic moment for Damascus as it returns to the UN stage at the head-of-state level for the first time after nearly six decades,” SANA reported.
                





            The debate of the UNGA's 80th session will open tomorrow and continue through Saturday and conclude on Monday.
    


            Al-Sharaa was the leader of the main militant group that spearheaded the lightning offensive that led to the overthrow Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, whose regime had been in power for several decades.
    


            Once an al-Qaeda affiliate and a key player in Syria's bloody civil conflict, al-Sharaa has rebranded himself as a pragmatic leader intent on rebuilding his war-torn nation and repairing Syria's fractured international relationships.
    


            The US has signaled a willingness to engage with the new Syrian leadership while emphasizing that it will judge them by their actions.
    


            The Palestinian Mission to the United Kingdom held a special ceremony in London on Monday, a day after the British government announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine.
    


            Husam Zomlot, head of the mission, praised UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to recognize Palestine, saying the move was “long overdue.”
    


                    “International recognition is more than just a diplomatic position. It is an acknowledgement that Palestine has always, always been a land with a people,” Zomlot said at a news conference outside the mission in the British capital.“This recognition is not about affirming what we already know. It is about righting historic wrongs and committing together to a future based on freedom, fundamental human rights,” he added.
                





            After Zomlot's address, supporters raised a Palestinian flag above the entrance to the mission.
    


            Hospitals in Gaza reported receiving nearly 50 bodies in the first 12 hours of Sunday. More than half arrived at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, an indication of the current focus of Israeli operations.
    


            The Palestinian Health Ministry said yesterday that the cumulative death toll as a result of Israel's attacks since October 2023 had reached 65,283.
    


            The Israeli military said “numerous terrorists who were preparing to carry out terror attacks” had been killed yesterday in the Gaza City area, where it is pressing on with a ground offensive.
    


            The military added that troops had also dismantled Hamas' military infrastructure sites in the area and uncovered hidden explosives. It said one airstrike had set off “numerous secondary explosions.”
    


An intensifying campaign: Israel is attempting to take control of Gaza City, the enclave's largest urban area, which it says is a Hamas stronghold.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces says more than 500,000 Palestinians have left the Gaza City area since it ordered civilians to evacuate on September 9.
    


            People in the area told CNN on Sunday that northern neighborhoods have emptied as people have moved to western parts of Gaza City or joined the exodus toward central and southern Gaza.
    


            Ahead of the UK's recognition of a Palestinian state, here's what some Brits in London had to say:
    


            Peter, a 70-year-old retired police officer, said the recognition is “rewarding Hamas.”
    


                    “I'm very sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people. But I don't think this is the way forward. I think it emboldens them and will only lead to further trouble on the world stage,” Peter, who declined to give his surname, told Reuters today.
                





            Michael Angus, a 55-year-old charity director, disagreed.
    


                    “I think it's acknowledging that there's a people here who are suffering the most awful genocide. And actually, it's time for the rest of the world to say enough is enough and give them a place to call home,” he said.
                





            We've been reporting on the growing momentum to recognize Palestinian statehood, with France among a host of nations set to join the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal.
    


            However there are roadblocks to a Palestinian state becoming a full UN member.
    


            The path there needs at least nine of the 15 members of the Security Council to vote in favor, and none of the five permanent members – Britain, China, France, Russia and the US – to veto it.
    


            The US would be expected to wield its veto power if the issue came before the Security Council.
    


            Because China and Russia recognized a Palestinian state in 1988, the US may soon be left as the only permanent Security Council member not to do so, reinforcing how Washington increasingly stands as a bulwark between Israel and growing international isolation.
    


Europe and G7 split: Other countries, too, have shown no sign of recognizing Palestinian statehood. Canada and the UK are the first G7 countries to recognize Palestine, but fellow members Japan, Italy and Germany oppose the move.
    


            France and Saudi Arabia will today hold a summit of world leaders aiming to revive the long-thwarted two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with several of the participants expected to recognize a Palestinian state.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron will co-chair the summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who will attend via video link.
    


            The summit comes a day after Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it doubles down on its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage.
    


            Macron was the prime mover in July, calling for Western countries to announce their recognition of a Palestinian state at UNGA. France is expected to announce formal recognition of Palestine this afternoon.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded furiously to the moves to recognize Palestine, vowing that “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


For context: Today's summit, held on the opening day of UNGA's high-level week, seeks to build on recent efforts to revive the two-state solution.
    


            On September 12, the General Assembly adopted by a wide margin the “New York Declaration,” proposed during a July conference also co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, calling for a “just and lasting peace” based on implementing the two-state solution.
    


            The United States and Israel boycotted the July conference and voted against the declaration earlier this month.
    


            The situation on the ground makes it almost impossible to imagine that a two-state solution, through which a sovereign Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel, could become a reality.
    


            Many analysts and activists say this is the result of decades of Israeli policy aimed at sabotaging the two-state solution by building Jewish settlements on Palestinian land and undermining the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the territory.
    


            The UN considers East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and Gaza to be Palestinian territories, and the land that would make up the future Palestinian state.
    


            But East Jerusalem has long been annexed by Israel, and decades of expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have turned the would-be state into a collection of disjointed Palestinian pockets cut off from each other by checkpoints, roads, and swathes of land controlled by the Israeli military.
    


            Some 700,000 Israeli settlers, most of whom are Jewish, now live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, in settlements considered illegal under international law.
    


            That number is likely to rise. In recent months, the Netanyahu government has approved a massive expansion of settlements, including E1, a controversial project to build thousands of new homes that would effectively cut the West Bank in two.
    


Gaza has been reduced largely to rubble by nearly two years of relentless bombardment and ground operations launched by Israel.
    


            Analysts across the board recognize that at present, the reality on the ground makes a functioning Palestinian state impossible – even if they disagree on whether that's because Israel has spent decades torpedoing the two-state solution, or because the PA is considered dysfunctional.
    


Read more about why a two-state solution remains elusive. 



            A growing number of countries are pledging to recognize a Palestinian state, with more than 145 nations now joining the call for international recognition.
    


            Most of the nations that recognize a State of Palestine did so in 1988, following the Palestine National Council's declaration of the state. Many other non-Western states followed suit in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s.
    


            Yesterday, Canada and the United Kingdom announced formal recognition of the State of Palestine, making them the first of the Group of Seven (G7) nations to do so. Australia and Portugal followed suit.
    


            Those recent announcements leave the US increasingly isolated from some of its closest allies on the issue of Israel and how it has conducted its military campaign and aid restrictions.
    


            Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of a Palestinian state yesterday, piling pressure on Israel as it presses on with its war in Gaza despite growing international outrage.
    


            France is among the countries expected to announce recognition of Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in New York this week.
    


            More than 140 other members of the UN already recognize Palestine, a number that has grown in the face of mounting alarm over Israel's war in Gaza.
    


What Israel said: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.”
    


                    “I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said yesterday.
                





            Netanyahu said Israel's response would come after he meets US President Donald Trump next week.
    


What Palestinians said: Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the announcements would pave the way for the implementation of the two-state solution, “allowing the State of Palestine to live side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace, and good neighborliness.”
    


            Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, said the move is a “welcomed step,” but must be accompanied by “practical measures on the ground.”
    


What the US said: Before the UK's recognition, Trump made it clear he disagreed on the issue. When Canada pledged recognition in July, Trump said it could hurt Canada in trade talks.
    


            We'll bring you the latest reaction from yesterday's announcements as we build up to the UN General Assembly throughout the day. Stay with us.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","India sends more skilled workers to the US than any other country. Trump's visa hike has sparked panic","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/india/india-h1b-visa-confusion-intl-hnk","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 07:33:53 GMT","


            A wave of panic and confusion has spread through Indian communities and the global tech industry, following US President Donald Trump's surprise order imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B visa, impacting the largest group of beneficiaries of the skilled-worker program.
    


            The initial announcement on Friday ignited immediate and widespread confusion, culminating in chaotic scenes like the one aboard an Emirates flight from San Francisco to Dubai. The plane was stuck on the tarmac for three hours as H-1B holders scrambled to understand if they would be able to re-enter the country.
    


            Video of the incident verified by CNN appears to show the captain attempting to calm the nerves of worried passengers on board.
    


            “Due to the current circumstances, obviously they're unprecedented for us here at Emirates,” he can be heard saying over the speaker of the plane as confused passengers check their phones. “We are aware that a number of passengers do not wish to travel with us. That's perfectly fine.”
    


            CNN has contacted Emirates for a response.
    


            Masud Rana, who was on the flight and filmed the video, called the situation “complete chaos,” in an Instagram post, adding it created “panic among many – particularly Indian passengers – who even chose to leave the aircraft.”
    


Trump imposes $100K fee on H-1B visas



            Washington has justified its latest immigration crackdown as a necessary measure to curb what it describes as “systemic abuse” of the program and to encourage the hiring of American workers.
    


            The H-1B visa is a work visa that's valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Economists have argued the program allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow their business, creating more jobs in the US.
    


            But Trump's new move is set to disproportionately impact skilled professionals from India, who have consistently accounted for the majority of approved applications in recent years, threatening to upend the career paths of hundreds of thousands of individuals and disrupt the business models of tech firms reliant on global talent.
    


            The H-1B visa fee “is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families,” India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Saturday, adding it hopes that the “disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities.”
    


            The White House later clarified the $100,000 visa fee will apply only to new H-1B applications.
    


            For decades, the H-1B visa has served as a gateway for some of India's brightest minds to enter the US workforce, acting as a crucial launchpad for building long-term careers in America.
    


            This has not only allowed skilled Indian professionals to contribute their expertise but in many ways, enabled them to become deeply integrated into the fabric of American innovation.
    


            The most striking evidence of this success is visible across the top leadership of today's tech giants: Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, IBM's Arvind Krishna, and Adobe's Shantanu Narayen were all born in India and earned degrees from American universities.
    


            India's National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), a non-governmental trade association and advocacy group, said the new order “can potentially have ripple effects on America's innovation ecosystem and the wider job economy.”
    


            According to data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services for the 2025 fiscal year, which ends at the end of this month, Amazon has been the leading beneficiary of the H-1B program, securing approximately 10,000 visas. The second-largest recipient was Indian tech giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), with just over 5,500 approved petitions.
    


            Under the new $100,000 visa fee, that level of hiring would translate to a staggering potential cost of $1 billion for Amazon and $550 million for TCS for a single year's applicants.
    


            CNN has reached out to several of the largest Indian beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program for comments, including TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions, HCL Tech, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree, and Mphasis.
    


            However, according to analysts at Nomura, these IT service providers are not expected to simply absorb the cost.
    


            In a research note, the Japanese financial services group predicted the fee will likely accelerate a strategic shift towards increased offshoring and automation. It also forecast a rise in hiring in “near-shore” locations like Mexico and Canada, with the costly H-1B visa being reserved only for “extremely critical roles” where local talent is unavailable.
    


            The visa announcement represents a new front in the Trump administration's escalating economic pressure on India.
    


            The move follows last month's imposition of 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which the White House justified as a punitive measure for India's importation of Russian oil.
    


            “Service exports have finally been dragged into the ongoing global trade and tech war,” wrote Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, in a note on Sunday.
    


            However, Arora also argued that the policy could have an unexpected upside for India, potentially bringing talent back home.
    


            While it could concentrate top professionals within India's largest tech firms, she said it could also “catalyze India's transformation into a more powerful global innovation and delivery hub.”
    


            Mumbai resident Ashok Gupta agrees.
    


            “It is a loss for America not India,” he told Reuters. “Those people who go abroad and can't pay that much money, they will open their offices here. When they will work here, India, which is already on the way of progress, will progress more.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is banning opinions by professors in the classroom and some books and courses in a crackdown that violates the First Amendment, a law professor at the military school said in a lawsuit Monday seeking class action status.

Tim Bakken filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court and named the school and its leaders as defendants. He said he wants to protect free speech and the right to academic freedom at an institution where he has flourished despite his public criticisms of the academy and the U.S. military.

Bakken also noted in the lawsuit that he has a contract with a publisher for a book that is critical of some aspects of West Point and doesn't want to seek approval from the school's leadership prior to its publication because “it is very likely such approval will be withheld.”

The lawsuit seeks class action status for West Point's civilian faculty members, believed to be more than 100 individuals, and a court order to stop restrictions on free speech, along with unspecified damages and legal fees.

Bakken's lawsuit said the school began to scrutinize faculty speech after a January executive order from President Donald Trump to “carefully review the leadership, curriculum and instructors of the United States Service Academies and other defense academic institutions.”

In February, the military academy at West Point issued a policy preventing faculty members from using the schools' “affiliation or branding” in connection with any public comments or writings without the academy's approval, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit said the policy was “to control, chill and suppress faculty speech.”

The lawsuit said the academy in the spring withdrew books from its library, removed words and phrases from faculty members' syllabi, eliminated courses and majors and threatened or punished faculty members for teaching, speaking and writing without prior approval from the school.




During the summer, the academy removed information about faculty members' published books, articles, essays and scholarship entries from all faculty members' webpages on the school's website, the lawsuit said. It also directed instructors not to express opinions in the classroom, it said.

“As a professor of law, Plaintiff's inability to express opinions on the subject matter being taught is stifling and disruptive to the educational process,” the lawsuit said. It added that he no longer would be able to express to students whether a major or dissenting opinion is persuasive and why.

The military academy did not immediately return a request for comment.

Bakken, a civilian professor of law in the academy's Department of Law and Philosophy for the last 25 years, is the longest-serving law professor in West Point's history and has written extensively, including books, articles and essays, along with appearances on podcasts, radio and television, the lawsuit said.

According to the lawsuit, he traveled with U.S. soldiers to Kabul in 2007 during the war in Afghanistan and created the Department of Law at the National Military Academy of Afghanistan.

He seeks class action status for West Point's faculty and a court order to stop restrictions on free speech.

Five months after ending development of its own obesity treatment, Pfizer is accelerating its push into the rapidly growing field with a nearly $5 billion acquisition.

 The COVID-19 vaccine and treatment maker said Monday that it will pay $47.50 in cash for each share of development-stage drugmaker Metsera. That represents a premium of more than 42% to Metsera's closing price Friday.

Pfizer also could pay an additional $22.50 per share depending on how Metsera's product pipeline develops.

Metsera Inc. has no products on the market, but its pipeline includes four programs in clinical development and one in mid-stage testing. Pfizer said the deal will add expertise and potential oral and injectable treatments.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla noted in a statement from the drugmaker that there are more than 200 health conditions associated with obesity, which he called “a large and growing space.”

Demand for obesity treatments has soared in recent years, due to unprecedented weight loss provided by regular injections of market leaders Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Co.'s Zepbound. The Lilly drug generated $5.7 billion in sales in the first half of the year. 

But the drugs can cost patients hundreds of dollars a month, and experts in the field are looking for competition to potentially drive down prices. 

Pfizer currently has no obesity treatments on the market but has some in clinical development. Earlier this year, the company said it was ending development of a potential once-daily pill treatment before it started late-stage testing, the biggest and most expensive phase of clinical development.




Pfizer said the boards of both New York-based companies have approved the deal, but Metsera shareholders still need to OK it. The companies expect the acquisition to close in this year's fourth quarter. It still needs approval from regulators. 

Shares of Pfizer Inc. climbed 38 cents to $24.40 before markets opened Monday while Metsera's stock advanced about 61%.

Miami jumped LSU and Penn State into the No. 2 spot behind Ohio State in The Associated Press college football poll on Sunday while Oklahoma climbed into the top 10 for the first time in two years and Indiana and Texas Tech made big moves after lopsided wins over Top 25 opponents.

The Hurricanes have beaten two ranked opponents, and they turned in another complete performance in a 19-point home win over Florida to earn their highest ranking since 2017.

Penn State, which had been No. 2 since the preseason, was idle and slipped to No. 3. LSU fell one spot to No. 4 after an easy win over Southeastern Louisiana of the second-tier Football Championship Subdivision.

No. 5 Georgia and No. 6 Oregon held their positions and were followed by No. 7 Oklahoma, which beat previously ranked Auburn at home and returned to the top 10 for the first time since it started 7-0 in 2023. Florida State, Texas A&M and Texas round out the top 10.

Ohio State had an open date and received 52 of 66 first-place votes from the media panel. Miami got seven first-place votes, four more than a week ago. Penn State had five first-place votes and Oregon and Oklahoma each received one.

Indiana had played one of the softest schedules in the country through three games before raising eyebrows with its 63-10 hammering of then-No. 9 Illinois. The Hoosiers made the biggest move up, climbing eight spots to No. 11. 

Texas Tech got a five-rung promotion to No. 12 for its 24-point win at Utah. The Red Raiders won easily despite playing backup quarterback Will Hammond most of the second half in place of an injured Behren Morton.

No. 24 TCU beat SMU to go 3-0 and earn its first regular-season ranking since it was a fixture in the top 10 the second half of the 2022 season. The Horned Frogs, beaten 65-7 by Georgia in the national title game that season, were No. 17 in the 2023 preseason poll and hadn't been back since.

No. 25 BYU, which finished last season No. 13, picked up a road win at East Carolina and is ranked for the first time this season.

Utah (16) and Auburn (22) dropped out.

__ Oklahoma is the lowest-ranked team to receive a first-place vote in a regular season since then-No. 7 Washington got one on Sept. 24, 2023.

__ Illinois' 53-point loss at Indiana was the most lopsided in Bret Bielema's five seasons and caused the Illini to tumble from No. 9 to No. 23.

__ The last time Miami was ranked as high was in back-to-back polls in November 2017, when Mark Richt's Hurricanes were 9-0 and 10-0. That team lost three straight to end the season.

__ Texas Tech has its highest ranking since Kliff Kingsbury's first team was No. 10 following a 7-0 start in 2013.

SEC (10) — Nos. 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20.

Big Ten (7) — Nos. 1, 3, 6, 11, 19, 21, 23.

Big 12 (4) — Nos. 12, 14, 24, 25.

ACC (3) — Nos. 2, 8, 16.

Independent (1) — No. 22.

No. 4 LSU at No. 13 Mississippi: They've split the last four meetings. Garrett Nussmeier dealt the Rebels a crushing overtime loss last year, throwing the tying touchdown with 27 seconds left in regulation. 

No. 6 Oregon at No. 3 Penn State: It's a rematch of last year's Big Ten championship game, a 45-37 Oregon win that made the Ducks 13-0 and the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. Ducks have beaten four overmatched opponents by an average of 41.5 points per game. Penn State's schedule has been even easier.

No. 17 Alabama at No. 5 Georgia: Crimson Tide has won nine of 10 meetings since 2008. The loss was the 2021 season's national championship game. Bulldogs have won 33 straight at home, the nation's longest active streak.

No. 21 Southern California at No. 23 Illinois: Two teams on different tracks. The unbeaten Trojans are averaging 52.5 points per game. The Illini were riding high until they gave up 63 at Indiana. First meeting since the 2008 Rose Bowl.

SAO PAULO (AP) — Thousands of Brazilians protested in all 26 states and the federal district Sunday against a possible pardon for former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies, who were convicted of attempting a coup. 

Calls for demonstrations grew after the lower house Tuesday passed a constitutional amendment that would make it harder to arrest or launch criminal proceedings against lawmakers. The measure now heads to the Senate.

The following day the lower house voted to fast-track a bill backed by right-wing opposition lawmakers that could grant amnesty to Bolsonaro, his closest allies and hundreds of supporters convicted of their roles in the January 2023 uprising.

In São Paulo, 42,400 people joined the protest, while 41,800 turned out in Rio de Janeiro, according to estimates by the University of São Paulo's Monitor of Political Debate and the nonprofit More in Common.

Pablo Ortellado, director of the Monitor of Political Debate, told The Associated Press the numbers in Brazil's two largest cities were the highest for a left-wing demonstration since President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's 2022 electoral victory. Researchers estimated crowd sizes using drone photos.

“Right-wing mobilizations have typically been three times larger than those of the left,” Ortellado said. “In recent months, that pattern has changed. The opposition's support for (U.S. President Donald) Trump's tariffs and for the amendment has brought the left back to the streets.”




Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Sept. 11 for attempting to stay in power after losing a 2022 reelection bid. He is the first former president convicted of trying to overturn an election in Latin America's largest economy. Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing.

Ana Paula Brito, a 37-year-old nanny, attended the São Paulo protest mainly to oppose a possible pardon for Bolsonaro. She said she was also outraged by the proposed amendment shielding lawmakers from prosecution.

“They (politicians) are rich, have plenty of money and keep stealing. No funds are ever released for us. That's one more reason we're in the streets today,” Brito said. 

Some of Brazil's most prominent artists helped organize and promote Sunday's demonstrations.

Music legends Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil — who defied censorship during the military dictatorship of the 1960s — reunited in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana neighborhood to protest.

“I was outraged by the news that many deputies voted in favor of a shielding law for themselves and their colleagues,” Veloso told Brazilian news outlet UOL in an interview published Saturday. “This, along with a proposal for amnesty for the coup plotters. I think I identified with the majority of the Brazilian population, who do not want these things to go through.” 

Brazilian actor Wagner Moura attended the protest in Salvador, Bahia. Speaking to the crowd from the top of a truck, he said he was not willing to talk about the legislative proposals. Instead, he emphasized “this extraordinary moment in Brazilian democracy, which serves as an example to the entire world.”

Sunday's protests were organized by artists and left-wing groups that have struggled to mobilize large crowds compared with the right. On Sept. 7, ahead of Bolsonaro's Supreme Court trial, thousands of his supporters rallied in his defense.

Two weeks ago, right-wing demonstrators unfurled a huge U.S. flag during a protest in Sao Paulo, with many thanking Trump for the sanctions against Brazil. 

Trump called the trial a witch hunt, and in July announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods and explicitly linked the import tax to Bolsonaro's fate. Later, the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on Supreme Court JusticeAlexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case and is seen by Bolsonaro as a foe. 

On Sunday, the left sought to counter that symbolism by unfurling a giant Brazilian flag on the same avenue. Posters, T-shirts and stickers not only rejected amnesty and expanded protections for lawmakers but also asserted national pride and defended Brazil's sovereignty in response to Trump's sanctions.

Polls show the country remains deeply divided over Bolsonaro.

According to a Datafolha poll released Sept. 16, 50% of respondents said Bolsonaro should be jailed, while 43% disagreed and 7% declined to answer. The survey interviewed 2,005 people nationwide and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.

Two young men were found dead after going missing in rugged Colorado terrain.

Andrew Porter and Ian Stasko, both 25, have been identified by Lynee Runkle on a GoFundMe. Runkle said she is the aunt of Porter. The two were reported missing to the Conejos County Sheriff's Office on September 13, but last made contact with their family on September 11. 

""It is with a broken heart and through tears that I give you this update,"" Runkle wrote on Thursday. ""Andrew and Ian have both been found deceased. Their bodies were discovered earlier today by Colorado Search and Rescue.""

Deputies say Porter, who was from Asheville, North Carolina, and Stasko, who is from Salt Lake City, Utah, ""were reported over due while elk hunting."" They did have a satellite device, which Runkle said was ""not functioning.""

Texas state Rep. James Talarico claimed that Gov. Greg Abbott is the greatest threat to Texans' public safety while appearing on MSNBC's ""The ReidOut"" Monday.

FIRST ON FOX: A Democratic hopeful running for U.S. Senate is building a brand of civility in politics, but four years ago he argued that ""radicalized White men"" were the nation's greatest domestic terrorist threat.

Texas state Rep. Jame Talarico, D-Texas, threw his hat into the Democratic primary in the Lone Star State to run against former Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas. Talarico launched his campaign earlier this month with a message that he wanted to restore unity and quiet the divisive noise that comes from social media and cable news.

Both are vying for the Democratic nomination to run for Sen. John Cornyn's, R-Texas, seat. Cornyn is currently engaged in a tough primary challenge against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Talarico condemned his murder and, despite a wide difference in their politics, said he found a middle ground in their shared faith.

""I am tired of being pitted against my neighbor,"" Talarico said in the hours following the news of Kirk's death. ""I am tired of being told to hate my neighbor. People across the political spectrum in this state and in this country are hungry for a different kind of politics, not a politics of fear, not a politics of hate, not a politics of violence, but a politics of love, a love that can heal what's broken in this country.""

But four years earlier, he was using fiery rhetoric online.

""Black Americans in a church. Mexican Americans in a store. Asian Americans in a spa,"" Talarico said.

""Radicalized White men are the greatest domestic terrorist threat in our country,"" he continued.

(Ross D. Franklin/The Associated Press)

Talarico's post that day was in response to a mass shooting at three spas in Atlanta on March 16, 2021, by suspect Robert Aaron Long that left eight people dead.

He went on to write in the same thread, ""As a White man, I'm susceptible to the same radicalization,"" and he said he planned to draft and file diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) legislation in the Texas legislature.

Joanna Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), charged that ""in the last few years, Democrat James Talarico has falsely accused Republicans of trying to create an 'authoritarian, Christian Nationalist state' and a 'Christofascist theocracy.'""

""He is one of many extremist, far-left Democrats that will vilify Republicans at any cost because it gets him praise from the woke mob and Texas voters will never elect him to statewide office because of it,"" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

JT Ennis, a campaign spokesperson for Talarico, fired back, ""For years, James has called out the billionaire-run algorithms that often radicalize young men in dark corners of the internet.""

""As a young man himself, James feels a responsibility to speak out against this for-profit rage economy that's destroying our youth — recently addressing this crisis in his widely circulated comments calling for a politics of love in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination,"" he said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""That's how we turn down the temperature.""

There are other instances in that same year when Talarico used fiery rhetoric against prominent Texas politicians, notably Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas.

On Jan. 6, 2021, Talarico posted, ""You sacrificed your country for your ambition. You're not a senator, you're a traitor,"" in response to Cruz's calls for people ""storming the Capitol"" to stop.

And on Nov. 19, 2021, Talarico blasted Abbott for celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse's not guilty verdict after being charged for fatally shooting two people during a night of civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.

""Are you our governor or a white supremacist troll?"" he asked at the time.

Ennis also defended Talarico's rhetoric in those moments.

""Texans need leaders who fight for their principles — like calling out those who promote insurrection and violence — while also working across the aisle to deliver bipartisan legislation that gets things done for working people,"" he said. ""James is that kind of leader.""

Trump announced on Truth Social Friday that a U.S. military strike in international waters killed three narco-terrorists aboard a vessel trafficking illicit narcotics. (Credit: @realDonaldTrump via Truth Social)

The Dominican Republic has indicated that a boat targeted by a U.S. airstrike had been ferrying ""approximately 1,000 kilograms of suspected cocaine."" 

That figure converts to more than 2,200 pounds, which is more than one ton of the drug.

The Dominican Republic indicated that its National Drug Control Directorate and its navy seized hundreds of packages of the drug following the American attack against the vessel. ""The packages were sent, under chain of custody, to the National Institute of Forensic Sciences (INACIF) to determine their exact type and weight,"" the country noted.

Republican lawmakers are accusing Democrats of playing politics over a resolution honoring the ""life and legacy"" of Charlie Kirk, which passed the House along bipartisan lines last week.

The Friday vote split Democrats – 95 voted to approve the measure, 58 voted in opposition, 38 voted ""present"" and 22 did not vote.

House Republicans have been hammering those 58, and several pointed out the fractured vote was much different from an earlier resolution condemning an attack on state lawmakers from Minnesota who were shot earlier this year.

That resolution passed the House in a unanimous 424-0 vote in late June.

""In June, House Republicans voted unanimously to condemn the attacks on Democratic Minnesota lawmakers,"" Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., wrote on X late Sunday. ""Last week, not even half of House Democrats voted to condemn the assassination of Charlie Kirk.""

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., recounted the tragedy in Minnesota with more detail, writing in a statement, ""When Minnesota Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were murdered, and State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded, the U.S. House unanimously passed a resolution condemning the attack and political violence.""

""But after Charlie Kirk was assassinated, 58 Democrats voted against denouncing political violence,"" Mace wrote.

Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., said he believed the decision by dozens of Democrats to oppose the measure would reflect negatively on the party as a whole in the coming midterm elections.

""58 House Democrats refused to condemn the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Every House Republican voted to condemn the attack against the Democrat lawmakers in Minnesota. This is why Democrats continue to lose,"" Steube wrote on X. ""Americans won't forget in 2026.""

AOC claimed Charlie Kirk's ""rhetoric and beliefs were ignorant, uneducated and sought to disenfranchise millions of Americans."" (Fox News)

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., also criticized those who voted ""present.""

""Every single House Republican voted to condemn the murders in Minnesota. Meanwhile, 58 House Democrats refused to condemn the murder of Charlie Kirk. Another 38 put their hands in their pockets. Those 96 need to be held accountable,"" Fine wrote.

The Minnesota resolution condemned ""the June 14, 2025, attacks on Minnesota state legislators"" and called ""on all people in the United States to reaffirm our commitment to a safe, civil, and peaceful democracy.""

The resolution honored ""the lives of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, who were killed, Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman, who were critically injured, and the law enforcement officers who rapidly responded to the attacks and apprehended the suspected perpetrator.""

GOP GOVERNOR NOMINEE PUSHES REDISTRICTING TO OUST STATE'S LONE HOUSE DEM

Republicans' measure memorializing Kirk went into comparatively more detail on the slain conservative activist as a person, lauding him as ""one of the most prominent voices in America, engaging in respectful, civil discourse across college campuses, media platforms and national forums, always seeking to elevate truth, foster understanding and strengthen the Republic.""

It also said Kirk ""personified the values of the First Amendment…and did so with honor, courage, and respect for his fellow Americans,"" while calling on all Americans to condemn political violence.

Several Democrats who opposed the measure said they were uncomfortable with its praise of Kirk.

""Political violence should never be tolerated. However, empathy is not celebration, and I do not have to call Charlie Kirk a hero. He was no such thing. He repeatedly disparaged minorities, especially Black Americans,"" Rep. Shri Thandear, D-Mich., wrote on X Friday.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said in a written statement, ""Condemning the depravity of Kirk's brutal murder is a straightforward matter – one that is especially important to help stabilize an increasingly unsafe and volatile political environment where everyday people feel at risk.""

""It then only underscores the majority's recklessness and intent to divide by choosing to introduce this resolution on a purely partisan basis, instead of uniting Congress in this tragedy with one of the many bipartisan options to condemn political violence and Kirk's murder, as we did with the late Melissa Hortman,"" she continued. ""His rhetoric and beliefs were ignorant and sought to disenfranchise millions of Americans – far from ‘working tirelessly to promote unity' as asserted by the majority in this resolution.""

Young entrepreneur Lucas Salzman joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss starting his own business at age 13 and growing it into a success.

Coffee in the morning is a must for most Americans, so bringing the café experience home has become a popular trend.

More people are adopting ""coffee house culture"" in their own homes, including artisanal coffee products and café ambiance, Better Homes & Gardens recently reported.

""Coffee is shaping homes, setting trends and spreading its influence beyond café walls,"" the article states.

COFFEE GIANT FINALLY REVEALS ITS 'SECRET MENU' WITH NEW APP-EXCLUSIVE DRINKS

""Paint shades are named after brews, with colors like 'Swiss Coffee' and 'Coffeehouse,' and seasonal staples like the pumpkin spice latte (aka PSL) have reshaped fall aesthetics and spurred a deluge of pumpkin spice products since Starbucks created it in 2003.""

Individual coffee preferences have become a part of people's ""identity,"" the publication said, determined by ""what we drink, how we brew it, where we buy it and even the drinkware we collect.""

Karen Strange, director of retail at Milwaukee-based roaster Stone Creek Coffee, spoke with Better Homes & Gardens about this modern trend of coffee-at-home, adding that coffee lovers today are ""more inquisitive than ever before.""

This includes investing in home brewing gear and new gadgets and participating in workshops, tastings and tours, as seen at her own roastery.

""Some guests even take the factory tour multiple times,"" she said. ""As they learn and experience coffee, their perspective changes and they have new questions or observations during the tour.""

""I love café environments. I've always felt really strongly that they're this bastion of human connection,"" Strange said. ""COVID was such a profound experience for our global community. We found out just how much we value connective experiences and spaces.""

The pandemic gave birth to coffee trends such as whipped coffee, further influencing people to invest in at-home supplies.

One of the biggest impacts of coffee culture has been on home design, aligning with today's ""wellness-inspired spaces,"" Better Homes & Gardens reported.

A recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports found that caffeine drinkers recorded better moods after a cup of coffee or tea in the first two and a half hours of waking up, compared with later in the day.

The mood boosts were linked to caffeine consumption, with researchers finding that the positive emotions included enthusiasm and happiness.

University of Warwick psychology professor Anu Realo said the positive effects happen after caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain.

""[This] can increase dopamine activity in key brain regions – an effect that studies have linked to improved mood and greater alertness,"" Realo said. 

She also noted that an important factor may be related to caffeine dependence.

""A morning cup of coffee engages all the senses and signals to the brain that the day is beginning,"" the expert said.

Lupoli said that even after experimenting with decaffeinated coffee, she observed the same positive effects on herself.

""The ritual alone still brings that same sense of calm and fresh-start energy,"" she said. ""So, yes, coffee may make us happier, but it's often as much about the habit and mindset as it is about the caffeine.""

Supreme Court justices are not subject to elections, but thanks to a trio of cases the high court will hear in the upcoming term, their rulings may significantly affect the midterm elections in 2026 and beyond.

Among the dozens of cases the Supreme Court will hear in the coming months, three cases it has agreed to hear could have wider ramifications for campaigns, elections, and who controls the House of Representatives. Two of the cases have been scheduled for October hearings, while the other has yet to be scheduled but will be heard by the justices in the upcoming term, long before the midterm elections in November 2026.

The first case the Supreme Court will hear in the next term that could significantly affect forthcoming elections deals with whether federal candidates have standing to challenge state regulations of the federal elections they are running in. With Bost v. Illinois State Board of Elections, Rep. Mike Bost (R-IL) sued Illinois officials over a state law that allows mail-in ballots to be collected 14 days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.

The case the justices will hear in oral arguments on Oct. 8 does not concern the legality of the Illinois mail-in ballot law but whether Bost is able to sue, as a federal candidate, over those state election laws. The lower district and appeals courts rejected Bost's assertions of standing, leading him to the Supreme Court for a question that could either open up or shut down various election procedure challenges by candidates.

Bost argues the lower court's rulings were “flatly wrong” and that “no one has more of a concrete and particularized interest in the rules governing an election than the candidates running in it.” The Illinois Board of Elections argues Bost has failed to show any material harm to him caused by the law and that the lawsuit should not hold up.

Honest Elections Project Vice President Chad Ennis told the Washington Examiner that if the Supreme Court upholds the lower courts' rulings and finds no standing for candidates to sue, it would have “wide implications.”

“It makes these things harder to challenge, almost impossible, and that's really the problem if a candidate doesn't have standing to sue on election rules. Who does at that point? It gets really hard to think of how anyone can get in court,” Ennis said.

“It would be far, far reaching to find a candidate does not have standing,” he added.

Should the justices rule in favor of Bost, ruling that candidates have standing to challenge laws such as the 14-day, postelection mail-in period, it could allow candidates more avenues to challenge election statutes in states.

Ennis believes that, should the high court rule in favor of Bost, it could help the issue of late-arriving ballots make its way to the Supreme Court in the future, with the argument that extending the deadline past Election Day violates federal law.

“The Constitution gives Congress the ability to set the time, place, and manner of federal elections,” Ennis said. “If you keep collecting ballots two weeks later, you've gone well past Election Day, and it's not Election Day anymore, it's election month.”

While a case on the legality of mail-in ballot deadlines stretching beyond Election Day itself could take years to reach the Supreme Court, the finding of standing for challenging election procedures would immediately affect challenges leveled as Nov. 3, 2026, marches closer.

A week after the Supreme Court hears arguments in Bost v. Illinois, it will hear arguments in Louisiana v. Callais. The oral arguments slated for Oct. 15 will center on whether Louisiana's creation of a second minority-majority congressional district violates the 14th or 15th Amendment, a ruling that could have implications beyond the Pelican State.

The case held a first round of oral arguments earlier this year. Still, the justices punted on a decision and scheduled a second round of oral arguments around a sharper question. The new question the justices want answers to from the parties has teed up the case as possibly being the decision where the Supreme Court strikes down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Conversely, the high court could also uphold the provision of the VRA and rule that creating a second minority-majority district is constitutional.

Section 2 of the VRA and the Supreme Court's 1986 ruling in Thornburg v. Gingles, which set the current parameters for Section 2 lawsuits, have paved the way for the creation of court-ordered minority-majority congressional districts for minority groups that make up a significant amount of a state's population. Because of the significant black minority populations in the Southern states and the Democratic Party's dominance with black voters, Section 2 lawsuits have led to the creation of various deep-blue districts in states like Louisiana and Alabama.

In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's proposed congressional map violated Section 2 of the VRA, mandating the creation of a second black majority district for the state. The 5-4 decision in Allen v. Milligan did not strike down Section 2, but Louisiana, in its brief to the Supreme Court for the Callais case, told the justices it believes Section 2's “race-based mandate is unconstitutional.”

Louisiana, the GOP-dominated legislature of which created the second black-majority district after a court order, said in its brief to the court that it is seeking clarity on how to proceed with redistricting. While the court's ruling may not overturn Section 2, the Pelican State wants to avoid endless court battles over its legislative map, which should only change once a decade.

RAMPANT COURT SHOPPING AGAINST TRUMP GETS REPRIEVE

“In all events, the States desperately need clarity that so far has been absent from this Court's redistricting cases. Absent that clarity, nothing will change in the extraordinary expenditure of time, money, and resources that the States (and the courts) face after every redistricting cycle,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in her brief to the court.

If the high court strikes down Section 2's racial gerrymandering requirements, it could set off another wave of redistricting and net Republicans seats in various Southern states. With the tight battle for the House of Representatives, it could be the difference between Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Democratic House Speaker Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) in the next Congress.

While the Supreme Court has yet to schedule its arguments for NRSC v. FEC, the justices' ruling is slated to have the most immediate effect on campaigns. The Federal Election Commission's coordinated spending limits between political parties and candidates have remained in place despite the Supreme Court lifting different limits as unconstitutional in recent years, but the NRSC case could open the floodgates to more coordinated spending.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP's Senate campaign wing, argues to the Supreme Court that the limits the FEC places on coordinating spending between political parties and candidates violate that party's First Amendment rights. The NRSC also rejects the claims by the FEC that the limits work to prevent corruption.

“Since their inception, these coordinated party expenditure limits have been a form of speech rationing in search of a rationale. Given that they were enacted to reduce what incumbents saw as wasteful and excessive campaign spending by political parties, the government has spent decades casting about for a way to recharacterize them as an anti-corruption measure,” the NRSC's brief to the high court said.

“But because no one seriously claims that parties are trying to bribe their candidates, the government has been forced to rely on a quid pro quo-by-circumvention defense — namely, that the limits will somehow prevent donors from laundering bribes to candidates through the political parties,” the NRSC added, arguing the Supreme Court has previously rejected this rationale.

The Supreme Court striking down the limits on how parties coordinate spending with candidates could flood increasingly expensive campaigns with more money, thanks to the political parties.

“If you lift the limits, it would allow more money to come into the system, and it would allow the candidates' parties to receive more money, and it would allow the parties to spend more money,” Dan Greenberg, senior research fellow at the Cato Institute, told the Washington Examiner.

With the Democratic and Republican parties becoming weaker in recent years, lifting the limits on coordinated spending could give the political parties some power.

SUPREME COURT FRUSTRATED BY LOWER COURT OVERREACHES

“We live in an era of American history where parties are incredibly weak, and I think that if these regulations were struck down, it would certainly help parties to become relatively stronger,” Greenberg said.

Decisions in all three cases are expected by the end of June 2026, but cases argued early in the term tend to be decided months earlier than June. The Supreme Court could also take up additional election-related cases as it continues to agree on cases for this term over the coming months.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Throughout this week, the Washington Examiner's Restoring America project will feature its latest series titled “Reforming the Deep State: Reining in the Federal Bureaucracy.” We invited some of the best policy minds in the conservative movement to speak to the issues of what waste, fraud, abuse, and unaccountability exist throughout the federal government and what still needs to be done. To learn more about the series, click here.

The Central Intelligence Agency is America's most famous spy outfit. It's not our biggest or best-funded intelligence service — that's the National Security Agency — but the CIA's reputation was long ago established in the popular imagination, between spy movies and novels. When people think about espionage, the CIA is what comes to mind.

The agency is an experienced bureaucratic player inside the Beltway. It protects its turf with more effectiveness than the agency sometimes displays with its spy mission. However, the hour for serious reform has arrived. During former President Barack Obama's second term, his relationship with the CIA turned toxic, thanks to his excessively cozy relationship with Director John Brennan, a naked Democratic partisan. Matters hardly improved under former President Joe Biden, when CIA leadership and too much of the intelligence community corrupted themselves by endorsing White House lies about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attacks on U.S. intelligence personnel known as the Havana Syndrome.

We need a fresh start in the second Trump administration, yet so far results are mixed. CIA Director John Ratcliffe enjoys a good relationship with the White House. The administration's emphasis on payback against the deep state for its past sins against Trump is a top priority for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, but Ratcliffe has played along too. Gabbard's reaching into CIA ranks to purge suspected anti-Trumpers, especially when the anti-Trump evidence against some of those officers is very thin, doesn't sit well with many Langley veterans.

The larger problem, which Team Trump must address, is that the CIA shouldn't have the political power it possesses, much of which is derived from its status as the U.S. government's chief intelligence analyst. It's the CIA that owns most of the analysts who provide the White House with intelligence, including the President's Daily Brief, going back to President Harry Truman. That's too much power vested in one spy agency, plus a recipe for politicization — exactly as occurred under Obama and Biden. The agency's Directorate of Analysis, formerly Intelligence, boasts battalions of analysts, of frankly mixed quality. One very accomplished CIA analyst once described his colleagues as “rather bright graduate students” in their mentality, which explains their politics, too.

The fix here is a simple one. Copy the United Kingdom's Joint Intelligence Committee, which takes intelligence officers from all Britain's spy agencies and rotates them to perform national-level intelligence analysis and assessments. The U.S. must do the same. Disband the Directorate of Analysis and create a top-level analysis shop, with the best spy minds. Make sure none of them serve there too long, because that's what leads to partisan politics infecting the intelligence business. There's no need to reinvent the wheel, just mimic the U.K.'s JIC, which has existed since before World War II.

The CIA's most famous mission resides in its Directorate of Operations, which is where the real spies are. The DO's core mission is to steal foreign secrets. Per Hollywood depictions, DO officers serving all over the world, under various forms of cover, represent the pointy end of Langley's secret spear. Sometimes, it can be very dangerous work, as the agency's storied Memorial Wall attests.

The DO's operational model, which is largely based on employing U.S. diplomatic facilities to collect foreign intelligence, has changed remarkably little since the agency's establishment in 1947. It still works rather well on the whole. In most of the world, CIA spies work the diplomatic cocktail circuit, per the spy-film cliché, while waiting for walk-ins to show up at the U.S. Embassy door, selling secrets.

However, this venerable modus operandi faces serious challenges in “hard target” countries such as China and Russia, where AI-enabled facial recognition systems and the ubiquitous local security service watch suspected CIA personnel so closely that getting any work done outside the embassy can be extraordinarily difficult and dangerous. To say nothing of “denied areas” such as Iran and North Korea, where the U.S. has no embassies, nor do American businesses operate. The CIA is all but shut out.

The bigger problem is the disappearance of traditional cover thanks to the internet and biometrics. This challenge confronts spy agencies worldwide, and nobody yet has a firm solution. The old ways of masquerading as a diplomat or businessperson, thanks to fake documents, get much trickier when quick database and social media checks can reveal the spy's true identity with astonishing ease. These days, casual habits regarding cover can get CIA personnel arrested or even killed.

The agency is addressing this through its Directorate of Digital Innovation, established a decade ago, which counts among its missions finding new ways to employ cover in the digital age. This effort requires maximum effort because the CIA's traditional espionage practices are disappearing rapidly in the always-online world.

NEW YORK CITY – President Donald Trump's problems ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are poised to mar his return to the United Nations in New York City this week, though he is more empowered than he was the last time he made an appearance at the annual leaders summit in 2019.

Trump is scheduled to address the 80th session of the U.N. General Assembly's High-Level Week on Tuesday before the green marble facade he has criticized in the past.

Despite his criticism of the U.N. building and the multilateral organization more broadly, a White House source underscored that Trump “is excited to participate” and is expected to “lay out his vision for a safe, prosperous, peaceful America and world.” 

“Under President Trump's leadership, our country is strong again, which has made the entire globe more stable,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle told the Washington Examiner, citing how Trump has “brokered seven peace deals, secured historic trade deals and investments, and strengthened alliances across the world.”

A White House official told the Washington Examiner that Trump would use his address to the U.N., his first in-person appearance at the summit since 2019 after the COVID-19 pandemic upended the 2020 edition, to emphasize issues of “peace, sovereignty, liberty,” ensure the organization delivers on its “core mandates,” and to promote “transparency, accountability, and burden sharing.”

Through a State Department spokesperson, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defined the U.N.'s core mandates as being “an effective tool for advancing peace, not a bloated bureaucracy that compromises national sovereignty and pushes destructive ideologies like [diversity, equity, and inclusion].”

Trump's desire to make his mark on the U.N. is at odds with his preference for bilateralism over multilateralism as the two wars he promised to end on day one of his second administration continue eight months into his second presidency.

But although Trump may dislike multilateralism and is still contending with the wars, he is heading to the U.N. in a position of strength compared to previous High-Level Weeks.

For Jon Alterman, the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Zbigniew Brzezinski Chair in Global Security and Geostrategy, the most striking difference between now and Trump's other appearances at the U.N. is that leaders once “tried to avoid [the U.N. General Assembly] because they thought it would be awkward to run into” him.

“Now I think everybody in the world has concluded that they both can and need to engage with him,” Alterman told the Washington Examiner. “You saw with [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's most recent] meeting in Washington, all the European allies came to meet with the president, and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin came to Alaska to meet with the president. There is this desire across the spectrum to engage and I think a belief that you're much better off engaging than not engaging. And I think that's very different from the first term when people thought there was too much risk, too much uncertainty, and they would just avoid the encounter entirely.” 

Leaders are also advantaged now in contrast to then because “there's a much greater understanding of how [Trump] operates, what he prioritizes, his keen interest in negotiations, and his belief that negotiations can resolve differences,” according to Alterman.

Regarding Trump's highly anticipated address, Alterman previewed potential presidential references to Israel, Gaza, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, and China, in addition to Iran, North Korea, and maybe even Venezuela.

“The challenge has always been calibrating reassuring allies and partners and intimidating adversaries, and the president's unpredictability sometimes has the opposite effect,” he said. “Getting it so that the allies are moving where you want them to move and the adversaries are moving where you want them to move, and not just the adversaries think they can play him and the allies think they have to hedge against abandonment. That's not where you want to be.”

More generally, American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Brett Schaefer predicted Trump would speak to two audiences through his address, one domestic and the other foreign.

“Domestically, he's going to tout his successes, what he's seen as successes, whether that's the tariff agreements, whether that's the U.S. economy, whether that's securing the border, all these things are no doubt going to be celebrated by the president,” Schaefer told the Washington Examiner. “In terms of the audience there, I think the president is going to tout his foreign policy successes. The White House has noted that he's been involved in resolution of conflicts, or at least cessation of hostilities, in about six different conflicts around the world.”

More specifically, Schaefer assumed Trump would defend Israel, demand that Hamas release its remaining hostages, and implore Russia to “end the fighting in Ukraine,” though he has repeatedly put pressure on Zelensky to agree to a peace deal with Putin.

“The review of U.S. involvement in international organizations has still not been publicly released,” he said. “It would not surprise me if the president teased, or at least unveiled part of the conclusions from that review, particularly in front of this audience as the United Nations is particularly interested in the future of U.S. engagement with the organization and the organization is facing an existential crisis in terms of funding and in terms of its relationship with its largest donor and supporter.”

Trump has already announced his administration's unwillingness to engage with the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

Alterman agreed that the U.N. has a challenge in how it demonstrates it makes a positive difference, particularly amid the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars. 

“I think that part of what other countries will be trying to do, whether it's the Europeans, or Asians, or others, is they'll try to persuade the U.S. administration that they should care about the future of the U.N.,” he said. “How successful they'll be I don't know and I think that the president's retort may well be, ‘Well, I personally solved more problems than the U.N. did this year.'”

To that end, U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, recognized Palestinian statehood in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank on Sunday before Monday's U.N. General Assembly conference regarding a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians. The conference has been convened by France, which started the recognition campaign, and Saudi Arabia to try to increase pressure on Israel to agree to a ceasefire in order to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as Israel expands its ground operation in Gaza City after last week's strikes against Qatar, another U.S. ally that the U.S. has asked to host Hamas leaders within its borders.

“As the president stated, he would be rewarding Hamas and would be hindering efforts to bring home the hostages if he recognizes a Palestinian state, and he doesn't think they should be rewarded. So he is not going to do that,” a White House official told the Washington Examiner on Sunday of recognizing Palestinian statehood.

The diplomatic move punctuates how powerless U.S. allies are against Israel without U.S. support, despite the U.N.'s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory finding Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, stopping short of calling the war in Gaza a genocide.

Recognizing Palestinian statehood is part of a package that “hopefully takes us from the appalling situation we're in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters alongside Trump last week during their press conference concluding the president's three-day state trip to the U.K.

“The hostages have been held for a very, very long time, and they must be freed. And we need aid to get into Gaza at speed,” he said.

Trump, from behind his press conference podium, expressed his concerns regarding recognizing Palestinian statehood, reiterating that his priority is Hamas releasing the hostages, with both Trump and Starmer agreeing Hamas cannot govern Palestinians in the future.

“We have to remember Oct. 7, one of the worst, most violent days in the history of the world, not just there, but in the history of the world,” Trump said. “But we want it to end. We have to have the hostages back immediately. That's what the people of Israel want. They want them back. And we want the fighting to stop.”

At the same time, the limits of Trump's power over Putin will also be on display during the U.N. General Assembly's High-Level Week after last month's meeting in Anchorage, Alaska similarly failed to yield a ceasefire or peace deal with Ukraine.

During his post-trip press conference in London, Trump amplified his disappointment with Putin regarding the Russian's war with Ukraine, particularly as Moscow last week kept invading North Atlantic Treaty Organization airspace with drones.

“The one that I thought would be easiest would be because of my relationship with President Putin, but he's let me down. He's really let me down,” he said. “If the price of oil comes down, Putin is going to drop out. He's going to have no choice. He's going to drop out of that war.”

WAS TRUMP'S ROYAL WELCOME WORTH IT? BRITS CERTAINLY THINK SO

While a Zelensky meeting with Trump during the U.N. General Assembly's High-Level Week has not been confirmed, Netanyahu will sit down with Trump at the White House after the summit.

“There's a conception that the last person to talk to the president has ideas stick in his mind, so I think there are going to be a lot of people who are going to try to get a piece of him,” Alterman said. “I think from the president's perspective he's not going to come in with a clear end state, he's going to want to see how many things he can move forward simultaneously.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Department of Agriculture announced it will stop publishing reports on food security in the United States, which the agency said have consistently been rife with “liberal fodder.”

In a press release, the USDA trashed the annual reports, which began under former Democratic President Bill Clinton, as “redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous studies [that] do nothing more than fear monger.”

“The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the termination of future Household Food Security Reports,” the agency said. “Trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged, regardless of an over 87% increase in SNAP spending between 2019-2023. USDA will continue to prioritize statutory requirements and where necessary, use the bevy of more timely and accurate data sets available to it.”

The most recent report available is from 2023. It found that 13.5% of households in the nation were food insecure, which the USDA defines as having “limited or uncertain access to adequate food.” Of that percentage, 5.1% of households reported very low food security, or disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake. Notably, that percentage went unchanged from the previous year.

Reported cases of very low food security over the past two decades have also hovered largely near 4% to 5%, with a peak of nearly 6% in 2008. Over the same time frame, general food insecurity has stayed between 11% and 15%.

The move from the USDA comes after President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” included some changes to entitlement programs, particularly SNAP and Medicaid.

The legislation mainly added work requirements, which are expected to reduce participation in the programs.

The Trump administration is set to advise pregnant women against taking Tylenol due to a possible link between the common painkiller and an increased risk of autism in children, according to multiple reports.

The Washington Post reported on Sunday night that President Donald Trump's planned Monday announcement on autism will include raising new concerns about acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and its possible links to the disorder.

The press conference will also see the unveiling of a possible treatment for autism, specifically the drug leucovorin. According to Mayo Clinic, leucovorin is primarily used to combat the negative effects of a cancer medicine and treat certain kinds of anemia, or a deficiency in red blood cells.

The announcement makes good on a promise from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to find the cause of what he has called an “autism epidemic” in the country by sometime in September.

Both findings were teased earlier this month by the Wall Street Journal, leading to an immediate plunge in the stock price for Kenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol. Spokespeople for the company have since maintained that there is no link between the over-the-counter drug and autism.

At the time, the outlet also said those findings would be filed in a larger HHS report, which was expected to be a review of existing research. According to Politico, no such report from Kennedy exists ahead of Monday's presser, citing one unnamed senior Trump administration official.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) rebuked FCC Chairman Brendan Carr on Sunday for his comments leading up to Jimmy Kimmel‘s suspension from ABC.

Kimmel's show was suspended “indefinitely” after the late-night host falsely claimed that the suspect in Charlie Kirk‘s assassination was part of the “MAGA gang.” The comments did not go unnoticed by Carr, who suggested that he could take action against networks that don't “operate in the public interest.”

Paul, who has broken with the Trump administration before, most notably over President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” called Carr's remarks “absolutely inappropriate” on Sunday.

“Brendan Carr has got no business weighing in on this,” Paul said on NBC News's Meet the Press. “The government's got no business in it, and the FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I'll fight any, any, any attempt by the government to get involved with speech. I will fight.”

The Kentucky senator, however, called Kimmel's comments “despicable” and speculated that ABC's suspension could've been due to the comedian's unpopularity.

“I mean, this is television for goodness sakes. You have to sell sponsorships. You have to sell commercials, and if you're losing money, you can be fired,” Paul said.

Kimmel's suspension last week led to a larger free speech debate in the country, with critics claiming that the late-night host was targeted by the Trump administration, while others maintain that Carr didn't actually go after Kimmel.

Regardless, Trump has consistently lobbed threats at networks in his second term, including calling for them to lose their licenses in some cases.

On Saturday, Trump appeared to dig in on that threat amid the controversy over Kimmel, saying “dishonest” networks that “give you 97% bad publicity” should be grounds for losing a license.

In demanding that the attorney general go after his enemies, Donald Trump is upending fundamental norms of fairness and neutrality in the American legal system.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

King Henry II is reported to have mused, “Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?” It wasn't an order, so to speak, but the King's subjects knew a royal command when they heard one. A short while later, four knights traveled from Normandy to Canterbury, where they killed Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury and the subject of King Henry's ire.

Attorney General Pam Bondi won't have to do any traveling. But like Henry's loyal knights, she has received a royal command. And like them, she will do her best to implement her ruler's direction.

In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Donald Trump demanded that Bondi find a way to bring criminal indictments against some of his enemies, naming Letitia James (the New York attorney general), James Comey (the former FBI director), and Adam Schiff (a California senator), and declaring them “all guilty as hell.” Urging quick action, Trump declared “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” and later made clear to reporters that his direction was tantamount to an order: “They have to act. They have to act fast.”

Trump's imperious demand for criminal action came less than a day after he had forced the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert, to resign. Siebert's error? Not acting fast enough, and apparently having doubts about the validity of the cases against Comey and James. Let's be clear: Siebert was no anti-Trump “Republican in name only.” Since taking office on an interim basis, he had transformed the U.S. attorney's office into a “cooperative partner on immigration and crime enforcement in Washington's southern suburbs,” at least according to Attorney General Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, The New York Times reported.

But if Siebert was unwilling to bring a case against Trump's enemies, he had to go. And by all accounts, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, who is leading the inquiries into Schiff and the former national security adviser John Bolton, is next in the line of fire if she, too, doesn't come up with charges for … something.

It is difficult—indeed, almost impossible—to express how utterly transgressive Trump's demands for personal justice are, how important the norms are that he is now violating, and how much destruction he is inflicting on the rule of law. But let's try.

To begin with, and to state the obvious, the likelihood that any of these three people has actually committed a federal crime is scant. Without knowing all the evidence, it is, of course, impossible to prove the negative. But if the mortgage-fraud evidence against Schiff and James is of the same quality as the “evidence” against Lisa Cook (the Federal Reserve Board member who has, likewise, been subject to a Trump attack), one can be forgiven for doubting the integrity of any forthcoming charges. Likewise, the investigation of allegations that Comey shared classified information about the Russia-collusion probe with a friend of his seems to have foundered on the lack of any proof that the memos he shared contained secret details. Certainly, Siebert's and Hayes's reluctance to bring charges strongly suggests the weakness of these various allegations.

Conor Friedersdorf: Show me the person, and I'll show you the crime

This is not the first time Trump has used the government's investigative power to punish his enemies. Recall that Trump has ordered the investigation of other disloyal opponents, including the cybersecurity expert Chris Krebs and the former Department of Homeland Security official Miles Taylor. The difference now (and it is a categorical one that matters deeply) is that beyond ordering an investigation, Trump appears to be ordering unjustified indictments and prosecutions.

To be sure, those prosecutions will almost certainly fail—that is likely one of the many reasons prosecutors have thus far declined to bring the charges. But the costs of defending oneself even against a doomed legal proceeding are substantial, both in terms of the financial resources required and the mental strain imposed. In the long run, even if the prosecutions collapse, Trump will have caused substantial, lasting harm to his enemies.

Second, and of equal concern, Trump's politicization of the Department of Justice runs counter to a norm of independence that goes back to the 1970s Watergate scandal. Under Nixon, the country learned that having the president's personal attorney, John Mitchell, as the attorney general was a formula for partisan politics. An unfettered, partisan DOJ is a danger to democracy; investigations and prosecutions should be based on the facts and the law, not political will. Trump's influence at the DOJ has eliminated its independence, a hallmark of its probity for the past 60 years. That DOJ is now extinct, and doubtfully can be restored anytime soon.

David Frum: Trump is sending a terrifyingly clear message

Finally, Trump's order is, indirectly, evidence of the destruction of an even greater norm—bipartisan opposition to politicized justice. Nixon had his enemies list, and his White House counsel, John Dean, wrote that the administration would “use the available federal machinery to screw” the people on that list. Mitchell was part of that machinery, tasked with bringing abusive litigation and even prosecution. But a bipartisan group in Congress saw Nixon's effort for what it was: an assault on the fundamental neutrality of the rule of law and the nature of American governance. Acting together, with real difficulty and at no small risk to their own personal careers, that group's members restrained Nixon and, eventually, ousted him from office.

Today, that sort of commitment to the rule of law is a thing of the past. The gravest sin here is not so much that Trump has an enemies list and that he is issuing kingly orders of retribution. It is that not a single elected Republican seems likely to stand up and condemn this total perversion of the American legal system. Government action should not be arbitrarily coercive and subject to the personal whims of our leaders. Sadly, it now is.

Everyone in America ought to be scared when the justice system is being used to target the president's political opponents. If Republicans do not step up and criticize Trump's actions, then he truly will have become a king.

Party leaders know they need to moderate on cultural issues to win back working-class voters—so why don't they?

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

Immediately following the 2024 presidential election, Democrats seemed to be in rare agreement: They had moved too far to the left on cultural issues, and it had cost them. The day after Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump, for example, Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts told The New York Times, “I have two little girls, I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.” In that moment, the floodgates seemed poised to open. Moulton's perspective, though taboo among much of the party's activist base, placed him firmly in the American mainstream. Surely more Democrats would start coming out of the woodwork to advertise their moderate cultural views, and the idea of a radical Democratic Party would begin to fade away.

In fact, in the ensuing 10 months, the floodgates have mostly stayed closed. With a few exceptions—notably California Governor Gavin Newsom and, less notably, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who hasn't won an election since 2015—Democrats have avoided making comments similar to Moulton's, whether regarding trans athletes or other high-profile social issues on which the party is vulnerable, such as immigration and climate.

This is a sign of a strange dynamic that has emerged in Democratic politics. Many pundits, strategists, and even elected officials recognize that the party has weakened itself by being out of touch, or at least perceived to be out of touch, on cultural issues. As Representative Ritchie Torres of New York told Time in May, “We swung the pendulum too far to the left.” But for the most part, the very same Democrats making that argument haven't followed it to its natural conclusion by moving significantly rightward on any major issue. Even Torres's big postelection immigration “flip-flop,” as Politico put it, was to announce that he would no longer fight against the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have a criminal record.

Countless Democrats are barnstorming the country and the media, stressing the need to broaden their party's appeal and reach voters where they are. But they have yet to prove that they're willing to do what it takes.

Seemingly every other week, another Democrat gives a podcast interview or writes an op-ed about how the party must win back the working-class voters it has alienated. “If you are setting a table that people with mud on their boots and grease on their jeans do not feel comfortable at,” Representative Kristen Rivet of Michigan told me in July, “you are walking away from the Democratic agenda.” But if you pay close attention to what these politicians say, you will struggle to find much evidence of them trying to stake out positions that might bring some of those blue-collar voters back into the fold.

The platonic ideal of political moderation works something like this: Pick a high-profile issue on which your party is perceived as out of touch with public opinion. Signal publicly that you agree with most voters on the issue, and that you disagree with the members of your own base who think otherwise. “You've got to go against your party,” Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings fellow who was a prominent centrist New Democrat during the 1990s, told me. Creating conflict demonstrates your independence and draws media attention, without which voters might never know about your position. The gambit is not without risk—you're purposely angering some of your own supporters—but it hopefully pays off because you gain new supporters, and most of your angry existing supporters will still vote for you.

The canonical example was executed by Bill Clinton. In 1992, while running to become the first Democratic president in 12 years, he spoke to Jesse Jackson's social-justice activist group, the Rainbow Coalition. The night before his speech, the group had hosted the rapper and activist Sister Souljah, who had recently caused a stir by saying, about the Rodney King riots, “If Black people kill Black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?” Clinton used his own appearance to condemn Sister Souljah's comments. His speech infuriated Jackson and many other left-wing activists, who felt that Clinton had taken her comments out of context. The back-and-forth became a major news story. Of course, this was the plan. “If nobody gets mad, you're not doing anything courageous,”Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton White House, told me.

Jonathan Chait: Moderation is not the same as surrender

Trump is no moderate, but in 2016 and 2024, he used selective moderation to make inroads with swing voters who disapprove of certain unpopular Republican Party orthodoxies. In his first run for president, he committed to not cutting Social Security and Medicare, and he hammered his primary opponents for supporting the invasion of Iraq. In his 2024 run, he promised not to enact a national abortion ban. All three of these positions were broadly popular but offended core Republican constituencies—budget hawks, neoconservatives, and pro-lifers, respectively. They seem to have paid off.

The Democrats who complain most loudly about the need to fix the party's brand aren't trying anything this ambitious. Their efforts to appeal to moderates and conservatives tend to be uncontroversial, which might defeat the purpose. One recent Washington Post article compiled various recent “Sister Souljah moments” from Democratic politicians. It included, as a lead example, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro boasting that he'd legalized hunting on Sundays. No core constituency in the Democratic Party is outraged by the thought of hunting on Sundays, which is why you almost certainly heard nothing about Shapiro's comment.

Newsom might be the most high-profile exception to the trend. In apparent preparation for a presidential run, the governor has taken public steps to shed his image as a doctrinaire California progressive. In March, he launched a podcast featuring conversations with conservatives. His very first guest was Charlie Kirk. During that episode, Newsom declared that allowing trans girls to compete in girls' sports was “deeply unfair.” A few weeks later, he repeated the sentiment to Bill Maher. And in May, he proposed freezing enrollment of undocumented immigrants into California's Medicaid program—a very modest break with the left that nonetheless angered immigration activists in the state. Newsom's approach, along with his outspoken opposition to Trump, is raising his profile: In recent weeks, he has appeared at the top of some 2028 presidential-primary polls.

By and large, however, even the elected Democrats most insistent on the need for change seem focused on adjustments to the party's communication style, rather than to its substantive positions. One school of thought holds that Democrats can woo cross-pressured voters without having to compromise on policy at all, as long as they switch up their vocabulary. Last month, the centrist group Third Way published a list of jargon that it would like Democrats to stop using. The list included the genuinely ubiquitous—privilege, existential threat, unhoused—along with more obscure academese, such as minoritized communities, chest feeding, and person who immigrated.

The memo hardly made a splash, because its point of view had already become conventional wisdom: fewer academic buzzwords, more folksy language. Be less “preachy,” as Pete Buttigieg put it in July. No more “advocacy-speak,” per Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. Demonstrate your “alpha energy,” as Elissa Slotkin says frequently. Slotkin bragged in May to The Washington Post about a speech that she'd given to some Teamsters ahead of the election: “I just said, ‘Hey, you motherfuckers, I don't want to hear another goddamn word about all Donald Trump has done for you.' They love it.”

A related theory of rhetorical moderation is about emphasis, not word choice. Because Democrats are much closer to the median voter on bread-and-butter material issues than Republicans are, perhaps they just need to talk more about their popular economic ideas and less about their unpopular social-issue positions. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut recently articulated a version of this argument to my colleague Gilad Edelman. “Climate, guns, choice, gay rights, voting rights: Every single one of those issues is existential for an important community,” he said. “But I think right now, if you aren't driving the vast majority of your narrative around the way in which the economy is going to become corrupted to enrich the elites, then you aren't going to be able to capture this potential realignment of the American electorate that's up for grabs.” Representative Tom Suozzi of New York is a rare Democratic moderate on immigration. So I was surprised that, when I asked him whether his colleagues needed to change any of their cultural positions, he said, “No. We've got to focus more. We have to lay out clearly what the platform is, what the emphasis is.”

Both ideas—talk like a normal person, and shut up about social issues—have some merit. But because working-class voters already think Democratic politicians hold radical left-wing cultural views, tactical silence seems unlikely to dislodge that belief.

Why didn't more Democrats follow Seth Moulton's lead after the election? The answer might lie in what happened to him after his comments about trans athletes. In the weeks that followed, his campaign manager resigned, protesters swarmed his district office, and the chair of the local Democratic committee in Salem, Massachusetts (where Moulton was born and resides), referred to him in an email as a “Nazi cooperator.” The committee promised to find a primary challenger. Over the summer, the threat came true: Moulton will defend himself in a primary for the first time since 2020. (His opponent, Bethany Andres-Beck, is trans and uses “any/all pronouns.”)

Moulton told me that “fear of backlash” is what prevents Democrats from adjusting their publicly held cultural commitments. He estimates that more than half of his Democratic colleagues in the House, possibly many more, privately agree with him that girls' sports should be limited to cisgender girls. After Moulton wrote a Washington Post op-ed warning against “Democratic purity tests,” he said, scores of colleagues approached him in the halls of Congress to thank him. But, he told me, they did so in a whisper. “Thank you for saying that, because I really can't,” they'd say.

This silence is a result of the primary system. Because the overwhelming majority of elected Democrats at the federal level are in safe seats, they're more likely to lose to a primary challenger from their left than to a Republican in the general. Everyone knows what must be done to improve the party's image, but each individual actor's incentive is to do nothing—or, if not do nothing, then settle for rhetorical adjustments without taking any controversial positions.

Jon Favreau: The conversation Democrats need to have

That strategy might be enough for Democrats to win the House next year. A recent New York Times analysis found that, even if Republicans succeed in their most ambitious gerrymandering plans, Democrats could expect to take the House back by winning the national vote by 3.4 points. In 2018, during Trump's first term, they won by about seven (excluding uncontested races).

But the Senate is a far more difficult prospect for Democrats. To take back the upper chamber in 2026, Democrats must not only beat Susan Collins in Maine, but win five races in states that Trump won last year, including two that he carried by more than 10 percentage points. The idea that they can do so without fielding candidates who are willing to publicly renounce some left-wing orthodoxies is delusional. Nor is this a quirk of the 2026 cycle. By design, the Senate favors less-populous states, which today are disproportionately rural and white. Democrats might never control the Senate again if they don't return to being competitive in such states. That would mean never stopping the confirmation of a Republican official or judge, and never being able to confirm their own without Republican votes.

Democratic recruiters could respond to that fact by looking for the kind of culturally conservative Senate candidates that rural voters used to approve of, but there's little sign of that happening. In Maine, national Democrats have been trying to recruit 77-year-old Governor Janet Mills, most famous for refusing to go along with a Trump executive order to ban trans women from women's sports. In North Carolina, Iowa, Ohio, Texas, Alaska, and Florida—of which Democrats must win at least three to take the Senate—the leading candidates mostly appear to have standard Democratic cultural views; two are Democrats who lost Senate races last year and haven't publicly changed any of their positions on high-profile social issues since.

For Democrats to appeal to cultural conservatives, some of them probably have to actually be more culturally conservative than what the party has offered in recent years, and not just adopt a different affect or ignore social issues entirely. Or they could simply cross their fingers and hope voters spontaneously adopt new perceptions about the party. That strategy offends no one and incurs little risk. That's why it's unlikely to work.

If the president takes over the Federal Reserve, he will have extraordinary power to reward his friends and destroy his enemies.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

President Donald Trump could be close to taking over the Federal Reserve. On September 9, a federal district judge blocked Trump's effort to remove Lisa Cook as a Federal Reserve governor; on Thursday, the administration petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the firing to go through. If the high court ends up siding with the administration, then Trump will have a clear path to filling the central bank with loyalists willing to vote the way he directs them to.

So far, most of the hand-wringing over this possibility has centered on Trump's desire to dramatically cut interest rates, which could juice the economy and improve the GOP's political prospects in the short term, but make inflation worse and destroy the Fed's credibility in the long term. But the Fed has far more power than just setting rates; in fact, setting rates is the least of what it can do. The central bank determines the supply of money flowing through the economy, decides which institutions can have access to the financial system, and can print and spend money at will. If Trump takes control of the Fed, he will have attained extraordinary power to reward his friends and destroy his enemies.

The Constitution makes clear that Congress, not the president, holds the power to authorize new government spending. But a major exception to this rule exists. In 1932, Congress gave the Federal Reserve the power to lend money to “any individual, partnership, or corporation” during “unusual or exigent circumstances.” The Fed used the emergency-lending provision to make a few modest loans during the Great Depression. The power then lay dormant until the 2008 financial crisis, when the central bank issued hundreds of billions of dollars in loans in an effort to rescue major financial institutions on the brink of collapse. During the height of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed went even further, offering trillions of dollars in loans not just to big banks but to corporations, small businesses, nonprofits, and even city governments.

Lev Menand: The Supreme Court made a bad bet

Several legal experts told me that even this expansive use of the Fed's lending authority was relatively restrained compared with what the central bank could do. Federal law imposes virtually no limits on what kind of institutions the Fed can lend to, how much money it can lend, or whether the loans ever need to be paid back. Whether any party would even have standing to sue the Fed for abusing its lending authority is unclear. As part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform act, Congress imposed a few restrictions, but these turned out to be vague and easily gamable. “There are really no limits to this power,” Aaron Klein, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Treasury official who helped draft the relevant provisions of  Dodd-Frank, told me. “The Fed can basically lend however much it wants, to whoever it wants, whenever it wants.”

Perhaps Trump would instruct his Fed appointees to exercise that power with restraint, lending only as needed to guide the economy through truly perilous circumstances. But little would stop him from instead treating the bank's lending power as a bottomless slush fund. He could direct money to favored industries, such as crypto, or even his own businesses. He could reward media outlets that give him favorable coverage, companies that donate to Republican campaigns, and even the budgets of local officials who promote his agenda. If Democrats in Congress shut down the government to limit funds for ICE, say, he could send hundreds of billions of dollars to private contractors to keep operations moving. “It's an infinite money pit,” Lev Menand, a professor at Columbia Law School who previously worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told me. “There's really nothing to stop the administration from lending trillions of dollars to the president's priorities.”

Perhaps even more alarming, control of the Fed would give the president a powerful weapon for punishing his enemies. The Fed is the central node of the U.S. financial system. Every major bank in the country holds a master checking account at the Fed, which they depend on to make and receive payments, manage their reserves, and access credit. The central bank, in turn, operates as the country's main financial regulator: It determines whether banks are in compliance with existing laws on financial risk management and illicit transactions, for example, and has various ways to enforce that compliance, ultimately backed by the threat of cutting off access to the financial system altogether.

The Fed has considerable discretion over how it uses this authority, giving it enormous power over not only the country's banks but all of the individuals, businesses, and organizations that require any kind of financial services. The response to marijuana legalization by one regional Fed branch is an instructive example. When Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, the Kansas City Fed, which has regulatory jurisdiction over the state, declared that banks offering financial services to cannabis sellers were in violation of federal law, implying they could lose their master accounts at the Fed. As a result, the state's banks largely refused to provide services to marijuana businesses, forcing them to choose between dealing in cash, banking illegally, or going out of business. Colorado tried to fix this by passing a law authorizing the creation of special “marijuana financial-services cooperatives,” to provide credit for the industry, but the Fed refused to allow the new institutions access to the federal financial system. When one of the newly formed credit unions sued, the courts sided with the central bank.

How might Trump use the power to “debank,” as it is sometimes called? Take the administration's threats against prominent left-leaning donors and organizations such George Soros's Open Society Foundations and the Ford Foundation following the murder of Charlie Kirk. Trump could designate them as a “domestic terrorist threat” and direct the Fed to cut off any bank that does business with them. “That kind of thing is basically what happened with cannabis,” Klein told me. “It isn't hard to imagine the same powers being used to go after Trump's enemies.”

Rogé Karma: Meddling with the Fed could backfire on Trump

The tools Trump has used so far to bend institutions to his will, such as withholding federal funding, are powerful, but they pale in comparison to the power of debanking. An organization subjected to such treatment would be unable to pay its employees, manage its endowment, or receive funding from government or private sources. An individual would be unable to receive direct deposits from their employer, get a mortgage from a bank, or pay their bills. “If you're made a persona non grata by the Fed, that's completely debilitating,” Menand told me. “It's the financial equivalent of cutting someone off from the electricity grid.”

Several legal experts told me that, given the broad discretion the courts have given the Fed over both lending and financial regulation, the judiciary would be unlikely to stop Trump from taking full advantage of the central bank's powers. In theory, the market itself could provide the necessary check: Reckless actions could cause investors to panic and tank the stock and bond markets, forcing the administration to back down. But control of the Fed would also give the administration plenty of tools to placate the markets with low interest rates and easy money. The only sure check on Trump's power would be Congress stepping in to amend the Federal Reserve Act. But this would require an implausible two-thirds majority vote to overcome a presidential veto in both chambers.

And so the most likely way to prevent these scenarios from unfolding is for the Supreme Court to rule that the firing of Lisa Cook was illegal, preventing Trump from taking over the central bank in the first place. If it instead green-lights Trump's efforts, the scale of what could ensue is difficult to predict. Most of the experts who have worked within the Fed or studied it closely have never contemplated what could happen if an institution with so much unchecked power came under the control of one man. Perhaps it's time to start imagining.

Dishonest governance is rarely a single act or brazen deal; more often, it appears as a set of habits that spread through a society.

Corruption is one of the most important—and misunderstood—concepts in contemporary American politics. Some examples are unambiguous: for instance, New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez taking gold bars from foreign governments in exchange for policy favors. But corruption covers a wide range of behavior, far beyond kickbacks and bribery. I've spent my career studying how it shapes legal and political systems, and I've found that it's rarely a single act or brazen deal; more often, it appears as a set of habits that spreads through society like a creeping disease.

For most of history, corruption has been known as the central, ongoing challenge of self-government. In Aristotle's traditional formulation, it encompasses all selfish use of public power toward private ends. The American Founders worried about it; George Mason warned that without active vigilance against it, “our government will soon be at an end.” And yet today, many of the practices that meet Aristotle's definition of corruption—interest groups paying for special consideration, the influence given to lobbyists and campaign donors—are both legal and widely accepted in America. Groups such as Transparency International have noted major growth in the public's perception of corruption over the past decade. Meanwhile, in the Trump administration, conflicts of interest are flagrant and ubiquitous.

This reading list provides a partial tour through the moral architecture of corruption: how it's justified, how it's buried, and how it reshapes the definitions of legitimacy. Together, these books will give you a deeper sense of what efforts have, historically, thwarted corruption, and make clear what its compounded effects do to a society over generations.



Rubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republic, by Tom Holland

Holland's Rubicon is a fast-paced, compelling narrative that vividly outlines the role of corruption in Rome's collapse. Through profiles of the leaders Caesar, Cicero, and Sulla, Holland demonstrates how political office became transactional: Governors extracted wealth from provinces, bribed voters, and relied on paramilitary gangs to sway elections. What were once civic duties, such as collecting taxes and maintaining order, became investment opportunities, and the commodification of public service weakened once-strong notions of citizenship and civic duty. As an alliance grew between senators and financial powers, public figures began profiting from real-estate speculation, slave trading, and overseas plunder—while masking their involvement. For all his detailed research, Holland's real gift is for explaining corruption not as a set of individual actions but as a broad culture of permission and self-justification. Rubicon is a warning about how republics decay, and how institutional reverence alone, without cultivating a common moral framework, is not sufficient to keep a state intact.



Politics, by Aristotle

Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has said that actionable corruption exists only when there is “quid pro quo,” or explicit exchange, which does not encompass influence, access, or the degradation of social systems for personal benefit. The economic theory of corruption, pushed by many academics, takes a similar approach: It does not treat corporate actions as corrupting unless they are also lawbreaking. The next time you run into someone who wants to suggest something similar, send them to Aristotle. In Politics, he outlines three forms of government and their corrupt counterparts, distinguishing between correct and deviant constitutions by asking whether rulers govern for the common good or for their own advantage. When leaders of any kind stop appealing to the common advantage and instead become motivated by self-interest, their government degenerates: Monarchy, for example, becomes tyranny, without so much as a handshake. The philosopher's relational, grounded work teaches that every government contains seeds of its own downfall, and that watchfulness, virtue, and civic education are necessary to prevent decline. His account remains relevant today, as he is clear-eyed about the unchanging substance of human nature.

Red Harvest, by Dashiell Hammett

Hammett's 1929 novel offers one of the most brutal and engaging accounts of normalized lawlessness in America. In Personville, sardonically called “Poisonville,” every association is bought, compromised, or controlled by criminal networks. The police chief is in bed with mobsters. Business owners run protection rackets. Judges are for sale. The narrator, a nameless detective known only as the “Continental Op,” is sent to solve a straightforward crime, but when he starts unraveling the case, he decides to purge the city of its ills—manipulating its gangsters, union bosses, and captains of industry into destroying one another. Hammett's fictional portrait is allegedly drawn from the time he spent in Butte, Montana, in the early 1900s, when it was dominated by the Anaconda Copper Company and full of labor unrest; he worked for, and was disillusioned by, the union-busting Pinkerton agency. Red Harvest is the dream of democracy in its most cynical, stripped-down form: wealth without justice, survival without virtue.



Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy, by William Greider

More than 30 years ago, Greider, a conscientious journalist with a keen eye for detail, exposed how the American political system had been bent toward wealthy interests who could afford to hire lobbyists. In this prescient document of dysfunction, he tells uncomfortable stories: The revolving door between private and government-agency jobs builds social ties among regulators and the industries they oversee, which inevitably lead to conflicts of interest, he writes; blueprints for legislation are drafted for future administrations by corporate lobbyists; likewise, public hearings are designed for insiders' benefit, rather than for public accountability. In one emblematic section, Greider details how big banks developed the framework for George H. W. Bush's 1989 bailout long before it was proposed, setting the terms of the debate far in advance. On Capitol Hill and in corporate boardrooms, he argues, theoretically neutral economic modeling and technocratic jargon are tools of obfuscation, turning moral decisions about who gets benefits or breaks into mystifying discussions that camouflage self-dealing as procedural necessity.

Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security, by Sarah Chayes

Kleptocratic governments are not weak or failing, Chayes argues in this paradigm-shifting 2015 book. Instead, what outsiders mistake as a lack of control is usually careful management of who gets to steal and how the spoils are distributed. Corruption metastasizes, she writes, when rulers and elites design networks of family members, bureaucrats, and security forces that serve to siphon money—and over time, opportunistic graft hardens into a system that is purposefully maintained to keep the cash flowing. In these states, even anti-corruption rhetoric, laws, and commissions can become part of the machine: They're made purposefully toothless, or selectively wielded against rivals. Most important, these corrupt webs generate extremism and unrest in the long run. Chayes's central case study is Afghanistan; she argues that the self-serving police, courts, and ministries fueled support for the Taliban. Chayes traces this pattern far beyond Kabul. In Nigeria, corruption in the oil sector and security forces helped Boko Haram take root; in Tunisia and Egypt, rage at theft by officials ignited the destabilizing Arab Spring. When governments fail to deliver services, instead extracting value, Chayes's book warns, radical alternatives can become far more appealing than the actual state.



Dark Money, by Jane Mayer

Mayer's masterpiece, now almost a decade old, remains the definitive investigation of modern campaign finance. Dark Money shows how a small cadre of right-wing billionaires, with Charles and David Koch at the center, reshaped American politics in the 2010s. Her animating phrase came into wide use after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling, and largely refers to political spending whose source is hidden from the public, usually through a web of nonprofit organizations that allow coordinated political operations to masquerade as apolitical civic activity. The Kochs didn't merely bankroll candidates, Mayer writes; they constructed an alternative political and philanthropic infrastructure—a sprawling network of foundations, academic programs, media outlets, think tanks, legal societies, and shell organizations—designed to outlast any single election cycle and distance donors' names and reputations from their activities. Dark Money is not just a story of influence-peddling; it is an anatomy of cultural corruption, in which intellectual legitimacy is bought and public institutions are deceitfully taken over.

Black Reconstruction in America, by W. E. B. Du Bois

The period following the Civil War presented a brief opportunity for a multiracial democracy to take root in the United States. That potential was strangled, Du Bois writes in this book, an essential look at governance and betrayal in America. Reconstruction's failure rests not only on Ku Klux Klan violence and political dealmaking, but also on the calculated withdrawal of northern financial elites. They had supported it for their own advantage, then abandoned it after securing their desired control over industry, tariffs, and finance. In Du Bois's telling, this was a national bargain; together, northern capital and southern oligarchy aligned to sacrifice Black citizenship for economic consolidation. Along with a coalition of manufacturers and party bosses, they redirected federal power away from protecting freed people and toward securing national markets, suppressing labor, and stabilizing white-supremacist rule in the South. After outlining that corrupt deal, Du Bois dissects how scholarship sympathetic to the northern interests then rewrote Reconstruction's history, turning the period into a fable of failure while caricaturing Black political leadership and widespread democratic participation. Black Reconstruction is a masterwork of political economy, historical revision, and moral clarity—and remains a caution for its modern readers.

How Trump's dealmaking has degraded American foreign policy

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Sign up for Trump's Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.

The sight of the Indian, Russian, and Chinese heads of state holding hands in late August led even Donald Trump to concede that the U.S. had “lost” India and Russia to China. But the president suggested that he wasn't bothered: “May they have a long and prosperous future together!” he wrote on Truth Social.

Behind the display of bravado, Trump must surely have sensed that his approach to foreign policy was catching up with him. His signature style, which involves breaking trust with America's friends while alternately cozying up to and lashing out at its competitors, rests on a notion central to his self-conception: the deal.

As dealmaker in chief, Trump has turned U.S. trade negotiations into a series of deals, haggled with Nvidia and AMD on China exports so America could get in on the deal, and called an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement the “ultimate deal.” He covets the Nobel Peace Prize, ostensibly as a tribute to his dealmaking prowess.

Read: So, about those big trade deals

Yet Trump has little to show for his methods: no end to the war in Ukraine, no new modus vivendi with Russia or China, no progress on Middle East peace, no breakthroughs on trade, and certainly no Nobel Peace Prize. The recent rupture in relations with India follows breaches with Europe and Canada. Mexico may be next.

Why is Trump's dealmaking backfiring so spectacularly? The answer may lie in his dismissal of an important bit of American dealmaking folklore: namely, that a deal is a deal.

Several aspects of Trump's posture, although ill-suited to the current moment, are not new. He hesitates to make long-term commitments and has a penchant for acting alone—traits he shares with a unilateralist strain in U.S. foreign-policy making that persisted well into the 20th century. He takes pride in driving a hard bargain, as have other tough American negotiators, including Dean Acheson, John Foster Dulles, Henry Kissinger, and James Baker.

But a crucial difference separates these statesmen from Trump's team: They were credible. They knew that American power and influence depended on the conviction, among both friends and enemies, that if the U.S. reached an agreement, it would keep its word. And they knew that America would cease to be able to reach agreements if it could not be counted on to deliver on its commitments.

At times the concern with credibility was excessive. It kept the country from cutting its losses as quickly as it needed to, for instance in Vietnam and more recently in Afghanistan. But the underlying idea was that a reputation for keeping commitments would deter enemies and attract friends. Allies who felt confident that America would keep its promises were willing to accede even to disadvantageous requests—such as equipping their militaries with hardware that only the U.S. made, or forswearing nuclear weapons despite living in a nuclear-armed neighborhood, or endorsing Washington's sanctions or export controls on powers that might otherwise have been friendly to them.

When America goes back on its word, leaving allies exposed, such countries learn their lesson and start hedging. Having paid a price for relying on America, they draw closer to others they may need to depend on in the future. They are less receptive when America asks them to take costly action to serve American interests, because the payoff of America reciprocating the goodwill is no longer there. America may then try to extract concessions with threats in place of promises, but even this may be ineffective, because a country that can't be trusted to fulfill a promise also can't be trusted to rescind a threat.

James Baker, who came to his posts atop the Treasury and State Departments with next to no diplomatic chops but ample experience cutting deals as a Texas lawyer, echoed that point when asked about the secret to his success. “The worst thing you can do, in my opinion, in a negotiation is to get caught in a lie,” he said in 2020, reflecting at age 90 on his long career. “Then it's almost all over, because the other guy thinks to himself, Boy, I can't trust anything this fellow says.”

That about sums up U.S. foreign policy today: No one trusts what we say.

Trump, like any president, has the right to develop his own foreign policy, and no one should pursue a policy just because a predecessor did so. Yet just as judges appeal to precedent to create stability and predictability in the law, policy makers must be attentive to the risks of casually discarding their nation's commitments. This is especially true for commitments that touch on what the historians Philip Zelikow and Ernest May called “capital-P” policies—policies that have a “deep underpinning” in America's history and embody “widely held views regarding national interests” as well as “widely accepted axioms about how a nation should behave.”

Read: Trump is right that Pax Americana is over

One can argue that Trump was elected to disrupt the old elite nostrums. But Trump is not only disrupting his predecessors' deals—whether NATO or AUKUS or the World Health Organization or the Paris Agreement. He's undermining his own diplomacy.

He imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico because he had complaints about the 2020 agreement between America and those two countries—a treaty that he negotiated and championed in his first term. He promised European allies that he would levy sanctions on Russia if Vladimir Putin didn't agree to a cease-fire in Ukraine—then concluded his summit with Putin in Alaska without any such agreement. He slapped a 50 percent tariff on India months after he'd welcomed Narendra Modi to the Oval Office, toasted him as his “great friend,” and committed to doubling trade between the two nations by 2030. South Korea promised to ramp up investment in U.S. manufacturing, only for Trump to follow up a recent meeting with the country's new president by arresting hundreds of Korean workers in an immigration raid at a Hyundai construction site in Georgia. Even countries that have not experienced Trump's betrayal directly can read the signs, which aren't subtle.

China and Russia have long sought to rewire the world for their own purposes and recruit others to their cause. They now have a target-rich environment. And they recognize that even when Trump is mad at them, the threatened consequences—new tariffs, export controls on chips, sanctions, or security guarantees to countries that are countering their ambitions—are either never imposed or quickly rolled back once Trump determines that they may cost him politically.

China has held firm in the face of Trump's tariffs and been rewarded with the option to purchase U.S.-designed chips that are foundational to global leadership in artificial intelligence. Russia has pocketed the gain in stature from Trump's diplomatic overtures and conceded nothing in return. Trump inverts the motto popularized by his onetime secretary of defense Jim Mattis: Instead of “no better friend, no worse enemy,” Trump's America is a fickle friend that leaves the field to its opponents.

In the short term, Trump has scored some legitimate wins: NATO allies have promised to pay more for their own defense, Asian allies have offered more favorable terms of trade, and Ukraine has granted the U.S. expanded access to crucial minerals. But as his relentless pressure on allies becomes the new normal, those allies have every reason to adapt to protect themselves rather than accede to his demands.

Trump has now been the primary actor in both American and global politics for more than a decade. No one can argue that he, or the MAGA movement he leads, is a passing phenomenon. And no country's leadership is under any illusion about what a deal with Trump is worth.

And so a number of countries are seeking to “de-risk” from America—to diversify supply chains, reduce dependency on American technology, and strengthen partnerships with other countries—in the same way America once pushed them to “de-risk” from China. What was conspicuous at the summit last month was not only the links between Russia and China, who professed a “no limits” partnership several years ago, but the eagerness of countries such as India, Egypt, Turkey, and Vietnam—all of which the U.S. has courted over the better part of several decades—to join this ascendant club.

America continues to have a stronger hand than any other single country in the world, but its power is not unlimited. The rest of the world produces more than two-thirds of all goods and services, and the U.S. lags behind China in both manufacturing capacity and leadership in several important technologies.

Trump may want to restore America's industrial base, make the U.S. preeminent in the industries of the future, pay less for troop deployments, counter China and Iran, and curb the drug trade, but he cannot make these things happen by himself. And the more he tries, the more the flaws in his strategy are exposed. His promises to end wars—in the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in 24 hours—have gone nowhere. Rather than striking deals, he issues angry missives on Truth Social.

Marco Rubio, Trump's national security adviser and secretary of state, once suggested that his predecessors in the Biden administration would be “polite and orderly caretakers of America's decline.” The irony is that while Trump has taken pride in being neither polite nor orderly, the decline in America's position has been swifter than nearly anyone imagined. There is no easy way to reverse it—but a president who knows how to strike a deal could make a worthy start.

How ignoring two-parent families has warped the narrative.

Our society has actively promoted two-parent families for decades, but today we're in a particularly intense moment. We have books getting published like Get Married: Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save Civilization and The Two-Parent Privilege: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind. Social conservatives are talking about establishing a “Manhattan Project” for boosting birth rates and nuclear families, and some on the right are even musing about ending no-fault divorce.

Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, Inherited Inequality: Why Opportunity Gaps Persist Between Black and White Youth Raised in Two-Parent Families, seeks to challenge these stories and solutions. Cross studies the outcomes of kids who grow up in two-parent Black families — a group of people she argues tends to “escape our collective imagination” — despite all the intense focus on single-parent households.

Cross's work bucks an idea that has fundamentally shaped government policy since the Moynihan Report in 1965 through welfare reform and contemporary marriage promotion initiatives: that if Black families just got married and stayed together, racial inequality would largely disappear. Her research reveals that Black kids raised by two parents still struggle far more than white kids from two-parent families, and do only about as well as white kids who only had one parent at home.

The numbers are stark. Black children in two-parent homes were two to four times more likely to get suspended or kicked out of school than white children with both parents. When it came time for college, there was a 25-point gap between how many Black versus white kids from two-parent families actually enrolled. By their mid-twenties, Black young adults from these families were three times more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts.

Despite representing half of all Black children in America, these two-parent Black families have been virtually ignored by researchers — just 2 out of 163 family structure studies published in leading journals between 2012 and 2022 examined their outcomes. Cross and senior correspondent Rachel Cohen Booth discussed the hidden costs of America's marriage promotion spending, the research gaps that have allowed myths about Black families to persist, and why even two-parent Black households can't escape structural racism. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.

Your research strongly suggests that promoting these traditional two-parent families is not going to reduce racial inequality, but you do find some advantages for Black children raised in these kinds of households. Given that, do you think encouraging marriage is still a worthy policy goal or cultural aim, even if it doesn't solve all the problems marriage advocates claim it could?

Christina Cross: One of the things I focus on in my book is that there's been such a singular emphasis on promoting marriage and the two-parent family for addressing racial inequality, and that this laser focus on this one intervention really limits our ability to close gaps between groups.

My research shows that even amongst Black and white children in two-parent families, inequality is very high. So the question we need to be asking ourselves is: Is this the best use of our time, attention, and resources? And are there other strategies and interventions that we could be focusing on that might be more effective? And my research suggests that yes, that is the case.

A lot of people probably will wonder why we should object to something that yes, isn't a silver bullet, but still seems to offer some help and protection. But I think you do find costs and consequences to this approach. Could you just walk me through the costs you see of prioritizing a focus on two-parent families?

So one cost, as I was mentioning, is that when we focus simply on promoting two-parent families, it limits our ability to explore other strategies that could be more effective. There are also real economic costs as well. Many people are surprised to find that currently our federal government spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year promoting marriage and the two-parent families.

TANF, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, is our largest cash assistance program in the US, and this program has outlined four goals, three of which focus on promoting marriage and the two-parent family. The government spends between $250 and $400 million each year on these efforts.

We're in a moment where federal funding for key safety net programs is being cut drastically. With the limited resources that are available, might we be more effective at improving children's outcomes and reducing gaps between groups by offering direct cash assistance or assistance for child care subsidies or for education or so many other really important things that families need?

In your book you identified a theory called the Family Resource Perspective as the principal framework used by social scientists and family demographers to explain how family structure influences well-being, which seems to basically boil down to more parents raising a kid means more money and more hands on deck. That sounds intuitive, certainly, but can you talk a little bit about how your research complicates that framework?

The Family Resource Perspective really emphasizes how having two parents in the home leads to more resources, more income, more wealth, more time to spend with children. But one of the things that often gets overlooked and that I highlight in my research is that these key resources are not evenly distributed, not everyone in two parent families has access to them. And unfortunately, that is especially the case when we look at Black two-parent families.

So I found that when it comes to income, Black two-parent families had about 60 percent of the income of white two-parent families and only 25 percent of the wealth. And so when we're thinking about how important these resources are for improving child outcomes, we need to remember that if we don't have equal inputs, we cannot expect equal outcomes,

I know this wasn't directly in your book, but I was curious. What do we know about kids who grow up in more affluent, divorced families?

Actually, that's a next step for me and my own research that I want to explore. Because we tend to focus on average differences. So on average, two-parent families have more resources than single-parent families. But what would it look like for a child to be raised in a single-parent family that was high-income? Or that even included other adults in the household who may not be a biological parent but who could help with child rearing? We can imagine that if resources are really driving family structures' impact on children, then more resources, and more adults in the household, could lead to better outcomes for children, even if they don't grow up in a two-parent family.

In that same vein, what if anything did you find regarding bad marriages? Do we know if they bring any kind of different level of harm or benefit to children compared to divorce or single parenthood?

I didn't focus specifically on marriage quality, but we know that not all marriages are created equally. It really is important to keep that in mind because we know that a child who is in a household where there is a significant amount of stress and conflict is going to be negatively impacted by that. That's not from my own research, but there are a number of studies that do show that.

You found that Black two-parent families have increased by 15 percent over the last decade, whereas Black single-mother families have declined by roughly the same amount. What do you think is driving that?

You know, it's funny because as I was doing background research for my book, I was surprised to find this because the story has been for so long that Black two-parent families are so small and we talk about them as if they don't even exist. So I was surprised to find that they're increasing and actually for every Black child who lives in a single-mother family, there's a Black child who's growing up in a two-parent family, but so much of our focus has been on single-parent families. And so in uncovering this finding, I'm also curious to know what's driving it. For my book, I was not pursuing that direction, but that's actually one of the next things on my research agenda as well.

You have this pretty striking statistic that between 2012 and 2022, there were 163 articles published on family structure effects in the five leading family studies journals, but just two of them looked at the outcomes of Black youth in two-parent families. Why do you think that is? Were you surprised to find that?

Yes, I was very surprised. I mean, I had a sense that there was less research on Black two-parent families just based on where much of our conversation currently sits focused on Black single-parent families. But to find that there were so few studies, I mean, two out of more than 160, it's just very striking. We've really only begun to scratch the surface of understanding what it means to live with two parents in the home for Black children, and there's very little empirical evidence to support some very strong claims about the power of the two-parent family for addressing racial inequality, which is why I decided to write this book.

I wanted to be able to provide some foundational facts for us to have a more accurate conversation about the role of the two-parent family and improving child outcomes and addressing one of our most intractable issues, which is racial inequality. And unfortunately, I'm finding that this family structure cannot do what we imagine that it should be doing. And that's really, really important.

Given your critiques of America's current approach, what policies or cultural shifts would you recommend to better help Black families and children?

So I think about these things as being two-pronged. As you mentioned, part of this is about culture and then the other part is about structure. So when thinking about culture, I think it's important to remember the power of narrative, the power of story, because it shapes the way we think about problems and how to address them. And for so long, we've had a cultural narrative that says that the main reason that Black people have a harder time getting ahead is because they don't live in the “right” type of family, that they're less likely to raise their children within the context of a two-parent family. And as we can see in terms of our federal programming like TANF, that has led us to focus on trying to promote this family structure.

My work shows that even when Black people raise their children in two-parent families, inequality is still very high. So part of what I hope to do in my book is to change the narrative, to present evidence that we really have not had access to because there has been so few studies on Black two-parent families. So that's the cultural component.

But also in thinking about structure, I think it's important for us to know that one of the main reasons why there are such huge opportunity gaps between Black and white children is that there are huge gaps in resources. Right now, we're in a moment in which many social safety net programs are being cut — like SNAP, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program. These changes in our structure are likely to widen many of the gaps that I witnessed in my book.

We've seen recently some strategies that have been effective that we could potentially implement. One of them in particular is the expanded Child Tax Credit, which lifted millions of kids out of poverty in the pandemic. Another policy is marriage penalties. For some couples, it costs them more in taxes when they file as a married household than if they were to file as single individuals.

I know a lot of conservatives want to get rid of those penalties. 

That's true. And so that could be one strategy, but also leveraging existing assets of families. There's been such a focus on the nuclear family in terms of how we craft social policy. And sometimes that actually limits our ability to support families that might arrange themselves differently. Black Americans are more likely to live in extended families, and there are some policies that would limit Black families' ability to provide support to one another in this arrangement. Family leave policy, as an example: with family leave policy, folks are allowed to take leave to take care of a nuclear family member, like a spouse or child, but some people are responsible for taking care of their parents or grandparents. They might be in a situation where they're living with siblings or cousins or other individuals who are not necessarily considered within the family leave policy. And that means that when it comes to taking care of them, they have to choose between missing out on pay.

Last year, you came in the crosshairs of Christopher Rufo, who labeled you a “Black Critical Race Theory/DEI scholar” and leveled charges of plagiarism. I know the scholars from whom you were accused of plagiarizing have all rejected the allegations. Harvard's sociology department rejected it, the head of Plagiarism Today rejected it, and the American Sociological Association also rejected it. What did you make of this kind of attack on your work, and were you surprised?

Well, in moments like this, I think even being singled out really speaks to the work that I've been doing and the fact that it has had reach outside of academia. We know that Chris Rufo is not an academic. And so, as difficult as that moment was, what that really signals to me is that I have been able to contribute to national conversations and hopefully to be able to help generate more productive conversations. And I plan on continuing to do that.

And as you mentioned, there was so much widespread support for the work that I was doing inside and outside of academia, which I found to just be very encouraging and heartening. And so I'm gonna continue to do the work, and I'm very excited to see what will come of this book that I have written for a much broader audience.

Between Congress, property development, and climate change, there's no easy fix.

Even though a major hurricane has yet to make landfall this season, 2025 has been a year of devastating floods. Thousands of flash floods across the country this summer sent torrents of water into people's homes, swept away cars, knocked down trees, and ripped bridges away. Floods over the July 4 weekend in Central Texas killed at least 135 people and caused upward of $22 billion in damages according to one estimate.

Though lost lives can never be recovered, the US has long had a program designed to help surviving homeowners financially devastated by floods. But at a moment when so many are trying to return home and the costs of flood recovery are rising, the National Flood Insurance Program is sinking deeper into the red.

Earlier this year, the program borrowed $2 billion from the US Treasury to help cover claims from major storms in 2024 like Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. Even though the program previously had $16 billion in debt forgiven in 2017 — the year Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma struck — NFIP's total debt is now more than $22.5 billion, and is likely to rise further as claims from floods this year complete processing. And an overwhelmed flood insurance system could be devastating for the homeowners who depend on it — whether they want to or not.

Sharon Cozort said that floods were always in the back of her mind when she bought her house in Houston in 2006. “The [500-year] flood plain went right through the middle of our living room,” Cozort said. She and her husband carried flood insurance for about 25 years, paying about $100 to $500 per year, but never needed to use it. Then came Hurricane Harvey in 2017, a one in a thousand-year flood event. It dumped a gargantuan amount of water on Houston and forced the reservoir system to release water to avoid overflowing out of control, which then flooded Cozort's house for a week.

She thought about relocating to a neighborhood outside the flood zone, or out of the city entirely. But the existence of government flood insurance made coming back the most financially viable option, if not the most comfortable one.

“My husband dragged me back to Houston kicking and screaming,” Cozort said. “The whole town was calling each other, ‘What are you going to do? Are you going to repair? Are you going to rebuild? Are you going to elevate?' It was kind of a mass panic.”

Cozort is clear-eyed about the risks she faces and knows that the flood insurance system, as it stands, is unsustainable. It's just that there aren't any practical alternatives for her and her husband, who are hoping to use their home's equity to retire and invest. For individual homeowners, there isn't much they can do on their own to reduce the systemic flood risk for their cities, or to change the structure of flood insurance.

Meanwhile, the other parts of the country she was considering are facing their own mounting insurance costs from severe weather and wildfires. “This house will flood again,” Cozort said. “This is a new world.”

And indeed, we are living in a new world. Flooding is the most frequent and most expensive disaster in the US. More Americans are living in areas prone to flooding, even as property values are increasing and construction costs are rising, making it more expensive to rebuild after a disaster. And due to how humanity has altered the landscape and warmed the climate, the devastation of inundation is growing. “The baseline is that flood risk is definitely increasing,” said Carolyn Kousky, an insurance expert at the Environmental Defense Fund.

The current national flood insurance system was founded in 1968. Today, the federal program has 4.7 million policyholders and provides $1.3 trillion in flood coverage. Unlike other perils such as fire and earthquakes, there are few private companies willing to insure properties against floods. For the vast majority of homeowners, NFIP is the only game in town, or the only plan within their budget. The program is funded through short-term authorizations from Congress. The program is currently authorized until September 30, 2025.

The challenge for the NFIP is that it's boxed in by mandates set by Congress that make it almost impossible for it to balance its books. NFIP must make flood insurance available to homeowners in areas that face flood risks, and it has to keep rates affordable, even as risks increase. “The tension between widespread access and being fiscally sound has been there since the beginning,” Kousky said. The federal program can't simply jack up its prices or cut off its riskiest customers the way private companies do. It's a crude, blunt tool for mitigating an expansive, evolving, and complicated problem.

And in many ways, the program makes the problems it's trying to solve worse, creating a moral hazard that can encourage people to remain in flood-prone areas because they know the federal government is picking up most of the tab after a flood. “There are areas where we're spending more to rebuild than the properties are worth,” Kousky said. These costs are shouldered by all of us, whether we're in a flood zone or not.

But even with broad agreement that the current situation is untenable, the nation's flood insurance is stuck in place. The Trump administration has also been slowing efforts to redraw maps of floodplains to better account for evolving risks. President Donald Trump said he was considering closing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which manages NFIP, leaving its future less certain. And there are signs that the administration of the program itself is shaky: Homeowners like Cozort have also reported recent hiccups in accessing NFIP's website and communicating with the program this year, leaving them worried that their coverage may have lapsed.

Ultimately, the growing threat from floods will force a difficult political reckoning over who gets to live where and how much the rest of us should pay to protect them.

The business model of a private insurance company is straightforward: take in more money in premiums than it pays out. However, the math of figuring out just how much to charge gets complicated fast, demanding a sophisticated understanding of hazards, exposure, economics, and human psychology.

Floods are especially difficult to insure because the damages are highly correlated. A house fire may destroy or damage several homes on a block, but a torrential downpour can flood thousands of properties at the same time. Fulfilling all those claims at once can overwhelm even a large insurance company.

Another issue is that the homeowners who most expect to see floods are the ones most inclined to buy flood insurance, while those on higher ground or outside of designated flood zones often don't. That means the pool of properties covered by flood insurance is much riskier than the housing market as a whole, a phenomenon known as adverse selection.

Faced with these circumstances, most private property insurance companies decided the best bet was not to be in the business of providing flood insurance at all. But there are still tens of millions of people who live close to the coast or in places where rivers can swell. About 40 percent of the US population lives in a coastal county, accounting for just over one-third of the country's economic output.

Between 1970 and 2020, the coastal US population has increased by 40.5 million people. Most banks require homes in known flood risk areas to have flood insurance in order to get a mortgage. Add to that the millions who live alongside inland rivers, low-lying farms, and valleys where the natural geography shunts water toward towns, and you have a huge portion of the US population and economy facing some type of flood risk.

The federal government stepped in to help manage some of these risks with NFIP. The goal over time was to spend less on disaster recovery by encouraging people and communities to invest in flood protection — things like levees and drainage systems — or to relocate to lower-risk areas.

But that hasn't really happened.

Simply assessing the risks accurately as they stand today is an arduous task. The main benchmark the federal program uses is the 100-year flood zone, the regions of the US where a major flood is expected at least once every 100 years. Put another way, these are the places where there's a 1 percent chance of a major flood in any given year.

The problem is that flood risks change over time. As we've built new housing developments, for example, we've cleared landscapes and put down more pavement, and that alters where water flows. Because of climate change, sea levels are rising, leading to more extensive coastal flooding. Hotter air can also hold onto more moisture, so severe rainfall events are pouring out more rain, increasing the intensity of flooding in some areas, including outside of tropical storms. But climate change is complex. Other parts of the country are drying out and seeing a drop in flood risk and decline in flood insurance rates.

In addition, homeowners aren't keen to find out their house is now suddenly in a flood zone, which means they may have to buy flood insurance, their property value could drop, and if they want to sell, it could be difficult to find a buyer. That's why some property developers have lobbied to change federal and state flood risk assessments to downplay the dangers to their real estate. On the other hand, FEMA has long been criticized for using outdated flood maps, let alone anticipating future changes in the climate.

In an attempt to resolve some of these tensions, NFIP in 2022 implemented Risk Rating 2.0, the biggest revisions to its flood mapping and risk calculations since the program was founded. While it brought flood risk assessments closer to the real world, the changes made flood insurance premiums for many homeowners more expensive, leading hundreds of thousands to drop their coverage entirely. Already, some lawmakers are calling for Risk Rating 2.0 to be repealed.

And even with this revised methodology, many observers say NFIP doesn't adequately measure flood risks as they exist today. “We're definitely seeing more and more flooding in places where we didn't expect to see it,” said Jeremy Porter, chief economist at First Street, a climate risk modeling group. Porter told Vox that First Street found there are more than twice as many properties in the 100-year flood risk zone than FEMA shows.

And just because a home or business is outside of a known flood zone doesn't mean it will never flood. Marc Ragin, an associate professor in the Department of Insurance, Legal Studies, and Real Estate at the University of Georgia, studied how flood maps can create a false sense of security. “We did a survey of small businesses in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. We flew down there and met with probably 20-25 business owners,” Ragin said. “In every conversation, we would ask them, ‘Did you have flood insurance?' And almost every one of them said, ‘No.' And we would say, ‘Why not?' And they would say, ‘Well, I'm not in a flood zone.'”

FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.

How NFIP prices these risks poses another problem. While the price of insurance normally serves as a clear signal of risk — higher risk, higher premiums — a subsidized rate from the federal government's program masks that signal.

In the case of NFIP, providing insurance policies at below-market rates reduces the incentive for people who live in risky areas to move out of flood zones, and may even do the opposite. Jonathan Scott, an assistant professor at the Jindal School of Management at the University of Texas Dallas, coauthored a paper last year that found that NFIP was actually encouraging more people to move to high-risk areas for flooding. “We're looking at this moral hazard where if risk is priced below the actuarially fair level, it's going to encourage an inefficient level of migration to these locations because consumers are essentially getting a bargain on this,” Scott said. “A lot of these properties were getting charged like $500 premiums when they should have been something closer to like $5,000, $10,000, or something like that.”

The first step is to have a blunt, realistic assessment of the risks, particularly those exacerbated by climate change. “I would anticipate a continuing pattern of worsening storm damage from rainfall, flooding events, and also from hurricane and tropical storm events,” said Jim Blackburn, a professor in the civil engineering department at Rice University in Houston studying severe storms and floods. “I don't think we've been honest about these facts about our changing risk profile.”

Getting people to take flood risks seriously, even in areas that have seen extensive floods in recent memory, has been difficult. In 2011, after Hurricane Ike, the Houston suburb of Clear Lake installed signs around town showing that storm surge could reach as high as 20 feet. But residents complained that the signs were hurting property values and they were soon taken down. Houston itself has built up thousands more properties in flood-prone areas since Harvey. The local flood control district is still using old flood maps that predate the damage revealed from the storm.

The next step is to act on these risk assessments. The Environmental Defense Fund's Kousky said FEMA could restore and enhance grant programs that help communities mitigate risks, like restoring watersheds and building levees. Federal, state, and local governments also need to put more money toward adaptation.

It's also important to remember insured losses don't tell the whole story. Increasingly, Americans are facing greater flood risks in places that lack any financial protection. A 2024 working paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that 70 percent of property losses to floods are uninsured, totaling $17.1 billion in damages. Even for those who are insured, as flood policies get more expensive, more homeowners are letting their coverage lapse, and the total damage from floods is far outpacing what's covered by insurance.

And flood insurance loss tallies mainly capture homeowners, not renters. Apartment dwellers also get displaced during floods, but don't get as much help in relocating or returning after a disaster.

It's also worth rethinking the role of NFIP. It may never work as a business proposition, and there's no way around the core fact that losses from floods are growing. If NFIP charges for its policies in line with the risk, few people would be able to afford them. And if they continue to subsidize rates, homeowners will continue to live in risky areas, damages will continue to rise, and the program will keep losing money.

Should it be viewed as a public service, like the Marine Corps or the Postal Office, something that serves a purpose but is not designed to turn a profit? In that case, we may just have to let NFIP again slide on the money it owes the Treasury.

The real challenge is for states and local governments to say no to new buildings and pulling people back from existing structures in high-risk areas. In places like Florida and Texas that don't have income taxes, the states get much of their money from property taxes, which gives state lawmakers an incentive to encourage more property development, particularly in high-value areas like riverfronts and coasts. “If you think about these communities just in terms of economic incentives, the tax revenue that they're going to get from this high-value home that's got this beautiful view of the water, that's a big boon to the community,” said University of Georgia's Ragin.

There needs to be a strong message from policymakers that building in a floodplain is dangerous. That's not just a signal from insurance companies, but from policymakers to actively discourage and relocate people. “In my opinion, federal, state, and local policies need to be to move people out of the floodplain over time,” Blackburn said. “These areas are only going to get more and more water.”

A home is often the single most expensive thing anyone buys, and people spend years paying it off. Getting people to adapt or retreat will be a slow process, even as disaster losses continue to mount. “You have to do that in a gradual manner,” said Scott at the University of Texas Dallas. “It could take decades.” In the meantime, America's main financial tool for dealing with floods will plummet even further underwater.

﻿One author's quest to get to the bottom of our self-improvement obsession.

Peruse the self-help aisle at your local neighborhood bookstore, and you'll likely find tomes giving you all kinds of advice. Titles that tell us to “let them” or develop “atomic habits” or offer an expletive-laden guide to caring less.

For all the critiques of the multibillion-dollar self-help industry, it sells, launching the high-profile careers of authors and influencers and ways of life for its followers. What is it about self-help that we find irresistible?

That's the question author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro set out to answer with her book Promise Land: My Journey Through America's Self-Help Culture. It's a topic she has personal investment in. “My dad was a child psychologist, and he wrote parenting books. And I later found out that he used me as an example,” she says. Her experience left her skeptical of self-help culture, so she set out to explore it by trying the guidance in several self-help guides.

Though her experience was unique, she says it's not all that different from the culture of self-help we all interact with. “That kind of stuff percolates, even if you're not reading self-help books,” Lamb tells Vox. “It's so woven into the fabric of our experience that I think everyone grew up with self-help, even if they didn't grow up reading self-help books or having a self-help book writer for a dad.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

It seems that when it comes to self-improvement, we just can't help ourselves. But is this attempt at optimization actually leading to our isolation? That's what we discuss on this week's episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Lamb-Shapiro, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

How long have self-help books been around?

The first incarnation of self-help was in the mid-1800s. There was a writer named Samuel Smiles. He wrote for the Leeds Times, and there was a society called the Mutual Improvement Society. They invited him to give a lecture, and he told these anecdotes about working men rising from poverty into positions of power. It was hugely successful. People loved the stories. So he started doing more and more lectures and then eventually made it into a book. The book was called Self-Help. It came out in 1859. It was immediately a bestseller.

So it was popular way before I thought. You can also find predecessors in the Greek Stoics, from around 160, 180 AD. There was a Roman emperor named Marcus Aurelius who wrote a book called Meditations. That book is actually sold as a self-help book today. If you go to your bookstore and you look in the self-help section, you could find Marcus Aurelius's self-help.

Every man I know reads about stoicism. So yes, I do know that name quite well.

When I was writing the book, I was like, oh, this is Don't Sweat the Small Stuff. Do you remember that book?

Yes.

It was a bestselling book when I was growing up — so '80s, '90s. And it basically is the same thing with a different, more dire message: “We're all going to die one day, so who cares?” It's repackaged for today's happy America, but it is basically the same message. So any self-help book you find today, there's always a predecessor of a hundred years or earlier.

How big is the self-help industry?

The global self-help industry is worth between $45 billion and $59 billion. It's also called personal growth or self-improvement, not always self-help. And this isn't just books, but it's also courses and TikToks and affirmation-a-day calendars.

You did all of this work, and part of it was to find out if self-help books are a scam. Are they?

This is a very difficult question. I wouldn't say that they're a scam. There are so many self-help books. There's good ones, there's bad ones, there's bad ones that have some good qualities. If you don't take everything as gospel, you can kind of pick and choose what's helpful and what's not helpful.

“You could be richer, you could be hotter, you could be smarter, you could be more popular, you could be faster.”

Why are we so drawn to these books?

The idea that whatever your life is, it could be better is really appealing. You could be richer, you could be hotter, you could be smarter, you could be more popular, you could be faster. It's just an idea that's very appealing to us as human beings: that we could just be more awesome than we are right now or have more awesome stuff than we have right now. I mean, I'm always trying to do things better. I'm trying to learn, I'm trying to be smarter. I'm trying to be more social, leave my house more, be a better dog owner.

It's interesting because you started out pretty skeptical of self-help, going into writing this book. Do you still feel that way or have you found redeeming things in it?

I've definitely found redeeming things in it. I also absolutely think you should always retain a bit of skepticism and a little bit of cynicism when you're encountering self-help. I was in my 30s when I wrote the book. I'm in my 40s now, and a lot has happened politically and socially. The pandemic happened, and those were some tough times for me and for everybody. So I feel like I have a lot more sympathy for the urge to self-help and the idea of it, even if it doesn't get realized in the books.

What's changed about self-help in recent years? Anything at all?

One thing I've noticed is that self-help has become better and more mainstream. I'm thinking of someone like Brené Brown, who is an academic researcher and actually has studies to back up the things she's saying, but also is sometimes seen as a self-help writer. Certainly, her books have helped people. So there's kind of an elevation of the discussion, where it's a little bit more intellectual. I think that appeals to more people. They've brought in a whole new audience to self-help, and I think in a way the books have become better as a result.

Do you think we're overdoing it on self-help? Are we trying too hard to fully optimize ourselves to be our best selves?

Yes, absolutely. I think we're obsessed with betterment and productivity. I don't think that's healthy, necessarily. Self-help books are appealing if you're thinking, “I'm going to go to therapy for years and I'm going to spend thousands of dollars, or I could just buy this book for 20 bucks, and feel better immediately, and maybe get something out of it.”

“We're obsessed with betterment and productivity. I don't think that's healthy, necessarily.”

But I think we're really losing the community aspect. When you're talking about self-help, everything is done by yourself. When you do that, you lose the opportunity to have a community and to strengthen your relationships with other people. When I try to help myself on my own, I'm still by myself. Whereas if I ask for help, I am strengthening my relationships, and I'm getting a lot more out of it than just the help that I was looking for.

That sense of community is really important, and so many people are feeling lonely and alienated. To actually make contact with another person or an organization is really beneficial. Not just to society — because it's definitely beneficial to society to have people invested in the community — but also to the individual to feel like they have community support and they're not just completely isolated and alone.

Environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben on why “you can't stop the sun.”

Talking about climate change can feel hopeless. Even the good news, on the rare occasion we get some, feels hollow.

But for the most part, it's bad news. The planet keeps heating up. So many of the disasters we were warned about years ago are starting to pile on. Meanwhile, the oil keeps flowing, the politicians keep punting, and the systems meant to save us keep failing.

Now we're staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency and the potential unraveling of what little climate progress we've made. But there's a twist: Solar and wind are booming, and they're now the world's cheapest energy sources. Many cities, towns, and in some cases countries are running almost entirely on renewables. That is all great news.

But what does it actually mean? Is it too late to turn this thing around?

Bill McKibben is one of the most influential voices on the climate over the past four decades. He sounded the alarm in his 1989 book The End of Nature, which many consider a foundational text of the modern environmentalist movement. He's also founded organizations like Third Act and 350.org, the latter of which remains one of the biggest climate activist groups in the world.

His new book, Here Comes the Sun, is about the revolution in solar and wind power and it might be the most hopeful thing he's ever written. And that's because we now have the tools we need to tackle this problem. The question is, do we have the political will to do it?

I invited McKibben onto The Gray Area to talk about that and the many possibilities in front of us. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

This book is much more optimistic than I expected. It doesn't feel forced; it feels like you're genuinely excited about what's possible.

It's an odd moment for me. Much of what I've been describing since The End of Nature in the late '80s is now happening in real time. We're watching the climate system come apart. Politically, I don't think I've lived through a bleaker period. And yet, at the same time, I have news of one big good thing: a transformation in how we make and use energy that's actually moving fast enough to matter. So I get to be the bearer of some good news, for once.

You're clear that we're past being able to “stop” global warming. So what's the plausible goal now?

Stopping warming entirely isn't on the menu. What might still be on the menu is stopping it short of the point where it cuts civilization off at the knees. That's the goal here. Recent science about the jet stream, the Gulf stream, and the atmosphere's moisture content is scary. These are enormous systems with momentum. But every tenth of a degree matters. Each tenth we avoid keeps tens or hundreds of millions of people within a livable climate zone. That remains the biggest task humans have ever had: keep the damage within survivable limits.

Right — this isn't binary. Degrees matter. Fractions of degrees matter.

That's why the clean energy news is so important. I've covered this long enough to feel the ground shifting, and the pace has surprised even people in the climate and energy world. California, which is the fourth-largest economy on Earth, has quietly hit a tipping point. On many days, it supplies more than 100 percent of its power for long stretches from clean energy.

When the sun goes down, batteries that spent the afternoon soaking up surplus sunshine now become the biggest source of electricity. The net result is that California used about 40 percent less natural gas for electricity this summer than two years ago. If that spreads globally, you start shaving tenths of a degree off the future. That's the best number I've heard in almost 40 years of doing this.

We're talking in mid-August, more than six months into President Donald Trump's second term. He ran promising to “drill, baby, drill” and to kneecap electric vehicles. Has he delivered?

He's doing extraordinary damage and he's doing it with the spineless support of a lot of Republicans who know better.

I'll make two points. First, this is a global crisis and a global energy market. What Trump is really doing — and this should make any American furious — is ceding the energy future to China, often for technologies that were developed here. We invented the solar cell and the lithium-ion battery. Now we're practically handing the future to Beijing on a platter. In the long run, that might still be good for the planet because they're pushing these technologies everywhere, but it's a staggering abdication by the US.

Second, even here at home, the story isn't finished. The most interesting state in America for energy right now is Texas. It's installing renewables faster than California. In the spring, fossil fuel interests tried to ram through a “DEI for gas” bill, which is basically forcing one unit of gas buildout for every unit of solar. People in rural Texas came out of the woodwork to say, Don't do this. Wind and solar keep schools open, fund elder care. These are real, tangible benefits. The legislature backed down. So even in red states, the economics and the local benefits are changing the politics.

And one reason I'm optimistic is that a lot of this is now mundane economics. We live on a planet where the cheapest way to make power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. This is no longer the Whole Foods of energy — nice but pricey. It's the Costco of energy: cheap, abundant, on the shelf, ready to go.

The federal picture is obviously grim. The EPA under Trump revoked a long-held scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare, which is the legal basis for a lot of climate regulation. Is this as bad as it looks? Do you think the courts will stop it?

It will be challenged. We'll see what happens. But it's an “up is down” administration. They insist DC is a crime-ridden hellscape when the data say otherwise, and they insist climate's no big deal as entire neighborhoods burn, as Texas floods, as wildfire smoke becomes a seasonal feature in the East, and as we log the hottest months in recorded history. But physics doesn't care about press releases. The danger is the damage they can do in the meantime. So we can't just rely on the superior economics of solar, wind, and batteries. We also need activism to change laws and minds. There's a lot that states and cities can do — even with Washington hostile.

Give me a concrete example.

Rooftop solar in the US costs roughly three times as much, and takes far longer, than in many other countries. In Australia, you can call on Monday and have panels up by Friday; 40 percent of homes there have rooftop solar. The difference isn't the price of panels; it's our baroque, Byzantine permitting across 15,000 municipalities. We're treating a safe, standardized appliance like it's a bespoke construction project. The National Renewable Energy Lab built an instant-permitting tool — SolarAPP+ — and states like California, Maryland, and New Jersey have adopted it. We should scale that everywhere.

Another example is “balcony solar.” In the past two years, millions of Europeans — apartment-dwellers! — have bought a plug-in panel that hangs off the balcony and instantly supplies around 20 percent of a home's power. That's illegal across the US, except in Utah, where a libertarian state senator asked the obvious question: Why can Hamburg do it but Provo can't? The law changed unanimously. Now you can find people in Utah happily plugging in balcony panels and watching the meter spin backward.

Why did so many people — including environmentalists — so badly underestimate how fast solar and wind would scale?

For decades, fossil energy was cheap and renewable energy was expensive. That got lodged in our heads. Even climate advocates focused on things like carbon taxes to raise fossil prices so renewables could compete. But about four or five years ago we crossed an invisible line and people didn't update. Today, it's often twice as cheap to make power from sun as from fire.

If you want a date, I'd circle June 2023. That's when global temperatures began their latest spike. Some of the hottest months in at least 125,000 years, and it's also the month humanity started installing a gigawatt of solar every day. Since then the pace has only accelerated. In April, China alone was installing around 3 gigawatts per day, which is the equivalent of a coal plant's capacity every eight hours.

In your book, you note that in 2022, China spent 26 times as much on the clean energy supply chain as Europe and the US combined. The Inflation Reduction Act was starting to narrow that gap. With Trump back, how dramatically will that change? Will we get anywhere close to that expected number or will China just continue to lap us?

They'll lap us. The IRA was our best chance to catch up; parts may survive, but a lot won't. Twenty years from now, the US may be a kind of theme park where tourists come to see how people used to make energy by setting things on fire. Eventually, we'll try to catch up, but we won't be owning that future anymore.

I wanted to ask about movement politics since you've been so involved for so long. For decades, climate politics was about stopping bad things — pipelines, leases, drilling. But the economics have flipped. The movement now has to be about building. What does that shift look like?

I've been writing for a year that people like me — old white guys — should stop reflexively suing to block projects we don't like. It's absurd to block solar farms because you don't like looking at them. The imperative is to make it easier to build the clean stuff. That's why we're focused on permitting reform at the local and state level.

Washington is a write-off for the moment; rational thought has left the building. But states — red and blue — can move. Texas and Utah show it. And the appeal is broad. If you're a “my home is my castle” American, solar makes that literally truer; if you love the idea of a network powered by something elegant and natural, you're on board for different reasons. Small versus big is the fault line — not left versus right.

Why did this become a red-blue cultural fight when it really doesn't have to be?

The fossil fuel industry spent decades and billions making it partisan. The Koch network effectively bought one of our political parties. Fifty years ago, environmentalism was bipartisan. [Republican President Richard] Nixon signed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and created the EPA under pressure from the first Earth Day. The science has been clear since the '80s, and the oil companies knew. They treated it as a threat to their business model, not to the planet, and were willing to wreck our democracy as well as our atmosphere to defend it. The wild card is that we've now introduced the cheapest, most beautiful form of energy into this mix and that changes the politics.

“Beautiful” isn't a word people associate with utility-scale power — but you lean into it.

It matters! The sun already gives us light, warmth, and photosynthesis. Now it can power everything else. People respond to that. The Vatican just announced it's building a solar farm outside Rome that will make the Vatican the first fully solar-powered nation. That's not just a tech story; it's a civilizational story. Big Oil is still powerful, but a lot of what they're pushing — like leaning on countries to lock themselves into US liquefied natural gas — may backfire. If you're Indonesia or Vietnam, do you really want to tie your future energy supply to a fickle superpower? Or do you want to harvest the sun and wind that fall on your own land and sea?

There's a perverse wrinkle here: Sun and wind are so cheap they don't fit neatly into a profit model built on scarcity. 

It's an investment problem for some incumbents. Returns aren't as juicy as selling fuel forever. But for countries, cheap power is a competitive advantage. If you can run your industries on electricity, your economy hums. That's what China is aiming at. Meanwhile, if the US insists on expensive options — coal, gas, or boutique nuclear — we handicap ourselves.

You also make the blunt point that breaking the centralized power of the fossil fuel industry is a big deal if we do want a more humane politics. What's the argument there?

It's liberating in multiple senses. Cut emissions or the planet fries — that's incentive enough. But we also save lives. About 9 million people die each year from air pollution tied to fossil combustion. We prevent childhood asthma. We reduce the leverage of petro-authoritarians. And we unlock a wave of useful appliances: heat pumps that use a little electricity to move latent heat in the air and keep homes comfortable year-round; EVs and e-bikes that make cities quieter and cleaner.

You really believe there's hope?

I have hope that it's worth the try. I can't think of a better way to spend a life than working on the gravest problem our species has stumbled into.

On page one you say there's still a path forward. When is that path foreclosed? How much warming is too much?

Honestly, we don't know. We've never run this experiment with people watching. The last five times the atmosphere filled with carbon — because of massive volcanic eruptions — there were mass extinctions. We're adding carbon faster now than in those episodes. But unlike volcanoes, our “eruptions” are cars, factories, and power plants we could shut down quickly if we chose. It may be that we've already waited too long. The momentum in polar melt and the knock-on effects on jet and Gulf streams are frightening. I'm not a Pollyanna. My first book was called The End of Nature. But for the first time, we have a scalable response. So we should try like hell and hope the Hollywood ending works at least a little.

Paint the bleak alternative plainly. If we don't get this right, what's the world like in 10, 50, 100 years?

If it's not hell, it's close in temperature. Smokier. Harder to grow food. Biology in shock. Extinctions accelerating. At 3 degrees Celsius, the UN estimates 1 to 3 billion climate refugees. That would mean up to a quarter of humanity forced to move. A couple of million people at our southern border nearly broke American politics; now multiply by a thousand. That's why every tenth of a degree we avoid is the most important political work humans have ever undertaken.

The safe path felt too predictable.","https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-job-ab-inbev-startup-asia-jakarta-indonesia-baskit-company-2025-9","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 00:14:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yann Schuermans, the CEO of Baskit, who is based in Jakarta, Indonesia. His words have been edited for length and clarity.

By 30, my career looked ideal on paper, but I couldn't ignore the pull to create something of my own.

When I was studying international management at the University of Manchester, I spent a year abroad in Hong Kong. That experience opened my eyes to Asia's pace and possibilities, and I knew I wanted to be part of it.

In 2016, two years after graduating, I joined AB InBev's Asia Pacific headquarters in Shanghai. With my Belgian-Brazilian background and a family history in brewing, stepping into the world's largest beer company felt both ambitious and familiar.

I threw myself into the work. By my mid-20s, I was chief of staff to the region's CEO, then general manager for Hong Kong and Macau, and later strategy director and head of M&A for the region. Each role brought more responsibility, more travel, more wins. On the outside, it looked like everything was falling into place.

But inside, I felt married to a single corporate identity. The path ahead was predictable — move back to the Americas and climb higher into the corporate ranks. It would have been a safe choice, but it wasn't what I wanted.

I kept coming back to the same question: What would it look like to start something of my own, without the safety net?

In 2021, I left AB InBev and moved to Singapore to join a hyper-growth startup. That year confirmed that I was ready to take the leap.

The next year, I co-founded Baskit with my wife, Yoonjung Yi. Our goal was to digitize Southeast Asia's fragmented supply chains and help small and medium-sized brands reach the market with better distribution, support, and credit.

The reality hit fast. More than 50 VCs turned us down. We nearly lost our visas, couldn't pay ourselves, and survived on $100,000 in savings from family and personal funds.

But persistence eventually paid off. Through mentors and local networks, we raised $5.5 million. The capital mattered, but the bigger shift was psychological. Once I was responsible for other people's money, failure was no longer just personal.

Entrepreneurship tested me, but I drew on lessons from corporate life.

At AB InBev, I often faced unpredictable situations while traveling to more than 100 countries. Improvisation became second nature, and that mindset turned into my survival kit at Baskit. Ideas rarely show up fully formed. Baskit today looks very different from what I imagined on day one. The key has been composure, resilience, and adaptability when things go sideways.

Fast forward, we've grown to more than 50 people, and we've had a few profitable quarters under our belt. Our early scrappiness built muscles we still rely on.

Day to day, the contrast with corporate life is stark. At AB InBev, my schedule was structured and supported. As a founder, each day is chaos and filled with a mix of sales pitches, fundraising calls, product pivots, and customer complaints. But it's liberating too.

In 2023, we moved from Singapore to Jakarta to be closer to our customers. To really understand the market, we had to live it. We had to sit in traffic with distributors; watch goods move through small shops; and see late payments or stalled deliveries firsthand.

It wasn't easy. Building trust meant hours with wholesalers just to earn another meeting. Infrastructure gaps, language barriers, and constant pivots made every day complicated. But Jakarta was where the lessons — and opportunities — were.

The past two and a half years have been the steepest learning curve of my life. I've had to become a generalist overnight, from treasury management to crisis leadership. I've gained the confidence that I can figure it out.

Building Baskit with Yoonjung has been both the biggest risk and the biggest gift. We share the roller coaster — celebrating wins together, pushing through low points side by side. But our lives, careers, and future plans are all tied to one venture, which can compound the stress, especially as we think about starting a family.

During the toughest fundraising days, we leaned on each other's resolve. We'd met at AB InBev, where she worked as HR Manager, so blending work and life always came naturally.

Now, we balance responsibilities. I focus on external growth and sales, while she manages operations and team culture. With our third co-founder, Abhishek Pansari, covering strategy, we've learned to complement one another without overlap.

If I've learned anything, it's that you don't wait for the ""right"" time to leap. Corporate life will always tempt you with another promotion, another bonus, another milestone. Cover your basics, then take the jump. The rest, you'll figure out along the way.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm an Uber and Lyft driver who tried a robotaxi for the first time. I'm not impressed.","https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-driver-tries-waymo-tesla-robotaxis-first-time-reaction-2025-9","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 10:33:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Munderloh, a part-time ride-hailing driver of 10 years and lifelong San Francisco resident. It has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider paid for Munderloh's rides in a Waymo and a Tesla robotaxi.

I'm from San Francisco and have been driving for Uber and Lyft for 10 years.

I also organize a group called Rideshare Drivers United in the Bay Area.

I've seen the Waymos, the Cruises, and the Zooxes around the city but have avoided taking robotaxis. I don't want to give these companies money, and I don't support their business model. I'm always happy to talk with other rideshare drivers — it's part of what I do as a union organizer.

I had some safety concerns, but I also think having the added element of a human driver makes travel better and more efficient.

After my experience, I'd give Waymo and Tesla's robotaxi four out of five stars. The rides felt fine, but I think there's always room for improvement.

The pros are what I thought they might be: You don't have to deal with a person — at least in a Waymo.

But I would've liked to talk to a person. I like talking to people.

Every person that I get a ride from — they're from Eritrea, they're from Bangalore, they're from some place I just never really thought about, and I get to be near this person, talk to them, and find out what they think of the city that I grew up in.

I think that's amazing.

[Spokespeople for Tesla, Waymo, and Uber didn't respond to requests for comment.]

I appreciated that the Waymo pulled up with its hazard lights on. I think that's the right thing to do.

The Waymo, however, stopped about a block away from where we were. I could miss a star or get a low rating for pulling up that far away from a rider for sure.

My immediate impression of the ride was that it was pretty smooth. It's not zippy, but not frustratingly slow. The inside of the car was reasonably well-maintained.

The Waymo also has good eyes. The interface on the center console showed that it had noticed the turn signal coming from a truck a few lanes over.

I see the appeal of having time to yourself in a car and being able to put on whatever music you want. But I didn't like the part where I was sitting next to an empty driver's seat.

It just felt strange, and it's hard to say why. The Waymo didn't quite have the personality of a human. For example, it was always exactly in the middle of the lane.

Maybe that's why I got the uncanny valley feeling — you can't quite place it, but something's not quite right.

But after a while, the novelty of not having a person there wore off quickly. Maybe I'm jaded because I've seen them around the city for a long time, but I wouldn't pay more for one of those.

It was fine. It was a car ride.

I like Teslas. I considered buying the car before I ended up with a Chevy Bolt, which kind of has similar styling inside as a Tesla in some ways.

I approved of the route the vehicle took. The navigation and ride felt mostly the same as the Waymo. It felt safe under the conditions we were in.

The Waymo felt a little more conservative, while the Tesla's acceleration was just a little bit quicker.

Overall, they're just normal drivers.

I might use entertainment options like Netflix or YouTube if it were a long drive or if I were particularly internet-addicted. However, most of these things you'd do on your phone anyway.

It's interesting that a person is sitting in the car with you. One of the main draws of Waymo is that you're alone in the car.

However, I do appreciate that there's a driver there at least because if something went wrong, there would be somebody to take over in a way a Waymo can't.

But at the point, what's the purpose? Why not have the driver there the whole time?

So there are mixed feelings. It seems kind of pointless on one hand, but on the other hand, the point is to get to a destination safely, and sometimes, you need a human for that.

I think I'm a better driver than a robotaxi — for now.

I would've gotten to the destinations quicker and safer with a more efficient route.

Waymo and Tesla did as good a job as they could, given the technology the cars are equipped with — cameras, lidars, or maps.

Having a person in the car who can pick up all the cues of the environment like the smells, the sights, the anticipation of where construction will likely be in one part of the city — all these little things that have nothing to do with the simplest form of driving — those are real things and they really do help you get from one place to another.

The robotaxis also don't have personality. The experience was a little sterile.

There's the loss of human connection, which is something I would hate to lose.

We're already so disconnected from each other that we're able to self-select human experiences that we have with each other.

It does not end well if we just continue not to think about other people and not know about other people's very different experiences from our own.

However, most of what I think about robotaxis is about its economic impacts — and that doesn't stop at the fact that it's putting a driver out of work or driving their wages down.

That driver who just lost their job? They used to spend in the local economy.

I would like people to evaluate what that would mean for San Francisco, that suddenly, many people not only lose their jobs but are not spending money back into the economy.

For the most part, the reason people think that robotaxis are inevitable is because we haven't really fought to create any control over whether we're going to have autonomous vehicles on our roads in any organized way.

As a matter of what's happening on our roads that we pay for through our taxes, this should be something that's worked out somewhat democratically in a way that it hasn't been.

I don't want to remove these things from the roads entirely — unless that's what the people want.

I don't want to be a parent or employee who falls behind.","https://www.businessinsider.com/vibe-coding-maternity-leave-mom-upskill-tips-cursor-laura-zaccaria-2025-9","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Laura Zaccaria, a Singapore-based HR professional and new mom who taught herself to build an AI-assisted web app while on six months of maternity leave. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I've never studied anything related to coding.

My husband started to dabble with vibe coding. He replicated my not-for-profit yoga organization website and sent me the link. He was like, ""See what you can do now in a couple of hours?"" I was quite intrigued.

He was going to sign up for a class called Code with AI in June. He asked me, ""Why don't you come with me?""

I suppose what he was trying to do was nudge me into exploring something else. Becoming a mother was a very life-altering experience — suddenly, my baby became the center of my world.

I was very intimidated because I didn't know anything about coding and how to use ChatGPT. I didn't even have a personal laptop to install the software needed, so I bought one for this class.

It's a weekend thing and a few hours from my baby, but we have help at home. So, I went along with him. It's a capsule of time before going back to work, and in a career, you rarely get that.

As a new mom, I started to think about my baby's weaning — he's starting to eat solid food. I thought, How are we going to plan all the meals when I go back to work? Maybe I'll try to build something to tackle that: a family meal planner.

I kept working on it after the course, mostly in the evenings or when the baby was napping. On weekends, my husband would take the baby away for a couple of hours or just play with him so I could keep working on it.

It kept my brain active in a different way. When I went on leave, I unplugged from corporate life and was fully focused on caring for a small human. That uses such a different part of your brain.

Picking up new skills gave me confidence that I can continue to evolve. Being a mom is not my sole identity.

When I was coding, I mainly used Cursor.

If I got stuck, I'd just ask Cursor, and it would tell me, ""Here's what you can do, here's where to look."" It wasn't just building the app — it was also guiding me.

I faced a technical hurdle with sign-ups and confirmation emails. There were limitations to how many emails the database could send and how customizable they were. When my husband, my brother, and friends tried to test the app, we hit those limits fast.

Eventually I had to find another platform to handle verification emails and password resets, then integrate it as another layer on top. It sounds basic, but before building this I never thought twice about how that logic actually works.

Sometimes, you get stuck in a loop. Generative AI can be like a young, over-enthusiastic intern. You need to know when to pause and ask yourself: Where was I not clear? And sometimes it's OK to scrap the whole conversation and start afresh.

A few times, what Cursor created was not what I wanted. I realized I hadn't phrased things properly, or I had asked for something too big. Then I'd have to break it down again. That was probably the main skill I picked up, which I now use not just for building an app but for any other generative AI tool.

What this made me realize is how far the technology has come.

People in tech already know this — I have friends at places like Workday, Salesforce, Google, and Meta, and they're under a lot of pressure from their employers to pick up these skills because they have to deploy these solutions.

I was astonished by how quickly things were improving, even while I was building my app.

Some things became easier to unlock week by week. It made me want to stay up to speed, because I'm sure that what I learned now will be semi-obsolete in just a couple of months.

Before, if someone said AI is coming for your job, I might have panicked. But once you learn about it, it becomes less daunting.

And with my baby, I know the tools he grows up with will be completely different from what I had, or what my parents had. It emphasized that we need to keep up so that we can understand the world he'll grow up in.

When I was younger and mobile phones came out, my parents were shocked: What is a smartphone? What do you even do with apps? I hope I won't be like that. I want to understand what my son is using, how he's learning, and the world he'll grow up in.

John Oliver warned that Jimmy Kimmel's show being pulled off the air was the latest warning sign that free speech is under attack in the US.

On an episode of his talk show ""Last Week Tonight,"" aired late on Sunday, the British American comedian said Kimmel was ""by no means the first casualty in Trump's attacks on free speech.""

""He's just the latest canary in the coal mine,"" Oliver said. ""A mine that at this point now seems more dead canary than coal.""

Kimmel's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" was indefinitely suspended by Disney after Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, criticized Kimmel's comments about the killing of the conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.

Oliver devoted the majority of his 40-minute-long episode to talking about Kimmel's suspension.

He criticized Carr for walking back what the commissioner said in a 2023 statement about free speech being a check on government control, and the comedian slammed the broadcasters Sinclair and Nexstar for what he characterized as bending to the FCC's will.

Oliver joined the ranks of comedy talk-show hosts who have weighed in on Kimmel's suspension.

On Thursday night, four of late night's best-known voices — Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart — criticized Disney's move and defended Kimmel.

Stewart gave a sarcastic monologue on the suspension. Meyers said it was a ""big moment for our democracy."" Colbert called it a ""blatant assault on the freedom of speech."" And Fallon said he hoped Kimmel would get his show back.

Oliver's segment on Kimmel was longer and more critical than those of the American talk show hosts. He said his show was less susceptible to FCC pressure because it wasn't on broadcast TV.

He ended the segment on Kimmel by urging media companies to stand up against ""stupid, ridiculous demands.""

A representative for Oliver didn't respond to a request for comment.

In this article

Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as the artificial intelligence lab sets out to build hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers based around the chipmaker's AI processors, the companies said on Monday.

OpenAI plans to build and deploy Nvidia systems that require 10 gigawatts of power, the companies said on Monday. A gigawatt is a measure of power that is increasingly being used to describe the biggest clusters of AI chips.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview in San Jose, California, that the 10 gigawatts is equal to between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units (GPUs), which is what the company will ship in total this year and ""twice as much as last year.""

""This is a giant project,"" Huang said, in the interview alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, the company's president.

Nvidia stock rose almost 4% during on Monday, instantly adding roughly $170 billion in value to the company's market cap, which now sits close to $4.5 trillion.

The partnership, which Huang described as ""monumental in size,"" highlights the intimate link between OpenAI and Nvidia, two of the biggest drivers of the recent AI boom. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs started picking up when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies GPUs to develop its software and deploy it to users.

""Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,"" Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, told CNBC after the announcement. ""I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.""

It further signals the magnitude of Nvidia technology that OpenAI will need to develop next-generation AI that can do more than its current models. OpenAI was already in need of an increasing number of chips to serve its users. The company said it had 700 million active weekly users.

""You should expect a lot from us in the coming months,"" Altman said in the interview. ""There are three things that OpenAI has to do well: we have to do great AI research, we have to make these products people want to use, and we have to figure out how to do this unprecedented infrastructure challenge.""

The companies said the investment will be deployed ""progressively"" as the infrastructure is built and that Nvidia would be a ""preferred"" supplier for OpenAI for chips and networking gear. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, but faces increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices and cloud providers which are developing their own chips and systems to tie them together.

In August, Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of that is for Nvidia chips and systems.

Nvidia and OpenAI said that the first phase of the latest investment will come online in the second half of 2026, using Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin systems.

Nvidia's investment comes after a roster of investors valued OpenAI at $500 billion in a recent secondary round. Microsoft was one of OpenAI's early investors, and has a strategic partnership to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office. Other OpenAI investors include SoftBank and Thrive Capital.

The companies said on Monday that the partnership will compliment the infrastructure work it is doing with Microsoft, Oracle, SoftBank and the Stargate project.

Altman referred to Nvidia and Microsoft as ""passive"" investors and two of the company's ""most critical partners"" in the CNBC interview.

Huang said Nvidia's investment is ""additive to everything that's been announced and contracted."" He indicated to CNBC that it's in addition to anything the company has told Wall Street about its financial expectations.

While this investment dwarfs Nvidia's prior commitments, the chipmaker has been opening its wallet of late to put funds in many companies in and around the industry.

Last week, Nvidia said it's taken a $5 billion stake in Intel and announced that the two companies will collaborate on AI processors. Nvidia also said it invested close to $700 million in U.K. data center startup Nscale. And CNBC reported on Thursday that the company spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI startup, and to license the company's technology.

Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayor's race, on Monday said he was dropping out of an upcoming WABC-TV town hall because of the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show by ABC under pressure from the Trump administration.

""I am withdrawing from an ABC town hall that was scheduled to take place this Thursday,"" Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, said at an event on Roosevelt Island, according to a transcript released by his campaign.

""I am withdrawing not as an indictment of the local affiliate or the hardworking journalists, but rather in response to the corporate leaders who have put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press,"" Mamdani said.

He blasted WABC's owner, ABC, whose corporate parent Disney remains mum on the question of when — or if — Kimmel's show will return after it was yanked under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission because of comments he made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. 

ABC said last week that the ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!' show is off the air ""indefinitely"" on the heels of Nexstar Media Group saying that its stations affiliated with ABC would preempt Kimmel's show ""for the foreseeable future"" because of the host's statements tying Kirk's alleged killer to the MAGA movement.

""We cannot understand this moment of authoritarianism as solely coming from the White House, when it is also characterized by the cowardice of those in response to it — the cowardice that we have seen typified whether by the parent company of ABC or by so-called leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams looking to the White House for their path to their future ambition,"" Mamdani said.

Cuomo, a former New York governor, and the current New York City Mayor Adams are running as independents against Mamdani.

Meanwhile, a slew of Oscar winners and other Hollywood artists are backing Kimmel in a new letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union.

""Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation,"" said the ACLU's letter, which has more than 400 signatories.

""In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees,"" the letter says.

Stars who signed the letter include Academy Award winners Robert DeNiro, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Frances McDormand.

President Donald Trump raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000 on Friday, leaving companies scrambling to respond.

With many left wondering whether their careers will remain in tact, here's a breakdown of the new H-1B fees:

As of Sunday, H-1B visa applications will require a $100,000 payment. Previously, visa fees ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company.

Employers now must have documentation of the payment prior to filing an H-1B petition on behalf of a worker. Applicants will have their petitions restricted for 12 months until the payment is made, according to the White House. 

The fee will only be applied to new H-1B applicants, not renewals or current visa holders, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The fee will be implemented in the upcoming lottery cycle.

Those who already have H-1B visas and are located outside the U.S. will not be required to pay the fee in order to re-enter.

Leavitt also clarified that the $100,000 is a one-time payment and not an annual charge.

Exceptions can be made to any immigrant whose employment is deemed essential in the national interest by the Secretary of Homeland Security and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the U.S.

Employees with B visas who have start dates prior to October 2026 will also receive additional guidance in order to prevent using those temporary business visas as a workaround for H-1B visas.

H-1B visas allows highly skilled foreign professionals to work in specialty occupations that generally require at least a bachelor's degree to fulfill the role. Jobs in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, usually qualify.

Many employers use H-1B workers to fill the gaps in these highly technical roles that are not found within the American labor supply. 

Companies in the tech and finance sectors rely heavily on these specially-skilled immigrants, particularly from India and China, which accounted for 71% and 11.7% of visa holders last year, respectively.

The current annual cap for H-1B visas is 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution. A lottery system is used to select additional petitions if demand exceeds the cap.

Since 2012, about 60% or more of approved H-1B workers had computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research.

Amazon was the top employer for H-1B holders in the fiscal year 2025, sponsoring over 10,000 applicants by the end of June, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Microsoft and Meta had over 5,000 each, while Apple and Google rounded out the top six with over 4,000 approvals.

In this article

A preliminary deal to keep TikTok alive in the United States will not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a ""golden share"" in the social media company, a senior White House official said Monday.

The official confirmed that the deal will base the popular video app's U.S. operations in the states as part of a new joint venture with a board of directors that will have a majority of American members. 

None of those board members will be selected by the government, the official said during a call with reporters.

Tech giant Oracle will oversee its security operations, the official said.

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order later this week backing the proposed deal, and once again extending the deadline when TikTok could face a U.S. ban, the White House said.

When asked to clarify that the deal is finalized, an official expressed confidence that China has approved it and that it will not get hung up on any regulatory hurdles.

Since Trump took office in January, the United States government has secured a golden share in U.S. Steel and taken an equity stake in Intel. A golden share effectively gives Trump veto power over key business decisions at the company.

ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, faces an ultimatum under a federal law requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S. That law passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress who expressed national security concerns about the app and its potent content algorithm.

Trump, who says he likes TikTok, has repeatedly extended the divest-or-ban deadline. Last week, he signed an executive order delaying it until Dec. 16.

In this article

Oracle is promoting its presidents of cloud infrastructure, Clay Magouyrk, and industries, Mike Sicilia, to co-CEOs, the company announced Monday.

Safra Catz, the software giant's current CEO, will serve as executive vice chair on the company board.

Larry Ellison will remain Oracle's board chairman and chief technology officer. He has been active outside the company, helping to finance Skydance Media's merger in August with CBS News' parent company, Paramount Global. The combined company, run by Ellison's son, David, is now exploring an acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery, CNBC reported earlier this month.

Oracle has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom thanks to its cloud infrastructure business and its access to Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are both needed to run large workloads. Oracle and other major cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are in a fierce competition for customers.

As Oracle's cloud infrastructure president, Magouyrk led the development of its Gen2 platform. Sicilia oversaw Oracle's applications for vertical businesses, from banking to retail.

""A few years ago, Clay and Mike committed Oracle's Infrastructure and Applications businesses to AI—it's paying off,"" Oracle founder and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison said in a statement.

Shares of the company rose 3% on Monday morning.

Oracle's stock has surged 30% in the past month after its first-quarter earnings report projected massive cloud growth from the AI boom. Shares are up about 85% for the year.

The company said that its remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, soared to $455 billion, up 359% from a year earlier. The company also reaffirmed its financial guidance on Monday.

""At this time of strength is the right moment to pass the CEO role to the next generation of capable executives,"" Catz said in a statement.

For decades, Oracle grew by selling licenses to database software that stores and serve up data for a variety of processes inside companies. The company also fielded applications and middleware. In the early 2010s, with Amazon gaining a foothold in information technology with its cloud-based services for computing, storage and databases, Oracle set out to build its own cloud. It wasn't immediately popular, prompting the company to bring out a second generation of infrastructure in 2018.

Oracle's cloud picked up business from young technology companies TikTok and Zoom. The real momentum came after OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, as Oracle sought to rent out Nvidia graphics chips for training and running AI models. It won business from cloud competitor Microsoft. More recently Oracle picked up a $300 billion contract from OpenAI over five years, starting in 2027.

On Monday, Oracle hinted at its corporate transformation toward AI-led cloud infrastructure, calling its webcast to announce the executive transition ""AI Changes Everything.""

Catz was named co-CEO of Oracle in 2014 alongside Mark Hurd after Ellison stepped down from the role. Hurd died in 2019, and Catz continued to lead the company as its sole CEO. Catz joined Oracle in 1999 after 13 years of investment banking at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and in 2005 she became Oracle's finance chief.

Catz departs her role after selling over $2.5 billion in stock in 2025, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. She was also one of just 55 women to lead a Fortune 500 company.

Oracle is also involved in the Trump administration's ongoing negotiations around social media platform TikTok, as CNBC has previously reported.

TikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless its Chinese parent company ByteDance divested from U.S. operations.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Saturday said Oracle will be responsible for maintaining TikTok's data and privacy in the U.S. The platform will be owned by an investor consortium that includes Oracle and Silver Lake, and Oracle will keep its cloud deal with the platform, sources told CNBC's David Faber earlier this month.

Oracle also said it was promoting two other executives. Mark Hura, executive vice president of North America sales, will become president of global field operations, and Doug Kehring, executive vice president of operations, will assume the role of principal financial officer.

In this article

T-Mobile's current chief operating officer, Srinivasan Gopalan, will take over from Mike Sievert as the next CEO effective Nov. 1, the company said on Monday.

Shares of T-Mobile fell nearly 1% in premarket trading.

Sievert, who took charge as chief executive in April 2020, will move to the newly created position of vice chairman and advise on long-term strategy, innovation and talent development.

Gopalan has held senior leadership positions at Bharti Airtel, Capital One and Vodafone and most recently served as chief executive of Deutsche Telekom's Germany business, where he is credited with doubling the company's growth rate and scaling its fiber business.

Gopalan had served on T-Mobile's board for nearly four years and took on the COO role in March.

The company in July raised its annual forecast for postpaid net customer additions and added more wireless subscribers than expected in the second quarter.

In this article

Pfizer on Monday said it would buy weight loss drugmaker Metsera in an up to $7.3 billion deal, including future payments, as it scrambles to win a slice in the booming obesity drug market. 

Pfizer said it will pay an initial $47.50 a share in cash for Metsera, a nearly 43% premium to the biotech company's Friday's closing price of $33.32. That gives the deal an enterprise value of $4.9 billion. 

The pact also includes a contingent value right worth up to $22.50 a share based on potential clinical and regulatory achievements for Metsera's medicines, which could bring the total value to $70 a share. 

The deal is expected to close at the end of the year. Shares of Metsera rose more than 60% in premarket trading on Monday, while Pfizer's stock rose more than 1%. 

The move comes after a string of setbacks for Pfizer in the obesity space. The pharmaceutical giant struggled to develop its own lead obesity drug candidate, danuglipron, before deciding to scrap it entirely in April due to safety concerns. Pfizer also discontinued a different once-daily pill in June 2023 due to elevated liver enzymes in patients who received it. 

Pfizer has earlier-stage obesity drugs in its pipeline that work in different ways, but the company has faced mounting investor pressure to accelerate its push into the market.

The opportunity could be huge. Some analysts expect the weight loss drug space could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s, with room for new rivals to compete with popular injections from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

Metsera, founded in 2022, brings a pipeline of both oral and injectable treatments with different targets that the company had picked up through its own licensing and acquisition deals. That includes a GLP-1 drug called MET-233i, which helped patients lose up to 8.4% of their weight in 36 days in a small, early-stage trial. Metsera is developing that treatment as a potential once-monthly injectable, meaning that patients can take it less frequently than existing weekly injections.

Metsera's pipeline also includes a monthly drug targeting a hormone called amylin, along with two oral GLP-1 candidates ""expected to begin trials imminently,"" Pfizer said in a release. 

""The proposed acquisition of Metsera aligns with our focus on directing our investments to the most impactful opportunities and propels Pfizer into this key therapeutic area,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. ""We are excited to apply our deep cardiometabolic experience and manufacturing and commercial infrastructure to accelerate a portfolio that includes potential best-in-class injectables.""

In a note on Monday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said the firm estimates Metsera's obesity candidates have the potential to generate more than $5 billion in combined peak annual sales. In a separate note on Monday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said Metsera's experimental drugs ""should accelerate"" Pfizer's entry into the market. 

The New York-based Metsera went public this year in one of the biggest biotech listings of 2025. It is among several companies racing to develop next-generation obesity treatments following the success of weekly injections such as Eli Lilly's obesity drug Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival Wegovy.

Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager who partly contributed to the trading explosion in Opendoor, unveiled his new pick Monday — Better Home & Finance Holding Co. Jackson said his firm holds a position in Better Home but didn't disclose its size.

At one point Monday, Better Home leapt 176% to an intraday high of $94.06 after Jackson touted the stock on X. The New York-based mortgage lender soared more than 36% last week. Better Home's market capitalization was a little more than $500 million as of Friday's close, according to FactSet data.

The EMJ Capital president and founder called Better Home ""the Shopify of mortgages"" and said the company is rebuilding a $15 trillion industry from scratch using artificial intelligence. Shopify is a Canadian e-commerce platform.

Jackson noted that newly public blockchain lender Figure Technology Solutions has a much higher multiple that Better Home.

To the average investor, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds may not seem very different.

After all, they are both relatively liquid baskets of stocks, bonds and other assets overseen by professional money managers, and can help investors diversify their portfolios.

But there are some key differences that may make one a better financial choice than the other for certain investors, according to experts.

Perhaps the most obvious difference is how investors trade ETFs and mutual funds.

ETFs trade like stocks: Investors buy or sell them on a stock exchange. By comparison, mutual fund investors transact directly with the fund itself.

While investors can place mutual fund trades during the business day, they won't know their transaction's exact price per share until the end of the day. However, ETF investors know their exact purchase price when they transact.

These differences generally matter more for day traders but not the average buy-and-hold investor, said Gloria Garcia Cisneros, a certified financial planner and wealth manager based in Los Angeles, and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.

Investors can hurt themselves financially by trading too frequently, experts said.

""Even in a scenario where you'd want to sell intraday, it's [often] emotion-based and usually not a good way to invest,"" said Bryan Armour, director of ETF and passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar.

Taxes and fees are much more consequential differences for everyday investors, experts said.

For example, ETFs can save certain investors from a big year-end tax bill that mutual fund shareholders might otherwise incur.

In this case, the taxes are capital gains, which are taxes owed on investment profits. Fund managers can generate such taxes within a fund when they buy and sell securities. Those capital gains then get passed along to all the fund shareholders, who owe a tax bill even if they reinvest those distributions.

Here's a look at other stories offering insight on ETFs for investors.

However, ETF investors rarely owe these tax bills: Just 6.5% of U.S. stock ETFs distributed capital gains to investors in 2024, compared to 78% of U.S. stock mutual funds, according to Morningstar.

The trend was similar for international stock funds: About 6% of ETFs distributed capital gains, versus 42% of mutual funds, according to Morningstar.

""Sometimes, [mutual fund investors] get a bit of a nasty surprise in the form of capital gains and a tax bill,"" said Lee Baker, a certified financial planner based in Atlanta, and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.

While mutual fund managers use cash to buy and sell securities, ETF managers use a different mechanism known as an ""in-kind"" transaction to facilitate a trade. This basically entails trading securities instead of cash; the method doesn't trigger a sale, and therefore doesn't create capital-gains tax.

""ETFs are way more tax-efficient,"" Armour said. ""That's a huge advantage over the long term.""

However, there are certain times when ETFs can't make in-kind transfers, and may therefore create a taxable event: for example, many kinds of derivatives, currency trades and when handling securities from certain international jurisdictions (like India, South Africa and Brazil), Armour said.

Also, ETFs' tax advantage only exists for investors who hold their funds in a taxable brokerage account. It disappears for those who hold their funds in a tax-sheltered account, like a 401(k) or individual retirement account.

ETFs also tend to be significantly cheaper for investors to own than mutual funds, experts said.

The average asset-weighted investment fee for ETFs was 0.42% in 2024, compared with 0.57% for mutual funds, according to Morningstar.

These fees, known as expense ratios, represent a share of investor assets in a fund. They are charged annually and withdrawn directly from investor accounts.

Some of this fee differential is because a larger share of ETFs are index funds, which tend to be cheaper than actively managed ones, Armour said. It's therefore natural that mutual funds would be more expensive if a larger share of them is actively managed.

However, many asset managers have debuted identical investment strategies in both an ETF and mutual fund — and, when comparing their fees, the ETFs are still often cheaper for retail investors, Armour said.

He gave the example of the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth fund, which charges a 0.57% annual fee for the ETF version and 0.69% for the investor share class of the mutual fund version.

""In pretty much every way, ETFs are cheaper than mutual funds,"" Armour said.

There may be times when it's better for investors to buy mutual funds.

For example, the universe of mutual funds is much larger, meaning investors may only be able to access certain funds in a mutual fund structure, experts said.

The ETF universe is expanding, though.

""ETFs are growing in popularity,"" Cisneros said. ""Even mutual fund managers are launching ETF versions of their strategy.""

Additionally, ETFs aren't readily available in 401(k) plans, so investors may not have a choice.

Certain brokerages may not allow for dollar-cost averaging into an ETF, Baker said. Investors who want to schedule automatic contributions into a fund on a regular basis may have to choose mutual funds, depending on their brokerage, he said.

Gold surged to set a fresh record high on Monday, buoyed by investors' heightened expectations of a dovish rate-cut path, ahead of remarks by multiple Federal Reserve officials and key inflation data later in the week.

Spot gold rose 1.1% to $3,723.81 per ounce after hitting a new record high of $3,726.19 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures for December delivery climbed 1.4% to $3,758.40.

""I would expect gold to reach new record highs this week with Fed officials likely to indicate further rate cuts, but also being data dependent on the pace and magnitude of cuts,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.

Several Federal Reserve officials are slated to speak this week, with Chair Jerome Powell set to deliver remarks on Tuesday, as investors closely monitor their commentary for clues about the future direction of monetary policy.

The market is also focused on the release of the U.S. core personal consumption expenditure price data on Friday for cues on the pace of further rate cuts.

On Wednesday, the Fed delivered its first rate cut since December, lowering rates by 25 basis points and signaling openness to further easing.

Investors are now expecting two more 25-bp rate cuts this year, one each in October and December, with a 93% and 81% chance, respectively, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

""There is a shift in the factors supporting gold. So far it was central banks and Asian demand, now we are also starting to see Western investors looking to add gold, visible in gold ETF holdings, driven by expectations of falling U.S. rates,"" Staunovo said.

Bullion has gained more than 40% this year, driven by broader geopolitical and economic uncertainty, central bank buying, and monetary policy easing.

Spot gold may test resistance at $3,705 per ounce, and a break above that could lead to a gain into a range of $3,719 to $3,739.

""We continue to see further upside, with gold expected to reach $3,900 by mid-2026,"" Staunovo added.

Saudi Arabia's new mutual defense pact with Pakistan is unlikely to alter Riyadh's energy relationship with key consumer India, a source told CNBC.

Asked whether India would continue to buy Saudi barrels, a senior source familiar with the matter told CNBC, ""Of course.""

The source, who could only speak anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter, added that Saudi Arabia is looking to shore up its security by broadening its alliances, but not at the expense of its commercial ties. 

India, which has been in conflict with neighboring Pakistan for decades, is one of the world's largest crude consumers and a key customer for Saudi Arabia. Riyadh sold just over 600,000 barrels per day in July, making it one of India's top three suppliers alongside Russia and Iraq, according to Kpler data.

The source also dismissed long-running speculation of a shift away from the U.S. dollar for Saudi oil trade, describing talk of a non-greenback pricing arrangement as a ""phantom agreement.""

Dollar pricing remains the foundation of Saudi crude exports, even as Riyadh balances security ties with the U.S. and Pakistan — while also expanding energy trade with India, a fellow BRICS alliance member.

""Saudi Arabia has always been a very strong partner for us,"" Asif Iqbal, president of the Indian Economic Trade Association, told CNBC on Friday, when asked about the Saudi-Pakistan defense deal.

""It's in their interest,"" Iqbal said, stressing that the agreement should be seen through the lens of national priorities. ""Those countries have their own interests, just like India has its own interests.""

India's government said it was ""aware that this development, which formalizes a long-standing arrangement between the two countries, had been under consideration,"" India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement in response to the Saudi-Pakistan pact.

""We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability,"" the statement added. 

CNBC has reached out to the Saudi and Indian energy ministries for comment. 

The pact, signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Riyadh, marks a deepening of ties between two partners. It also comes as Gulf states grow more uneasy about U.S. defense guarantees following Israel's strike inside Qatar.

""They're pivoting to other partners, because there is this perception that the U.S. will not honor its promises as it used to do,"" Rashmi Garg, a senior portfolio manager at Al Dhabi Capital told CNBC's ""Access Middle East"" on Friday. 

""So far we haven't seen any break in the relationship between the UAE and the other GCC geographies and the United States. Even the tariff picture has been fairly benign for them. So far, I think things remain good here — but this is something to be kept in the back of mind,"" she added. 

At the same time, India has also been shoring up its own Gulf ties. India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal was in the UAE last week to review progress on the UAE-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. Abu Dhabi is also a top supplier of crude to India, selling about 400,000 barrels per day with June delivery, according to Kpler.

""We're quite skeptical that there will be any long-lasting impact, at least over the next 6-12 months,"" Manpreet Gill, chief investment officer of Africa, Middle East and Europe at Standard Chartered Wealth Management, told CNBC when asked about the overall price impact.

""Despite all of the geopolitical events that we've seen in this region or elsewhere, any rise in oil prices has ultimately proven to be quite temporary,"" he said, suggesting that WTI futures will stay near $65 dollars per barrel.

Oops, something went wrong

Shares of leading Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) are down about 1.4% amid news the firm spent $100 million to acquire 850 Bitcoin last week at an average price of $117,344. 

Trading at $339.80, MSTR is now down around 5.2% in the last month, underperforming BTC itself, which is only down around 1.6% in that time. 

To make its latest purchase, the firm used around $19 million in proceeds from its STRF preferred stock offering, and more than $80 million in net proceeds from its existing $21 billion MSTR common stock offering. 

While shares have slumped on the latest Bitcoin buy, analysts at TD Cowen still see the stock as a buy. 

In a note to investors last week, analysts from the firm wrote that “management views its common stock as undervalued relative to the price of Bitcoin,” highlighting potential catalysts like the stock's addition to the S&P 500 index and the “continued assimilation” of Bitcoin into the mainstream political and economic worlds. 

As such, TD Cowen maintains a price target of $620—an 83.4% jump from its current trading price.

Strategy, which began buying Bitcoin in 2020, now maintains a Bitcoin treasury of 635,893 BTC valued around $72.25 billion at the time of writing—more than 10 times the size of the next largest treasury held by Bitcoin miner MARA. 

The firm operates five distinct at-the-market (ATM) offerings to help it raise funds, using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin for its treasury. Based on data from its Monday press release, Strategy still has around $16 billion available for issuance in its $21 billion common stock offering, and more than $30 billion available for issuance across its four separate preferred stock offerings—STRF, STRK, STRC, and STRD.

Each stock offering was unveiled earlier this year to provide Bitcoin exposure to investors of varying risk profiles.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired an additional 850 BTC for approximately $99.7 million at an average price of $117,344 per bitcoin between Sept. 15 and Sept. 21, according to an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.

Strategy now holds a total of 639,835 BTC — worth around $72 billion — bought at an average price of $73,971 per bitcoin for a total cost of around $47.3 billion, including fees and expenses, according to the company's co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor. That represents more than 3% of Bitcoin's total 21 million supply and implies around $25 billion of paper gains.

The latest acquisitions were made using proceeds from at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, and perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF. 

Strategy's STRK, STRC, STRF, and STRD perpetual preferred stock's respective $21 billion, $4.2 billion, $2.1 billion, and $4.2 billion ATM programs are in addition to the firm's ""42/42"" plan, which targets a total capital raise of $84 billion in equity offerings and convertible notes for bitcoin acquisitions through 2027 — upsized from its initial $42 billion, ""21/21"" plan after the equity side was depleted.

STRD is non‑convertible with a 10% non‑cumulative dividend and the highest risk‑reward profile. STRK is convertible with an 8% non‑cumulative dividend, allowing equity upside. STRF is non‑convertible with a 10% cumulative dividend, making it the most conservative. STRC is a variable‑rate, cumulative preferred stock offering monthly dividends, with adjustable rates designed to keep it near par.



Saylor once again hinted at the likelihood of another bitcoin acquisition filing ahead of time, sharing an update on Strategy's bitcoin acquisition tracker on Sunday, stating, ""The orange dots go up and to the right.""

Following its Q2 financial results, Strategy committed not to issue common equity if its market cap to net asset value (mNAV) ratio is below 2.5, except for specific purposes such as paying interest on debt obligations and funding preferred equity dividends. However, the firm later reneged on that guidance, clarifying that it will still issue MSTR below 2.5 mNAV if it deems the issuance to be advantageous to provide greater flexibility in executing its capital markets strategy.

Last week, Strategy reported it had bought 525 BTC for $60.2 million, taking its total holdings to 638,985 BTC. The pace of Strategy's bitcoin buys has generally been slowing in recent weeks as it switched focus from its common stock ATM program to its perpetual preferred stocks for funding bitcoin acquisitions.

Strategy was recently snubbed for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, which instead will add AppLovin, Robinhood, and EMCOR Group on Monday. TD Cowen analysts said the decision, which met all the criteria for inclusion, represented ""bias against bitcoin,"" comparing the exclusion to prior snubs of Facebook and Tesla, although they were eventually added. Analysts at JPMorgan argued the rejection was a ""blow to all crypto treasuries,"" warning that other index providers may also reconsider their inclusion of Strategy and similar crypto treasury firms.

Saylor joined other crypto execs and lawmakers at a roundtable hosted by Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Nick Begich in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, aiming to advance strategic bitcoin reserve legislation that, if passed, could see the U.S. purchasing 1 million BTC.

According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, there are now 178 public companies that have adopted some form of bitcoin acquisition model. MARA, Tether-backed Twenty One, Adam Back and Cantor Fitzgerald-backed Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, Metaplanet, Bullish, Riot Platforms, Trump Media & Technology Group, CleanSpark, and Coinbase make up the remainder of the top 10, with 52,477 BTC, 43,514 BTC, 30,021 BTC, 25,555 BTC, 24,300 BTC, 19,309 BTC, 15,000 BTC, 12,703 BTC, and 11,776 BTC, respectively.

Earlier on Monday, Metaplanet returned to the top five after announcing it had bought a further 5,419 BTC for approximately $632.5 million — the company's largest acquisition to date.



While the number of bitcoin treasury companies continues to rise, the value of many of the cohort's shares is down significantly from their summer peaks, with Strategy itself down 24%, for example.

Although its mNAV has been contracting over the past couple of months, Strategy's $98 billion market cap continues to trade at a premium to its bitcoin net asset value, with some investors concerned about the firm's premium valuation and its numerous bitcoin acquisition programs. However, certain analysts argue that with Strategy's relatively low debt levels and no payments due until 2028, the firm's leverage remains manageable. Strategy's mNAV currently sits at around 1.37.

MSTR closed down 1.3% on Friday at $344.75, according to The Block's Strategy price page, in a week that saw bitcoin fall 2.1%. MSTR is currently down 2.3% in pre-market trading on Monday, per TradingView, and has gained 14.9% year-to-date compared to bitcoin's 20.5%.

Strategy (MSTR) continued to add to its bitcoin BTC$112,562.54 stash last week, though it was a relatively small purchase.

The company Monday said it bought another 850 BTC for $99.7 million, increasing its total holdings to 639,,825 coins. This purchase was made at an average price of $117,344 per bitcoin, lifting the company's overall average purchase price to $73,971.

This latest acquisition was funded through the issuance of perpetual preferred stock and common stock at-the-market (ATM), though about 80% of that funding was through common stock sales.

Shares of MSTR were down 2.5% in premarket trading alongside a sizable slide in the price of bitcoin to about the $112,000.

Crypto just kicked off the week on a sour note.

Cryptocurrencies saw big declines on the back of a broad-based sell-off on Monday as positions worth $1.5 billion were liquidated, according to data from Coinglass, causing the price of tokens like bitcoin and ethereum to tumble.

Over 407,000 traders liquidated positions on the crypto derivatives market the 24 hours leading up to Monday, Coinglass data shows. That marks the biggest liquidation wave the crypto market has seen since March 27, according to the crypto trading platform. 

Bitcoin dropped as much as 3% on Monday to trade around $111,000, before the coin pared its losses and climbed back above the $113k mark.

Ethereum dropped as much as 9% to trade around $4,000 before edging back up to around $4,200. It was down about 6% midmorning on Monday.

Other popular tokens, like Worldcoin, FLOKI, and dogecoin, dropped more than 9% on Monday, putting them among the crypto market's biggest losers, according to data from CoinMarketCap. XRP was down 4% and solana lost 7%. 

Long positions in the crypto market had been looking ""overcrowded"" leading up to the liquidation wave, Linh Tran, a market analyst at XS.com, wrote in a note on Monday.

""This is a healthy process that reduces the risk of sharp long squeeze and provides a stronger foundation for a sustainable trend,"" Tran said, adding that bitcoin looked like it was entering a ""correction phase.""

""This pause is seen as necessary to absorb profit-taking pressure, reduce short-term leverage, and lay the groundwork for a more stable price base,"" Tran continued.

""Sentiment has been dented by the scale of the declines, and much now depends on whether these markets can bounce back quickly, or head lower to test more significant support levels,"" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note about Monday's sell-off.

The decline hasn't otherwise stellar gains for crypto in 2025, with prices climbing steadily amid bullishness spurred by rate-cut views, looser regulation, and other crypto-friendly developments pushed by the Trump White House. Bitcoin is up 21% year-to-date, while ethereum is up 26% this year.

Ethereum ETH/USD has tumbled 6%, falling below $4,200 over the past 24 hours as a prediction from a major crypto analyst seems to be playing out. 

What Happened: In his latest update, Cowen noted the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) as a critical level for Ethereum to consolidate and build momentum. 

He explained that the test could occur through sideways price action rather than a sharp drop, aligning with Ethereum's historical seasonal weakness in October versus Bitcoin BTC/USD.

Cowen drew parallels to prior post-halving cycles where ETH revisited the 21-week EMA before starting its final rally toward cycle highs. 

He predicts this pattern could play out over the next 2–3 months, potentially pushing Ethereum past $5,000.

Despite anticipating a near-term correction or sideways movement, Cowen remains bullish on Ethereum's long-term outlook.  

In his opinion, investors are advised to exercise patience, letting Ethereum test its support before riding the next upward leg, rather than attempting to time short-term moves.

Bitcoin And Altcoins

Cowen also emphasized that altcoins currently outperform Ethereum following its August all-time high, with liquidity expected to rotate back into Ethereum once the 21-week EMA is tested, triggering the next major rally.

He notes broader cycle considerations, maintaining that Bitcoin's cycle is likely to extend into Q4 2025, historically when major Bitcoin tops occur. 

He identifies two weekly closes below Bitcoin's 50-week moving average, currently around $98,000, as a key invalidation point for this bullish cycle thesis.

Oops, something went wrong

A massive sell-off has swept across the broader crypto market, with Bitcoin and altcoins crashing, leading to more than $1.7 billion in liquidations. BTC price has crashed under $113,000, with analysts predicting further drop ahead and the be ginning of a deeper correction.

The altcoin crash on Sept. 22 is even deeper as top crypto assets Ethereum , XRP , BNB Coin , Solana , and Dogecoin correct 6-10%.

The broader crypto market has seen $1.61 billion in long liquidations amid massive sell-offs, as the market sentiment turns sour, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin is down 2.62% dropping to $112,799, with over $80 billion wiped out from its market cap. The daily trading volume is up 70% to $43 billion, showing that the selling pressure is strong.

Market experts believe that this is just the beginning of a broader correction for BTC and altcoins. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has highlighted that Bitcoin faces more than $2 billion in long liquidations between the $106,000 and $108,000 range. He noted that a sweep of this level appears highly likely in the coming weeks before any major upward move.

 

Crypto analyst Captain Faibik has warned that Bitcoin (BTC) could be preparing for another bearish wave. He noted that on the daily chart, a rising wedge has already broken down and a bearish flag pattern is now forming.

Looking ahead, he expects another bearish leg that could push BTC down toward the $100,000 level. Despite this, the prediction markets suggest a BTC rally to $125K.

In addition to the Bitcoin price correction, altcoins have faced an even deeper crash. CoinGlass data shows that Ethereum is leading Bitcoin in 24-hour liquidations at $483 million, against Bitcoin's $276 million.

Ethereum (ETH) price has entered a deeper correction, currently trading under $4,200, down by 15% from its all-time high. Last week, ETH whales were on a dumping spree, citing what's coming ahead for them.

Binance's BNB Coin (BNB) touched an all-time high of $1088 during the weekend. Even BNB price is down today 4.55% in today's crypto market sell-off, however, it continues to hold above $1,000 threshold.

Meme coin DOGE has faced the steepest fall, dropping 10.79%, and is currently trading under $0.24. With the rising demand for spot Dogecoin ETF, the meme coin has been on investors' radar.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoins Hit Hard as Week Starts With $1.7 Billion in Crypto Liquidations","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:c0e558d38094b:0-altcoins-hit-hard-as-week-starts-with-1-7-billion-in-crypto-liquidations/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:00:08 GMT","

The crypto market kicked off the week with one of its sharpest downturns of 2025, erasing more than $151 billion in market value within a single day. According to data from CoinGlass, over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, leaving more than 402,000 traders in the red.

Ethereum (ETH) bore the heaviest losses, with nearly $500 million in liquidations, while Bitcoin (BTC) saw about $284 million wiped out. Altcoins such as XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) tumbled between 7–12%, erasing recent gains and signaling an abrupt end to the latest altcoins rally.

The cascade began with BTC dipping below $113,000, triggering margin calls and automated sell-offs. Within just 30 minutes, liquidations had surged past $1 billion, underscoring the fragility of highly leveraged trading environments.

Bitcoin Dominance Rises as Altcoins' Value Drops

The sell-off also brought a sharp reversal in market sentiment. The Altcoin Season Index, which peaked at 100 points just days ago, has now dropped to 64, suggesting traders are shifting back toward Bitcoin. BTC dominance has climbed to 57%, while ETH dominance slipped to 13%.

Historically, altcoin seasons last only a few weeks before liquidity rotates back into Bitcoin. Analysts warn that the latest liquidation cascade may have ended this cycle earlier than expected.

Smaller tokens, including ASTER, WLFI, and PUMP, which recently saw speculative surges, were among the hardest hit, with more than $263 million in altcoins longs liquidated.



Healthy Shakeout or Bearish Warning?

Despite the steep losses, many analysts argue the pullback reflects a healthy reset rather than the end of the bull cycle. Overleveraged traders were washed out, creating stronger support levels for long-term holders.

Institutional demand remains intact, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recording steady inflows last week, suggesting that large investors continue to buy the dip. On-chain data also shows 420,000 ETH leaving exchanges, pointing toward accumulation despite short-term volatility.

For now, the market's next move hinges on whether Ethereum can hold above $4,100 and Bitcoin stabilizes near the $112,000–$114,000 zone. Despite skepticism from traders, analysts predict a correction as laying the groundwork for the next upward move in the ongoing bull market.

$BNB is one of the strongest large-cap altcoins in 2025, climbing from $500 to the magic $1,000 mark in just a few months.

The token is up nearly 75% since the beginning of March and now looks primed to become the next big breakout winner in crypto after the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

In times like these, when a token is rallying hard, online sentiment often turns overwhelmingly bullish, with both retail and institutional analysts churning out one aspirational price target after another.

But to keep sanity intact and offer you an objective analysis of the situation, we asked Grok where $BNB could realistically head in the coming months.

Read on as we unpack Grok's $2K BNB target in detail, the strong technical setups that provide much-needed momentum for the token, and the best altcoins to buy right now to make the most of this altcoin season.

Grok first pointed to $BNB's weekly chart, where its current rally is coming from the breakout of a pattern channel that had been in place since June 2024.



Then, Grok applied the technical analysis playbook, measuring the width of this consolidation channel and mapping it onto the breakout level.

This gave us the next possible target of $1.35K, which is around 30% above current levels.

While this is still very bullish, it's not the most intriguing part of Grok's analysis. When we fed Grok the monthly $BNB chart, things became even more enthusiastic.

On the monthly chart, $BNB had formed a strong base around the $210 mark, where it took support three times: once in May 2021, again in June 2022, and most recently in August–October 2023.

On the top side, it was capped by a strong resistance level of $630 to $650, which it broke out of very recently.



According to the same playbook we used above – mapping the width of the consolidation phase onto the breakout level – doing this on the monthly chart gives us a target of $2K.

So $BNB is all set to double in the coming months.

With that in mind, we asked Grok about the best low-cap coins to buy right now. Here are its top three suggestions.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) shines as the best crypto to buy now, offering a game-changing solution to the long-standing issue of institutional dominance in meme coin trading.

It's the official cryptocurrency of the Snorter Telegram trading bot, built specifically for small meme coin traders.

Right now, most of the liquidity in new meme coins is swept away by large institutional traders with access to sophisticated algorithms and bots, leaving little for retail participants.

The easy-to-use Telegram bot also lets you copy the trades of profitable meme coin traders, helping you build steady profits while learning the art of trading.



Even better, Snorter ensures a secure environment. It uses MEV-resistant layers to protect you from honeypots, rug pulls, and sophisticated sandwich attacks.

According to our $SNORT price prediction, the token could hit $0.94 by the end of 2025, representing a massive 800% return on current prices.

The $SNORT presale is currently live, with over $4M already raised. Each token is available for just $0.1051 and you can stake it for 116% APY.

Visit $SNORT's official website to learn more about how this trading bot combines top-notch security with ease of use.

Much like Snorter, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) also aims to solve a critical real-world issue: content platforms charging heavy fees from creators while offering virtually no next-gen assistance in return.

SUBBD plans to transform the way users interact with their favorite creators and consume content.

For instance, AI text generators can build engaging scripts, AI image and video generators can produce striking visuals, and AI voice generators can create catchy voiceovers.

These tools will save creators a ton of time, enabling them to engage more directly and organically with their fans to build real connections.

Content viewers, on the other hand, can use the $SUBBD token to access exclusive content, request personalized creations from their favorite artists, and even send them tips.



Unlike other presale platforms that offer dynamic staking returns, SUBBD offers a flat 20% reward for the first year, giving investors steady passive income assurance.

Additionally, staking unlocks special perks such as behind-the-scenes content and exclusive creator livestreams.

SUBBD Token is currently in its presale stage, having already raised over $1.17M from early investors.

Interested? Check out our detailed guide on how to buy $SUBBD.

Visit SUBBD Token's official website to learn more about how it's narrowing the gap between creators and their fans.

CZ's Dog ($BROCCOLI) is a hyper-popular meme coin on the BNB Chain, based on the pet dog (named Broccoli) of Binance's ex-CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao.

It all started when CZ shared his admiration for character-based meme coins on X and expressed his willingness to launch one of his own.

Then, as soon as he posted a picture of his dog, the meme coin community was quick to pounce on the opportunity and mint $BROCCOLI tokens.

It's worth noting that several $BROCCOLI tokens flooded the market, with some rallying over 1,000% within a week.

CZ's Dog is one of the few BROCCOLI tokens that remain relevant today. Being on the BNB Chain, traders also benefit from lower transaction costs.

This could be one reason why, despite being a meme coin, CZ's Dog consistently clocks an average daily trading volume of around $18M.

The token has rallied more than 53% in the past couple of weeks, thanks to strong support around $0.0250. Its next resistance lies at $0.05555, which is about 70% away from its current price of $0.03278.

We suggest keeping a close watch on $BROCCOLI as it approaches this major resistance. A breakout from here could clear the path toward its next target of $0.10 – a massive 200% gain from current levels.

Buy your $BROCCOLI through MEXC or other leading exchanges.

Company is Unlocking Transaction-Based Revenue in $85 Billion Market Dominated by Legacy Players, like Stubhub and Ticketmaster

NEW YORK CITY, NY AND TORONTO, ON / ACCESS Newswire / September 17, 2025 / Nextech3D.ai (CSE:NTAR)(OTCQB:NEXCF)(FSE:1SS) (the “Company” or “Nextech3D.ai”), an AI-powered event management company, today announced its accelerated launch of its event ticketing software solutions from Q4 to Q3 2025 with blockchain ticketing coming in Q4. As tickets are digital, risk of fraud, counterfeiting, and scalping increases. Solutions using blockchain, identity verification, and secure tokenization are becoming more important. This launch introduces a scalable, transaction-based revenue model aligned with the continued expansion of the global ticketing industry, which, according to Mordor Intelligence, is projected to reach $85 billion in 2025 and grow to $103 billion by 2030.

Built-In Adoption Across Multiple Verticals

Ticketing spans multiple industries: live concerts, sports, conferences, trade shows, festivals, museums, transportation, and even hybrid/virtual events. This breadth creates diverse revenue streams and provides resilience against fluctuations in any single sector.

Nextech3D.ai's new ticketing platform introduces a new revenue model designed to scale with event demand. The company will generate $0.99 per ticket sold plus 3% of the ticket price, creating a fully transaction-based revenue stream that expands directly with ticket volume and pricing. This represents a significant shift from traditional flat platform fees, aligning Nextech3D.ai's growth with the success of its customers' events and unlocking recurring, high-margin revenue opportunities.

The opportunity is reinforced by the strength of the global ticketing industry. With blockchain tokenized ticketing scheduled to launch in Q4, Nextech3D.ai is positioned to participate in both primary ticket sales and the secondary resale market, currently dominated by legacy players, while offering a secure, next-generation solution.

CEO Commentary

“By accelerating our ticketing platform launch into Q3, we are creating a new revenue driver for Nextech3D.ai. For the first time, our earnings are directly tied to how many tickets are sold and at what price-creating significant upside potential as our customers' events grow. With blockchain-enabled ticketing coming in Q4, we will also participate in secondary market transactions, aligning Nextech3D.ai with the evolving economics of the global ticketing industry,” said Evan Gappelberg, CEO of Nextech3D.ai. “We believe these initiatives lay the foundation for 2026 to be a breakout year for profitability and cash flow.”

Built-In Adoption & Immediate Pipeline

Nextech's Map D platform already supports 500+ events annually, with about 25% involving ticket sales

With 125+ existing clients positioned to adopt the new ticketing platform the company has an established pipeline offering fast, low-friction revenue wins from the outset.

Stock option issuance:

The company has issued 1,000,000 3-year stock options priced at .15 under its existing employee stock option plan.

About Nextech3D.AI

Coinbase-incubated (NASDAQ:COIN) Ethereum Layer 2 Base is ""exploring"" the launch of a native token after denying any plans of doing so for years, according to Coinbase Head of Protocols Jesse Pollak.

​

""We're going to be exploring a network token for base,"" Pollak said Monday at a Base-hosted event.

​

Pollak suggested that the Base team has shifted its stance to pursue greater decentralization, align economic incentives and ""unlock new systems.""

​

""I will be upfront with y'all, it's early,"" Pollak said, stressing that the team behind the protocol had yet to figure out all the details. Still, he said that the team was committed to designing the token openly, with the help of the community.

​

Pollak also said that despite the token plans, Base remained ""committed to building on Ethereum,"" preemptively addressing anticipated questions about the network's Ethereum alignment.

​

Pollak assured the audience that Base was going to get the token launch ""right,"" citing Coinbase's reputation and hinting at potential collaboration with regulators and lawmakers.

​

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared the Base token announcement on Monday on X, stressing that there were no concrete plans yet.

​

""To be clear, there are no definitive plans,"" he said. ""We're just updating our philosophy. As of now, we're exploring it.""

​

""We're in the early phases of our exploration, and don't have any specifics to share around timing, design, or governance,"" the Base team reiterated in a Monday blog post.

​

The recent announcement of Base token plans is likely to bolster activity on the already popular Ethereum Layer 2 chain as users try to secure a potential token airdrop. According to L2Beat data, Base is the second-largest Layer 2 by total value locked at nearly $16 billion. In the past 30 days, the network has processed over 330 million transactions, far surpassing the roughly 49 million transactions processed on Ethereum.

​The Base team's token announcement comes amid a more friendly U.S. cryptocurrency regulatory backdrop. When Base launched in 2023, the position of then-Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler was that most cryptocurrency tokens were unregistered securities. Coinbase was the target of a lawsuit questioning its listing of certain assets, which were labeled as unregistered securities by the regulator.

​

Now, the SEC has adopted a more favorable stance. Chair Paul Atkins, a strong cryptocurrency advocate nominated by President Donald Trump, maintains that most cryptocurrencies are not securities and that the security designation should not hinder a token's prospects.

​

The SEC has dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase.

​

Base is not the only exchange-backed project planning a token launch. Ink Foundation, the nonprofit behind the eponymous Ethereum Layer 2 incubated by Kraken, announced token airdrop plans in June.

 US regulatory frameworks signal acceptance of crypto, but most blockchains lack the privacy and compliance features institutions need. 

Opinion by: Eran Barak, CEO at Shielded Technologies

For more than a decade, crypto in the US has existed in a legal gray zone. Regulators have wavered between silence and sudden crackdowns, leaving developers, investors and institutions paralysed with doubt. 

In 2025, this started to change. The SEC dropped its case against Binance, citing the need for more explicit rules. The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, introducing a federal framework for stablecoins. The odds of the CLARITY Act being signed into law are high.

Even the White House has shifted its stance, reversing guidance discouraging employers from adding crypto to retirement portfolios. An executive order now allows 401(k) allocations into digital assets — a signal that Washington no longer sees them as inherently risky but as a market-viable asset class. Institutions are paying attention.

Lawmakers may open the door, but institutions will remain hesitant unless infrastructure evolves in parallel, and blockchain will remain confined to retail-driven speculation.

Today's financial rules were drafted for a different era, and they struggle to adapt in this digital age. Blockchains were designed to promote trust and resist censorship through radical transparency, but this design now clashes with modern expectations around privacy, selective access and compliance. 

This makes it difficult for most blockchains to comply with governance frameworks born of political processes or to handle the particular legal requirements of sectors like finance, healthcare or enterprise data management. 

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, gives users the right to be forgotten, yet data cannot be altered once published on blockchains.

The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) requires strict safeguards for health records, but no hospital can store patient data on a system where every access point is visible. Financial institutions, meanwhile, need selective disclosure — data shared with some parties but not all.

Markets where every transaction is fully transparent are inefficient, since fund movements can be tracked in real time and counterparties can trade against those signals.

For regulation to be meaningful, the systems it's meant to govern have to be capable of compliance. That's where the real gap lies today.

The promise of Web3 is control, privacy and ownership. The architecture, however, often turns those ideals into tradeoffs: private but incompatible with regulation, or open and transparent at the cost of compliance and user trust.

This problem goes beyond transaction data. The metadata surrounding each transaction — who accessed it, when and under what conditions — can be as revealing as the data itself. Most chains ignore this layer, dangerously exposing developers and institutions when meeting compliance and audit standards.

This needs to change if we want blockchain to serve more than early adopters and retail use cases. In traditional markets like Nasdaq and the NYSE, about 80% of trading comes from institutions, while in crypto it's almost the opposite, with retail still dominant. 

Unless infrastructure adapts, new laws will only take crypto so far. Institutions may welcome the clarity, but they won't commit meaningful capital until the systems they rely on meet regulated industries' operational, legal and risk standards.

Blockchain has shown that programmable assets and global settlement can work in practice. The challenge now is scaling them for institutional use. That means building infrastructure that can reconcile blockchain's transparency with requirements for privacy, selective disclosure and compliance — making it possible to meet regulated industries' legal and operational standards.

A decade ago, early cloud platforms faced similar security, auditability and compliance hurdles. It took years of engineering, standards-setting and iteration before those systems could support the world's most risk-sensitive industries. Once they did, adoption followed, and blockchain now stands at the same threshold.

Thankfully, new frameworks are emerging. Zero-knowledge proofs, selective disclosure and novel tokenomic designs give developers the building blocks for privacy and compliance without reverting to centralized gatekeepers. These tools are coming into focus just as regulation is starting to get serious.

If the two evolve together, blockchain won't just be a tool for speculation or fringe use cases. 

It can become the trusted platform for the next generation of financial and data infrastructure, driving the global economy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","The NFT Winter Deepens: Digital Collectibles Face Existential Challenge Amidst Crypto Crash","https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2025-9-22-the-nft-winter-deepens-digital-collectibles-face-existential-challenge-amidst-crypto-crash","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:13:00 GMT","

The non-fungible token (NFT) market, once a beacon of rapid innovation and astronomical valuations, finds itself in a deep ""NFT Winter,"" a chilling period characterized by plummeting sales, eroding floor prices, and widespread investor disillusionment. This dramatic downturn is not an isolated event but a direct consequence of the broader cryptocurrency market crash, which has wiped out billions in value and severely curtailed speculative enthusiasm across the digital asset landscape. As the dust settles from successive crypto calamities, the future of digital collectibles hangs precariously, prompting a crucial re-evaluation of their inherent value and long-term utility.

This prolonged slump is forcing a harsh reckoning, shifting the focus from ephemeral hype and quick profits to fundamental utility and sustainable ecosystems. The immediate implications are profound, with marketplaces struggling, creators adapting, and investors grappling with significant losses. The ongoing contraction is reshaping the very fabric of the digital collectible space, demanding innovation and resilience from projects aiming to survive and thrive beyond this speculative winter.

The meteoric rise of NFTs in late 2021 and early 2022 was fueled by a confluence of factors, including surging cryptocurrency prices, low interest rates, and a frenzy of speculative investment. However, this bullish sentiment proved unsustainable, and the subsequent crypto market crash delivered a devastating blow. The collapse of major ecosystems like Terra (LUNA-USD) in May 2022, followed by the spectacular implosion of the FTX (FTT-USD) exchange in November 2022, sent shockwaves across the entire digital asset industry, with NFTs bearing a significant brunt of the fallout.

The numbers paint a stark picture of decline. Monthly NFT trading activity plummeted by an astonishing 97% from its peak of roughly $17 billion in January 2022 to a mere $466 million by September 2022. Major marketplaces like OpenSea, once the bustling hub of NFT transactions, witnessed a nearly 98% drop in trading volume from May to late August 2022, with daily transaction records dwindling from billions to mere millions. The cascading effect of these events continued into 2023 and 2024, with overall NFT trading volume in 2023 less than half of what it was in 2022, illustrating a sustained and severe contraction.

Floor prices, the lowest price point for an NFT within a given collection, suffered equally dramatic depreciation. Even so-called ""blue-chip"" projects, once considered relatively stable, saw their values evaporate. Between June 10th and June 13th, 2022, collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, Doodles, and Cool Cats experienced floor price declines ranging from 18% to 33%. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) floor price, which soared to over $430,000 in April 2022, had plunged to approximately $115,200 by mid-June 2022 and further to just over $80,000 by May 2023, representing a staggering 340% decline from its peak. Solana-based NFTs were particularly hard hit after the FTX collapse, with their aggregate floor value dropping by a staggering 68%, partly due to FTX's prior advocacy for the Solana blockchain. Investor sentiment, once characterized by ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO), has largely shifted to ""fear,"" with a significant erosion of public confidence and a growing skepticism towards the entire NFT industry.

The NFT Winter has proven to be a harsh arbiter, separating projects and platforms built on speculative fervor from those grounded in utility, community, and genuine innovation. While the downturn has brought widespread losses, it has also compelled a necessary evolution, revealing surprising resilience in some corners of the ecosystem.

The Losers: The most significant casualties of the NFT Winter are the legions of speculative investors who bought into projects at their peak, only to see values plummet by 90% or more. Many ""blue-chip"" collections, once symbols of digital status, have seen their floor prices and sales volumes dramatically shrink. For instance, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), a flagship project of Yuga Labs, experienced a 61% decline in sales volume in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, with celebrity endorsers reportedly removing their Apes as profile pictures. Similarly, Azuki has faced declining sentiment and value. Numerous smaller, less established projects, often referred to as ""jpeg flips,"" have become entirely ""worthless,"" with over 1,600 projects on Ethereum deemed defunct by early 2023. NFT marketplaces that failed to innovate or adapt also suffered. While OpenSea (NYSE: OPEN), once dominant, saw its market share severely eroded, others like GameStop (NYSE: GME), DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG), Immutable, and Kraken (NYSE: KRKN) notably exited the NFT market, unable to sustain operations amidst the reduced activity and interest. Artists who relied heavily on secondary market royalties also faced significant challenges as many platforms shifted to royalty-optional models, further cutting into their potential earnings.

The Winners and Adapters: Despite the widespread devastation, certain projects and entities have demonstrated remarkable resilience and even growth. Pudgy Penguins, for example, emerged as a top performer, recording $72 million in sales in Q1 2025, a 13% increase year-over-year, by investing in its own networks and launching proprietary crypto assets. Milady Maker also saw a significant price surge and maintained a solid floor, while The Captainz by Memeland and Doodles (which saw sales rise to $32 million in Q1 2025, partly due to a collaboration with McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)) showcased the power of strong communities and strategic partnerships. The rise of Bitcoin Ordinals, NFTs inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, marked a significant shift, with Magic Eden, a multi-chain marketplace, shrewdly integrating the protocol to capture the largest market share in August 2024, surpassing its competitors. Even OpenSea has shown signs of a comeback in early 2025, regaining market share through platform developments and teasing an official token. Traditional companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) proved that utility-driven NFT programs can still thrive, successfully selling out 2,000 digital tokens in minutes. Luxury brands like Nike (NYSE: NKE), Adidas (XETRA: ADDYY), and Gucci (PPRUY) continue to integrate NFTs into their strategies for enhanced consumer engagement and loyalty, viewing them as long-term brand extensions rather than speculative assets. Furthermore, the focus has shifted towards Web3 gaming, with projects like Axie Infinity (AXS-USD) and The Sandbox (SAND-USD) becoming key catalysts for potential market revitalization. Artists who have built strong direct-to-fan communities or focused on innovative, utility-rich digital art, such as Tyler Hobbs and Emily Yang (pplpleasr), have also managed to weather the storm, demonstrating the enduring value of genuine artistic talent and engaged patronage.

The NFT Winter is more than just a market correction; it represents a fundamental re-evaluation and maturation of the entire digital collectibles industry. This downturn is shaking out the speculative excess that characterized the boom, forcing projects and platforms to prioritize utility, sustainability, and genuine community building over mere hype and profit-seeking. The event fits squarely into broader trends within the cryptocurrency space, particularly the shift from purely speculative assets towards blockchain applications with tangible real-world use cases.

One of the most significant ripple effects is the increased scrutiny on project fundamentals. Investors and users are now demanding clear roadmaps, tangible benefits, and transparent operations from NFT projects. This pressure is accelerating innovation in areas like Web3 gaming, where NFTs serve as in-game assets providing true ownership, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which uses NFTs to represent fractional ownership of physical properties, art, or commodities. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in creating and managing NFTs is also gaining traction, opening new avenues for creativity and utility. On the regulatory front, the market instability and widespread losses have intensified calls for clearer guidelines. Governments and financial bodies worldwide are now actively debating how to classify NFTs—as securities, commodities, or unique digital assets—a decision that will have profound implications for future market structure, investor protection, and compliance requirements. Historically, this period mirrors other speculative bubbles, such as the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, where many overvalued companies collapsed, but resilient and fundamentally sound technologies eventually emerged to redefine industries. The NFT market is undergoing a similar cleansing, shedding unsustainable ventures while paving the way for more robust and impactful applications.

The aftermath of the NFT Winter is poised to reshape the digital collectibles landscape profoundly. In the short term, expect continued market consolidation, with less viable projects fading into obscurity and stronger, utility-focused initiatives gaining traction. The emphasis will remain on real-world applications and tangible benefits, moving beyond profile pictures to encompass areas like digital identity, verifiable credentials, and loyalty programs. Marketplaces will continue to compete fiercely on features, fees, and multi-chain support, with platforms like Magic Eden demonstrating the agility needed to capture new market segments (e.g., Bitcoin Ordinals).

Long-term, the NFT market is likely to emerge as a more mature and integrated component of the broader digital economy. Strategic pivots will be crucial for survival, with many projects shifting from a pure collectibles model to incorporating their NFTs into gaming, metaverse experiences, or even traditional brand activations. We will likely see more institutional adoption, but with a cautious and compliance-focused approach, as major corporations seek to leverage NFTs for verifiable ownership and enhanced customer engagement. Emerging market opportunities will coalesce around interoperable NFTs, which can seamlessly transition across different platforms and metaverses, as well as the tokenization of illiquid assets, unlocking new forms of investment and ownership. Potential scenarios include a gradual recovery driven by technological advancements and clearer regulatory frameworks, leading to a more stable and less volatile market where value is derived from utility rather than speculation.

The NFT Winter, while painful for many, serves as a critical turning point for the digital collectibles industry. It has exposed the vulnerabilities of speculative markets and highlighted the imperative for innovation, utility, and robust community building. The key takeaway from this period of contraction is that the underlying technology of NFTs—digital scarcity and verifiable ownership on a blockchain—retains its power, but its application must transcend fleeting trends. The market is moving beyond the initial hype toward a more discerning appreciation of intrinsic value.

Moving forward, the NFT ecosystem will likely be characterized by greater maturity and a focus on long-term sustainability. The speculative froth has largely been removed, paving the way for projects that offer genuine utility, foster strong communities, and demonstrate clear use cases. Investors should watch for regulatory clarity, as clear guidelines will provide much-needed stability and legitimacy to the market. Furthermore, attention should be paid to projects that are effectively integrating NFTs into Web3 gaming, real-world asset tokenization, and established brand strategies, as these are likely to drive the next wave of adoption and value creation. The NFT Winter, therefore, is not an end, but a necessary crucible from which a more resilient, useful, and integrated digital collectibles market is beginning to emerge.","{'href': 'https://markets.financialcontent.com', 'title': 'FinancialContent'}","cryptocurrency"

As we see the NFT market thrive, it's clear its effects are reaching far and wide, and the payroll sector is no exception. Particularly in Asia, where fintech startups are stepping up to redefine how salaries are paid, merging the worlds of NFTs and payroll into something new and intriguing. This is not just a fleeting trend; it's a sign of how digital assets could transform employee compensation.

The global NFT market has been on an upward trajectory, led by Asia—especially China, South Korea, and Singapore. This isn't a mere coincidence; it's part of a larger shift towards digital solutions in finance. These fintech startups are diving into NFTs, seeing potential beyond just collectibles, and are now using them in payroll systems. This appeals to tech-savvy younger generations who are more at home with digital currencies.

These fintech companies are using NFTs to offer performance-based incentives and gamified rewards in their payroll setups. It's a strategy that seems to resonate, enhancing engagement while aligning with a growing trend of blockchain adoption, which aims to improve security, cut transaction costs, and provide more seamless cross-border payments. By incorporating NFTs and stablecoins, they're creating payroll solutions that are not only efficient but also attract top talent in a competitive environment.

But let's not kid ourselves. The promise of crypto payroll adoption isn't without its obstacles. Regulatory uncertainty looms large for these fintech players. Still, examples like Sea Group in Singapore and Paytm in India show that there is a willingness to adopt these systems. As the NFT market stabilizes and blockchain use cases grow, we might see more fintech companies jumping on the crypto payroll bandwagon, surmounting regulatory hurdles as they seek to stay competitive.

What does the future hold? It looks like the trend of integrating NFTs and stablecoins into payroll systems will only pick up steam. Countries like Nigeria, Singapore, and South Korea seem most likely to lead this charge by 2025, given their high fintech adoption rates. Digital assets could soon be a staple in how salaries are structured, and companies would do well to prepare themselves for these changes.

To wrap it all up, the rise in NFT sales and blockchain adoption in Asia is pushing fintech startups to adopt these digital assets in their payroll systems. This evolution could lead to better employee incentives and streamlined operations, even if regulatory challenges remain. If the digital economy continues to grow and mature, NFTs will likely play a significant role in how we view compensation in the future.

Daily Coffee News Staff | September 22, 2025

The International Coffee Organization (ICO) officially launched the 2025 International Coffee Day campaign, rallying the global coffee industry around the theme “Embracing Collaboration More Than Ever.”

Observed annually on Oct. 1, International Coffee Day was established by the ICO member states — representing the majority of the world's leading coffee-producing countries — and first celebrated in 2015.

Since its inception, the holiday has aimed to highlight the contributions of the world's coffee farmers and producers who bring coffee to life for consumers worldwide, while providing messaging for events, promotions and other marketing initiatives.

Announcing the 2025 effort, ICO Executive Director Vanúsia Nogueira said the organization is calling for “practical collaboration that delivers real benefits along the whole chain.”



The campaign asks governments, industry partners, civil society and consumers to register activities, share the official posters, use the #ICD2025 tag and record short videos finishing the phrase: “Coffee is collaboration because…”

The group has created a communications toolkit and multilingual resources to support the 2025 campaign.

The ICO — which remains a leading advocate for coffee farmers, producers and sector-wide collaboration — oversees the International Coffee Agreement, which was last revised in 2022. For decades, the agreement involved a quota system for the world's coffee production, designed to stabilize global coffee prices.

Although the international quota agreement was terminated in 1989, resulting in the current free-market period characterized by price volatility, the ICO continues to provide sector-wide data while promoting the long-term sustainability of the global coffee sector, including through International Coffee Day.

“Coffee is a product of many hands and many hearts,” Nogueira said of this year's campaign. “When farmers, cooperatives, researchers, roasters, traders, baristas and consumers work together, we create opportunities for income, resilience and environmental stewardship.”

Telegram-based trading bot Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) has raised $4 million in its ICO despite the broader meme coin market cooling.

Investors continue to commit capital to the presale because of Snorter's capabilities, which enable users to spot opportunities even amid challenging market conditions and give retail traders a chance to profit.

At the center of this ecosystem is the SNORT token, which unlocks multiple utilities, including cutting trading fees to an industry-low 0.85% simply by holding it.

Now the presale is entering its next stage, with just 24 hours left to join the current round at $0.1051 per token.

Once the window closes, the price of SNORT will rise again as the project moves closer to launch, leaving fewer rounds for new investors to enter at lower valuations.

The meme coin sector has slid back under a $80 billion market cap, after pushing close to $90 billion just last week.

Monday's trading painted the space in red, with AI-themed meme coins dropping the hardest at 12.4%, followed by the Murad Mahmudov-backed pick on CoinGecko, which slipped 11.8%. 

Among the top ten meme coins, the biggest loser was Pump.fun's native token on Solana, PUMP, plunging 19.3%, while Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) followed with an 11.7% decline. The lone exception was MemeCore (M) on Binance, which managed to climb 3.2%, extending its meteoric run that saw it hit a billion-dollar valuation in just two months.

But the red isn't just hitting meme coins. The broader market has cooled as Bitcoin failed to hold above $117,000 last week and has since slipped to $112,000 as of writing, dragging sentiment across the board. 

Even with the Fed's rate cut last week, investor mood remains neutral at best.

For most traders, these are the moments that test their conviction – whether to sit through the seasonal blues and wait for the historically strong “Uptober” and “Moonvember,” or to look elsewhere for opportunity. 

The developers built Snorter Bot Token for the latter: a tool that can scan mempools and surface potential breakout meme coins, which turns volatility, even on red days, into trading opportunities.

Snorter Bot Token's edge lies in its ability to spot those breakout meme coins before the big pump happens. Essentially, this allows retail traders a chance to position early rather than end up as exit liquidity.

The first way it delivers that edge is through mempool scanning on Solana and Ethereum. As it monitors pending transactions, Snorter has the capability of detecting new token launches and liquidity adds the instant they appear – even well before they show up on exchanges or trackers like CoinGecko. 

Combined with sub-second swaps and MEV protection, Snorter executes trades faster than most bots, which benefits users by offering ground-floor entry without being front-run by whales or trapped in sandwich attacks. To reduce risk further, it layers in smart filters like liquidity thresholds, contract verification, and honeypot checks.

The second way that users get ahead with Snorter is through copy trading. Users can simply mirror the wallets of traders with proven track records, effectively riding alongside them in profitable moves without needing to scout opportunities manually.

In both cases, Snorter is built to give retail traders the upper hand as it spots entries early and secures gains before the usual exit liquidity games even begin.

Most meme coin traders live on FOMO. They chase pumps they've seen too late, get caught in hype cycles, and end up second-guessing every move. Snorter is designed to change that behavior entirely.

With its automation and filters, Snorter reduces the stress of decision-making. Instead of staring at charts or Telegram groups all day, users can rely on the bot to flag opportunities that meet real criteria – liquidity checks, contract verification, and smart anti-rug filters. 

And for those who'd rather not scout at all, copy trading removes the guesswork by letting them ride alongside proven wallets.

The result is a different mindset altogether: instead of reacting to the market, traders can approach meme coins with a strategy. They don't need to panic about missing the next 100x tweet because Snorter is already in position to surface it.

The only thing left before the presale closes is to head to the Snorter Bot Token site and secure your SNORT tokens using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or even a credit card.

The International Coffee Organization (ICO) is launching a global campaign in time for International Coffee Day on 1 October.



ICO's digital campaign encourages participants to register planned coffee events via its website, use the hashtag #ICD2025, and help spread its message on the importance of collaboration across communication channels.

The intergovernmental organisation also encourages video messages that complete the phrase “Coffee is collaboration because…”, and tagging @icocoffeeorg and using the hashtag #ICD2025.

“Coffee is a product of many hands and many hearts. When farmers, cooperatives, researchers, roasters, traders, baristas and consumers work together, we create opportunities for income, resilience and environmental stewardship,” says Vanúsia Nogueira, Executive Director at ICO.

“This year's campaign calls for practical collaboration that delivers real benefits along the whole chain. Join us – take part in the challenges and show how, together, coffee can be a force for good.”

The digital campaign calls on stakeholders in the global coffee value chain to support collaboration, resilience, and sustainable development. The theme of the campaign is designed to champion coffee farmers and cooperatives, traders, roasters, baristas, and consumers to secure sustainable livelihoods.

The ICO invites all levels of the industry to participate, including governments, industry partners, civil society, cooperatives, and consumers by hosting events, sharing campaign assets, and posting with #ICD2025.

The campaign follows the relaunch of the Coffee Sustainability Support Database. Its new and improved digital features aim to provide an interactive platform that enhances transparency, collaboration, and strategic alignment across sustainability initiatives in the global coffee sector.

The latest BTC layer-2 coin, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), continues to establish itself as one of the most promising new cryptocurrencies. 

The viral HYPER presale has raised over $17.2 million in relatively short order, a sign of strong community support and high upside potential. The new crypto is seeing strong whale demand as well. 

The broader crypto market has improved drastically. Every time the Bitcoin price has closed the month of September in the green, it has followed it up with double-digit gains in October. The growing M2 money supply indicates that BTC could hit $150,000 this year. 

Experts are viewing HYPER as one of the best beta plays on Bitcoin. A growing number of them are even calling it the next 100x crypto, so let's explore why analysts are so bullish on the project. 

During this bull cycle, Bitcoin Hyper has evolved from a speculative play into one of the most sought-after assets among Wall Street whales.

The rising number of BTC treasury firms highlights surging institutional demand, with BlackRock's spot ETF already cementing itself as the most successful exchange-traded fund launch in history. 

Adding to this momentum, US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, while the US Treasury explores budget-neutral mechanisms to acquire additional BTC holdings.

However, Bitcoin continues to draw significant criticisms due to its archaic network architecture, which results in slow transaction finality and high fees. The average Bitcoin confirmation time reaches multiple days during periods of heavy traffic.  

While layer-2 projects like the Lightning Network and Stacks exist, both suffer from slow mainstream adoption and usability barriers that hinder Bitcoin's evolution as a truly scalable payments network. Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of a true peer-to-peer electronic cash system remains unrealized. 

Enter Bitcoin Hyper. This cutting-edge Layer-2 network takes the pressure off Layer-1 through a canonical bridge, Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) execution, and zero-knowledge proofs.

Bitcoin Hyper introduces a seamless Layer-2 framework designed to scale Bitcoin without compromising security and decentralization. 

The process begins with the Bridge, where users deposit BTC to a monitored address. Through the Bitcoin Relay Program, block headers and proofs are verified, and an equivalent amount of BTC is minted on Layer-2 in a trustless manner.

Once on L2, users can send and receive BTC with near-instant finality, participate in staking, and access decentralized exchanges. This is powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling high throughput and advanced DeFi operations.

Next, transactions undergo Settlement & Security, where they are batched, compressed, and validated using zero-knowledge proofs before being periodically committed back to Bitcoin Layer-1 for synchronization.

Finally, in the Withdrawal phase, users can exit Layer-2 by submitting a request, after which verified BTC is released to their Layer-1 address. This cycle ensures speed, scalability, and robust trustlessness.

A growing number of DeFi apps, payment protocols and meme coins are looking to tap into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Considering that Bitcoin Hyper brings the programmability, scalability and performance of modern blackchains, it could become the hotbed for such products. 

Unsurprisingly, its native token, HYPER, is being viewed as one of the best new cryptos to buy now. 

Experts continue to include Bitcoin Hyper as one of the best new cryptos to buy now. Besides its cutting-edge layer-2 architecture, HYPER also has sound fundamentals, including community-centric tokenomics, attractive staking rewards and audited smart contracts. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper whitepaper for more details. 

As previously mentioned, layer-2 coins are high-beta plays on their respective layer-1s. This makes HYPER strongly correlated to Bitcoin. 

The global M2 money supply indicates that the Bitcoin price could hit $150,000 this year. 

This could result in a low-cap Bitcoin Hyper delivering outsized returns following its launch. After all, the top layer-2 projects tend to reach multibillion-dollar valuations. In fact, Bitcoin's layer-2 coin Stacks has a peak valuation of over $5 billion. 

Unsurprisingly, HYPER has been a favourite of whales and smart money investors. Five-figure buys are a regular occurrence, with one whale purchasing over $160k worth of Bitcoin Hyper in a single transaction, data from Etherscan reveals. 

Popular crypto influencers are also bullish on HYPER's upside prospects, with some calling it the next 100x crypto.

BCG Forecasts That Global Payments Revenue Will Reach $2.4 Trillion by 2029 Despite Slowing Growth 

Agentic AI, Digital Currencies, and Real-Time Account-to-Account Payments Are Reshaping Industry Economics 

Stablecoins Will Create New Opportunities for Banks and Nonbanks

BCG's 23rd Annual Global Payments Report Highlights Five Structural Forces Redefining the Sector

BOSTON, Sept. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Global payments revenue is projected to grow to $2.4 trillion by 2029, according to new research from Boston Consulting Group (BCG). While growth is expected to moderate to 4% annually over the next five years, the industry is undergoing a foundational reset as agentic AI, digital currencies, and fintech business models begin to shape the next wave of expansion.

These findings come from BCG's 23rd annual Global Payments Report, The Future Is (Anything but) Stable, released today. The report draws on BCG's proprietary Global Payments Model and includes forecasts and market dynamics across more than 60 economies accounting for more than 90% of global GDP. It identifies five structural forces reshaping the payments landscape: the rise of agentic AI, digital currencies such as stablecoins, fintech disruption, real-time account-to-account (A2A) systems, and the enduring importance of cost transformation.

""This is a turning point for the industry,"" said Inderpreet Batra, BCG managing director and senior partner and global head of the firm's payments and fintech segment. ""Traditional growth levers are losing force, but new drivers including agentic systems, programmable money, and fintech innovation are rapidly coming into focus. The players that align to these shifts now will lead the next decade.""

New Forces Reshaping the Industry

Among the key findings of the 2025 report:

Global payments revenue reached $1.9 trillion in 2024, but future growth will slow. After growing at 8.8% annually since 2019, revenue expansion is expected to ease to 4% annually. Transaction-based revenues remain strong, while deposit margin tailwinds slacken. Looking at overall growth (transaction-related and non-transaction-related revenue combined), Latin America will lead with 7.9% projected annual growth from 2024 to 2029, followed by the Middle East and Africa at 6.8%. Revenue growth in Europe over this period is expected to be 3.5%, in line with North America (3.4%) and Asia-Pacific (3.3%).

Agentic AI is set to influence over $1 trillion in e-commerce spending. According to BCG research, 81% of US consumers expect to use agentic AI tools to shop, which will shape more than half of all online purchases in the near future.

Stablecoins reached $26 trillion in volume, although real-world payments account for only 1% of that total. The market remains heavily concentrated in facilitating crypto trading.

Payments fintechs generated $176 billion in revenue in 2024, and are growing at 23% annually. Payments-focused fintechs have attracted over $135 billion in equity funding over the past 25 years and now make up 45% of total fintech revenue. The top performers are growing three times as fast as incumbents.

Real-time A2A payment volumes rose 40% globally in 2024. These systems now account for around a quarter of digital retail payments worldwide, even exceeding 50% of transactions in selected markets like India and Brazil. In the Middle East and Africa, where real-time systems are still emerging, adoption is projected to reach more than 50% by 2030.

""We're entering an era where growth and complexity go hand in hand,"" said Markus Ampenberger, BCG managing director and partner. ""The next winners in payments won't just be fast adopters of technology. They will be the firms that deeply integrate new capabilities into business and operating models, and customer value propositions.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","How soon will crypto creep into your 401(k)? New rules being explored now","https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/retirement/2025/09/22/401k-options-including-bitcoin/86291758007/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:42:42 GMT","

As if deciding how to invest 401(k) money isn't perplexing enough, we soon could be staring down some ridiculously overwhelming new options — including whether to buy bitcoin or turn to private equity as a way to juice up retirement returns.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Labor Department and the Treasury are tasked now with working out regulatory details for paving the way for alternative investments, including cryptocurrency, to be offered in 401(k) plans.

Ultimately, 401(k) investors could get access to cryptocurrency, private equity and other alternative investments in retirement savings plans at work, thanks to an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Aug. 7.

In his executive order, Trump blamed ""regulatory overreach and encouragement of lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers"" for stifling investment options, such as crypto, in 401(k)s.

One argument being made by Trump and bitcoin backers is that alternative investments already are part of the mix for traditional pension plans. Why not 401(k) plans, too?

Trump's executive order pointed out that alternative investments, including cryptocurrency, are ""an increasingly large portion of the portfolios of public pension and defined-benefit retirement plans.""

Michigan's largest public pension plan, for example, held approximately $44 million in bitcoin and $30 million in ethereum exchange traded funds as of Sept. 10, totaling $74 million. The cost basis was $37.5 million, meaning the Michigan Retirement System nearly doubled its original investment with a gain of $36.5 million to date.

Yet, the combined holdings represent a fraction of 1% of the retirement system's total $115 billion portfolio. ""Cryptocurrency is not a big focus of our investment strategy,"" said Ron Leix, a spokesman for the state treasury.

Leix pointed out that the state's retirement system was recognized by NASDAQ eVestment as having one of the best five-year returns among large public pension plans in the United States as of June 30.

Not surprisingly, those who are bullish on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies applaud what they see as a new opportunity to enable everyday investors to expand their horizons.

Bitcoin is a digital currency, launched in 2009, that can be used to buy goods or services with relative anonymity and without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. Devotees say the value comes from the scarcity, as bitcoin's algorithm caps the supply at 21 million digital coins.

Ronnie Bedway, known as the ""Bitcoin Butcher"" on social media platforms, says the ability to own bitcoin and other cryptocurrency in a 401(k) plan will open the doors to more investors, particularly young savers, to what's likely to be a burgeoning area.

Bedway is a third-generation owner of Ronnie's Meats in Eastern Market in Detroit. For a Detroit trivia night point, Ronnie's made a name 50 years ago during the ""Corned Beef War"" with Wigleys in Eastern Market. Tens of thousands of pounds of brisket were sold at deep discounts in the friendly battle in 1975.

Ronnie's Meats was named after the founder, the young Ronnie Bedway's grandfather, who opened the butcher shop in 1967. Tom Bedway is the son of the founder and father of the ""Bitcoin Butcher.""

Bedway, 36, started studying bitcoin in 2017, the original blockchain and cryptocurrency. But Bedway didn't first invest in bitcoin until 2020 when bitcoin was trading at roughly $7,000. Some friends from college bought into the bitcoin story, including as an inflation hedge. Bedway also had been impressed after listening to podcasts by Michael Saylor, entrepreneur and bitcoin evangelist.

""Gold wasn't sexy enough,"" Bedway said.

Back in 2017, Bedway said, many people probably just logged into the Coinbase website to buy bitcoin via the crypto exchange platform. Now, there's an exchange traded product called IBIT or the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF or some investors buy stock in companies that leverage their corporate balance sheet to invest in cryptocurrency.

""The two biggest themes going forward are artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies,"" Bedway said.

He has been focusing lately on former bitcoin mining companies that are now reallocating their power to artificial intelligence, like Iren Limited and Cipher Mining.

""I am 36,"" Bedway said, ""I can take a few more chances that maybe average investors are unwilling to do and kind of wait for the thesis to play out.""

Some crypto enthusiasts say that the president's executive order is only a response to what many people already want.

For years, many workers have been questioning why bitcoin isn't being offered in their retirement plans, according to Elizabeth Hansson, president of the Stand with Crypto Michigan Chapter and chief technology officer of Blockchain Exploration Corp.

""This is very much the future of money. Digital assets will be incorporated into every aspect of our financial life in the near future,"" Hansson said.

""And people are starting to see this.""

The executive order, she said, will give employers the option to add alternative investments, like cryptocurrency, to the mix of investments in a 401(k) plan.

Hansson said adoption won't happen overnight because the regulatory process still needs to unfold. The Aug. 7 executive order, she said, directs the Department of Labor in coordination with the SEC and Treasury to reexamine fiduciary guidance, propose new rules and potential safe harbors, and issue clarifications within 180 days.

After that, investment firms will develop compliant products and employers will update their plans.

""I expect some employers — especially those with younger, tech-savvy workforces — will move quickly once the framework is in place, and more will follow as guardrails and education build confidence,"" Hansson said.

Employers, she said, will still decide what makes sense for their workers.

She likes to refer to Trump's executive order as ""permissive, not prescriptive.""

""It opens the door without pushing anyone through it,"" Hansson said.

Holding cryptocurrency in a 401(k) could have potential tax advantages. A traditional 401(k) would allow pretax contributions to grow on a tax-deferred basis for years; taxes are paid based on ordinary income tax rates when the money is withdrawn in retirement. Holding the investment in a Roth 401(k) would allow qualified withdrawals to be taken tax-free.

Hansson estimates that some 1 million people likely own cryptocurrency already in Michigan, though, no exact figure exists.

The advocacy group Stand With Crypto has more than 45,000 engaged crypto advocates in Michigan, she said, with high concentrations in Oakland County, Wayne County and the Grand Rapids area.

Make no mistake, we're talking about what's been a wild, unfolding shift in acceptance. Trump, once a well-known crypto skeptic, now has promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.""

We've read plenty of headlines indicating how Trump and his family have embraced crypto in a variety of ways. Early in September, American Bitcoin, the crypto-mining company co-founded by Eric Trump, went public and began trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Days after the executive order was signed, bitcoin hit an all-time high in trading of $124,457 on Aug. 14. Much of the rally kicked off in late 2024 on the theory that a second Trump administration would offer a friendly, regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.

Having cryptocurrency available as an option in a 401(k) plan would make it even easier to say ""why not"" and take a chance on investing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. But experts warn that the risks for sudden, dramatic drops in price remain.

The highly volatile investment isn't for the faint of heart.

Dramatic, double-digit fallouts have taken hits more than once. Bitcoin crashed by 84% in just one year, for example, from December 2017 to December 2018 when bitcoin closed at $3,815 on Dec. 30, 2018.

Right now, bitcoin has been riding high.

In the past 12 months alone, Bitcoin has doubled in value since it closed at $58,127.01 on Sept. 12, 2024. Bitcoin closed at $116,394.70 on Sept. 12, 2025.

Most of us, of course, aren't investing in bitcoin and aren't even sure how bitcoin works. Unlike a dollar bill, you cannot pull a bitcoin out of your pocket.

Coinbase notes: ""Unlike a normal wallet, which can hold actual cash, crypto wallets technically don't store your crypto. Your holdings live on the blockchain, but can only be accessed using a private key.""

And your keys prove your ownership of your digital money and allow you to make transactions. ""If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money,"" Coinbase notes. ""That's why it's important to keep your hardware wallet safe.""

A Gallup poll released in July indicated that one in seven U.S. adults, or 14%, report owning cryptocurrency now, with few others intending to buy it soon.

Some 60% of adults surveyed, according to the poll, indicated that they are not interested in ever buying cryptocurrency, indicating that they believe it is too risky.

The findings come from a June 2-15 survey of U.S. adults age 18 and older, conducted by the web using the probability-based Gallup Panel.

The poll was conducted before Trump signed the GENIUS Act on July 18, which, according to the White House, will ""make America the undisputed leader in digital assets, bringing massive investment and innovation to our country.""

Cautionary advice continues, as even Bedway says retirement savers will need to take into account their age and how close they are to retirement, as well as other factors before deciding how much they want to invest in cryptocurrency, if at all.

""There's a lot of fanfare around this,"" said J.J. Conway, who has a law firm which specializes in the litigation of employee benefits cases.

Conway says he doesn't want to take a completely dim view on alternative investments being offered in 401(k) plans. Higher earners in their 30s and 40s and more sophisticated investors might indeed benefit if they can withstand the volatility, he said.

But the average worker, someone who is punching a clock or coming in at a highly restrictive salary, might not be able to take on that kind of risk, he warned.

He asks: Will the higher chance of losing money with alternative investments, like cryptocurrency or private equity, make sense for someone who is older, maybe even a widow or widower, and must deal with living on a fixed income?

""Does this make sense? And I don't think the case has been made for that,"" Conway said.

Regulators, he said, also are being tasked with figuring out how to insulate those who provide alternative investments to retirement savers from potential liability. ""If this is so good, what's the concern? Why would you be thinking about lawsuits?""

Another concern, he said, is that the alternative investments typically involve extremely high fees that will cut into a retirement saver's profits.

Alicia Munnell, senior adviser of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, calls offering bitcoin in 401(k) plans a ""terrible idea.""

""Participants don't understand the product,"" she wrote in an essay in June. ""It's a speculative and volatile investment, straying from traditional investments is unlikely to enhance returns, and it's probably not a prudent option for 401(k)s.""

While the gambling has paid off for some, she wrote, adding bitcoin to 401(k) plans ""introduces unnecessary risk, and it is unlikely to improve returns.""

She and others have similar feelings about adding private equity investments into the 401(k) mix.

Sam Huszczo, a chartered financial analyst and founder of SGH Wealth Management in Southfield, said many people will need to move carefully if they want to select any alternative investments for their 401(k) plan once those options are offered.

When it comes to private equity deals that could show up in your 401(k), Huszczo warns that many of those deals likely will be offerings that were that rejected by nearly every single billionaire in America. Think of some offerings as ""the scrap heap"" of rejects.

No one, of course, is financially clairvoyant when it comes to the crypto story, private equity offerings or the odds for any other alternative investments might pop into your 401(k) plan. Putting any money in these types of investments will be new to most people, but old advice remains truer than ever: Buyer beware.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Ex-Coinbase exec says legacy economy is dying as tech and crypto rule","https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tech-and-crypto-replacing-legacy-economy/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:26:00 GMT","

Balaji Srinivasan, an American entrepreneur and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, has pointed out that developed countries such as the U.S. have shifted their focus from traditional economies to an internet-first economy driven by technology and digital platforms.

His remarks came after he shared an X post stating that it is time to say goodbye to the legacy economy and start embracing the Internet economy.

Srinivasan also shared a chart highlighting the widening growth gap between the Magnificent Seven, a group of major tech firms whose stock gains far outpaced the strong performance of the S&P 500 over the past decade, especially in 2023 and 2024, and the rest of the S&P 500, which has shown little change since 2005. The S&P 500 is a major stock market index that tracks the 500 largest companies listed on U.S. exchanges by market value.

Srinivasan pointed out the 2008 financial crisis, stating that all transactions and communications have begun taking place online since its occurrence. 

However, according to him, this is only the beginning of this journey. Based on his argument, the next phase will involve developing economies focusing on the internet, communities, cities, and even governments, concluding that the world is now concentrating on the Internet-First.

Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, continue to dominate as the leading tech giants driving this transformation.

Commenting on Srinivasan's remarks, analysts noted that the former Coinbase executive helped popularize the idea of Network States. From his perspective, these online communities could eventually evolve to rival or replace traditional nation-states.

According to him, such entities will depend on internet-based money, like cryptocurrencies, to function effectively, a transformation he likens to the Industrial Revolution, when society moved from farming to manufacturing.

Despite the promising developments surrounding this significant milestone, analysts have revealed obstacles hindering this success. According to their analysis, the financial system that is currently operating and government agencies usually take their time to adopt new technologies, slowing down innovation.

Considering the benefits of the internet sector in the economy, U.S. regulators and lawmakers have joined forces to support and encourage the research, development, and use of AI and blockchain technology to update the current financial system. This has sparked hope for more innovation in the economy.

In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint statement signalling a shift towards 24/7 capital markets. This change aims to connect the traditional financial system with the crypto sector, which carries out daily operations.

According to the regulators, a trading environment that is available 24/7 for various types of assets is essential to establish on-chain finance.

They also pointed out that it is important to set up clear regulations for event contracts and perpetual futures, which enable investors to speculate on the future of an asset's price without an expiration date.

However, the two agencies highlighted that by extending trading hours, U.S. markets can better relate to the reality that the global economy operates around the clock. They further explained that some types of assets may adopt this change more perfectly than others; hence, there will be one solution for every product.

Apart from this, the U.S. government has collaborated with oracle providers Pyth Network and Chainlink to share economic data on the blockchain to improve clarity and accountability regarding budgeting for the public.

Balaji Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase, has declared the legacy economy is fading as technology and crypto rule. He emphasized the transition to an internet-first economy. Srinivasan's remarks follow a post on X, urging the world to embrace the Internet economy. According to him, the global shift is inevitable and already well underway.

Srinivasan highlighted a chart showing the significant growth gap between the Magnificent Seven tech companies and traditional businesses. These tech giants, including Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia, have seen stock prices surge, especially in 2023 and 2024. In contrast, the broader S&P 500 index has remained stagnant since 2005.

“These companies are leading the charge, with stock gains far outpacing the performance of traditional companies,” Srinivasan noted. 

The former Coinbase executive pointed out the 2008 financial crisis as the turning point. Since then, most transactions and communications have shifted online, laying the groundwork for the internet-first economy.

Srinivasan believes that this is just the beginning. He predicts that the next phase will involve economies, cities, and governments embracing the internet. 

“The world is now focused on the Internet-First approach,” he stated, highlighting the ongoing evolution of the global economy.

In his comments, Srinivasan also explored the concept of Network States, an idea he popularized. He argued that online communities might eventually rival or replace traditional nation-states. These online communities would likely rely on internet-based currencies, such as crypto, to function effectively.

https://x.com/balajis/status/1969608133531353516 

The shift towards crypto and blockchain technology is seen as a modern-day equivalent to the Industrial Revolution. Just as society transitioned from farming to manufacturing, Srinivasan believes the internet-first era is reshaping society.

 “Crypto will play a crucial role in the next stage of economic development,” he stated.

Despite the promise of these changes, obstacles remain. Analysts point to the slow adoption of new technologies by financial systems and government agencies. They argue that outdated systems hinder innovation, delaying the full potential of tech and crypto.

The U.S. government has started to support the development of AI and blockchain technologies. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC are pushing for changes to align the traditional financial system with the growing crypto sector. This includes a push for 24/7 capital markets that better reflect the global, always-on economy.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released a joint statement in September. The two agencies aim to connect traditional markets with crypto and blockchain technologies. Their effort includes clearer regulations for event contracts and perpetual futures, which are essential for the crypto sector.

Further collaboration between the U.S. government and blockchain-based oracle providers like Pyth Network and Chainlink aims to enhance transparency. These initiatives will allow for clearer economic data sharing through blockchain, particularly for public budgeting.

Launching a crypto exchange in 2025 remains a potentially lucrative venture – but it's far from a plug-and-play business. This section explores what it takes to start (or acquire) an exchange, covering the spectrum from traditional centralized exchanges to decentralized trading platforms. We'll delve into legal hurdles, technology requirements, choosing between building vs. buying solutions, and how successful exchanges have navigated these waters.

One of the first strategic decisions is what type of exchange to operate. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Coinbase or Binance act as intermediaries: they hold users' funds in custodial wallets, maintain internal order books, and execute trades off-chain within their own systems topflightapps.com. Users log in to a CEX and trade through the platform's interface, trusting the company to securely custody assets and match orders. In contrast, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap or SushiSwap are protocols that facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions on a blockchain topflightapps.com. On a DEX, users trade directly from their own crypto wallets (self-custody), and transactions are recorded on-chain via smart contracts, often using automated market maker algorithms instead of traditional order books.

These models have fundamental differences in both user experience and operational demands:

Given these contrasts, hybrid models have also emerged – for example, some newer exchanges use a centralized entity for front-end and compliance but let users trade via non-custodial accounts (a bit of CEX and DEX blend). Determining your model will guide many other decisions: tech stack, budget, legal strategy, and target user base.

Regulation is often cited as the #1 barrier to launching a crypto exchange. Unlike many tech startups that can launch in a garage and worry about rules later, an exchange deals with money and investments – a highly regulated space. Laws vary widely by jurisdiction, but almost everywhere, you'll need to establish a compliant business entity and obtain relevant licenses or registrations:

No matter where you are, KYC/AML compliance is universal. Exchanges must verify customers' identities, monitor for suspicious transactions, implement record-keeping and reporting (e.g. suspicious activity reports) – all to prevent illicit finance through their platform hashcodex.com. This not only satisfies regulators but also builds trust with banking partners (who won't work with you if you're a compliance risk).

Legal costs and time can be significant. It's wise to budget for legal counsel from the start (some exchanges spend tens of thousands on legal fees before launch). There's also the consideration of jurisdiction strategy: do you launch globally from day one (risky), or start in one country and expand as you get licenses? Many successful exchanges launched in relatively permissive environments first – for instance, Binance initially operated from crypto-friendly locales and did not serve the U.S. until later via a separate entity. Others like FTX similarly were offshore. But being unregulated can catch up with you – global regulators can still bar your platform locally or even pursue enforcement (as seen by Binance facing multiple country bans/fines by 2023–2024).

In summary, anticipate a rigorous compliance regimen. As the industry saying goes, you can beg forgiveness or ask permission, but in crypto exchange land, asking permission (licenses) is the safer route. The regulatory outlook is gradually improving (clearer rules are being developed), yet enforcement is also increasing. Running an exchange means staying on top of evolving laws in every region you touch.

Building the tech backbone of a crypto exchange is a major undertaking. At its core, a centralized exchange's system consists of:

Developing all this from scratch can easily take a team of 10–20 skilled engineers many months. (Recall that Coinbase reportedly employs over 1,400 engineers, which underscores the scale at which top exchanges operate topflightapps.com.) The cost estimates we cited earlier – around $150k-$200k for an MVP – assume a streamlined feature set topflightapps.com. A fully competitive exchange with multi-asset support, mobile apps, and advanced features could run much higher in development costs.

Security deserves special emphasis. If you start an exchange, you are effectively becoming a high-value target for hackers worldwide. Best practices include:

For those leaning toward a DEX, the technical stack is different: your core is one or more smart contracts (e.g., an automated market maker contract). Forking an existing open-source DEX contract (like Uniswap's) can jump-start development, but be aware that many successful DEXs have unique innovations or tokenomics that drive their usage. You'll still need to create a web frontend and attract liquidity providers (often via issuing your own governance token as incentive). Smart contract security audits are a must – a bug in the contract can directly drain users' funds. Also, hosting a reliable frontend for your DEX is important (if your website goes down, users can't easily interact with the contracts unless they use command-line or alternate interfaces).

In short, whether CEX or DEX, technology is your product – it needs to be safe, fast, and user-friendly. Cutting corners here can be fatal. Plan for a substantial engineering effort and do not assume a “launch and done” approach; continuous development and maintenance will be needed to keep up with industry standards and user expectations.

Starting a crypto exchange requires significant funding – both to build the platform and to operate it until it becomes self-sustaining. Key financial considerations include:

A realistic plan might be: initial seed capital to build the platform, additional capital or revenue to support operations for X months, and a strategy to reach break-even on a per-month basis by Y users or Z trading volume. For context, trading volume is the key driver of revenue – a platform doing $100 million in monthly volume with a 0.2% fee on trades would earn $200,000 that month in fees. Top exchanges do billions in daily volume, but a new exchange might struggle to reach even tens of millions monthly without a unique market niche.

It's worth examining examples: Coinbase methodically built up volume and revenue by focusing on being legally accessible to retail users in the U.S. and expanding its offerings over years. Binance, in contrast, grew explosively in 2017–2018 by listing many altcoins, operating with minimal KYC early on, and attracting a global user base with low fees – essentially prioritizing growth over strict compliance at first (a strategy that brought huge market share, though with regulatory consequences later). Each path has trade-offs. The bottom line: ensure you have the funding to not only launch but to grow, and a clear idea of when the business might become self-funding via fees.

“Build it and they will come” does not apply in the crowded crypto exchange market. Dozens of exchanges vie for traders' attention, and incumbents have strong network effects (liquidity attracts more liquidity). So, you need a savvy go-to-market strategy:

User acquisition is indeed one of the hardest parts, as noted by many in the industry chainup.com. It's wise to have a marketing budget and expertise lined up from the beginning, rather than treating it as an afterthought. Some exchange founders bring on co-founders for growth or advisors with fintech marketing experience. In summary: a great product won't succeed without users, so have a plan (and funds) to win them.

We touched earlier on the cost differences of building from scratch versus using a white-label exchange solution. Let's expand on that decision:

A balanced approach some take is start with white-label to test the market, then migrate to custom-built once you gain traction. White-label providers often allow you to export data or even transition to self-hosting later. This way you get to market quickly and start generating revenue, and if you outgrow the platform, you then raise funds to build your own. The risk there is the transition can be complex (you don't want downtime or user disruption when switching systems).

To illustrate, a 2024 industry analysis put it this way: white-label solutions offer a middle ground between cost and customization – higher cost than a simple DEX clone, but far cheaper and faster than scratch-built, with flexibility to tailor some features to your needs topflightapps.com topflightapps.com. Many successful exchanges in smaller countries or niche markets are essentially white-label implementations with local branding.

Financially, also note that white-label providers have various pricing models: some charge a flat setup fee plus a monthly support fee, others also take a tiny slice of trading volume. Make sure to model those costs as your volume grows.

In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all. If your priority is speed to market and limited budget, a white-label is likely the best choice. If you have a unique product vision or very specific requirements (or the backing of investors who want proprietary tech), building custom could be justified. What matters is that whichever route, you ensure the platform is secure, scalable, and compliant.

The crypto exchange arena has seen spectacular successes – and spectacular failures. Learning from them can inform your strategy:

Finally, academia and researchers have weighed in on what makes or breaks exchanges. A 2024 study of 845 exchange failures found that exchanges operating in highly regulated countries (like U.S.) paradoxically had higher failure rates, likely due to the pressures of compliance costs and threat of enforcement phys.org. It also found warning signs like excessively high withdrawal fees often precede an exchange's collapse (struggling exchanges tried to squeeze more revenue, a red flag) phys.org. And of course, security incidents have felled many: Mt. Gox (once the biggest Bitcoin exchange) collapsed in 2014 after losing coins to hackers, an event so seminal that “Mt. Gox'd” became slang for lost crypto. The takeaway is that running an exchange is as much about risk management as it is about facilitating trades.

In summary, to emulate the successes and avoid the failures: prioritize compliance, security, and transparency from the start; know your target users and serve them better than alternatives; and be ready to adapt quickly in this fast-moving industry. The exchange space isn't an easy win – but for those who execute well, it can be immensely rewarding, as the likes of Coinbase and Binance have proven.

Even as regulators debate crypto's future and some skeptics call crypto a passing fad, one trend has become unmistakable: young people – including teenagers – have embraced cryptocurrency at remarkable rates. In 2025, the “crypto generation” is not just millennials in their 30s; it's increasingly Gen Z and even Gen Alpha (today's teens). This section explores what's driving teenagers toward crypto, how they're getting access, and what implications this has.

For many teenagers, the appeal of crypto is rooted in the promise of financial opportunity. Growing up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and seeing traditional paths to wealth (like buying a home) become more challenging, young people are eager for new avenues. Crypto – with its tales of Bitcoin millionaires and 100x token gains – offers a tantalizing chance to “make it” at a young age.

Of course, motivations vary. Some are just curious because their friends are doing it. Others are drawn by the cultural hype (more on that next). But at the core, crypto offers hope of fast profits and a feeling of empowerment, which is a potent combination for a 16- or 17-year-old figuring out their place in the world.

If Wall Street in the 20th century was driven by suits reading the Financial Times, crypto in the 2020s is driven by memes and viral videos. Social media has been the amplifier of youth interest in crypto:

However, the social media factor is a double-edged sword. The information teens get is often high on hype, low on substance. Viral trends like “#CryptoTrading” on TikTok led to such concern that in mid-2021 TikTok actually banned promotional content about financial services (though plenty of content still slips through). Studies of TikTok's financial content found a lot of it to be misleading or one-sided cryptorank.io. A teen might not have the experience to separate good advice from bad.

Parents and authorities are keenly aware of this dynamic. Some schools have started including discussions on cryptocurrency in personal finance classes, not to encourage it, but to inform students so they don't just learn from potentially misleading online sources. The peer pressure element also means that if “everyone” is talking about the latest coin that “will go 100x,” a teenager might jump in out of social inclusion, not wanting to be the one who “missed out” at lunch table discussions.

In essence, social media has made crypto as much a cultural phenomenon as a financial one among youth. It creates excitement and community – which are positives – but also can foster unrealistic expectations.

Given that most regulated exchanges restrict accounts to adults (18+), how exactly are teenagers buying and trading crypto? It turns out teens have proven resourceful and found multiple avenues:

From a legal standpoint, most jurisdictions don't criminalize a minor holding cryptocurrency – the laws focus on businesses (exchanges) not serving minors, rather than minors possessing assets. For example, UK law doesn't forbid under-18s from owning Bitcoin coinmarketcap.com; it's the platforms that voluntarily or by regulation restrict under-18 accounts. This means if a teen acquires crypto, they're generally not breaking the law per se – unless they lie about their age to open an account (which could be a terms-of-service violation but not usually a crime). Thus enforcement is tricky, and it falls largely on parents to monitor this.

We've touched on some risks earlier, but let's summarize and add context specific to teenagers:

The rise of teen crypto traders has not gone unnoticed. Here are some perspectives:

In conclusion, teenagers flocking to crypto is a sign of the times: it reflects both the broad democratization of finance via technology and the unique challenges of raising a generation in an age of digital speculation. Crypto offers tremendous learning opportunities – a savvy teen could come out with early investing experience and perhaps even profits – but it also poses significant risks to those not prepared for its pitfalls. The trend “even in 2025” shows that despite market ups and downs (and there have been downs, like the 2022 bear market), young people's interest in crypto remains high. In a way, crypto has attained a cultural permanence among the youth akin to social media itself.

For any teenager (or parent of one) reading: approach crypto like you would a powerful tool – it can do big things, but if used recklessly, it can also cause big harm. As the saying goes, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and maybe double that caution if you're a minor. With knowledge, moderation, and oversight, teens can be part of the crypto world without being exploited by it – but getting that balance right is the challenge ahead for families and regulators alike.

Introducing the Commercially Ready Qastle Hot Wallet Powered by QeM's QRNG

Montreal, Quebec and Monroe, Louisiana--(Newsfile Corp. - September 22, 2025) - Krown Technologies Inc. (""Krown""), a leader in blockchain and digital asset security, and Quantum eMotion Corp. (TSXV: QNC) (OTCQB: QNCCF) (FSE: 34Q0) (""QeM""), a Canadian innovator in quantum-based cybersecurity, are proud to announce the successful completion of the Qastle Quantum-Safe Hot Wallet. This milestone represents a breakthrough in securing cryptocurrencies and digital assets against both today's advanced cyber threats and the looming risks of quantum computing.

The Qastle Wallet integrates QeM's patented ultrafast Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) technology with Krown's advanced blockchain security architecture. By generating true, unpredictable entropy at gigabit speeds, QeM's QRNG ensures the strongest cryptographic keys possible, resistant to both classical and quantum attacks. The wallet is further strengthened with post-quantum encryption protocols, offering unprecedented protection for digital assets in real-time transaction environments.

""This milestone confirms our vision of building the most secure blockchain wallets in the industry,"" said James Stephens, CEO of Krown Technologies Inc. ""Together with QeM, we are delivering a solution that brings unmatched protection to both retail and institutional users at a time when cyberattacks and quantum threats are converging. With Qastle now completed, we are in the final stages of our commercialization planning and will soon be sharing details of our market rollout.""

""The Qastle wallet demonstrates the tangible, practical impact of quantum technologies in protecting the digital economy,"" added Dr. Francis Bellido, CEO of Quantum eMotion. ""Powered by QeM's patented QRNG technology, it establishes the true entropy backbone required to safeguard blockchain infrastructures in the quantum era.""

The Urgent Need for Quantum-Safe Blockchain SecurityToday's blockchain networks and digital wallets rely heavily on public key cryptography (RSA, ECC) to secure transactions and private keys. While effective against classical threats, these algorithms are vulnerable to the exponential computing power of quantum computers. Emerging quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm could, once deployed at scale, break widely used cryptographic schemes-potentially exposing billions of dollars' worth of digital assets to theft or manipulation. Analysts warn that ""harvest now, decrypt later"" attacks are already being prepared, in which malicious actors capture encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it once quantum computers become powerful enough. This makes the shift to quantum-safe encryption and true entropy generation a critical and urgent necessity for the blockchain ecosystem.

Market Opportunity for Hot WalletsThe launch of the Qastle Wallet coincides with a rapidly expanding market. The global crypto wallet market was valued at USD 3.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 33.6 billion by 2033 (CAGR nearly 30%). Hot wallets account for more than half of this market, driven by their convenience for daily transactions and increasing institutional adoption. With revenues for hot wallets alone expected to grow from USD 1.5 billion in 2024 to over USD 5 billion by 2033, the opportunity for secure, quantum-safe solutions is immense.

The Qastle Quantum-Safe Hot Wallet developed by Krown and QeM is well-positioned to capture this growth, delivering unmatched levels of trust, convenience, and future-proof security.

With valuations of crypto treasury companies headed very quickly south in recent weeks, sector consolidation seemed a certainty at some point, with the only question being when it would start.

It has.

Strive (ASST) has agreed to buy Semler Scientific (SMLR) in an all-stock deal that represents a 210% premium, or $90.52 per share, based on Friday's market close, according to a press release. Each share of SMLR will be exchange of 21.05 shares of ASST.

Semler Executive Chairman Eric Semler is expected to join the board of the combined company.

Alongside, Strive announced the purchase of 5,816 bitcoin BTC$112,502.93 for $675 million, or an average price of $116,047 each.

Adding that to Semler's roughly 5,000 in bitcoin holdings, the combined company would hold more than 10,900 BTC.

The deal comes as Semler Scientific shares have been under relentless pressure for several weeks, trading for well below the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet, thus presumably giving negative value to its medical equipment business. The popping of the crypto treasury bubble this summer has left a number of companies in similar positions.

""This merger cements Strive's position as a top Bitcoin treasury company,"" said Matt Cole, chairman and CEO of Strive. ""We believe our alpha-seeking strategies and capital structure position us to outperform bitcoin over the long run.""

ASST shares are higher by 9.3% premarket to $4.71. SMLR shares haven't traded since the announcement hit, but closed at $29.18 on Friday.

Real-world assets (RWA) focused project Midas and Interop Labs unveiled mXRP, an attempt to channel dormant XRP supply into yield-bearing structures the could deliver returns as high as 8%.

Announced at XRPL Seoul 2025 on Monday and pitched as the first liquid-staking product tied directly to the XRP ecosystem, the product is minted on XRPL's EVM through audited contracts. XRP is bridged in and wrapped under Midas' tokenized certificate framework. 

MXRP can be used as a structured vehicle that users can slot into existing decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, with early strategies including market-making and liquidity provisioning.

Targeted net returns are set in the 6%–8% range, with outcomes fluctuating depending on underlying strategy performance. 

“Much of the XRP supply has been dormant for years; mXRP provides a transparent mechanism for users to access on-chain strategies,” said Dennis Dinkelmeyer, co-founder and CEO of Midas. “With strong community demand and DeFi integrations, we believe mXRP can play a key role in unlocking new use cases for XRP.”

The mXRP token is fully integrated within the XRPL EVM ecosystem at launch and can be deployed across DeFi protocols, such as lending markets and native integrations,  to access additional opportunities.

 The whale started withdrawing their HYPE tokens after nine months of holding, with an unrealized profit of about $90 million. 

Update Sept. 22, 1:31 p.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include quotes from Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

Large cryptocurrency investors, or whales, are cashing out of Hyperliquid's native token as concerns grow over an upcoming vesting schedule that could unleash about $11 billion worth of supply.

Whale wallet “0x316f” withdrew $122 million worth of Hyperliquid (HYPE) tokens on Monday, which had been acquired for about $12 per token.

The whale was sitting on about $90 million of unrealized profit nine months after buying the tokens and is likely “selling for profit,” according to blockchain data platform Lookonchain.

The selling comes as the HYPE token rallied to a new all-time high of $59.29 on Thursday, but faces its first major test in November when team tokens begin vesting.

According to the Hyper Foundation, 23.8% of the total supply allocated to core contributors will start unlocking on Nov. 29, a year after the project's genesis event.

The vesting schedule will distribute about $11.9 billion HYPE tokens over 24 months for the team, which may be the “first true test” for the resilience of the token, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes' family office fund, Maelstrom, said on Monday.

In what it dubbed a “Sword of Damocles” moment, it will introduce about $500 million worth of monthly unlocks, of which only about 17% will be absorbed by buybacks, leaving about $410 million in potential supply overhang, according to Maelstrom researcher Lukas Ruppert.

“Token unlocks generally can create some sell pressure,” which is not necessarily tied to a token's “fundamentals,” according to Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

Sondergaard pointed out that not all recipients will sell, with some holding their tokens to signal confidence in the project.

Maelstrom's research was published shortly after Hayes sold all his HYPE tokens, which he apparently used to pay the deposit for a new Ferrari, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Monday.

“Need to pay my deposit on the new Rari 849 Testarossa,” Hayes said on Sunday. 

Other whales appeared to be shifting to Hyperliquid's emerging competitor, Aster, a decentralized perpetuals exchange linked to Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao.

On Monday, whale address “0x220” bought $10.5 million worth of Aster tokens across two wallets and is currently holding over $6 million in unrealized profit, Lookonchain said in a Monday X post.

Over the past week, the Aster token rose by more than 1,700% to become the industry's fourth-largest DEX token with a market capitalization of $2.5 billion.

The HYPE token fell 7.9% during the same period to trade at $49.34 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data.

 The United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Finance said the government will roll out the framework in 2027 and begin sharing information in 2028. 

The United Arab Emirates took a step toward aligning its digital asset policies with international tax standards by signing the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Automatic Exchange of Information under the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). 

The UAE's Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced the agreement on Saturday, formalizing the UAE's commitment to implementing the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) global regime for digital asset reporting. 

CARF creates a mechanism for the automatic exchange of tax-related information on crypto asset activities between participating jurisdictions. This strengthens international cooperation on transparency and tax compliance. 

The MOF announced that the UAE will roll out the framework in 2027, with the initial information exchange expected to start in 2028. 

Cointelegraph reached out to the UAE Ministry of Finance for more information, but did not receive a response by publication. 

To prepare for implementation, the UAE launched a public consultation to gather feedback from industry stakeholders, including exchanges, custodians, traders and advisory firms. The consultation opened Sept. 15 and will close Nov. 8. 

The UAE joined 50 other jurisdictions that have committed to implementing CARF in the coming years, setting the stage for a global approach to crypto tax reporting. 

Countries including New Zealand, Australia and the Netherlands have also committed to adapting the framework.

On June 6, Switzerland also moved forward with the plans to automatically share crypto-related tax data with 74 partner countries. The Swiss government adopted a bill that would enable the automatic exchange of information, sharing data with most G20 countries.

On Sept. 2, South Korean media outlet Nate reported that the country had also finalized the agreement to implement CARF to share crypto tax data with participating jurisdictions. 

The country's National Tax Service will be collaborating with local crypto exchanges and international organizations to automatically share tax information. 

Apart from participating in the global information exchange framework, the country has also cracked down on tax delinquents' crypto assets. 

On Aug. 17, South Korea's Jeju City engaged in freezing and seizing crypto assets of users believed to be dodging tax requirements.

 Bitcoin's drop to $112,000 saw significant liquidations of late longs, with onchain metrics suggesting that BTC's bullish conviction was fading. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin dropped 4% to $112,000 in a marketwide correction, liquidating $1.6 billion in longs.

Analysts say the BTC bull market may have run its course, based on several bearish onchain signals.

Bitcoin bears extended sell-side activity into the weekly open on Monday as a drop to $112,000  resulted in a large liquidation of leveraged positions across the crypto market. 

According to analysts, Bitcoin showed signs of “cycle exhaustion,” pointing to further downside. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price fell as low as $111,980 on Monday, down 4% in the past 24 hours, amid a broader market tumble, per Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

This extended the deviation from the Aug. 14 all-time high of $124,500 to 10% and was accompanied by massive liquidations across the derivatives market.

Over $1.62 billion in long positions was liquidated, with Ether (ETH) accounting for $479.6 million. Bitcoin followed with $277.5 million in long liquidations.

Across the board, a total of $1.7 billion was wiped out of the market in short and long positions, as shown in the figure below.

The sudden market drop led to the liquidation of 402,730 traders over the period, catching many off guard as investor sentiment flipped bearish.

The Bitcoin liquidation heatmap showed the price eating away liquidity around $112,000, with more than $400 million bid orders between $111,500 and $110,000. 

This suggests that Bitcoin's price might drop further to sweep this liquidity before any potential recovery.

The Fed's interest rate cut last week, which was once viewed as a vital bullish catalyst for BTC, failed to push markets higher, implying that the Bitcoin bull cycle may have run its course. 

“Bitcoin is already showing signs of cycle exhaustion and very few are seeing it,” said Alphractal founder Joao Wedson in an X post on Monday. 

Several onchain signals now warn that Bitcoin's rally may have run out of steam.

Bitcoin's Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a metric that measures the overall profitability of all spent Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain, showed fading profitability, raising chances of a deeper correction.

The Sharpe ratio was weaker than in 2024, meaning risk vs return and profit potential were lower. 

“This won't attract as many institutions as most people believe,” said Wedson, adding:

Bitcoin's taker buy/sell ratio across all exchanges, a metric gauging market sentiment, was at -0.79, according to data from CryptoQuant.

When the metric dips below 1, it indicates that bears are in control of the market, and when the metric is above 1, it shows that bulls are in control.

The ratio at -0.79 indicates that active selling volume (taker sell) now outpaces buying, reflecting negative trader sentiment.

The last time similar levels were observed was at the Jan. 20 peak, when Bitcoin reached the $109,000 range before entering a three-month correction period that saw BTC price drop by 32% to $74,000 in April. 

The taker buy/sell ratio reinforces that the market is in a critical zone, as growing selling pressure exposes weaknesses in Bitcoin's price structure. 

As Cointelegraph reported, analysts are now mixed on the possibility of a rally in October after markets turned bearish on Monday.

The Sordid Mystery of a Somalian Meteorite Smuggled into China

How a space rock vanished from Africa and showed up for sale across an ocean

By Dan Vergano edited by Clara Moskowitz

Mark Smith

Millennia ago a piece of the sky fell toward East Africa, streaking overhead, born of an ancient collision of asteroids. The meteorite landed, probably with more of a thud than a boom, in a river valley where camels now forage near the village of El Ali in Somalia.

Known locally as Shiid-birood (“the iron rock”), the El Ali meteorite is 13.6 metric tons of iron and nickel. For generations it rested in the ground some 24 kilometers (15 miles) outside the village, becoming a landmark that was featured in folklore, lullabies and poems. According to one story, the region had been a green paradise until its inhabitants stopped believing in Waaq, the local god, who punished them with volcanic stones, leaving behind the El Ali meteorite as a reminder of their folly. Over the centuries people hammered the brown rock from the heavens with stones, banging off flakes of cold iron, or used it as a whetstone. Children pretended to ride it like a horse.

Now, though, the El Ali meteorite is gone. Shaky cell-phone videos suggest the rock is being stored in China, where sellers hope to hock it for millions, either whole or in pieces. How did it get there? The journey of the ninth-largest meteorite in the world involves lies, smuggling and possibly death. Mystery surrounds its departure from its landing site, a lawless region of Somalia, one of the poorest and most contested places on the planet. In August, a Somali cultural minister asked the UNESCO World Heritage Center to recognize the meteorite as part of the country's patrimony, calling for its return in a statement. The fate of the cosmic cannonball is now anyone's guess.

For centuries the El Ali meteorite, a brownish, pitted boulder some two meters wide and one meter tall, went unnoticed by anyone but locals. Village elders say that about 80 years ago, during World War II, the Italian army suggested removing it for study. Later, United Nations peacekeeping forces eyed it, and so did militias after the 1991 collapse of Somalia's government. They were all drawn by the mystery of Shiid-birood, seeing the curious iron rock sitting on the outskirts of a Somali camel-herder village as an object of research—or at least scrap metal. But locals stopped all these extraction attempts. Then, in September 2019, opal hunters scouring the surrounding desert reported the meteorite to a nearby mining outfit—the Kureym Mining and Rocks Company, a Somalia-based firm led by five traders and businessmen in Mogadishu, the country's capital. Using a hammer, prospectors chiseled a 90-gram sample from the space rock they renamed “Nightfall” and sent it off to Nairobi for analysis. Those samples confirmed for the first time that the meteorite was indeed extraterrestrial, comprising some 44 percent iron and 45 percent nickel.

This is where the story of the El Ali meteorite turns murky—and grim.

We know from news reports and human rights groups that sometime in February 2020, the stone was removed from the village El Ali. The area is largely controlled by al-Shabaab, or “the Youth,” a militant affiliate of al-Qaeda that has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. Al-Shabaab ruled Mogadishu into the late 2000s but was then dislodged by African Union forces. The organization is responsible for numerous bombings and killings, including the massacre of 148 people at Kenya's Garissa University in 2015, as well as an “extensive racketeering operation” in Somalia, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Given the group's authority in the region, it seems likely that it orchestrated the looting of the meteorite or at least assisted in it.

No one knows exactly what happened after the meteorite was carted out of El Ali, though. News reports from the time say the rock was “forcibly taken” by al-Shabaab. They describe large cranes excavating the stone amid gunfights that reportedly left several people dead, including civilians. Some accounts put the toll even higher, with local leaders describing in news reports two full-scale firefights—one during the dig and one as the meteorite was trucked away—between al-Shabaab and fighters from the clan-based Ma'awisley militia. Some leaders say the fighting included beheadings. But Abdulkadir Abiikar Hussein, a geologist at Almaas University in Mogadishu, calls the reports of bloodshed “exaggerations.”

Whichever way the extraction went down, most accounts agree on what happened next. Militia members drove the meteorite to the nearby town of Buq Aqable, then reportedly sold it to the Kureym mining company for $264,000.

From there the truck carrying the stolen space rock started to make its way toward Mogadishu, but it was detained on the drive. Somalian government officials impounded the vehicle for inspection, Hussein says, after security forces on the road into the city grew suspicious of the big metal boulder in the back of a truck and arrested the lone driver. They sent the meteorite to a warehouse near the local airport. At that point, in late February 2020, the government's mining ministry called in Hussein. He measured, sampled and tested the meteorite in the warehouse, making the first characterizations of the cosmic rock, which would appear later in scholarly descriptions.

Somehow, however, the meteorite was released. By December 2020 Shiid-birood was back in the hands of Kureym, although the details of the transaction are unclear (Hussein and others say it was corrupt). Kureym representatives declined to comment on the record for this article.

The El Ali meteorite's original landing site in Somalia is a dry valley without much vegetation.

From “El Ali Meteorite: From Whetstone to Fame and to the Tragedy of Local People's Heritage,” by Ali H. Egeh, in Meteoritics and Planetary Science; June 12, 2025

Scientists outside Somalia first learned about the meteorite from representatives of the mining company late that year. After Kureym took possession of the stone, Nicholas Gessler, a now retired researcher of anthropology, archaeology and meteorites, got an e-mail about a large meteorite. The sender offered Gessler a chance to study it, saying they were looking for buyers. Piqued by a longtime interest in iron meteorites used by Indigenous people, he agreed to get it analyzed for publication in the Meteoritical Bulletin, a necessity to verify its provenance as a meteorite. Investigating the El Ali meteorite has since called on every one of his areas of expertise, he says, and became an obsession leading him to compile an extensive website tracking the object and what he can piece together of its sordid history. “Nothing is clear,” Gessler says. “People have repeatedly asked for clarity and documentation. None has been provided.”

In January 2021, after Gessler agreed to help register the meteorite, a representative of Kureym sent him a sample. A lump of iron rock, one side weathered brown, the other shining dully from the saw's incision, arrived in a FedEx package. Around the same time, the company also shipped two sliced chunks of iron rock totaling 70 grams to geologist Chris Herd, curator of the meteorite collection at the University of Alberta.

Both researchers say they wish they had known the full story of the meteorite and its contested ownership at the time. Up to that point, rumors of any violence during its excavation had been confined to Somalian news reports. Only four years later, in June 2025, did a Meteoritics & Planetary Science report by geoscientist Ali H. Egeh of the Somali National University first communicate to the scientific community the “secrecy and uncertainty” surrounding the meteorite and its removal from its home country.

“When I first did the work, I had no knowledge of what had happened, the tragic circumstances,” Herd says. “We were, in retrospect, getting quite biased information” about both the removal of the El Ali meteorite and its export to China. Canadian law, Herd adds, is very strict about the export of meteorites. Temporary loans of samples for study are permitted, but permanent ones are much more sensitive. “For Somalia, this would qualify as having outstanding significance and national importance,” he says. “It is a real shame it has been wholesale exported.”

At the time, Herd and Gessler were simply excited about the opportunity to investigate a meteorite—one that would turn out to be scientifically exciting in several ways. Herd first analyzed his sample with a scanning electron microscope, which shoots a beam of low-energy electrons at solid samples, to view its surface in fine detail. He also used a spectrometer to reveal its elemental makeup. A colleague at the California Institute of Technology employed an electron microscope that used a narrow electron beam with ultrafine 30-nanometer resolution to further analyze the object's chemistry. Gessler sent part of his sample to A. J. Timothy Jull of the University of Arizona, an expert on dating meteorites, who estimated that it had landed in Somalia 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, based on radiocarbon dating. (Jull cautions that this “very rough estimate” is uncertain and says that other preliminary radionuclide data show that it must have landed 60,000 to 30,000 years ago at the earliest.) Later in 2021 Gessler presented the El Ali meteorite to the Meteoritical Society, recognizing it as the third-largest meteorite discovered in Africa.

Meanwhile, through his correspondence with Kureym, Gessler learned the company hoped to sell the meteorite to a museum for around $30 million. In more than a dozen e-mails, Gessler warned the sales representatives that this plan was unrealistic. But in August 2021 the company's representatives cut off contact. They complained about his collaboration on the Meteoritical Bulletin entry for the El Ali meteorite with Hussein, the Almaas University geologist who had first measured the meteorite for Somalia's mining ministry and who was advocating that it be placed in the National Museum of Somalia, not sold.

Still, Gessler and Herd continued to analyze their samples. In 2023 Herd and his colleagues reported that they had discovered three new iron phosphate minerals in the El Ali meteorite that had never been identified as naturally occurring on Earth. “It's hugely significant scientifically,” says Herd, who classified the meteorite in the type IAB family. Meteorites in this group are likely to have originated in smashups in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, which created an “almost hard-to-imagine” sea of molten metal magma, Herd says. Born of collisions in space millions of years ago, these cauldrons baked their ingredients together in unusual ways, producing phosphate minerals such as elaliite, elkinstantonite and olsenite (the last two are named after revered meteoritic scientists).

Mark Smith

Given that the El Ali samples are only small slivers of a meteorite weighing more than 10 metric tons, “there could be numerous other new minerals within different areas of it,” says Diane Johnson of Cranfield University in England, an expert in ancient iron meteorites. These minerals lace the El Ali meteorite, residing inside tiny inclusions roughly the width of a human hair. “I never thought I'd be part of a study finding new minerals, much less three of them,” Herd says. “The really cool thing is when you do find them, people start to ask whether they exist in other meteorites.” Studying these deposits could reveal new secrets about the chemistry of the early solar system.

The results made a splash in the news and were reported by the BBC, among other outlets. Gessler, at that point invested in the fate of Shiid-birood both professionally and personally, contacted scientists in Somalia. It was then that he first learned about the accounts of bloodshed during its removal. He tried to piece together as much of the story as he could, gathering photographs and videos of the meteorite and posting them on a sprawling website devoted to it. Official representatives of Kureym had stopped communicating with him, but he began to receive text messages from people associated with the sellers, who sometimes sent updates on the meteorite's sales prospects and even videos showing its move to China. Their recent messages, which he posted at the top of his website in September, have featured bickering between two sellers over prices.

In addition to its value for solar system science, the meteorite could tell us about human history. Gessler is curious about its historic role as a source of cold iron for people in Somalia. The pitted brown lump “has been intensively and extensively hammered,” Gessler says, pounded by generations of people who extracted bits of iron from the rock, probably to make tools such as arrowheads or handles. “It is a really interesting example of Indigenous use of meteorites as a resource by a community,” he says.

The Iron Age in Somalia, he suggests, might have started with the El Ali meteorite.

People across the world have long exploited meteoritic metal. A knife found in the tomb of 14th-century B.C.E. Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen was made of meteoritic nickel, iron and cobalt. In the 11th century C.E., followers of the pre-Buddhist Bon religion in Tibet fashioned a statue, thought to be of the Buddhist god Vaiśravana, from a metal-rich meteorite that had landed on the border between modern-day Mongolia and Siberia. A Nazi-backed expedition looted the statue around 1939, and now it's privately owned by someone in Vienna. The Cape York meteorites are eight large rocks and other fragments weighing about 60 metric tons total that landed on Greenland's western coast. The Inuit people of Greenland used these rocks to make tools and harpoons. They are the best-known example of Indigenous people exploiting meteoritic stones for iron.

These cases also further demonstrate how commonly meteorites are looted from their original communities. The largest known pieces of the Cape York meteorites, for instance, are long gone from Greenland. U.S. Navy explorer Robert Peary took two of the heaviest ones, the “Dog” and the “Woman,” in 1895, and in 1897 he carried off the biggest one, the “Tent,” which weighed 31 metric tons and was more than three meters across. He sold all three meteorite pieces to the American Museum of Natural History, where they are still displayed, for $40,000—a fortune then—in a Victorian-era example of meteorite treasure hunting and exploitation of Native resources. Peary also convinced six Inuit people to return to New York City with him, where four died of tuberculosis. Another 20-metric-ton fragment of the meteorite was discovered in 1963 and taken to Copenhagen four years later.

A similar story may be playing out with the El Ali meteorite. Its exact location and status now are hazy. In December 2022 the boulder was inside a shipping container on a boat docked at Mogadishu, according to a cell-phone video passed along to Gessler during his sporadic communications with the sellers. After that, it was next recorded in a shaky May 2023 video verifying the meteorite had arrived in China, still under mysterious circumstances. In that video, a speaker talks in Somali, and someone holds up a phone bearing Chinese writing in front of the meteorite. The most recent reports from the sellers and from scientists following the market for meteorites suggest the El Ali object is being held in storage in Yiwu, a midsize city in the Chinese province of Zhejiang, and is being offered for sale in pieces at $200 a gram or at $3.2 million for the entire thing, Gessler says.

“This was a cultural looting operation, not a legal trade,” Dahir Jesow, El Ali's representative in the Somalian parliament, told the Horn Afrik News Agency for Human Rights in June. The Kureym mining company's rights to the meteorite were “hastily legalized ad hoc through a murky administrative process—essentially post factum to cover the theft,” he said.

Sales of meteorites by their legal owners are legal, of course, and records of such sales date as far back as 1863, when one was documented in a catalog written by a German collector. Even famous meteorites are regularly bought and sold; a slice of a Cape York meteorite was offered for sale at Christie's in 2019.

In July 2025 a Martian meteorite retrieved from the Sahara Desert in 2023—reportedly the largest piece of the Red Planet on Earth, at 25 kilograms—sold for $5.3 million to an unknown buyer at auction by Sotheby's. Niger's government then announced an investigation into the removal of the meteorite, “which likely bears the hallmarks of illicit international trafficking,” the Nigerian Council of Ministers said in a statement issued the day after the sale. Sotheby's, however, says it followed all relevant international procedures in the export of the meteorite, including documentation. Like the El Ali meteorite, the Martian rock was described by scholars in a Meteoritical Bulletin entry, this one published in June 2025.

A patchwork of international laws governs such sales. In the U.S., meteorites are owned by whoever owns the land they're discovered on, and those found on public land go to the Smithsonian. A 1970 UNESCO cultural-artifacts convention recognized by 148 countries, including the U.S. and Canada but not Somalia, outlines a system for tracking meteorites and returning them to their home countries if necessary. But Shiid-birood's legal status is uncertain: Sharia law currently governs the area it was taken from, but scholars aren't sure how the law treats meteorites. If UNESCO declares the El Ali object to be part of the cultural heritage of Somalia, as the government has requested, sale of the meteorite would become more difficult.

Within the past five years the market for meteorites has exploded, says criminologist Donna Yates of Maastricht University in Germany, following in the footsteps of the fossil and antiquities trades. “There's a kind of a profile to that buyer, one that's very interested in science and space and deep time and so on,” she says. “And those people visit the meteorite market.” The Meteoritical Society has an ethics code requiring researchers to “adhere to laws” in their investigations, but it offers little guidance on exported finds.

China has become a destination for smuggled meteorites in recent years. In 2019 customs authorities seized 857 kilograms of “dolomite” that turned out to be meteorites taken from Kenya, and in 2021 they captured 470 kilograms of iron meteorites listed as pyrite ore in customs declarations. The Kamil impact crater in Egypt was reportedly “strip-mined” for iron meteorites sometime between 2020 and 2023. “There are museums full of stolen stuff,” Jull says.

Both the legal status of the El Ali meteorite and the plans of its current custodians are unclear. “The worry is that it will be ground up a piece at a time to make keychains,” Gessler says. Ideally it would be returned to Somalia. In mid-July, Hussein, the geologist in Mogadishu, heard from members of the Kureym mining company who want to sell the meteorite back to Somalia's government. The company's lack of paperwork has stymied sales to international institutions. Only Somalia's government can make it legitimate, he says, making a return transaction the simplest way for the sellers to turn a profit from the meteorite. The National Museum of Somalia, once a trove of treasured antiquities, was closed for 30 years during the country's civil war. Although many of its artifacts were damaged or stolen, the museum reopened in 2020, with space for a meteorite display under a reinforced stand. “University students and children from even elementary schools would come to see it,” Hussein says. He envisions international researchers collaborating with local university students to build expertise in geochemistry in Somalia. “Now we'll have to raise the money.”

Even if the meteorite does come home, its safety isn't guaranteed. Dalmar Asad, a spokesperson for the Coalition of Somali Human Rights Defenders in Mogadishu, is skeptical that his country can protect Shiid-birood if it returns to Somalia. Security is still very uncertain, he says, even in Mogadishu. He worries that local misunderstandings about the meteorite—some early news reports suggested it was made of gold—might prompt someone else to attempt to steal it, even from the museum. “I think it would be better for an international organization to host the meteorite until the situation here is more secure,” he says.

For now the El Ali meteorite remains in limbo very far from home. Its ultimate destination is just as uncertain as it was when it was in the asteroid belt, bouncing across the sky. Wherever it ends up, though, this piece from the heavens may impart lasting lessons on Earth. The meteorite's tale should teach scholars to ask harder questions about the provenance of newly reported discoveries, says planetary scientist Hasnaa Chennaoui Aoudjehane of the Hassan II University of Casablanca in Morocco. “This community is my community; many scientists are friends of mine,” she says. “But in some cases, we are just closing our eyes. We don't want to take on the reality of the problem because if we do, there will be much less material to study.”

Deep-Earth Diamonds Reveal ‘Almost Impossible' Chemistry

Seemingly contradictory materials are trapped together in two glittering diamonds from South Africa, shedding light on how diamonds form

By Stephanie Pappas edited by Andrea Thompson

Deep-Earth diamond.

Yael Kempe and Yakov Weiss

A pair of diamonds that formed hundreds of kilometers deep in Earth's malleable mantle both contain specks of materials that form in completely opposing chemical environments—a combination so unusual that researchers thought their coexistence was “almost impossible.” The substances' presence provides a window into the chemical goings-on of the mantle and the reactions that form diamonds.

The two diamond samples were found in a South African mine. As with plenty of other precious gemstones, they contain what are called inclusions—tiny bits of surrounding rocks captured as the diamonds form. These inclusions are loathed by most jewelers but are an exciting source of information for scientists. That's especially true when diamonds form deep in the unreachable mantle, because they carry these inclusions basically undisturbed to the surface—the only way those minerals can rise hundreds of kilometers without being altered from their original deep-mantle state.

The two new diamond samples each contain inclusions of carbonate minerals that are rich in oxygen atoms (a state known as oxidized) and oxygen-poor nickel alloys (a state known as reduced, in the parlance of chemistry). Much like how an acid and a base immediately react to form water and a salt, oxidized carbonate minerals and reduced metals don't coexist for long. Typically, diamond inclusions show just one or the other, so the presence of both perplexed Yaakov Weiss, a senior lecturer in Earth sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and his colleagues—so much so that they initially put the samples aside for a year in confusion, he says.

But when they reanalyzed the diamonds, the researchers realized that the inclusions capture a snapshot of the reaction that made the sparkling stones and confirm for the first time that diamonds can form when carbonate minerals and reduced metals in the mantle react. The new samples are the first time scientists have ever seen the midpoint of that reaction captured in a natural diamond.

“It's basically two sides of the [oxidation] spectrum,” says Weiss, the senior author of the new study describing the find, which was published on Monday in Nature Geoscience.

The find has implications for what lies in the mantle's mysterious middle. As you travel deeper into the earth, away from the surface, the rocks and minerals become increasingly reduced, with fewer and fewer oxygen molecules available, but there is little direct evidence of this shift from the mantle.

Theoretical calculations have given researchers a notion of how the planet shifts from oxidized to reduced with depth. “We knew about that reduction with some empirical data, with real samples down to maybe 200 kilometers,” says Maya Kopylova, a professor of Earth, ocean and atmospheric science at the University of British Columbia, who was not involved in the new study but who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper. “What happened below 200 km [was] just our idea, our models, because it's so difficult to get the materials.” There are only a few samples from below this depth, she said.

These new samples, which come from between 280 and 470 km below Earth's surface, provide the first real-world fact-check on this theoretical mantle chemistry. One finding, Weiss says, is that oxidized melted material exists deeper than expected. Kimberlites, the erupted rocks that bring diamonds to the surface, are oxidized, so researchers had thought they couldn't originate much below 300 km of depth. But these findings suggest that oxidized rocks occur deeper than that—and thus so might kimberlite rocks.

Diamond-forming reactions likely happen when carbonate fluids are dragged down by subducting tectonic plates, which bring oxygen-heavy minerals in contact with the metal alloys of the mantle, Weiss says. (Another way chemists think diamonds may form is by precipitating out of carbon-rich fluids that cool as they rise upward in the mantle, like sugar crystalizing from syrup. The new paper doesn't rule out that process happening as well.)

The nickel-rich inclusions might also help explain an odd occurrence in some diamonds: occasional atoms of nickel seem to replace the carbon of these diamonds' crystal lattice. That's been a mystery, Kopylova says, because nickel is so much heavier than carbon that it shouldn't be able to easily swap into the crystal structure. “Now, looking at these data, I see that it might be just a sign of diamond formation at certain depths,” she says. “That would be very interesting to investigate further.”

San Francisco Rattled by Predawn Earthquake

The San Francisco Bay Area was rattled early this morning by a magnitude 4.3 earthquake along the Hayward fault line

Sleeping residents of California's San Francisco Bay Area were rattled awake by a magnitude 4.3 earthquake in the early morning hours of September 22.

The earthquake struck 1.25 miles east-southeast of Berkeley, Calif., with shaking felt as far away as Salinas, Calif., about 100 miles to the south, and Chico, Calif., about 150 miles to the north. The temblor does not pose any tsunami threat, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center.

The epicenter of the earthquake was about 4.7 miles deep, according to a preliminary report from the U.S. Geological Survey. The agency's analysis is continuing, but experts have tentatively linked the event with 10 other smaller quakes, mostly too weak for people to notice, that have rattled the region within the past month.

The earthquake occurred near the Hayward fault line, which runs from the north side of San Francisco Bay to southeast of San Jose. The largest known earthquake on record in the area of this fault was a magnitude 6.8 event in 1868.

The earthquake scale is logarithmic, not linear, so the historical quake released more than 5,600 times more energy than this morning's event. By comparison, San Francisco's deadly 1906 earthquake, which occurred along the San Andreas fault, was at least a magnitude 7.7 event.

Because of its history, the Hayward fault has been carefully watched by scientists, who worry that the now densely populated region could see much more serious damage the next time a very strong earthquake strikes.

So far, nearly 26,000 people have reported feeling Monday's quake through USGS's “Did You Feel It?” reporting tool, which gathers on-the-ground data about the intensity and effects of earthquakes. If you are in the Bay Area—whether you felt the temblor or not—you can fill out the agency's form to contribute to observations.

Vaccine Policy Shift, Brain Changes in Athletes and Ants That Harness Another Species' DNA

A revamped CDC advisory committee faces vaccine debates, studies reveal brain changes in athletes, and climate change drives deadly heat waves across Europe.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some of the latest science news.

First, let's check in on vaccines. On Thursday and Friday of last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, met to review and vote on recommendations for official U.S. vaccine guidelines. Back in June Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, dismissed all sitting members of the committee. Several of the 12 new panel members, all handpicked by Kennedy, have publicly expressed doubts about the safety of vaccines or the severity of the COVID pandemic.

An agenda released ahead of last week's meeting stated that the ACIP would propose recommendations for the hepatitis B, COVID and measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines.

Here's Lauren Young, associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American, with a quick update as of Friday.

Lauren Young: So far we've seen a few votes come through. The first one that they focused on was the MMRV vaccine. This is the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine. Varicella is commonly known as chickenpox, and they decided not to recommend the single combined shot for kids younger than age four.

Another vaccine that was discussed was the hepatitis B vaccine. There wasn't really any changes to this, but members did vote in support that all pregnant people should be tested for hepatitis B infection, which is the current standard practice of care.

ACIP also considered an additional recommendation to remove the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, with the first dose not given earlier than one month of age, [for infants born of people who test negative for the virus]. But they decided to table that vote because there was some confusion around some of the phrasing around that recommendation. That's been a really big theme around these meetings this past week. There's just been a lot of confusion.

So that's just come to show how much these meetings have changed since RFK, Jr., has overhauled the ACIP panel. We've seen the shift away from science and away from scientific evidence of reviewing, very rigorously, vaccine data. And now it's turned more into a lot of confusion and a lot of discourse around questioning the evidence in ways that just don't quite always make sense. And our staff is watching this super closely. So check out our website for the latest updates.

Feltman: Speaking of vaccines, last Tuesday, AHIP—the national trade association representing the health insurance industry—put out a statement on vaccine coverage. The organization said its member insurance plans would continue to cover all immunizations recommended by ACIP as of September 1, 2025, through the end of 2026. This includes updated flu shots and COVID vaccines.

Now for some public health news on a very different topic: head injuries in sports. You've probably heard of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. This progressive neurodegenerative disease, which can only be diagnosed with certainty via autopsy, is believed to be caused by repeat brain trauma, including the kind of repetitive head injuries one might endure while playing contact sports. It can include symptoms such as headaches, confusion, memory loss, poor judgment, depression, dementia, sensory-processing disorders and other potentially debilitating issues. CTE symptoms generally appear some years after repetitive brain trauma occurs. In a study published Wednesday in Nature researchers reported that brain degeneration may be detectable in young athletes before CTE starts to set in.

Researchers studied frozen brain tissue from 28 adult men. Some of the study subjects hadn't played contact sports at all, and others had played American football or soccer but hadn't been diagnosed with CTE. The rest of the study subjects played contact sports and had been diagnosed with early stages of CTE.

The researchers found signs of inflammation and vascular injury, including a marked drop in the number of neurons, in all the contact athletes they studied—even those who did not have the telltale signs of full-blown CTE. According to the study authors, this suggests that all athletes who frequently hit their heads could be at risk of experiencing some amount of brain damage.

A separate study also published last Wednesday, this one in the journal Neurology, found an association between headers, or a player using their head to control or pass a soccer ball, and changes in the brain. The study asked 352 amateur adult soccer players to estimate their number of head impacts over the course of a year. The use of headers varied pretty widely. When divided into four groups the top head-users cited an average of 3,152 headers, while those at the other end of the spectrum estimated just 105 a year.

Researchers then took scans of the players, noting changes in the white matter of their brain folds. The scientists were particularly interested in how microstructures in the white matter influenced the movement of water molecules in the folds, which is an important part of brain function. The team found signs that the organization of these structures degraded as the number of annual headers rose. The study isn't causational, and it relies on players' memories to estimate their actual rates of head banging. But studies like this one are important to our growing understanding of the dangers of full-contact athletics.

In some combination health and climate news a study released last week found that climate change likely tripled the number of heat-related deaths in European cities this summer. That's not a huge surprise, given that the Northern Hemisphere's 2023, 2024 and 2025 summers were the three hottest on record. The new study estimated excess heat-related deaths by combining climate models with temperature and epidemiological data. In the 854 urban areas the researchers analyzed there were around 24,000 heat deaths. The team estimated that 68 percent of those would not have occurred without climate change. The authors noted that the regions they looked at were only home to about 30 percent of Europe's population, so the actual number of excess heat deaths is likely higher.

I know we've covered some real bummers today, so let's end on a couple of fun stories. In a study published in Science Advanceslast Wednesday researchers offered what they called the first real estimate of how much booze chimpanzees consume in a day. Based on an analysis of fruit collected from two chimp study sites in Africa, the researchers say, the average adult is consuming about 14 grams of pure ethanol a day. When you adjust for their body size that's like an adult human having about two drinks, at least based on the American standard serving. And that's just a conservative estimate based on the fact that the animals consume some 5 to 10 percent of their body weight in ripe fruit every day. If they're preferentially seeking out fruit that's higher in ethanol, they could easily be imbibing more. But the average chimp doesn't show any sign of intoxication, probably because they consume their alcohol gradually over the course of the day—not to mention with plenty of fiber to slow them down.

Another study published earlier this month in Nature found something a little more majestic than boozy apes: a type of ant whose queen can produce eggs from two different species.

The Iberian harvester ant, or Messor ibericus, has a remarkable method for maintaining its workforce: in addition to laying eggs of her own species the queen can also produce offspring from a genetically distinct group: the species Messor structor. The authors suspect this started with a slightly less bonkers reproductive strategy known as sperm parasitism, where a queen mates with males from different ant species to produce hybridized, sterile worker ants. But in this case the queens somehow managed to also develop the ability to produce male offspring with the full Messor structor genome instead of a hybridized one. That gives them a self-sustaining source of the outsider DNA, allowing them to make as many hybrid workers as they want without actually interacting with the other species. In a sense you could say they've domesticated the other species's genome. Girlboss!

That's all for this week's news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday to talk to Mary Roach about growing human body parts from scratch.

The stone carving could be thousands of years old, possibly from the Bronze Age.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The land known today as Kazakhstan was formed and founded by the crucible of history. 

Home to a variety of cultures in the Bronze Age, including the Srubna, Afanasevo, and Andronovo, this country of the Eurasian Steppes hosted the Dark Age Huns, medieval Turks, and a variety of Khans. And that's all before becoming subjects of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union until eventually gaining independence after the latter's dissolution in the 1990s. Because Kazakhstan sits at such a crossroad of history, it's also one of the most archaeologically rich places on Earth—and a new discovery by unsuspecting fire crews once again proves this fact.

While patrolling the Sandyktau region, an area located some 200 miles northwest of Kazakhstan's capital, Astana, Nursultan Ashkenov and Akhmet Zaripov, both employees of the district fire service, stumbled upon an austere face carved into the side of a granite boulder. According to local news sources, the department immediately contacted the country's Ministry for Emergency Situations as well as the local museum. 

The face is around 10.5 inches long and roughly 8 inches wide, and some archeologists hypothesize that the carving was likely part of some ritual complex. 

 “The face is clearly visible,” Sergey Yarygin, a scientist at the Alkey Margulan Institute of Archaeology, said to Archaeology Magazine (click link to see images), “with large eyes, a long straight nose, and protruding lips. Kazakh archaeology not only enriches the scientific world with its remarkable discoveries but also reveals the main stages of the ancient and medieval development of Kazakhstan society.”

However, figuring out when this face was used for such ritualistic purposes is a bit more complicated.  According to Yarygin, similar carvings have been found at Bronze Age sites across Central Asia and Western Europe, but the carving also holds a striking resemblance to other types of iconography found in Iron Age sites in southern Siberia or even medieval Turkish cultures. 

The mysteries of Kazakhstan's historical melange strike again.  

Teams investigating the carving will likely need more time to determine its age and what culture might've created the stunningly somber carving. 

This discovery is only one of several made across the county recently, as reported by the Astana Times. Archaeologists uncovered a number of artifacts from the northwestern Pavlodar region, including pottery fragments, kitchen utensils, and an arrowhead dated to around the mid-13th to 8th century BCE. Other discoveries in the central Karaganda region also point to a variety of artifacts likely belonging to the Alakul culture, a subculture of the Andronovo culture, that thrived in this region around 2000 to 1700 BCE. 

All of these discoveries uncover the fascinating fabric of history that pervades the largest country within the Eurasian Steppe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Humanity Is Evolving Into One Big Ant Colony","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a66873797/humanity-is-evolving-into-one-big-ant-colony/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Not literally, of course. But similarly to how an ant colony, two scientists say our culture—not genetics—has become the driving force of our evolution.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

For the billions of years that life has been on Earth, genetic evolution has been in the driver's seat, slowly but steadily honing species as they face various environmental pressures. And then, roughly 600,000 years ago (by some estimates), a particularly big-brained member of the Great Ape family began displaying evidence of cumulative culture, as evidenced by increasingly complex stone tools. Those early technological steps blossomed into full, complex societies that have taken over from genetics as the key driver of evolution, according to a new paper by Timothy Waring and Zachary Wood at the University of Maine. 

Published in the journal Bioscience, the two scientists analyzed the differential between how adaptable genetics and culture can be while also identifying patterns in gene-culture coevolution. This study builds on years of work analyzing the phenomenon and coming to terms with what such an evolutionary transition could mean for the future of humanity and the planet.

“Human evolution seems to be changing gears,” Waring said in a press statement. “When we learn useful skills, institutions or technologies from each other, we are inheriting adaptive cultural practices. On reviewing the evidence, we find that culture solves problems much more rapidly than genetic evolution. This suggests our species is in the middle of a great evolutionary transition.”

At first glance, the idea is a relatively simple one. Environmental challenges that would've doomed individuals in the past can be remedied by technological advances enabled by cultural evolution. The authors use the example of eyeglasses or corrective surgery for vision problems, as well as medical breakthroughs such as caesarian sections and fertility treatments. These examples (among many, many others), the authors argue, increase our reliance on cultural systems like hospitals, schools, and governments and decrease our reliance on genetic adaptation. 

This transforms humans from an individual organism into a collective one—not unlike how individual ants form a colony to achieve something beyond the individual. 

“In the very long term, we suggest that humans are evolving from individual genetic organisms to cultural groups which function as superorganisms,” Waring said in a press statement back in 2021. “Take the coronavirus pandemic, for example. An effective national epidemic response program is truly a national immune system, and we can therefore learn directly from how immune systems work to improve our COVID response.”

While it's not hard to see the benefits of gene-culture coevolution, this reliance on societal culture to address problems can also have stark downsides if those societies are reliant on self-destructive practices. In January of 2024, Waring and Wood published another paper detailing how human culture was built on extracting resources, and reversing that trend will be tough. 

“This means global challenges like climate change are much harder to solve than previously considered,"" Waring said in a 2024 press statement. “The bigger problem is that central features in human evolution are likely working against our ability to solve them. To solve global collective challenges we have to swim upstream.""

The hope is that understanding these co-evolutionary mechanisms could help create positive change that fosters global action beyond regulatory frameworks like the Paris Climate Agreement. 

“If cultural inheritance continues to dominate, our fates as individuals, and the future of our species, may increasingly hinge on the strength and adaptability of our societies,” Waring said in a press statement about the latest paper. “And if so, the next stage of human evolution may not be written in DNA, but in the shared stories, systems, and institutions we create together.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Ordinary ice found to have shocking electrical powers","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090846.htm","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 01:46:41 GMT","

A study co-led by ICN2 reveals that ice is a flexoelectric material, meaning it can produce electricity when unevenly deformed. Published in Nature Physics, this discovery could have major technological implications while also shedding light on natural phenomena such as lightning.

Frozen water is one of the most abundant substances on Earth. It is found in glaciers, on mountain peaks and in polar ice caps. Although it is a well-known material, studying its properties continues to yield fascinating results.

An international study involving ICN2, at the UAB campus, Xi'an Jiaotong University (Xi'an) and Stony Brook University (New York), has shown for the first time that ordinary ice is a flexoelectric material. In other words, it can generate electricity when subjected to mechanical deformation. This discovery could have significant implications for the development of future technological devices and help to explain natural phenomena such as the formation of lightning in thunderstorms.

The study, published in the journal Nature Physics, represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the electromechanical properties of ice. ""We discovered that ice generates electric charge in response to mechanical stress at all temperatures. In addition, we identified a thin 'ferroelectric' layer at the surface at temperatures below -113ºC (160K). This means that the ice surface can develop a natural electric polarization, which can be reversed when an external electric field is applied -- similar to how the poles of a magnet can be flipped. The surface ferroelectricity is a cool discovery in its own right, as it means that ice may have not just one way to generate electricity but two: ferroelectricity at very low temperatures, and flexoelectricity at higher temperatures all the way to 0 °C "" explains Dr Xin Wen, a member of the ICN2 Oxide Nanophysics Group and one of the study's lead researchers. This property places ice on a par with electroceramic materials such as titanium dioxide, which are currently used in advanced technologies like sensors and capacitors.

Ice, flexoelectricity and thunderstorms

One of the most surprising aspects of this discovery is its connection to nature. The results of the study suggest that the flexoelectricity of ice could play a role in the electrification of clouds during thunderstorms, and therefore in the origin of lightning.

It is known that lightning forms when an electric potential builds up in clouds due to collisions between ice particles, which become electrically charged. This potential is then released as a lightning strike. However, the mechanism by which ice particles become electrically charged has remained unclear, since ice is not piezoelectric -- it cannot generate charge simply by being compressed during a collision.

However, the study shows that ice can become electrically charged when it is subjected to inhomogeneous deformations, i.e. when it bends or deforms irregularly. ""During our research, the electric potential generated by bending a slab of ice was measured. Specifically, the block was placed between two metal plates and connected to a measuring device. The results match those previously observed in ice-particle collisions in thunderstorms,"" explains ICREA Prof. Gustau Catalán, leader of the Oxide Nanophysics Group at ICN2.

Thus, the results suggest that flexoelectricity could be one possible explanation for the generation of the electric potential that leads to lightning during storms. Future perspectives

The researchers in the group are already exploring new lines of investigation aimed at exploiting these properties of ice for real-world applications. Although it is still a bit early to discuss potential solutions, this discovery could pave the way for the development of new electronic devices that use ice as an active material, which could be fabricated directly in cold environments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New crystal camera lets doctors see inside the body like never before","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090850.htm","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 01:46:41 GMT","

Physicians rely on nuclear medicine scans, like SPECT scans, to watch the heart pump, track blood flow and detect diseases hidden deep inside the body. But today's scanners depend on expensive detectors that are difficult to make.

Now, scientists led by Northwestern University and Soochow University in China have built the first perovskite-based detector that can capture individual gamma rays for SPECT imaging with record-breaking precision. The new tool could make common types of nuclear medicine imaging sharper, faster, cheaper and safer.

For patients, that could mean shorter scan times, clearer results and lower doses of radiation.

The study was published on Aug. 30 in the journal Nature Communications.

""Perovskites are a family of crystals best known for transforming the field of solar energy,"" said Northwestern's Mercouri Kanatzidis, the study's senior author. ""Now, they are poised to do the same for nuclear medicine. This is the first clear proof that perovskite detectors can produce the kind of sharp, reliable images that doctors need to provide the best care for their patients.""

""Our approach not only improves the performance of detectors but also could lower costs,"" said co-corresponding author Yihui He, a professor at Soochow University. ""That means more hospitals and clinics eventually could have access to the best imaging technologies.""

Kanatzidis is a Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. Yihui He is a former postdoctoral fellow from Kanatzidis' laboratory.

Nuclear medicine, like SPECT (single-photon emission computing tomography) imaging, works like an invisible camera. Physicians implant a tiny, safe, short-lived radiotracer in a specific part of a patient's body. The tracer emits gamma rays, which pass outward through tissues and eventually hit a detector outside of the body. Each gamma ray is like a pixel of light. After collecting millions of these pixels, computers can construct a 3D image of working organs.

Today's detectors, which are either made from cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) or sodium iodide (NaI), have several disadvantages. CZT detectors are incredibly expensive, sometimes reaching into the price range of hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for a whole camera. Because CZT crystals are brittle and prone to cracking, these detectors also are difficult to manufacture. While cheaper than CZT detectors, NaI detectors are bulky and produce blurrier images -- like taking a photo through a foggy window.

To overcome these issues, the scientists turned to perovskite crystals, a material that Kanatzidis has studied for more than a decade. In 2012, his group built the first solid-film solar cells made from perovskites. Then, in 2013, Kanatzidis discovered that single perovskite crystals were highly promising for detecting X-rays and gamma rays. This breakthrough, enabled by his group's growth of high-quality single crystals, sparked a worldwide surge of research and effectively launched a new field in hard radiation detection materials.

""This work demonstrates how far we can push perovskite detectors beyond the laboratory,"" Kanatzidis said. ""When we first discovered in 2013 that perovskite single crystals could detect X-rays and gamma rays, we could only imagine their potential. Now, we're showing that perovskite-based detectors can deliver the resolution and sensitivity needed for demanding applications like nuclear medicine imaging. It's exciting to see this technology moving closer to real-world impact.""

Building on this foundation, Kanatzidis and He led the crystal growth, surface engineering and device design for the new study. By carefully growing and shaping these crystals, the researchers created a pixelated sensor -- just like the pixels in a smartphone camera -- that delivers record-breaking clarity and stability.

Leading the design and development of the prototype gamma-ray detector, He developed the camera's pixelated architecture, optimized the multi-channel readout electronics and carried out the high-resolution imaging experiments that validated the device's capabilities. He, Kanatzidis and their team demonstrated that perovskite-based detectors can achieve record energy resolutions and unprecedented single-photon imaging performance, paving the way for practical integration into next-generation nuclear medicine imaging systems.

""Designing this gamma-ray camera and demonstrating its performance has been incredibly rewarding,"" He said. ""By combining high-quality perovskite crystals with a carefully optimized pixelated detector and multi-channel readout system, we were able to achieve record-breaking energy resolution and imaging capabilities. This work shows the real potential of perovskite-based detectors to transform nuclear medicine imaging.""

In experiments, the detector was able to differentiate among gamma rays of different energies with the best resolution reported thus far. It also sensed extremely faint signals from a medical radiotracer (technetium-99m) commonly used in clinical practice and distinguished incredibly fine features, producing crisp images that could separate tiny radioactive sources spaced just a few millimeters apart. The detector also remained highly stable, collecting nearly all the tracer's signal without loss or distortion. Because these new detectors are more sensitive, patients potentially could require shorter scan times or smaller doses of radiation.

Northwestern spinout company Actinia Inc. is commercializing this technology -- working with partners in the medical device field to bring it out of the lab and into hospitals. Because they are easier to grow and use simpler components, perovskites offer a far less expensive alternative to CZT and NaI detectors without sacrificing quality. Perovskite-based detectors also offer a realistic pathway to imaging using a lower dose of a radiotracer than can be used with a NaI detector but at a price that ensures widespread patient access.

""Demonstrating that perovskites can deliver single-photon gamma-ray imaging is a milestone,"" He said. ""It shows these materials are ready to move beyond the laboratory and into technologies that directly benefit human health. From here, we see opportunities to refine the detectors further, scale up production and explore entirely new directions in medical imaging.""

""High-quality nuclear medicine shouldn't be limited to hospitals that can afford the most expensive equipment,"" Kanatzidis said. ""With perovskites, we can open the door to clearer, faster, safer scans for many more patients around the world. The ultimate goal is better scans, better diagnoses and better care for patients.""

The study, ""Single photon γ-ray imaging with high energy and spatial resolution perovskite semiconductor for nuclear medicine,"" was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (award number HDTRA12020002), the Consortium for Interaction of Ionizing Radiation with Matter University Research Alliance, the National Key R&D Program of China (award number 2021YFF0502600), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (award number U2267211) and the Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (award number BK20240822).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tiny new lenses, smaller than a hair, could transform phone and drone cameras","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090853.htm","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 06:04:22 GMT","

A new approach to manufacturing multicolor lenses could inspire a new generation of tiny, cheap, and powerful optics for portable devices such as phones and drones.

The design uses layers of metamaterials to simultaneously focus a range of wavelengths from an unpolarized source and over a large diameter, overcoming a major limitation of metalenses, said the first author of the paper reporting the design, Mr Joshua Jordaan, from the Research School of Physics at the Australian National University and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Transformative Meta-Optical Systems (TMOS).

""Our design has a lot of nice features that make it applicable to practical devices.""

""It's easy to manufacture because it has a low aspect ratio and each layer can be fabricated individually and then packaged together, it's also polarisation insensitive, and is potentially scalable through mature semiconductor nanofabrication platforms,"" Mr Jordaan said.

The project was led by researchers from the Friedrich Schiller University Jena in Germany as part of the International Research Training Group Meta-ACTIVE. The paper reporting their design is published in Optics Express.

Metalenses have thickness mere fractions of the width of a hair, which is orders of magnitude thinner than conventional lenses. They can be designed to have properties such as focal lengths that would be impossibly short for conventional optics.

Initially the team attempted to focus multiple wavelengths with a single layer, but they hit up against some fundamental constraints, Mr Jordaan said.

""It turns out the maximum group-delay attainable in a single-layer metasurface has physical limitations, and these in turn set upper bounds on the product of the numerical aperture, physical diameter and operating bandwidth.""

""To work at the wavelength range we needed, a single layer would either have to have a very small diameter, which would defeat the purpose of the design, or basically have such a low numerical aperture that it's hardly focusing the light at all,"" he said.

""We realized we needed a more complex structure, which then led to a multi-layer approach.""

With the design shifted to incorporating several metalens layers, the team approached the problem with an inverse design algorithm based on shape optimization, with parameterization that meant a lot of degrees of freedom.

They guided the software to search for metasurface shapes that, for a single wavelength, created simple resonances in both the electric and magnetic dipole, known as Huygens resonances. By employing resonances, the team were able to improve on previous designs by other groups, and develop metalens designs that were polarization independent, and had greater tolerances in manufacturing specifications - crucial in the quest to scale fabrication to industrial quantities.

The optimization routine came up with a library of metamaterial elements in a surprising range of shapes, such as rounded squares, four-leaf clovers and propellers.

These tiny shapes, around 300 nm tall and 1000 nm wide, spanned the full range of phase shifts, from zero to two pi, enabling the team to create a phase gradient map to achieve any arbitrary focusing pattern - although they were initially just aiming for a simple ring structure of a conventional lens.

""We could, for example, focus different wavelengths into different locations to create a colour router,"" Mr Jordaan said.

However, the multilayer approach is limited to a maximum of around five different wavelengths, Mr Jordaan said.

""The problem is you need structures large enough to be resonant at the longest wavelength, without getting diffraction from the shorter wavelengths,"" he said.

Within these constraints, Mr Jordaan said the ability to make metalenses to collect a lot of light will be a boon for future portable imaging systems.

""The metalenses we have designed would be ideal for drones or earth-observation satellites, as we've tried to make them as small and light as possible,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists finally capture water's hidden state that's both solid and liquid","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922074936.htm","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 12:46:15 GMT","

Despite being one of the most familiar substances on Earth, water holds many secrets that scientists are still working to understand. When confined to extremely small spaces -- such as within certain proteins, minerals, or artificial nanomaterials -- water behaves in ways that are drastically different from its bulk liquid form. These confinement effects are critical for many natural and technological processes, including regulating the flow of ions through cell membranes and the properties of nanofluidic systems.

One intriguing yet poorly understood state of confined water is called the 'premelting state.' In this unique phase, water behaves as if it were on the cusp of freezing and melting at the same time, thus defying simple liquid or solid classifications. However, it has proven difficult to study the premelting state and other confined water dynamics in detail. While techniques such as diffraction methods (example: X-ray analysis) are useful for pinpointing the positions of atoms other than hydrogen, they are not sensitive enough to capture the picosecond-scale rotational motion of hydrogen and the motion of individual water molecules.

In a recent study, a research team led by Professor Makoto Tadokoro alongside Lecturer Fumiya Kobayashi and first-year PhD student Mr. Tomoya Namiki, from the Department of Chemistry, Tokyo University of Science, Japan, shed new light on the mysteries of confined water. Their paper, published online in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on August 27, 2025, reports how they used static solid-state deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to observe the hierarchical dynamics of water confined within the hydrophilic nanopores of a molecular crystal and characterized the premelting state, which is a new phase observed in water.

To perform their experiments, the team produced hexagonal rod-like crystals, with quasi-one-dimensional channels containing a nanopore approximately 1.6 nm in diameter and filled them with heavy water (D2O). By measuring the NMR spectra of a single crystal of {[Co(D2bim)3](TMA).20D2O}n at room temperature, the researchers were able to confirm the existence of a hierarchical, three-layered structure in the contained water molecules. The unique peaks observed in the spectra corresponded to every layered structures with distinct movements and hydrogen-bonding interactions with one another of the confined water, providing clear evidence of multi-layered organization. Furthermore, water confined in the nanopores freezes in a different structure from bulk ice and first melts through a distorted hydrogen-bonded structure, leading to the formation of a premelting state.

To gain insights into the premelting state, the researchers heated the crystal gradually from low temperature to get the water from a frozen state to a liquid state. They observed distinct changes in the NMR spectra that confirmed a phase transition into the premelting state, and their measurements revealed the presence of two seemingly contradictory states. ""The premelting state involves the melting of incompletely hydrogen-bonded H2O before the completely frozen ice structure starts melting during the heating process. It essentially constitutes a novel phase of water in which frozen H2O layers and slowly moving H2O coexist,"" explains Prof. Tadokoro.

The researchers measured the spin-lattice relaxation time to quantify the rotational mobility of the heavy water molecules in this new phase. While the activation energy for the premelting state was far from that of bulk ice, the correlation time was remarkably close to that of bulk liquid water. Simply put, this means that while the water molecules' positions were relatively fixed as one would expect of a solid, their rotational motions were extremely fast and liquid-like.

Taken together, these findings build toward a more comprehensive understanding of how water behaves in extreme confinement. They clarify crucial structural and dynamic aspects, which are important for understanding how water and ions permeate through biological proteins and membranes. Looking ahead, these insights could also lead to practical innovations. ""By creating new ice network structures, it may be possible to store energetic gases such as hydrogen and methane and develop water-based materials such as artificial gas hydrates,"" says Prof. Tadokoro. Controlling the freezing properties of water based on the structure of ice could lead to the creation of new, inexpensive, and safe hydrosphere materials.

Overall, this study ultimately demonstrates that even a substance as common as water still holds fundamental secrets waiting to be unlocked.

Acute leukemia requires precise molecular classification and urgent treatment. However, standard-of-care diagnostic tests are time-intensive and do not capture the full spectrum of acute leukemia heterogeneity. Here, we developed a framework to classify acute leukemia using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. We first assembled a comprehensive reference cohort (n = 2,540 samples) and defined 38 methylation classes. Methylation-based classification matched standard-pathology lineage classification in most cases and revealed heterogeneity in addition to that captured by genetic categories. Using this reference, we developed a neural network (MARLIN; methylation- and AI-guided rapid leukemia subtype inference) for acute leukemia classification from sparse DNA methylation profiles. In retrospective cohorts profiled by nanopore sequencing, high-confidence predictions were concordant with conventional diagnoses in 25 out of 26 cases. Real-time MARLIN classification in patients with suspected acute leukemia provided accurate predictions in five out of five cases, which were typically generated within 2 h of sample receipt. In summary, we present a framework for rapid acute leukemia classification that complements and enhances standard-of-care diagnostics.

Acute leukemia is an aggressive form of blood cancer affecting both pediatric and adult patients that is hierarchically classified according to the major lineages of hematopoiesis, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL), T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) and rare cases of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL)1,2,3,4. Acute leukemia lineages can be further categorized according to molecular subtypes defined by cytogenetic alterations, gene mutations and transcriptional and epigenomic features, which can inform prognosis and guide treatment selection5,6,7,8.

Given the clinical urgency of acute leukemia, a precise diagnosis must be generated in a timely manner9. In current diagnostic workflows, multiple tests are performed in parallel, including bone marrow morphology, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and targeted gene sequencing. These tests often require days to weeks to complete, even in tertiary care centers, and can substantially delay treatment planning. Moreover, standard-of-care testing alone may not capture the full spectrum of acute leukemia disease heterogeneity, potentially limiting a patient's access to best-suited therapies.

Research in the field of neuro-oncology has pioneered the concept of DNA methylation-based tumor classification. Of note, array-based methylation profiling has revealed novel tumor categories that are now recognized by the World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors10,11,12,13. Coupled to machine learning algorithms, methylation profiling permits reproducible tumor-class prediction and improves diagnostic accuracy in the clinic14,15. Recently developed nanopore-based sequencing technologies have accelerated classification by enabling direct measurement of methylation states without the need for additional sample processing, such as bisulfite conversion and PCR amplification16. These technologies raise the exciting possibility for rapid methylation-based classification in real-time for cancer diagnostics17,18,19.

However, there are considerable challenges to the development and implementation of methylation-based classification approaches for acute leukemia. First, epigenomic classification of acute leukemia requires the curation of a comprehensive methylation-based reference cohort encompassing the diversity of disease subtypes encountered in clinical practice. Although prior DNA methylation-based studies have provided elegant analyses within individual acute leukemia lineages, a comprehensive reference across lineages and age groups remains to be generated20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29. Second, real-time analysis of nanopore data requires computational methods that use informative features despite extremely sparse coverage during the first minutes to hours of a sequencing run. Finally, these approaches must be integrated within existing diagnostic workflows in the clinic and prioritize simplicity, reproducibility and ease of interpretation.

Here, we present a comprehensive strategy for rapid epigenomic classification of acute leukemia in the clinic using nanopore sequencing and machine learning. We assemble and characterize an extensive DNA methylation-based reference cohort encompassing the full spectrum of acute leukemia lineages and subtypes. We then train a DNA methylation-based acute leukemia classifier for rapid evaluation of clinical samples with nanopore, including real-time classification.

We curated a comprehensive DNA methylation-based reference cohort from published studies that encompasses the full diversity of acute leukemia lineages and molecular drivers (Fig. 1a). To this end, we assembled a dataset consisting of 2,540 high-quality samples from 11 published studies that used genome-wide 450k or EPIC DNA methylation arrays (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1)22,27,28,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. These data encompassed diagnostic samples from pediatric (n = 1,838) and adult (n = 702) patients, and included 1,461 AML, 686 B-ALL, 266 T-ALL and 18 mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) samples as well as 17 bone marrow and 92 peripheral blood controls from healthy donors.

Source data

A t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization of our methylation-based reference cohort revealed clear separation of acute leukemia samples according to lineage (Fig. 1a). The t-SNE visualization also showed discernible substructure within each lineage, indicating significant epigenetic heterogeneity within AML, B-ALL and T-ALL22,27,28. To further characterize this heterogeneity, we collected available pathology and molecular data for each sample and integrated annotations from prior studies. In total, we defined 38 distinct DNA methylation classes across AML (top right, n = 21), B-ALL (bottom, n = 11), T-ALL (middle left, n = 5) and ALAL (top left, n = 1; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2). Of these, 25 methylation classes (13 AML, seven B-ALL and five T-ALL) corresponded closely to classes defined in prior studies of individual acute leukemia lineages, and we therefore used these directly22,27,28,38. In addition, four methylation classes in B-ALL were produced by subdivision of published categories (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e), while nine methylation classes (eight AML, one ALAL) have not been previously described to our knowledge (Extended Data Fig. 1c,f). Samples without prior class annotations or with incomplete genetic data were assigned a methylation class by label propagation (Extended Data Fig. 1g–j; see Methods). Across methylation classes, we did not observe unexpected bias according to array version, tissue type or sex (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b,k). T-ALL classes generally showed a more hypermethylated epigenome, while AML classes were more hypomethylated, in agreement with previous reports (Fig. 1c)39.

We next assessed the accuracy of DNA methylation profiling for acute leukemia lineage assignment. Overall, methylation-based classification showed high concordance with immunophenotypic evaluation, assigning an identical lineage in 2,189 out of 2,249 (97.3%) cases (Fig. 1d). AML, B-ALL and T-ALL showed lineage concordance in 96.7%, 99.7% and 98.4% of cases, respectively, and we did not observe a difference in lineage concordance between adult and pediatric cases (98.0% and 97.1%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 2a). By contrast, MPAL were reclassified to a single lineage in ten out of 14 (71.4%) cases. Among lineage discordant cases, the majority (49 out of 60, 81.6%) localized to methylation classes characterized by molecular alterations with known lineage ambiguity, including BCL11B-activated ALAL (n = 17), HOXA9-activated T-ALL (associated with PICALM::MLLT10, n = 23) and ZNF384-r and KMT2A-r B-ALL (n = 4 and n = 5, respectively; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). In these cases, methylation classes mostly reflected the underlying molecular driver rather than the lineage defined by immunophenotype. Specifically, nearly all samples in our cohort with genetic alterations in BCL11B, PICALM::MLLT10 and ZNF384-r were assigned to the associated methylation class (eight out of eight BCL11B ALAL, 11 out of 11 PICALM::MLLT10 T-ALL and 23 out of 24 ZNF384-r B-ALL; Extended Data Fig. 2d–f). Together, these findings support DNA methylation profiling as a valuable approach to assign acute leukemia lineages and identify patients with rare or cryptic alterations associated with lineage ambiguity.

We next examined disease heterogeneity within specific acute leukemia lineages in more detail. As noted above, we did not identify considerable additional heterogeneity in T-ALL and B-ALL in addition to that reported previously (Extended Data Fig. 1c)22,28,38. However, our meta-analysis in AML included twice the number of samples (n = 1,289) analyzed in any prior methylation-based study (n = 649) and included substantial representation of pediatric (n = 825) and adult (n = 464) cases (Supplementary Table 3). We therefore focused on a detailed characterization of methylation classes in AML, in which we found eight new methylation classes and refined several others.

DNA methylation profiles of tumor samples reflect the epigenetic state of their cellular origin and changes acquired during tumorigenesis40,41,42,43. Therefore, we reasoned that AML methylation classes would reflect known molecular categories or disease subtypes but also resolve heterogeneity not captured in current classification schemes2,3,6,8. Consistent with this reasoning, eight out of 21 AML methylation classes were defined by specific genetic drivers, including seven classes (PML::RARA, RUNX1::RUNX1T1, CBFB::MYH11, FUS-r, ETV6::MNX1, HNRNPH1::ERG and GLIS-r) defined by specific gene fusions and one class defined by mutations in CEBPA (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). These eight methylation classes captured nearly all cases in our retrospective cohort with the corresponding genetic alterations (407 out of 426, 95.5%) and showed expected patient age distributions, survival outcomes and differentiation patterns per French–American–British (FAB) categories (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3b–d). Among the few cases with these genetic alterations that localized outside their expected methylation class (one out of 155 RUNX1::RUNX1T1, two out of 143 CBFB::MYH11, 13 out of 64 CEBPA-mut and three out of 19 GLIS-r), competing genetic drivers were present in most cases. Specifically, all (13 out of 13) cases with CEBPA mutations outside the CEBPA methylation class harbored co-occurring alterations in additional leukemia-associated genes (including NPM1 (n = 4), IDH1/2 (n = 3), TP53 (n = 1), genes associated with myelodysplasia-related changes (n = 4), NUP98 (n = 2) and FLT3 (n = 3); Extended Data Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 4). Moreover, 11 out of 13 samples (84.6%) lacked canonical bZIP in-frame insertions and deletions (indels), and no sample had bi-allelic mutations (zero out of five samples with available information). Therefore, these cases would not be categorized as prognostically favorable CEBPA-mutated AML by recent classification schemes2,3,44,45. Consistently, these cases were associated with worse outcomes compared to those within the CEBPA methylation class (log-rank test, P = 7.2 × 10−4 in adult cohorts, P = 0.019 in pediatric cohorts; Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). These data closely match similar findings in the transcriptome space46.

By contrast, most remaining AML methylation classes were not defined solely by genetics. For example, we identified three methylation classes (IDH-enriched, chromatin/spliceosome-enriched and TP53/aneuploidy-enriched) associated with older age and myelodysplasia-related changes, which localized close to normal controls and encompassed multiple distinct but biologically related alterations. (Extended Data Figs. 3b,c and 4e–h and Supplementary Table 5). As another example, we identified nine AML methylation classes defined by expression of HOXA9 and HOXB5 (groups 1–4) or expression of HOXA9 alone (groups 5–9; Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). HOXA/B-activated methylation classes were highly enriched for NPM1-mut, while HOXA-activated classes were defined by KMT2A-r, and each showed expected associations with monocytic differentiation (FAB M4/M5; Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3a)47. However, NPM1-mut and KMT2A-r were found across several distinct HOX methylation classes, suggesting that epigenetic profiling can complement and refine disease heterogeneity revealed by orthogonal genetic and transcriptional studies. Of note, activating mutations in FLT3, an indication for targeted therapy in AML, were also enriched in several HOXA/B-activated methylation classes but were not class-defining on their own (Extended Data Fig. 4b). In summary, these findings highlight how epigenetic states reflect established molecular categories in acute leukemia but can also reveal disease heterogeneity or shared biology that is not captured by conventional testing alone.

We next sought to characterize heterogeneity in HOX-activated AML methylation classes in greater detail. This analysis was of particular interest given the emergence of menin inhibitors for patients with KMT2A-r and NPM1-mutant AML, which show high expression of HOXA and HOXA/B-cluster genes, respectively, and reports describing menin sensitivity in less common acute leukemia subtypes with HOX activation (for example, NUP98-r, UBTF-ITD)48,49,50,51. Detection of these genetic alterations with standard-of-care workflows requires multiple specialized assays (targeted sequencing, karyotyping, FISH) and carries the risk of missing cryptic or rare alterations52,53. We therefore considered whether methylation-based assessment could detect HOX activation status and heterogeneity directly.

HOXA/B-activated groups 1–3 harbored frequent mutations in NPM1 (92.7%, 88.0% and 76.7% of cases, respectively) and were enriched for group-specific co-mutations in DNMT3A (group 1, n = 33 out of 37), TET2 (group 2, n = 14 out of 20) and IDH1 or IDH2 (group 3, n = 30 out of 32; Fig. 3a)27. HOXA/B-activated group 4 was more diverse, with primary genetic alterations spanning categories often associated with favorable prognosis, such as NPM1 mutations (n = 102, 34.9%), to those associated with unfavorable prognosis, such as NUP98::NSD1 (n = 45, 15.4%) or other NUP98 fusions (n = 6, 2.1%), KMT2A-r (n = 22, 7.5%), KMT2A-PTD (n = 4, 1.4%), DEK::NUP214 (n = 20, 6.8%) and UBTF-ITD (n = 18, 6.2%; Fig. 3b)6. Similar to KMT2A-r and NPM1-mut, NUP98-r, DEK::NUP214 and UBTF-ITD leukemias are all characterized by elevated HOX expression48,53,54,55,56.

Source data

Of note, 72 samples (24.7%) within HOXA/B-activated group 4 were without a known genetic driver mutation. Of those samples, 60 were wild-type for NPM1 and had a karyotype that did not show evidence of HOX-activating translocations, while 12 had missing information (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 3). However, 52 out of 54 (95.2%) samples with available gene expression data had strong expression of HOXA9 and HOXB5, comparable to group 4 cases for which HOX-activating driver mutations were detected (Extended Data Fig. 5b). These results suggest that methylation-based classification could provide a valuable proxy for HOX-activated leukemia. This information could be used to focus subsequent analysis to identify rare or cryptic drivers with validated sensitivity to menin inhibitors or, in a research setting, identify previously unrecognized mechanisms of HOX activation.

HOXA-activated groups 5, 7, 8 and 9 had KMT2A rearrangements in 100%, 90.6%, 93.5% and 95.0% of samples, respectively, while all group 6 samples (eight out of eight, 100%) harbored rearrangements of KAT6A (Fig. 3c). Interestingly, we found that methylation classes were not defined by specific KMT2A fusion partners (Fig. 3d). To better understand the similarities and differences between groups 5–9, we jointly analyzed available genetic, transcriptional and clinical data. We focused on the TARGET AML0531 and AML1031 trials, the two most homogenous AML datasets of adequate size available for analysis. Transcription data revealed class-specific expression patterns of MECOM in group 5, HMX3 in groups 6–8 and FOXC1 in group 9 (Extended Data Fig. 5d–f and Supplementary Table 6)57,58,59. Groups 5–7 represented patients of all age groups, while patients in groups 8 and 9 were almost exclusively below the age of 3 years.

Retrospective analysis of survival data showed differential outcomes between HOX groups 5–9 in the AML0531 and AML1031 cohorts (log-rank test, P = 1.4 × 10−4, C-index, 0.612; Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5g). Group 6 (KAT6A-r) and group 5 (MECOM-activated KMT2A-r) showed the poorest survival (median overall survival of 0.51 years and 2.01 years, respectively), while group 9 (FOXC1-activated KMT2A-r) displayed more favorable outcomes (median overall survival not reached). Finally, we asked whether stratification by methylation class could explain outcome heterogeneity for specific KMT2A fusion partners. We specifically investigated KMT2A::MLLT3, the most common KMT2A rearrangement in AML, which shows intermediate survival among pediatric patients (Extended Data Fig. 5h)60. When further stratified by methylation class, our analysis suggests that patients in group 5 (MECOM-activated KMT2A-r) are associated with worse survival than patients in HOXA-activated groups 7 and 8 (P = 0.03 and P = 0.1, respectively; Fig. 3f).

In summary, our results indicate that epigenetic classification, in concert with standard-of-care genetic approaches, could help identify patients with HOX-activated acute leukemia, including those driven by rare or unknown genetic alterations. In some cases, HOX-associated methylation classes may provide an additional layer of information that refines risk stratification based solely on genetics. However, implications for clinical outcomes and treatment, including how to best integrate methylation-based classification with standard-of-care approaches, must be studied in larger cohorts and is an important direction for future research.

Based on our reference cohort, we next aimed to create a machine learning model to predict methylation classes for query cases profiled using different epigenomic profiling technologies, including low-coverage whole-genome nanopore sequencing. The feasibility of methylation class prediction from sparse sequencing data has recently been demonstrated for central nervous system tumors17,18,19,61,62. These studies motivated our approach to develop MARLIN, a neural network-based classifier for acute leukemia (Fig. 4a). Network architecture includes all 357,340 high-quality methylation array probes as an input layer, two fully connected hidden layers and an output layer providing confidence scores for each of the 38 acute leukemia methylation classes and four control classes (Fig. 4b). To enable accurate predictions from shallow sequencing, several adaptations were made during model development, including random removal of 99% of input cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites during each training epoch (see Methods).

a, Schematic of MARLIN training and performance estimation. Cutout shows the reference cohort from Fig. 1a. Reference methylation array beta values are binarized, 50 samples for each class are randomly selected and 10% artificial noise is added to the data. Fivefold cross-validation is performed to estimate model performance at different levels of sparsity in the test sets. b, Schematic depicting MARLIN neural network architecture. The network is composed of an input layer equal to the number of probes in the reference (357,340), two hidden layers with 256 and 128 nodes and a final layer for the multiclass classification represented by 42 nodes. A 99% dropout is applied to the input layer only during training at each epoch (left). MARLIN generates scores corresponding to methylation class probabilities. Scores sum up to 1 across classes (right). Methylation class colors are the same as in Fig. 1a.

To evaluate our model, we performed fivefold cross-validation analysis of the training dataset (Fig. 5a). Using all CpGs, MARLIN showed high precision in distinguishing acute leukemia lineages (2,324 out of 2,356 cases, median F1 score of 0.99 across lineages) and methylation classes (2,175 out of 2,356 cases, median F1 score of 0.91, range of 0.63–1.00; Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Of 181 misclassified cases, 31 (17.1%) had high prediction scores for control classes, suggesting low tumor-cell content. Misclassifications otherwise occurred between closely related methylation classes, such as HOXA-activated (n = 26, 14.3%) and HOXA/B-activated AML (n = 18, 9.9%). Therefore, we grouped closely related classes into methylation class families, reasoning that this would allow us to increase the predictive confidence for biologically similar classes (Supplementary Table 2 and Methods). Introduction of methylation class families resulted in a median F1 score of 0.96 in cross-validation (2,232 out of 2,356 cases, F1 score range of 0.78–1.00; Extended Data Fig. 6c).

We next evaluated MARLIN performance by simulating different levels of sparsity (ranging from 0% to 99%) using random subsets of available CpGs. In fivefold cross-validation, we found that classification performance remained high for methylation class, family and lineage (median F1 scores of 0.91, 0.95 and 0.99, respectively) at simulated sparsity levels up to 97% (corresponding to 10,720 CpGs; Extended Data Fig. 6d–f). We found that a classification threshold of 0.8 offered a viable compromise between sensitivity and specificity across different levels of sparsity (Extended Data Fig. 6g).

We further validated the ability of MARLIN to use data from different DNA methylation profiling technologies with varying levels of sparsity. We first analyzed data from 75 AML samples profiled with 27k and 450k methylation arrays, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and nanopore sequencing (n = 58, n = 4, n = 11 and n = 2, respectively; Supplementary Table 7)29,30,63,64. For 450k, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and nanopore sequencing, 12 out of 13 (92.3%) samples reached high scores for the associated methylation class (Fig. 5b). Predictions for the 27k array were concordant in 52 out of 58 (89.7%) samples but showed lower overall prediction scores, possibly because of a limited number of informative probes or other data quality-related effects. Additional validation was performed in 321 B-ALL, T-ALL and healthy control samples profiled with 450k methylation arrays26,35,65,66. Using MARLIN, 156 out of 182 (85.7%) B-ALL, 36 out of 39 (92.3%) T-ALL and 100 out of 100 (100%) controls received the highest prediction scores that were consistent with reported annotations (Fig. 5c–e and Supplementary Tables 8–10). Overall, these results show that MARLIN effectively identifies different acute leukemia lineages, methylation families and classes. Moreover, the performance of our neural network on sparse methylation data demonstrates that MARLIN successfully learned to rely on a limited number of informative probes without compromising classification performance.

Having established that MARLIN accurately predicts acute leukemia classes from external DNA methylation datasets, we next performed nanopore sequencing on a retrospective cohort of 19 acute leukemia samples (n = 11 AML, n = 7 B-ALL, n = 1 T-ALL) harboring diverse genetic alterations and ranging from 21 to 82 years in age (median, 65 years; Fig. 6a, Extended Data Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 11). All samples were sequenced on individual MinION runs with flow cell reloading to maximize total read output (Extended Data Fig. 7b, Supplementary Table 12 and Methods).

Patient characteristics are indicated in the table on the left. Methylation classes with the highest score are indicated on the right. The top eight rows represent samples for which nanopore profiling resulted in a concordant methylation class that was equivalent to the clinical diagnosis. The subsequent seven rows represent samples for which MARLIN analysis resulted in a refinement of the clinical diagnosis. Analysis of the next three samples did not yield a clear methylation class prediction (score of <0.8). However, methylation classes with the highest scores were concordant with clinical diagnosis, and lineage and/or methylation class family predictions were obtained with high confidence.

Among cases that received a high-confidence prediction (≥0.8), 15 out of 16 (93.8%) were concordant with results from conventional pathology evaluation, including ten AML, five B-ALL and one T-ALL case (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 13). In two cases of fusion-defined AML (AL_010 and AL_024), additional high-coverage nanopore sequencing with the PromethION platform confirmed underlying RUNX1::RUNX1T1 and PML::RARA fusions, consistent with clinical cytogenetic testing and the predicted methylation classes (Fig. 6c,d). In one case (AL_014) harboring three non-canonical CEBPA mutations (that is, not bZIP in-frame indels) and co-mutations in NPM1 and DNMT3A, MARLIN assigned a HOXA/B-activated group 4 rather than CEBPA methylation class, in agreement with prior observations in our reference cohort (Extended Data Figs. 4a and 7c). MARLIN also resulted in refined classifications in cases of AML with mutated NPM1, which were classified as HOXA/B-activated methylation classes in a manner consistent with their observed co-mutation patterns, including HOXA/B-activated group 2 (AL_008, co-mutation in TET2) and HOXA/B-activated group 3 (AL_017 and AL_018, co-mutations in IDH2 and IDH1, respectively; Fig. 6b). In one case of B-ALL not otherwise specified (AL_002), MARLIN refined the molecular classification and led to the discovery of a cryptic genetic driver with prognostic importance. Classification showed a high score (1.00) for the B-ALL DUX4-r methylation class. We confirmed the cryptic DUX4 translocation with high-coverage nanopore sequencing (Fig. 6e).

In one case (AL_005), methylation-based classification (0.96 for AML IDH-enriched) was discordant with the clinical diagnosis of Ph+ (p190) B-ALL. This sample was from a 68-year-old male who experienced a sustained remission following tyrosine kinase inhibitor and blinatumomab therapies and subsequent bone marrow transplantation. Further investigation did not identify hotspot mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 that would explain the lineage discordance, although examination of copy-number profiles revealed losses of chromosomes 7q and 16q, which can be seen in myeloid-lineage neoplasms, and flow cytometry reported aberrant co-expression of myeloid antigens CD13 and CD33 on B-ALL cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a,d). Finally, in three out of 19 cases, MARLIN yielded a confidence score less than 0.8; however, all of these cases still showed dominant predictions at the level of methylation class (AL_011, 0.74 for AML HOXA-activated group 5; AL_001, 0.69 for B-ALL Ph/Ph-like) or methylation class family (AL_007, 0.84 for B-ALL Ph/PAX5) that were concordant with the pathology diagnosis (Fig. 6b).

To extend our validation, we analyzed 15 additional retrospective cases, including ten AML, four B-ALL and one MPAL (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c and Supplementary Table 14). These samples were profiled using multiplexed sequencing on the PromethION platform. Of cases that received a high-confidence MARLIN prediction (≥0.8), ten out of ten (100%) were concordant with results from conventional pathology evaluation, including three cases that received a more refined molecular classification (AL_028, B-ALL PAX5 group B; AL_033, AML IDH-enriched; and AL_027, AML TP53/aneuploidy-enriched). Among cases that did not receive a high-confidence prediction, three out of five had dominant classes that were in agreement with pathology results (AL_029, AL_036 and AL_039). The two remaining cases received dominant class predictions of bone marrow controls (AL_030) and mixed T cells and lineage-concordant acute leukemia classes (AL_034), possibly because of low tumor purity (blast counts 10% and 22%, respectively). None of the cases profiled in this validation set received a discordant prediction.

Finally, we also tested MARLIN on samples from healthy donors and patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a precursor state to AML that was not included in our reference cohort. Of ten samples profiled from healthy donors (four bone marrow, six whole blood), all were predicted as control methylation classes (Extended Data Fig. 8d and Supplementary Table 15). Among six MDS cases, two received high scores for the AML TP53/aneuploidy-enriched methylation class, while two were predicted as control classes and two received low scores for other myelodysplasia-related methylation classes (AML IDH-enriched, AML Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched; Extended Data Fig. 8e, Supplementary Table 16). These results suggest shared epigenetic features between MDS and MDS-associated AML and highlight the limitations of applying MARLIN to cases that have not met criteria for acute leukemia by standard-of-care methods. In summary, our findings indicate that MARLIN, coupled with nanopore sequencing of clinical samples, can correctly classify acute leukemia subtypes, achieving concordant diagnoses in 25 out of 26 (96.2%) cases that achieved high-confidence prediction scores across our two validation cohorts.

Having established our framework for retrospective samples, we evaluated whether classifications could be obtained in a rapid manner through real-time analysis of nanopore sequencing data17,18,19. As a proof of concept, we used MARLIN to simulate real-time methylation class predictions with sequencing data from our initial retrospective nanopore cohort. Comparing simulated real-time predictions to results obtained with the full dataset, we found that 14 out of 16 confidently predicted cases reached an identical classification (prediction score of ≥0.8) in less than 1 h of sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). We next implemented MARLIN locally as an automated workflow on a GridION sequencer to generate methylation class predictions in real-time (see Methods). To test our workflow, we re-sequenced sample AL_016 and obtained a concordant classification after just 50 min of sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 9c).

We next applied MARLIN for real-time, prospective analysis of research-consented samples from five patients presenting with suspected acute leukemia at our institution (Supplementary Table 11). The first case (RTC_001) was a 61-year-old female with leukocytosis (63 × 106 l−1) and 50% peripheral blasts (Fig. 7a). After 56 min of sample processing and 40 min of nanopore sequencing, we obtained a high-confidence (≥0.8) MARLIN prediction for the AML TP53/aneuploidy-enriched class (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Table 17). In parallel, conventional diagnostic assays were performed that arrived at a diagnosis of AML with mutated TP53 after 4 days, in agreement with the MARLIN classification (Fig. 7c–e and Extended Data Fig. 9d–f). Subsequently, additional high-coverage nanopore sequencing confirmed the TP53 mutation and complex karyotype identified by clinical testing (Fig. 7f).

The second case (RTC_002) was a 62-year-old male with hyperleukocytosis (238 × 109 l−1; Fig. 8a). After 55 min of sample preparation and 40 min of sequencing, MARLIN generated a high-confidence prediction for the AML HOXA/B-activated group 2 (NPM1/TET2-enriched) methylation class (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Table 18). Results of conventional diagnostic testing after 3 days showed AML with monocytic differentiation (M5), blasts with cup-shaped nuclei and NPM1, TET2 and FLT3-ITD mutations, in agreement with our MARLIN classification (Fig. 8c–f and Extended Data Fig. 9g–i). Similar observations were made for prospective cases three to five, which received confident classifications for the HOXA/B-activated group 3 AML (after 590 min), the HOXA9-activated T-ALL (after 96 min) and the AML Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched methylation classes (after 135 min), compatible with subsequent pathology results and genetic analyses (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). In conclusion, we provide proof of concept for rapid acute leukemia diagnosis in the clinic, highlighting the potential of MARLIN and nanopore sequencing to greatly accelerate diagnostic workflows for patients presenting with acute leukemia.

In this study, we established a comprehensive reference of DNA methylation classes in acute leukemia and developed a machine learning classifier for methylation-based diagnostics in the clinic. Our approach offers several key features to complement conventional methods. First, when coupling MARLIN to nanopore sequencing, results can be generated rapidly and in real-time, setting a realistic timeframe of hours or even minutes for generating preliminary molecular classifications. Providing this information to pathologists and treating clinicians could greatly accelerate treatment planning and potentially limit the development of oncologic emergencies caused by treatment delays. Second, methylation-based classification may resolve blind spots of conventional molecular diagnostic and cytogenetic testing, including classes associated with cryptic rearrangements (for example, DUX4-r) or molecular drivers of lineage-ambiguous cases (for example, MPAL with BCL11B activation)67. Third, methylation-based profiling may reveal novel predictive signatures of drug response. For example, methylation-based classification can identify HOX-activated subgroups directly regardless of genetic driver, although whether this predicts sensitivity to menin inhibition requires further study. Finally, nanopore sequencing and MARLIN are comparably easy to implement, making our approach suitable even in lower-resourced clinical settings where molecular diagnostic services and hematopathology expertise are difficult to access. Ultimately, we envision methylation-based acute leukemia classifications complementing standard-of-care diagnostic tests to provide more comprehensive and timely information to pathologists, clinicians and patients.

We acknowledge several limitations to our work. Although we built our methylation reference on large public datasets to ensure broad representation, it is possible that there are insufficient sample numbers for uncommon acute leukemia subtypes to discover associated methylation classes. Consequently, we envision that our current methylation reference and the MARLIN classifier will evolve in future iterations, reflecting improvements in knowledge and the availability of reference datasets. Although inclusive of most acute leukemia subtypes encountered in clinical practice, the current training set does not include entities that could reasonably enter into the clinical differential diagnosis with acute leukemia (such as MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms or high-grade B cell lymphomas), and it also does not include post-treatment and/or relapse samples. Thus, MARLIN-based classifications should be considered in the context of orthogonal clinical and pathology data to determine whether a sample has met conventional diagnostic criteria for acute leukemia versus other entities. Finally, although our study includes one of the largest published nanopore sequencing cohorts of acute leukemia to date, it has a modest size compared to other studies assessing novel diagnostic approaches in the field of acute leukemia68. Therefore, future studies will be required to better assess MARLIN's performance with nanopore sequencing across a broader representation of subtypes and to define limitations from possible confounders such as low tumor-cell content. These studies will also provide an opportunity to specify how epigenetic classification should be used to maximize its clinical utility.

In summary, we propose a comprehensive framework for rapid classification of acute leukemia in the clinic using epigenetics, nanopore sequencing and real-time data analysis with a machine learning classifier adapted to sparse data. We believe that our framework has potential for clinical, translational and basic research applications and paves the way for future developments in epigenetic classification of acute leukemia and machine learning-assisted diagnostics.

The acute leukemia DNA methylation reference cohort was built from publicly available datasets comprising Illumina Infinium Methylation 450k and EPIC arrays. Raw IDAT files were downloaded from the public repositories listed in the Data availability section of this manuscript. A complete list of samples used in this study is provided in Supplementary Table 1. All included samples were collected from patients at the time of diagnosis.

Annotations were retrieved from the respective publications for GSE147667 (ref. 28), GSE152710 (ref. 34), GSE159907 (ref. 27), TCGA-LAML32 and TARGET-ALL-P3 (ref. 33). For GSE49031, annotations were supplemented with updated annotations from additional publications22,38. For GSE159907, annotations were supplemented with data from the Beat AML project[31]. For TARGET AML, annotations were harmonized between annotations from four different publications30,69,70,71. Annotations were retrieved from additional publications for KMT2A-PTD32,47,71,72, UBTF-ITD53,71, HNRNPH1::ERG confirmed cases73 and BCL11B status47,67. For all publications, fusion information for common alterations was harmonized between published RNA-sequencing results and published information from conventional assays (for example, karyotyping, FISH). However, as many fusion events are cryptic, we only considered patients with negative RNA-sequencing results as confirmed negative. FLT3 activating mutations were filtered according to the list provided in a previous publication74. Established methylation class annotations for T-ALL and AML were kindly provided by the respective study authors27,28.

Raw IDAT files were read into R (v.4.4.0) using minfi's (v.1.50.0) read.metharray function75. For every sample, chipwide medians of the methylated and unmethylated channels were retrieved using minfi's getQC function, and a sample cutoff of ≥10.5 for log2 median meth/unmeth signal intensity was chosen for sample inclusion. In addition, detection P values were retrieved using minfi's detectionP function, and a per-sample cutoff was chosen at a mean detection P value of <0.01 for all measured probes. The minfi quality control report was generated and carefully inspected for every sample. All samples that did not pass one of the quality control metrics were removed. Sample normalization was performed using the ‘ssNoob' method. Probes that were not shared between both versions of the array, RS, CH, non-uniquely mapping and single-nucleotide polymorphism probes were removed. In addition, all probes that had a detection P value of greater than 1 × 10−16 in any of the high-quality samples were removed. Preprocessing was performed separately for each dataset, and the Mset objects were combined using the combineArrays function before being converted to beta values using the getBeta function. The final beta matrix contained 2,540 samples and 207,057 probes. To extend the number of probes available for MARLIN, only probes that were not on all of the most recent versions of the array (450k, EPIC, EPICv2), RS, CH, non-uniquely mapping and single-nucleotide polymorphism probes were removed, resulting in 357,340 final probes.

For t-SNE dimensionality reduction, we used the 5,000 most variable probes within samples diagnosed as B-ALL, T-ALL and AML to construct a weighted correlation matrix (weights package in R (v.1.0.4)). The corresponding distance matrix was used as input for t-SNE performed using the Rtsne package (v.1.0.4). The ggplot2 R package (v.3.5.1) was used for plotting. Genome-wide copy-number profiles were generated using the conumee2 package (v.2.0.2)76.

Most methylation classes were adopted directly or with minor adjustments from three previous studies that focused on AML (13 classes)27, T-ALL (five classes)28 and B-ALL (seven classes)38, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1c). B-ALL sample labels were based on International Consensus Classification categories38. To better reflect observations in the methylation space or account for inadequate sample sizes in certain groups, four B-ALL methylation classes were derived by splitting or merging established categories22,24. ETV6::RUNX1 and ETV6::RUNX1-like were merged to form one methylation class, ‘ETV6::RUNX1'. TCF3::PBX1 and MEF2D-r were combined. In addition, BCR::ABL1, BCR::ABL1-like and CRLF2-r (excluding PAX5alt with CRLF2-r) samples were clustered based on their 1,000 most variable probes and split into two classes (Ph/Ph-like and CRLF2-r/Ph-like; Extended Data Fig. 1d). Similarly, PAX5alt and PAX5 P80R samples were split into PAX5 group A and PAX5 group B (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Furthermore, we observed several patient groups without a corresponding methylation class. This was particularly pronounced among patients with pediatric AML alterations. New methylation classes were defined for the genetic alterations ETV6::MNX1 (ETV6::MNX1), FUS::ERG/FUS::FEV (FUS-r), HNRNPH1::ERG (HNRNPH1::ERG), CBFA2T3::GLIS2 (GLIS-r) and KAT6A::CREBBP/KAT6A::EP300 (HOXA-activated group 6, KAT6A-r). We also established an ‘AMKL-mixed' class encompassing AMKL cases with diverse genetic alterations. This class was originally defined based on samples with FAB M7 morphology harboring NUP98::KDM5A or RBM15::MKL1 fusions. We defined two classes representing KMT2A-r infant AML (HOXA-activated group 8 + 9). Initial class labels were defined by hierarchical clustering of infant KMT2A-r AML (age <3 years) with FAB M4 and M5 morphology, excluding KMT2A-r with MLLT10 and MLLT3, as those fusions were commonly found in other classes (Extended Data Fig. 1f). We defined the class of BCL11B-activated lineage-ambiguous leukemia based on sample labels in previous work67. Lastly, we defined five control classes.

Through the steps described above, we could define labels for 1,346 out of 2,540 samples (53.0%; Extended Data Fig. 1g). We used a semi-supervised clustering strategy to assign labels to the remaining samples, which were either not considered in the original studies or did not have complete metadata available. To generate stable consensus labels, we performed semi-supervised clustering 100 times on randomly subsampled parts of our dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1h). For this purpose, we randomly chose 80% of samples with and without labels. To ensure that we did not rely too heavily on existing labels, we also randomly masked 20% of all samples with labels in each iteration. We then calculated the weighted Pearson's correlation coefficients for these samples. We did this separately for each iteration using the 4,000 most variable AML, B-ALL and T-ALL probes and the 1,500 most variable global probes. The weight was the standard deviation per probe. In the next step, we constructed a graph with edges to the four closest neighbors. Finally, label propagation was performed according to previous work77 as implemented in the igraph R package (v.2.0.3). After 100 iterations, we assigned consensus labels to all 2,540 samples (Extended Data Fig. 1i,j). To ensure that we would not use samples that may be impure, we first excluded all samples that were assigned to a control class in more than 30% of cases (117 out of 2,540 samples; 4.6%). All samples with the same class or class family in more than 70% of iterations were assigned the class or majority class if in a class family (2,356 out of 2,540; 92.8%). All remaining samples were not assigned a class (67 out of 2,540; 2.6%).

RNAseq data were retrieved from the Genomic Data Commons (https://gdc.cancer.gov) for TARGET AML, Beat AML, TARGET-ALL-P3 and TCGA-LAML. We extracted unstranded count data of protein-coding genes. Data were previously processed according to the standardized GDC pipeline https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/Bioinformatics_Pipelines/Expression_mRNA_Pipeline). Counts were transformed to VST values using the vst function implemented in the DESeq2 R package (v.1.44.0)78. Z-score scaling was performed on all samples within AML methylation classes for visualization of single gene expression. Differential expression analysis was performed only on the TARGET AML data using the standard DESeq2 R pipeline.

MARLIN is a neural network able to process multi-platform and sparse methylation data trained in R (v.4.1.3) using the keras (v.2.13.0) and data.table (v.1.14.2) packages. The model architecture is composed of three fully connected layers. The first two layers have 256 and 128 nodes, respectively, with sigmoid activation. The first layer has an input size of 357,340, equal to the number of high-quality CpG sites of the reference cohort. The final layer is composed of 42 nodes, representing the 42 methylation classes. The control classes of peripheral blood adults and pediatric were merged into one control class to allow the model to learn general peripheral blood methylation patterns rather than age-specific ones. Softmax activation was chosen for this layer, and the scores (which sum up to 1) represent the class probabilities. During the training phases, a dropout rate of 0.99 was applied to the input layer within each epoch, defined as one complete pass of the entire training dataset. Categorical cross-entropy was used as a multiclass classification loss function. Beta values of the methylation array cohort were binarized to −1 and +1 with a beta value cutoff of 0.5, similar to previous works18,19,61. The model was trained using 50 randomly selected samples per methylation class (with replacement) for 3,000 epochs with a batch size of 32, a learning rate of 10−5 and the Adam optimizer. The model was trained using a Nvidia A100 80 GB GPU.

To evaluate MARLIN performance, fivefold cross-validation was performed. Samples were randomly divided into training (four folds) and test set (one fold). For each training set, 50 randomly selected samples for each class were used to train the model. Data sparsity was simulated on the test fold, converting an increasing fraction of CpGs to zero (from 0% to 100% in 1% increments, essentially setting them to ‘NA'). The F1 scores, defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, were used to evaluate the model. The final training was performed with the entire dataset, randomly sampling 50 observations for each class.

External validation cohorts were composed of methylation profiles obtained with different technologies, including Illumina Infinium Methylation 27k and 450k arrays, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and nanopore26,29,30,35,63,64,65,66. Processed data were downloaded from GEO accessions GSE152136, GSE213685, GSE155339, GSE133986 and GSE56600, EBI ArrayExpress accessions E-GEOD-35069 and E-MTAB-10090 and the Genomic Data Commons data repository (TARGET AML). Methylation values were binarized (−1 and +1) and restricted to the CpG positions used for training our model. Missing values were set to zero.

To determine an optimal classification threshold, we performed a receiver operating characteristic analysis of the maximum MARLIN prediction scores calculated during cross-validation. Samples correctly classified were labeled as ‘classified'; otherwise, as ‘misclassified'. We defined the optimal threshold by maximizing the Youden index (specificity + sensitivity − 1). At a simulated sparsity level of 97%, up to which the performance of our model remains stable, we found that a cutoff of 0.83 maximizes the Youden index with a specificity of 90.8% and sensitivity of 79.7%. At lower levels of sparsity (higher sequencing coverage), we found similar performances with higher optimal thresholds (for example, at 95% sparsity, the optimal cutoff was 0.93 with a specificity of 90.4% and sensitivity of 80.6%). At higher levels of sparsity levels, optimal thresholds and area under the curve dramatically decreased, in line with our previous performance analysis. We therefore reasoned that a cutoff of 0.8 is an adequate threshold for variable sequencing depths.

In a subset of cases, a predicted sample may fall between biologically similar classes, in which case MARLIN may not reach the classification threshold for an individual class. We reasoned that predictions contain valuable information; for example, by distinguishing these cases from other, more readily distinguishable methylation classes. Hence, we introduced methylation class families as a post-prediction step in which scores for individual methylation classes within a family are summed to yield a single score. Definitions of methylation class families are included in Supplementary Table 2. Methylation class families were also included in cross-validation analysis.

A cohort of 34 bone marrow aspirate, peripheral blood or pericardial fluid samples from 34 distinct patients (19 female, 14 male; median age: 61.5 years) was selected from the Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnosis at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The cohort included 20 AML samples, 11 B-ALL samples, one T-ALL sample, one MPAL sample and one essential thrombocythaemia sample by genetic classification following the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues (4th edition). We did not use the 4th edition provisional entity ‘AML with RUNX1 mutation', as it has been removed from recent classification schemes, and instead classified those cases as ‘AML with myelodysplasia-related changes'. In addition, six MDS cases were included in our cohort. All patients provided written informed consent to the DFCI Institutional Review Board-approved research protocol 01-206 for ‘Tissue and Data Collection for Research Studies in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies, Bone Marrow Disorders and Normal Donors'. To ensure data protection, all patients were assigned a unique numerical identifier for research purposes. The demographic characteristics of the patient cohort are provided in Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Table 16. In total, ten healthy donor controls were sequenced; four gDNA samples from bone marrow aspirates and six K2EDTA-anticoagulated peripheral blood samples obtained from BioIVT, provided with consent under their respective sponsor's protocol number (Supplementary Table 15). Finally, all samples were later subjected to Oxford Nanopore Technologies library preparation and sequencing.

Freshly collected bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were processed to obtain DNA. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue DNA extraction kit (cat. no 69506), following the manufacturer's instructions for non-nucleated blood specimens. For every patient sample retrieved, 150–200 μl of specimen was mixed with 20 μl of proteinase K, adjusting the volume to 220 μl with PBS. Then, 200 μl of ALT lysis buffer was added, and samples were gently vortexed. To complete the cell lysis step, samples were incubated for 10 min at 56 °C. For DNA precipitation, 200 μl of 100% ethanol was added to the samples. This mixture was then placed into a mini column and centrifuged for 1 min at 8,000 rpm. The mini column was placed into a new collection tube, and a first washing step was performed by adding 500 μl of buffer AW1 and centrifuging for 1 min at 8,000 rpm. The collection tube was discarded, and a second washing step was done using 500 μl of AW2 buffer, centrifuging for 3 min at 14,000 rpm. Finally, the DNA was eluted from the column by adding 200 μl of elution buffer and centrifuging for 1 min at 8,000 rpm. The elution step was repeated several times to increase DNA recovery, and DNA quantification was done using the Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. Q33238).

To make samples suitable for a sequencing run, 500 ng to 1 μg of DNA from 19 patients were prepared using the Ligation Sequencing Kit V14 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, cat. no. SQK-LSK114). All samples were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, following an increased AMPureXP incubation period up to 30 min in both end-repair and ligation reactions and a two-in-a-row elution step for 30 min each. After end-repair bead incubation and ethanol washing, beads were allowed to dry for 5 min. After the ligation step, bead incubation and long-fragment buffer washing, the beads were dried for 15 min. DNA was eluted in 16–18 μl of nuclease-free water. The abundance of the DNA recovered after the library preparation was quantified using the Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. Q33238), and DNA size was assessed in some specimens with the TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G2992AA) to corroborate the existence of high molecular weight DNA to obtain long reads. In the expanded cohort, 15 additional samples were processed using the Rapid Barcoding Kit 24 V14 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, cat. no. SQK-RBK114.24), according to the manufacturer's instructions. We prepared two multiplexed libraries, each one including eight and seven patients' samples, respectively, of the total additional cases.

Once the libraries were prepared, they were loaded either on a MinION flow cell device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, cat. no. FLO-MIN114 R.10.4.1) or, for select samples, on PromethION flow cells for detection of structural variants, single-nucleotide variants and indels (cat. no. FLO-PRO114M R.10.4.1) (Supplementary Table 12). Flow cells priming and library loading steps were performed using the Flow Cell Priming Kit (cat. no. EXP-FLP004) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All libraries were sequenced for 48–72 h, depending on the number of pores remaining and the reads generated by both times. Once the sequencing run was finished, library DNA was pulled out to perform a washing step, adding 398 μl of washing buffer and 2 μl of washing mix into the flow cell for 1 h according to protocol (EXP-WSH004). The washing fluid was then removed, and the flow cell was again primed with 1,170 μl of flow cell flush and 30 μl of flow cell tether. Libraries were again loaded onto the flow cell spotON port, and the sequencing run was restarted.

Pod5 raw data files were processed using Dorado (v.0.3.2), with a minimum q-score of 10 and using the human genome assemblies hg19 and T2T (processed with a Nvidia A100 80 GB GPU). The high-accuracy model used for base and modified base calling was selected according to the kit chemistry versions. Methylation calls were extracted from BAM files using the modkit tool (v.0.1.13), which produced a BED file restricted to CpG positions of our reference cohort and containing the methylation status of covered CpGs. Total number of reads, genome-wide called CpGs, covered array-based reference CpGs, average 5mC and 5hmC were calculated for quality assessment Supplementary Table 12. Methylation calls were binarized as described above and used as input for MARLIN. Prediction scores are reported in Supplementary Table 13. Maximum score and a threshold of 0.8 were used to evaluate the results. Prediction scores for 42 individual methylation classes were also aggregated at the methylation class family and lineage levels. A custom R script was used to extract read IDs and timestamps to simulate real-time predictions. BED files with the binarized methylation calls were generated for every 5 min of sequencing. Predictions were produced using the combined data up to that point. Methylation calls for retrospective (n = 34) and prospective (n = 5) samples are accessible on GEO (GSE280090). Two files are provided for each sample: one file containing the methylation calls of CpGs restricted to positions of probes in our reference, and one file containing genome-wide methylation calls for 5mC and 5hmC in bedMethyl format.

To confirm suspected structural variants in high-coverage nanopore data obtained from PromethION sequencing runs, we first extracted read IDs for all reads mapping to involved genes using Samtools (v.1.20). We then intersected lists of read IDs to identify split reads mapping to both fusion gene partners (for example, RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 or PML and RARA). For the DUX4 rearrangement, we extracted all IDs of reads mapping to the D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35 containing a number of DUX4 genes or pseudogenes and overlapped read IDs with reads mapping to the immunoglobulin heavy locus on chromosome 14. Split reads were pulled out from the BAM files using Samtools and visualized with IGV browser (v.2.7.14) using the Region Navigator.

For the five real-time classification samples, DNA was extracted as described above. DNA was then prepared using either the Rapid Sequencing Kit V14 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, cat. no. LSK-RAD114) for rapid analysis or the Ligation Sequencing Kit V14 (cat. no. LSK-SQK114) for later, deeper sequencing. For all patients, DNA size was checked using the TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G2992AA). Nanopore sequencing was performed on a MinION flow cell (cat. no. FLO-MIN114 R.10.4.1), with active base calling, methylation calling in the context of 5mC and 5hmC and real-time alignment to the hg19 human genome, allowing a BAM file generation every 10 min. These processes were handled using MinKNOW software (v.24.02.16) in a GridION platform with accelerated computing integrated (Nvidia Quadro GV100 GPU). The BAM files with the methylation calls were produced every 10 min. A custom bash script was used to check whether new BAM files were generated every 5 s. If so, methylation calls were extracted from the new BAM file using the modkit tool (v.0.1.13). The output was a BED file restricted to the CpG positions of our reference cohort and containing the methylation status of the covered CpGs. Custom R scripts were used to aggregate the BED files produced up to that time point, binarize the methylation calls, load MARLIN to generate the prediction, write a text file containing the prediction scores for each class, a timestamp and the number of covered CpGs and to plot the classification results at the class, methylation class family and lineage level. A single prospective sample (RTC_003) briefly received a MARLIN prediction score above the classification threshold before changing towards a related methylation class upon deeper sequencing. We therefore recommend monitoring real-time MARLIN scores until predictions stabilize. The real-time classification script is available on GitHub (https://github.com/hovestadt/MARLIN).

All patient samples were diagnosed using gold standard diagnosis techniques at the DFCI, including targeted sequencing by DFCI's rapid heme panel (RHPv3)79, which uses next-generation sequencing to search for alterations in 95 genes that are frequently associated with leukemias, bone marrow aspirate, immunohistochemistry staining, cytogenetics and flow cytometry.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. For the reference cohort, inclusion was based on availability of high-quality public data. The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment, as grouping is based on the molecular characteristics of individual patients. For the retrospective and prospective nanopore sequencing cohorts, samples were selected based on availability and with the aim of covering a broad spectrum of molecular subtypes. No data were excluded. Select samples were resequenced using the PromethION nanopore instrument to detect underlying genetic events (AL_02, AL_10, AL_24) or to test real-time implementation of MARLIN (AL_16). No allocation of samples into experimental groups occurred. All patient data collection and pathological analyses were performed independently of this study as part of routine clinical procedures. Results from MARLIN predictions on clinical samples were not used by pathologists or providers for patient care. Statistical tests used are reported in the figure legends.

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

a. Stacked bar plots showing lineage concordance by lineage (left), dataset (middle) and age group (right). Fractions are colored by immunophenotype with concordant and discordant cases colored separately. b. Visualization of lineage discordant cases. Out of the 60 lineage discordant cases, 49 were in the methylation classes ZNF384-r B-ALL (n = 4), HOXA9-activated T-ALL (n = 23), BCL11B-activated ALAL (n = 17), KMT2A-r B-ALL (n = 5). Sankey plots compare diagnosed immunophenotypes and study within those four methylation classes. We found that the lineage discordance was across a broad range of immunophenotypes and studies for the four classes. Highlighting that lineage discordance is not due to isolated studies, and that methylation patterns are robust between independent studies. c. Pie charts showing genetics of lineage discordant cases inside ZNF384-r, HOXA9-activated T-ALL, BCL11B-activated, and KMT2A-r B-ALL classes. We found characteristic lineage ambiguous alterations inside each class, including ZNF384-r (n = 3, methylation class ZNF384-r), PICALM::MLLT10 (n = 10, methylation class HOXA9-activated T-ALL), BCL11B (n = 6, methylation class BCL11B-activated), and KMT2A-r (n = 4, methylation class KMT2A-r B-ALL). d. Visualization of lineage ambiguous genetics specific to methylation classes. The top part shows all samples with known ZNF384-r, PICALM::MLLT10, BCL11B alteration, and KMT2A-r visualized on the t-SNE from Fig. 1a. The bottom part compares methylation class (rows) to immunophenotype (columns). We found that ZNF384-r, PICALM::MLLT10, and BCL11B are specific to the methylation classes ZNF384-r, HOXA9-activated T-ALL, and BCL11B-activated. Contrarily, KMT2A-r are genetic alterations that occur in several methylation classes across lineages. e. For cases within the BCL11B-activated methylation class, we wanted to see if we could verify their status as BCL11B-activated leukemia. Therefore, we first looked for BCL11B enhancer tandem amplification (BETA) in the copy-number profile of newly classified patients in the methylation class BCL11B-activated. BETA is a characteristic genetic event occurring in about 20% of BCL11B-activated leukemia67. We could confirm BETAs in 2/13 newly classified patients (15.4%). f. Comparison of BCL11B gene expression between AML, B-ALL, T-ALL, and BCL11B-activated methylation class samples across four cohorts (Alexander et al, TARGET AML0531, TARGET AML1031, Giacopelli/BeatAML). Boxplots depict the interquartile range (IQR, 25th to 75th percentiles) with central lines indicating median values. Whiskers extend to the most extreme data points that are no more than 1.5 × IQR from the respective quartile boundary. Individual points beyond the whiskers represent outliers. We found that samples inside the BCL11B-activated methylation class show strong expression of BCL11B in all four cohorts.

Source data

a. Confusion matrix comparing AML methylation classes (columns) and common genetic alterations (AML). Boxes are colored by genetic alteration and color intensity is relative to abundance of genetic alteration per class. Numbers in boxes show the number of altered samples divided by the number of samples with available information. Statistically significance was determined by Chi-squared test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons to calculate q-values (*q < 0.05,**q < 0.01,***q < 0.001, ****q < 0.0001; see row names). For significantly different mutated genes, post-hoc analysis was performed to assess which methylation classes were differentially mutated. Here, one-sided Fisher's exact test was performed followed by Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons to calculate q-values (*q < 0.05,**q < 0.01,***q < 0.001, ****q < 0.0001). b. t-SNE dimensionality reduction of AML classes colored by age groups. AYA, adolescents and young adults. c. Boxplots showing age distribution by methylation class. Boxplots depict the interquartile range (IQR, 25th to 75th percentiles) with central lines indicating median values. Whiskers extend to the most extreme data points that are no more than 1.5 × IQR from the respective quartile boundary. Individual points beyond the whiskers represent outliers. d. Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank test P value showing survival for PML::RARA, CBFB::MYH11, RUNX1::RUNX1T1 and CEBPA methylation classes in adult (left) and pediatric (middle) cohorts. These favorable-risk genotypes exhibit improved survival compared to other genotypes, and as such patients in the methylation classes also show favorable outcomes (P = 4.4e-9,P = 1e-13, respectively). The right panel shows a Kaplan-Meier plot with log-rank test P value comparing survival for patients in the methylation classes ETV6::MNX1, HNRNPH1::ERG, AMKL-mixed, GLIS-r and FUS-r.

Kaplan-Meier plots comparing survival of samples in CEBPA methylation class to CEBPA-mut samples outside the methylation class for pediatric (left) and adult (right) cohorts. Log-rank test P value is shown. e. t-SNE dimensionality reduction of AML classes colored by myelodysplasia genetics. In the IDH-enriched methylation class, mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were found in nearly all cases (14/15, 93.3%, also see Extended Data Fig. 3a). However, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were also found recurrently in several other classes, including HOX-activated AML. Similarly, the Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched methylation class was enriched for mutations in DNMT3A, chromatin regulators and/or spliceosome genes, but these alterations were also recurrently found in several other classes (IDH-enriched, TP53/aneuploidy-enriched, and HOX-activated). Lastly, the TP53/aneuploidy-enriched methylation class had frequent TP53 alterations (22/75, 29.3%) and copy-number changes such as deletions of chromosome 5/5q (24/84, 28.6%) or chromosome 7/7q (31/84, 36.9%). However, this class also contained a significant number of TP53 wild-type cases (53/75, 70.7%) and contained other alterations associated with myelodysplasia-related AML and adverse prognosis, including MECOM rearrangements (9/67, 13.4%) and RUNX1 mutations (18/74, 24.3%). f. t-SNE of AML methylation classes with samples colored by AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) status according to WHO2016 and whether they are inside or outside of MDS-associated methylation classes. g. Barchart showing the number of WHO2016 AML-MRC cases by methylation class. h. Kaplan-Meier plots comparing survival for patients in the methylation classes IDH-enriched, Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched, and TP53/aneuploidy-enriched. Outcomes for the TP53/aneuploidy-enriched and Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched methylation classes are particularly poor (median overall survival of 0.69 and 0.98 years, respectively). Log-rank test P value is shown.

We observed specific expression of MECOM, which is associated with adverse prognosis57. The middle and right panel show a t-SNE dimensionality reduction of AML classes colored by expression of MECOM (middle) and PRDM16 (right). PRDM16 is a MECOM paralog that has been shown to be a poor prognostic factor in pediatric AML84. Strong PRDM16 expression can be found in HOXA/B Groups 1 and 4. Interestingly, 22 KMT2A-r were found in HOXA/B-activated Group 4, which show strong MECOM, and no PRDM16 expression.

a. Chart showing immunophenotyping assessment for 15 acute leukemia samples of the multiplexed retrospective cohort. b. Predicted methylation classes for acute leukemia samples with a classification score of ≥0.8 overlaid on t-SNE visualization of the reference cohort. c. Bar plots show the number of covered reference CpGs and MARLIN prediction scores for 15 samples of the multiplexed retrospective acute leukemia cohort. Patient characteristics are indicated in the table on the left. Methylation classes with the highest score are indicated on the right. Concordance of MARLIN predictions with conventional diagnostics is visualized with an icon (see legend at the bottom of the panel). Notably, despite the multiplexed approach, the median number of covered reference CpGs was comparable to our initial cohort (309,066 vs. 324,990, respectively) due to the higher output of the PromethION platform. Among cases that did not reach the methylation class prediction threshold, 2/5 (AL_029 diagnosed as B-ALL Ph + , AL_036 diagnosed as AML-MRC) surpassed the prediction threshold on the methylation class family level (indicated by dotted lines) and the methylation class with the highest score was concordant with initial diagnosis in both cases (B-ALL Ph/Ph-like and AML TP53/aneuploidy-enriched, respectively). One case (AL_039 diagnosed as AML-MRC) received the highest score for HOX Grp 3 AML, coherent with a TP53-mut and structural alterations involving chromosome 11q23 (harbouring KMT2A). d. Bar plots show MARLIN prediction results for healthy donor bone marrow and whole blood samples. All ten samples have one of the control classes as the highest scoring methylation class. e.

Line graph shows real-time MARLIN prediction scores for the different methylation classes. Dashed horizontal line indicates classification threshold at 0.8 (middle). Copy-number profile generated from nanopore sequencing (bottom). Flow cytometry and aspirate evaluation on day one and day four established an AML diagnosis. Cytogenetic analysis on day two indicated a gain of chromosomes 11 and 13, while gene panel sequencing revealed mutations in ASXL1, ETNK1, IDH1, NRAS, RUNX1, SETBP1 and SRSF2 on day twelve, resulting in a conventional diagnosis of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. MARLIN briefly reached scores above the confidence threshold for the IDH-enriched AML methylation class, before changing towards the related HOXA/B-activated Group 3 (NPM1, IDH-enriched) methylation class upon deeper sequencing (passing the confidence threshold after 590 minutes). We therefore recommend monitoring real-time MARLIN scores until predictions stabilize. Both classifications were compatible with pathology findings showing AML with myelodysplasia-related mutations, an IDH1 hotspot mutation, and gain of chromosome 11 (harbouring KMT2A), although canonical HOX-associated alterations were not identified. b. Timeline, real-time MARLIN prediction, and copy-number profile for RTC_004. Flow cytometry results on day two showed a mixed phenotype, while aspirate evaluation on day three indicated an ETP-ALL immunophenotype. Gene panel sequencing on day 4 revealed mutations in JAK3 (x2), NOTCH1 (x5) and NRAS. Results from cytogenetics on day 22 revealed a complex karyotype. The final clinical diagnosis was Early T-cell precursor (ETP) lymphoblastic leukemia. In alignment with these results, MARLIN resulted in a high-confidence prediction for HOXA9-activated T-ALL, an ETP-like methylation class, after 50 minutes of sequencing and 96 minutes in total. c. Timeline, real-time MARLIN prediction, and copy-number profile for RTC_005. Flow cytometry on day one and aspirate evaluation on day five established a diagnosis of AML. Gene panel sequencing results on day four revealed mutations in ASXL1, EZH2, NRAS, RUNX1, and ZRSR2. Cytogenetics on day four showed a trisomy 8. The final clinical diagnosis was AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. MARLIN yielded a concordant classification of Chromatin/spliceosome-enriched AML, after 90 minutes of sequencing, and 135 minutes in total.

Billions of organic molecules have been computationally generated, yet functional inorganic materials remain scarce due to limited data and structural complexity. Here we introduce Structural Constraint Integration in a GENerative model (SCIGEN), a framework that enforces geometric constraints, such as honeycomb and kagome lattices, within diffusion-based generative models to discover stable quantum materials candidates. SCIGEN enables conditional sampling from the original distribution, preserving output validity while guiding structural motifs. This approach generates ten million inorganic compounds with Archimedean and Lieb lattices, over 10% of which pass multistage stability screening. High-throughput density functional theory calculations on 26,000 candidates shows over 95% convergence and 53% structural stability. A graph neural network classifier detects magnetic ordering in 41% of relaxed structures. Furthermore, we synthesize and characterize two predicted materials, TiPd0.22Bi0.88 and Ti0.5Pd1.5Sb, which display paramagnetic and diamagnetic behaviour, respectively. Our results indicate that SCIGEN provides a scalable path for generating quantum materials guided by lattice geometry.

We have compiled a comprehensive database of AL materials generated by SCIGEN. The dataset provides the folders of all generated materials (10.06 million), the materials that survived after the four-stage prescreening process (1.01 million materials) and DFT-relaxed structures (24,743). The folder with DFT calculation contains materials structures before and after relaxation. The Supplementary Dataset is available from figshare via https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7283062 (ref. 50.) Source data are provided with this paper.

After 500 million years of evolution, extant land plants compose the following two sister groups: the bryophytes and the vascular plants. Despite their small size and simple structure, bryophytes thrive in a wide variety of habitats, including extreme conditions. However, the genetic basis for their ecological adaptability and long-term survival is not well understood. A comprehensive super-pangenome analysis, incorporating 123 newly sequenced bryophyte genomes, reveals that bryophytes possess a substantially greater diversity of gene families than vascular plants. This includes a higher number of unique and lineage-specific gene families, originating from extensive new gene formation and continuous horizontal transfer of microbial genes over their long evolutionary history. The evolution of bryophytes' rich and diverse genetic toolkit, which includes new physiological innovations like unique immune receptors, likely facilitated their spread across different biomes. These newly sequenced bryophyte genomes offer a valuable resource for exploring alternative evolutionary strategies for terrestrial success.

The colonization of land by plants marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of life on the Earth1,2, ultimately giving rise to the complex modern-day terrestrial ecosystem3. Today, approximately 400,000 species of land plants (embryophytes) compose the following two major groups: bryophytes (that is, hornworts, liverworts and mosses) and vascular plants (tracheophytes)4, with the latter being distinguished by their branched sporophyte and lignified water-conducting cells. The phylogenetic relationships between bryophytes and tracheophytes, as well as among bryophytes themselves, were subjects of debate, until recent analyses of transcriptomic and genomic data resolved bryophytes as a monophyletic group, which is sister to all living tracheophytes5,6,7,8,9. These findings suggest that extant land plants emerged from two distinct evolutionary lines that diverged around 500 million years ago (Mya). Bryophytes and vascular plants differ primarily in their dominant vegetative generation, with bryophytes dominated by the gametophyte and vascular plants dominated by the sporophyte. Consequently, their diversification may be driven primarily, though not exclusively, by selection on traits associated with these respective generations7. However, whether the processes of genome evolution underlying these diversifications are similar or not have remained largely unexplored, primarily due to the limited availability of genomic data from a diverse range of bryophytes.

Bryophytes comprise approximately 22,000 species worldwide and exhibit a wide distribution, often thriving and even dominating in extreme habitats10,11. Their structure is rather simple, as they lack lignified water-conducting cells, roots12 and their sporophyte remains unbranched and reliant on the maternal gametophyte for the nourishment13. The widespread ecological success of bryophytes may be attributed to their unique and divergent physiological adaptations, such as dehydration and desiccation tolerance, which differ substantially from those of tracheophytes14, and may be concordant with the surprisingly divergent genomes15,16,17,18,19. Whether such genomic diversity is universal among bryophytes remains to be tested. Indeed, genomes remain to be assembled for the majority of bryophyte orders, which account for most of the approximately 70 land plant orders still lacking genomic information20. To date, only 8 of the 55 bryophyte orders have sequenced genomes, highlighting a substantial knowledge gap in furthering our understanding of genome evolution in land plants21. This study bridges this gap by presenting 123 newly sequenced bryophyte genomes, enabling a comprehensive ‘pangenome' analysis of bryophytes. Our findings also uncover divergent gene family spaces and distinct evolutionary processes that have shaped the genomes of bryophytes and vascular plants.

We newly sequenced, assembled and annotated 123 high-quality and highly complete bryophyte genomes, and compiled these in a centralized platform (www.bryogenomes.org). The sampling includes 37 liverworts, 82 mosses and 4 hornworts, representing 47 of the 55 known bryophyte orders (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). The genomes of bryophytes are relatively small compared to other land plants, and hold on average fewer genes (that is, 27,959 overall, or specifically, 19,267 for hornworts, 27,768 for liverworts and 28,701 for mosses; Supplementary Data 2 and 3 and Supplementary Note 1) than those of vascular plants (that is, 34,794 genes). Our phylogenetic analyses place bryophytes as a sister group to extant vascular plants, with relationships within bryophyte lineages largely aligning with recent phylogenomic studies4,8,22,23,24 (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 1 and 4), providing a robust framework for tracing the evolution of bryophyte genomes (Supplementary Notes 1 and 2).

The phylogeny is based on a 190-taxon (see details in Supplementary Data 1–3) phylogenetic analysis of green plants (Extended Data Fig. 2) with divergent time based on the molecular dating analysis of bryophytes (Supplementary Fig. 19). The branches and species names are color-highlighted by the three major bryophyte groups. From the inside to outside, the five channels illustrated are genome size, gene number, repeat ratio (percentage of repeat content in the genomes, with blue, purple and green bars representing LTR, LINE and unknown repeats, respectively), gene length and exon length. The bryophyte images (not to scale) shown from left to right include the hornwort Phaeoceros laevis1; the liverworts Apotreubia nana2, Asterella syngenesica2, Petalophyllum ralfsii2, Pleurozia purpurea2 and Scapania bolanderi2; and the mosses Sphagnum fallax2, Polytrichum sp.1, Buxbaumia aphylla3, Diphyscium mucronifolium2, Encalypta ciliata2, Ptychomitrium sp.4, Octoblepharum albidum2, Rhacocarpus purpurascens2, Imbribryum miniatum2, Rhodobryum roseum1, Racopilum cf. capens2, Hypopterygium flavolimbatum2, Antitrichia californica2 and Exsertotheca intermedia2. The illustrations were created based on photographs by S. S. Dong (P. laevis, Polytrichum sp. and R. roseum), D. Callaghan (A. nana, A. syngenesica, P. ralfsii, P. purpurea, S. bolanderi, S. fallax, D. mucronifolium, E. ciliata, O. albidum, R. purpurascens, I. miniatum, Racopilum cf. capens, H. flavolimbatum, A. californica and E. intermedia), Y. Liu (B. aphylla) and L. Zhang (Ptychomitrium sp.). LINE, long interspersed nuclear element.

The proteomes of 343 Archaeplastida species (138 bryophytes, 146 tracheophytes and 59 algae; Supplementary Data 5) were classified into 1,113,359 orthogroups (gene families). Bryophytes exhibit a considerably larger cumulative number of nonredundant gene families compared to vascular plants (that is, 637,597 versus 373,581; Fig. 2a), despite slightly larger taxon sampling for the latter. Bryophytes also have a higher average number of gene families unique to a single taxon (that is, 3,862 versus 2,223; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 6), and more accessory gene families, that is, those present in at least two but fewer than 80% of all samples of a lineage (4,021 versus 1,583), although they possess fewer (6,233 versus 6,647) core gene families (that is, those present in ≥80% of samples of a lineage). Whereas bryophytes have a lower percentage of unique or ‘orphan' gene families (that is, 84% versus 87%; Fig. 2a), their absolute number far exceeds that of vascular plants (532,840 versus 324,552). Collectively, the total number of unique and accessory gene families in a single bryophyte genome averages 7,883 (56% of the total number of gene families) versus only 3,806 (36%) in vascular plants.

a, The number of gene families of each composition (core, accessory and unique) in individual genomes of 138 bryophytes (left) and 146 tracheophytes (right). The taxa on x axis are ordered based on the phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 3). The added-up average number of the three types of gene families are marked by dash lines. The pie charts show the total number of three types of gene families of all sampled bryophytes and tracheophytes. b, Simulations of the decrease of core genome size (top), and the increase of the pangenome size (bottom) in bryophytes (blue dot) and tracheophytes (purple dot). In total, 100 random combinations were used for each given number of species. c, Dot plot indicates the total number of gene families (y axis) reconstructed at the ancestral nodes, dated based on Extended Data Fig. 3 (x axis), across the bryophyte (top), and tracheophyte (bottom) phylogeny. MRCA, most recent common ancestor.

Bryophyte genomes show substantial gene family diversity, with a sharp increase in the number of orthogroups as more genomes are added (Fig. 2b, bottom). This contrasts with the stabilization of core gene families after sampling 30 genomes. Tracheophyte genomes exhibit similar patterns, though with a less steep accumulation curve (Fig. 2b), possibly reflecting higher rates of gene innovation in bryophytes or the result of deeper phylogenetic sampling of bryophytes (Extended Data Fig. 3). These findings suggest that, despite extensive sampling, many genes and gene families in land plants remain undiscovered.

The estimated numbers of gene family gains and losses in land plants (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 7) are much higher than previously suggested7,25, indicating the profound impact of sampling size on reconstructing gene family evolution (Supplementary Note 3). Bryophytes show a long history of gene family innovation, especially notable in mosses (for example, Bryidae; Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3) since the early Cretaceous (~100 Mya), a phenomenon perhaps linked to the cumulative effects of successive whole-genome duplications (WGDs) in mosses (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 5). This contrasts with tracheophytes, wherein ancestral diversity of gene families is lower in lineages that arose over the last 65 million years and which are characterized by constant and small numbers of total gene families (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3), possibly due to mass extinctions during the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary26. Over time, bryophyte ancestral nodes are estimated to hold more gene family diversity than those of vascular plants (Fig. 2c), underscoring deep-rooted gene family innovation processes in bryophytes.

Accessory and unique gene families in bryophytes are integral to their genomes, with a guanine-cytosine (GC) content similar to core genes (that is, ~50%; Extended Data Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 2) and a substantial proportion (50–80%) are expressed (Extended Data Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 3), including in model species like Physcomitrium patens and Marchantia polymorpha (Extended Data Fig. 4a), and, further, a considerable fraction of them are differentially expressed under various stresses in P. patens (Extended Data Fig. 4c). However, in bryophytes, the function of most accessory and unique gene families remains ambiguous, with only a small fraction (27% and 16%) functionally annotated based on protein domains, compared to 91% in core families (Extended Data Fig. 4e). This highlights the substantial knowledge gap in understanding the functional roles of genes in bryophytes.

In all sampled bryophytes (Supplementary Fig. 2), including the model species P. patens and M. polymorpha (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g), genes within accessory and unique orthogroups contain fewer introns and possess shorter coding regions compared to those within core orthogroups. These characteristics are also observed in newly evolved or ‘young' genes in angiosperms such as Oryza27 and Arabidopsis28,29, suggesting that the majority of accessory and unique gene families in bryophytes may have originated recently. Additionally, genes belonging to unique gene families in P. patens and M. polymorpha are generally expressed at lower levels than those in accessory and core families (Extended Data Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 3), a pattern consistent with observations of new genes in rice27. It is likely that most unique orthogroups in bryophytes arose as orphan genes through various molecular mechanisms, including rapid sequence evolution and de novo gene origination27,30. In P. patens and M. polymorpha, less than 15% of unique genes show some sequence similarity to genes in other orthogroups (Extended Data Fig. 4i), suggesting their derivation following gene duplication. Conversely, the 85% that exhibit no sequence similarity to existing orthogroups likely arose through different mechanisms, predominantly de novo from noncoding regions31. Identifying ancestral noncoding sequences poses challenges due to rapid sequence divergence32 and the scarcity of genomic resources for closely related taxa. In our study, we selected M. polymorpha ssp. ruderalis for comparison with two conspecific subspecies and its sister species, all of which diverged within the last 5–7 million years33,34. Approximately 70–80% (3,120–3,583; Extended Data Fig. 4j) of genes in orphan gene families of M. polymorpha ssp. ruderalis aligns with noncoding regions in closely related species, indicating a likely origin from these regions (Extended Data Fig. 4j).

De novo gene origination, previously documented only in angiosperms such as rice27 and bamboo30, arises through gradual accumulation of mutations. For instance, the evolutionary trajectory of gene birth from proto-genes35 derived from noncoding regions can be reconstructed for several unique genes in M. polymorpha ssp. ruderalis, demonstrating the successive elimination or conversion of stop codons in proto-genes (Supplementary Fig. 4). For example, the orphan gene Mp7g02380 in M. polymorpha ssp. ruderalis shows increasing sequence similarity to orthologous sequences in noncoding regions of related Marchantia subspecies, with a corresponding decrease in the number of stop codons. Similarly, the orphan gene Mp4g17190 may have originated from noncoding regions with high similarity across Marchantia subspecies, where stop codons were converted to sense codons through single-base changes. Among mosses, particularly the Bryidae, about 26% of unique genes exhibit a high degree of similarity to noncoding regions in at least two other species (Supplementary Fig. 5, with exemplar alignments). This represents the largest set of de novo gene candidates proposed for any major plant lineage, totaling 36,481 genes. These findings not only demonstrate the occurrence of de novo gene innovation outside angiosperms but also underscore its significance in bryophytes. This mechanism36 has a crucial role in driving the adaptations and ecological diversification of bryophytes, highlighting the dynamic nature of their genomes and the evolutionary processes shaping them.

The genomes of 49 streptophyte species encompass 1,809 orthologous gene families with origins in prokaryotes, viruses, fungi or animals, and of these 1,306 are newly identified ones (Supplementary Data 8–11, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 6–13). The most substantial burst of HGT occurred in the ancestral streptophyte, with 115 HGT events, followed by 90 HGT events in the ancestral embryophyte (Fig. 3a). On average, individual bryophyte species have acquired more horizontally transferred genes than tracheophytes (229 versus 163; Fig. 3b), and our thorough phylogenetic analysis of bryophyte genomes indicates a higher number of species-specific HGT events (Fig. 3b), as also recently revealed for a relative of P. patens37. This suggests that HGT may have been a consistent feature throughout the bryophyte evolution, unlike the pattern observed during the diversification of vascular plants (Fig. 3a). HGT genes in Viridiplantae tend to have fewer introns and shorter lengths compared to core genes, reflecting the genes of their largely bacterial or fungal donor organisms36 (Supplementary Fig. 14). In bryophytes, HGT-acquired genes are often found in regions with a higher density of long terminal repeats (LTRs) than core genes, implying that LTR elements facilitate the integration or proliferation of HGT genes within their genomes (Supplementary Fig. 14).

a, A summary of the number of HGT events (Supplementary Data 10) on the chronogram of streptophytes (bryophytes in blue and tracheophytes in purple), with the numbers in the gray disks indicating total HGTs reconstructed at a node. The pie chart illustrates the distribution of putative donors to HGT among major categories, at select ancestral nodes and for specific clades, that is, including numbers from all internal bryophyte or tracheophyte nodes. Number next to terminal branch refers to HGT unique to the terminal taxon in our dataset. b, Bar chart of the cumulative numbers of HGT orthogroups in each sampled species, with each bar broken down into the proportion of gene families acquired from ancestral HGTs. Sum of tracheophyte nodes = summary of all tracheophyte internal nodes. Sum of bryophyte nodes = summary of all bryophyte internal nodes. OGs, orthologous groups.

A substantial portion of the genes that bryophytes have acquired through HGT are of unknown function, with the remainder having roles in replication, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism and secondary metabolism (Supplementary Data 12). In the moss P. patens, a large fraction of HGT genes were differentially expressed under heat, drought and UV stress, with 151 (60%), 148 (59%) and 190 (76%) HGT-derived orthogroups exhibiting altered expression, respectively (Supplementary Data 13–22). In total, expression of 233 HGT orthogroups was associated with abiotic stress responses, accounting for 93% of all HGT orthogroups in P. patens, implying they may enhance bryophyte ecological adaptability in diverse environments. Other HGT genes have been previously described as stress responsive. For example, the bacterial HPA3 gene, acquired by mosses, encodes an N-acetyltransferase, detoxifying toxic d-amino acids through N-acetylation, a crucial adaptation for cellular homeostasis and survival in nutrient-deprived or stressed ecosystems38,39. Finally, the fungal RDS1 gene acquired by liverworts, potentially linked to stress responses40, underscores the contribution of HGT-derived genes to plants' environmental resilience. Collectively, these genes highlight the pivotal role of HGT in shaping the adaptive capacities of bryophytes, enabling them to thrive in challenging ecological conditions.

Newly identified HGT genes in this study may also have various adaptive roles in interactions with other organisms. For example, the bacteria-derived LEC gene in mosses, encoding a mannose-specific lectin, exhibits antifungal activity against Alternaria alternata and Colletotrichum species41, underscoring its potential role in pathogen defense42. Similarly, the fungal-derived YANB gene in liverworts, encoding a decarboxylase involved in yanuthone D biosynthesis, provides antibiotic activity against fungi and bacteria, and may protect bryophytes from microbial competitors43. Another fungal-derived gene in liverworts, EUPF, biosynthesizes eupenifeldin, a secondary metabolite with broad-spectrum antifungal, antimalarial and anthelmintic properties44, likely enhancing bryophyte survival under diverse ecological pressures.

HGT-acquired genes may have critical roles in bryophytes' defense against herbivores. For example, in M. polymorpha, HGT-acquired terpene synthases (TPSs) are suggested to act mainly as antiherbivory agents45,46. Additionally, the FBT gene, encoding a protein with an FB lectin domain (PF07367), acquired from fungi and found in many liverworts and mosses, has an insecticidal effect (Supplementary Fig. 15). The protein synthesized by M. polymorpha causes 80% mortality in individuals of the moth Plutella xylostella injected with 5.41 µg FB lectin47. The antiherbivory function of this gene is strengthened here, even at a lower dose (0.45 μg mg−1, corresponding to 2.86 µg per individual) of the FB lectin derived from the leafy liverwort Acrolejeunea sandvicensis, causing 97.62% mortality in larvae of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Extended Data Fig. 5b and Supplementary Data 23). This potency approaches that of the Bt toxin secreted by Bacillus thuringiensis48. The FB lectin-containing diet also substantially reduces the growth rate of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Extended Data Fig. 5c and Supplementary Data 24). Thus, bryophytes possess a diverse array of gene families originating from microbial HGT, many of which are unique (Fig. 3), and offer a vast pool of genes for screening potential resistances to bacterial or fungal diseases (for example, KP4 (ref. 49)), or for exploring their roles in plant development50 and plant–fungi interactions51. This highlights the importance of HGT in the evolution and ecological diversification of bryophytes.

Bryophytes exhibit a substantially larger number of unique and accessory gene families compared to vascular plants (Fig. 2), with these families emerging throughout their evolutionary history (Fig. 2). Although bryophyte genomes contain a greater diversity of gene families (Fig. 2), they possess, on average, fewer genes than those of vascular plants (that is, 27,937 versus 34,813), where gene families expand primarily through gene duplications (Supplementary Fig. 16)52. Unique gene families in bryophytes may originate from de novo genes53, a process of gene innovation previously documented in flowering plants such as rice and bamboo27,30 and now also demonstrated in bryophytes. De novo origination appears to be a crucial mechanism for the diversification of bryophyte genomes. Our comprehensive genomic sampling across the plant kingdom substantially expands the phylogenetic distribution of de novo genes, highlighting the vital role of de novo gene origination in plant gene evolution and functional innovation. The patterns in new gene diversity imply their continuous emergence and fixation throughout bryophyte evolution. Fixation of ‘new' genes may be more efficient in bryophytes than in tracheophytes54, as these genes are immediately subjected to selection in the haploid vegetative body of bryophytes. Additionally, the totipotent nature of bryophyte gametophyte tissue may further enable the propagation of genetic newness, thus facilitating the fixation of new genes.

Many new functions in plants have been acquired through HGT, and our dense sampling indicates that HGT is not a sporadic but a continuous source of new genes in plants, particularly in bryophytes. Notably, nearly 70% of HGT gene families in bryophytes are categorized as accessory or unique gene families (Supplementary Data 25), and most sampled taxa carry unique HGTs (Fig. 3). Bryophytes show a differential accumulation of HGTs compared to seed plants, suggesting a possible link between the frequency of HGTs and the likelihood of germ line cells' direct exposure to microbes55.

Given the fundamentally simple architecture of bryophytes, the diversification of their genetic repertoire, leading to a vast number of accessory and unique gene families (Fig. 2a), may have been driven by the selection for new ecophysiological adaptations and their optimization14. In P. patens, for instance, 63% of accessory and 27% of unique gene families respond to abiotic stresses such as UV, heat and drought (Extended Data Fig. 4c). The PpARDT gene, involved in drought tolerance56, was initially identified as an ‘orphan' gene in P. patens but found to be common among more mosses in this study. Other physiological innovations may include adaptations to ultracold environments, enabling bryophytes to thrive in polar ecosystems57. Bryophytes are also distinguished by their diverse secondary metabolites, particularly terpenoids58, encoded by a rich assortment of TPS genes, notably the TPS-c type (Supplementary Fig. 17). More than 70% of bryophyte TPS genes belong to the accessory and unique gene families (Supplementary Data 25), and have been acquired through HGT multiple times independently across various land plant lineages59. In bryophytes, terpenoids are involved in numerous critical physiological processes, including allelopathy60, herbivore deterrence46,61, pathogen defense62 and hormonal activities58. Additionally, the diversity and variance in immune receptors (Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 18) between bryophytes and angiosperms also suggest distinct evolutionary defense strategies in bryophytes.

In conclusion, our comprehensive analyses of genomes from across the land plant tree of life indicated that the evolution and diversification of bryophyte genomes—unlike those of vascular plants—are driven in substantial part by ongoing de novo gene innovation and the acquisition of microbial genes. Although bryophyte genomes, on average, contain fewer genes, these genes belong to a wider variety of functional gene families. This genetic diversity likely underpins the resilience of these structurally simple and haploid dominant organisms. It may also explain their enduring presence on land over the past 500 million years, their widespread ecological distribution, and their success in colonizing extreme environments worldwide.

Bryophyte samples were collected from the field in Antarctica, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Germany, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa and the United States, and then maintained in environmental growth chambers. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Herbarium of Shenzhen Fairy Lake Botanical Garden in Shenzhen, China (SZG) and George Safford Torrey Herbarium at the University of Connecticut (CONN). Except for the three hornworts that used axenic cultures (DNA 639, 899 and 902; Supplementary Data 1), all the other bryophytes used field collection materials for DNA extraction and genome sequencing. Bryophytes were cleaned at least thrice with distilled water, and sampled under the dissecting microscope to avoid potential contamination. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted using the FastPure Plant DNA Isolation Mini Kit (Vazyme) and RNA-easy Isolation Reagent (Vazyme), respectively. DNA and RNA quantification and qualification were performed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Our sampling spreads across the bryophyte phylogeny, representing all but 8 (that is, Catoscopiales, Dendrocerotales, Disceliales, Leiosporocerotales, Neohodgsoniales, Oedipodiales, Phymatocerotales and Scouleriales) of the 55 currently recognized orders of extant bryophytes24,63.

DNA libraries for short-read whole-genome sequencing were constructed using the MGIEasy FS DNA Library Prep Set (Item 1000006988) or the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free library preparation kit (Illumina) with 300–500 bp fragment sizes, and sequenced on the MGI-SEQ or Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform to generate 150 bp paired-end reads. Transcriptome libraries were constructed with a TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) with an insert size of 200–400 bp, after polyA selection, and were sequenced for 150 bp paired-end reads on the MGI-SEQ or Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. For long-read sequencing, DNA fragments over 30 kb were selected for library construction, and the library was first end-repaired with NEBNext FFPE Repair Mix (New England Biolabs) and the NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (NEB), and then prepared for sequencing using the SQK_LSK109 Ligation Sequencing Kit. We used the Nanopore PromethION sequencer to generate long reads for 38 species. We generated single-tube long fragment reads (stLFR) and 10x Genomics reads for 85 species. The stLFR library was prepared with the MGIEasy stLFR Library Prep Kit (Item 1000005622) and sequenced with MGI-SEQ. The 10x Genomics Chromium Genome libraries were prepared with Chromium Genome Reagent Kit (v2 Chemistry) following the manufacturer's protocols and sequenced on an MGI-SEQ platform. Hi-C libraries were generated using DpnII restriction enzymes following in situ ligation protocols, and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform to generate 150-bp reads. We also prepared MethylC-seq libraries according to the protocol described in ref. 64 and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform to generate 150-bp reads.

The whole-genome sequencing short paired reads were filtered with TRIMMOMATIC v0.39 (ref. 65) to remove duplicates, low-quality reads and adaptors. The quality-controlled reads were further filtered with GC content (Supplementary Fig. 20) to remove aberrant reads, and the filtered reads were used for k-mer analyses to estimate the genome size. JELLYFISH v2.3.0 (ref. 66) and KMERFREQ67 were used to count the k-mer frequencies with parameters ‘-m -C'. GENOMESCOPE v2.0 (ref. 68) was used to estimate genome size with ‘-p 1' and other parameters with default settings.

Nanopore long reads were assembled with NEXTDENOVO v2.4.0 (https://github.com/Nextomics/NextDenovo) with the parameter ‘seed_cutoff = 45'. RACON v1.4.7 (ref. 69) and PILON v1.23 (ref. 70) were then used to polish the assembled contigs with nanopore long reads and short reads, respectively. For stLFR data, STLFR2SUPERNOVA pipeline was used to assemble the stLFR reads into scaffolds with default parameters. SUPERNOVA v2.1.1 (ref. 71) was used to assemble the 10× genomics reads with the default parameters (Supplementary Fig. 21).

Raw Hi-C reads were first filtered by TRIMMOMATIC v0.39 (ref. 65) with default parameters (Supplementary Fig. 22). JUICER v1.6 (ref. 72) was then used to extract valid data. The 3D-DNA pipeline v180922 (ref. 73) was used to correct, anchor, order and orient the misassembled contigs based on the cross-linked Hi-C data (Supplementary Fig. 22). The JUICEBOX ASSEMBLY TOOLS v1.11.08 (ref. 74) was used to manually adjust the mis-joins, translocations and inversions (for results, see Supplementary Fig. 23).

The draft genome assemblies were filtered for potential contaminants. We first performed BLASTN75 search for the sequences with an e-value threshold of 1 × 10−5 (Supplementary Fig. 22). The National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI's) nucleotide collection and nonredundant protein sequences (nt/nr database, released in May 2020) were used as the BLAST reference databases. The taxonomic affiliations were assigned to each BLAST hit. In detail, sequences from the draft assemblies were queried (BLAST) against the nt database, and scaffolds with resultant sites with more than 50% hits on non-Embryophyta (calculated by sites getting hits on non-Embryophyta/sites getting any hits in nt database) were removed. Then, the retained scaffolds were further queried against the nr database with DIAMOND v0.9.25 (ref. 76) using BLASTX, and scaffolds with resultant sites with more than 75% hit on non-Embryophyta (calculated by sites getting hits on non-Embryophyta/sites getting any hits in nr database) were removed. Mitochondrial and plastid sequences were removed by performing BLASTN search against organellar sequences from three model bryophytes (that is, M. polymorpha, P. patens and Anthoceros angustus). To evaluate the reliability of the decontamination pipeline, we compared the GC-depth distribution of the draft and the clean assemblies with a sliding window size of 10 kb, and the results indicated that the decontamination pipeline is effective (Supplementary Fig. 20).

For repeat annotation, we customized a de novo repeat library with homology-based approach. PILER v0.4.1 (ref. 77), LTR_FINDER v1.0.5 (ref. 78), REPEATSCOUT v1.0.5 (ref. 79) and REPEATMODELER v2.0 (ref. 80) were used to create a custom repeat library, which was then used for de novo repeat identification. REPEATMASKER v4.1.2 was then used for homology-based repeat identification against the Repbase database81. To calculate the insertion time of LTRs, LTR_STRUC82 was used to extract the complete 5′ and 3′ ends of the LTR elements. DISTMAT from EMBOSS v6.5.7.0 (ref. 83) was then used to calculate the K value of the retrotransposons' 5′-LTR and 3′-LTR sequences. Finally, the insertion time (T) of LTRs was calculated by the formula T = K/2r, where r is the average substitution rate of 9.4 × 10−9 substitutions per year per synonymous site84. The BRAKER v2.1.5 (ref. 85) pipeline was applied for gene structure annotation after repeat masking, by integrating the transcriptome-based, homology-based and ab initio evidence. Protein sequences of six green plants (that is, Arabidopsis thaliana, Azolla filiculoides, M. polymorpha, P. patens, Salvinia cucullata and Selaginella moellendorffii) retrieved from the Phytozome v13 database (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/) were used as the homology-based evidence. To evaluate the completeness of the assemblies, we conducted BUSCO v5.3.2 (ref. 86) assessment on the assemblies against the Viridiplantae_odb10 database.

For gene functional annotation, the annotated protein sequences were aligned against the KEGG (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and SWISSPROT (https://www.uniprot.org/) databases by NCBI BLASTP75 with an e value of 1 × 10−5. Protein domains were predicted with INTERPROSCAN v5.51-85.0 (ref. 87). Cluster of orthologous groups functional categories were used for functional annotation and classification of genes using the EGGNOG-MAPPER online server88,89 (Supplementary Fig. 24).

To identify the methylation pattern of bryophytes, the pair-end reads generated by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) were mapped to the corresponding representative genomes using BISMARK v0.23.1 (ref. 90). Methylated cytosines (C) of CG, CHG and CHH were extracted using bismark_methylation_extractor under ‘—CX_context –comprehensive' parameters, and only the methylated cytosines covered by at least five reads were used for calculation of the methylation level. The methylation level of CG, CHG and CHH was calculated for each candidate cytosine as the number of mapped methylated reads divided by the number of total mapped reads, that is, mC/(mC + T). For gene methylation analyses, the gene body and gene flanking region (±2 kb) were equally divided into 20 bins, respectively. The weighted methylation level of each bin was calculated using the ‘summed number of mapped methylated reads' divided by the ‘summed number of total mapped reads', that is, (mC1 + mC2 + … + mCn)/(mC1 + mC2 + … + mCn + T1 + T2 + … + Tn).

JCVI v.1.1.8 (ref. 91) was used to generate the dot plot and show the relationship of intragenomic collinear blocks with a cscore cutoff of 0.99 (for results, see Supplementary Fig. 25). Synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) estimates for pairwise comparisons of paralogues located on syntenic blocks were obtained using the Nei–Gojobori method92 implemented in yn00 program of the PAML package93 (for results, see Supplementary Fig. 26).

KSRATES v1.1.1 (ref. 94) was also used for KS-age distributions of paralogues and orthologues for representative bryophyte species as shown in Supplementary Figs. 27–31. The correction of synonymous substitution rates was realized in KSRATES. The maximum number of trios was set to 14, 8 and 7 for the moss, liverwort and hornwort datasets, respectively. An exponential-lognormal mixture model was fitted upon each whole paranome KS-age distribution. I-ADHORE v.3.0.01 (ref. 95) was used to infer anchor pairs for the subsequent KS analysis as required by KSRATES. An anchor KS clustering was performed to categorize anchor pairs into distinct groups, potentially indicating different WGDs. Ten representative moss species were selected to test all candidate WGDs while avoiding redundant species sampling, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 32–36 (for method details, see Supplementary Note 5).

Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on a 54-taxon (Supplementary Data 8), a 190-taxon (Supplementary Data 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2) and a 343-taxon dataset (Supplementary Data 5), respectively. ORTHOFINDER v2.4.0 (ref. 96) was used to generate gene families with all the proteins with default settings. KINFIN v1.0.3 (ref. 97) was used to select the mostly single-copy gene families with default settings. The protein sequences from the selected gene families aligned with MAFFT v5.0 (ref. 98), trimmed for ambiguous portions by GBLOCKS v0.91b99 with -b3 (the least stringent settings with maximum number of contiguous nonconserved positions) set to 8, -b4 (minimum length of a block) set to 5 and -b5 (allowed gap positions) set to half and -b6 (use similarity matrices) set to yes, and subjected to maximum likelihood tree optimization with RAxML v8.2.12 (ref. 100) and ASTRAL v5.7.3 (ref. 101) with the concatenated and coalescent methods. The PROTOGAMMAAUTO model and 200 fast bootstrap replicates were used in the RAxML tree inference method (for alignments and phylogenetic trees, see Figshare repository, https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23528667). PHYPARTS v0.0.1 (ref. 102) was used to map all individual genes to view gene tree incongruences on each node.

For molecular dating analysis, genes with concordant evolutionary histories were selected by SORTADATE v1.0 (ref. 103) and the resulting alignments were concatenated to generate the XML file in BEAUti as implemented in BEAST v2.4.6 (ref. 104). Then we performed the dating analysis with fossil calibrations (Supplementary Data 26) by using the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model and LG + G model with four site-rate categories in BEAST v2.4.6 (ref. 104). Different loci were partitioned, and model parameters were unlinked across different partitions. A starting tree with branch lengths satisfying all fossil prior constraints was generated with TREEPL105. Two independent Markov chains of Monte Carlo analyses of 10,000 M generations with 25% burn-in and sampling every 50,000 generations were carried out to evaluate the credibility of posterior distributions of parameters. Convergence and mixing were assessed to make sure that the effective sample size values of all parameters exceeded 200 using Tracer v.1.5 (ref. 106).

Gene-based pangenome analyses were conducted based on the dataset of 343 Archaeplastida genomes (see Supplementary Data 5 for details). ORTHOFINDER v2.4.0 (ref. 96) was used to generate gene families (orthogroups) with the default inflation value (I = 1.5). ‘Core' gene families were defined as those presented in >80% samples of a lineage, ‘accessory' gene families were defined as those presented in at least two but fewer than 80% of the total samples of a lineage and ‘unique' gene families were defined as those presented in one individual. COUNT107 was used to infer the gene family gains and losses along the tree with the DOLLO PARSIMONY model. A VENN diagram (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) was used to identify unique and shared gene families among the five Archaeplastida groups, that is, algae, tracheophytes, hornworts, liverworts and mosses. BLASTN was used to search the unique genes of M. polymorpha subsp. ruderalis against the noncoding genomic sequences of M. polymorpha subsp. ruderalis and the other three Marchantia (M. polymorpha ssp. polymorpha BR5, M. polymorpha ssp. montivagans SA2 and M. paleacea ssp. diptera MPA) with an e-value threshold setting to 1 × 10−10. For each unique gene of M. polymorpha subsp. ruderalis, those contigs containing the corresponding best hit in the other three Marchantia genomes were extracted and aligned with MAFFT v5.0. The resultant alignments were analyzed in Geneious v10.0.2 (www.geneious.com) to trace the evolutionary history of the unique genes of M. polymorpha subsp. ruderalis. The three M. polymorpha genomes (that is, M. polymorpha subsp. ruderalis, BR5 and SA2) were downloaded from https://marchantia.info/, and the genome of MPA was downloaded from the NCBI database.

Transcription factors of the newly sequenced bryophyte genomes were identified with iTAK v1.6 (ref. 108), and manually curated using phylogenetic and domain information. Genes related to phytohormone-related genes were blasted (e ≤ 1 × 10−5) against the phytohormone genes of Arabidopsis, and manually verified by phylogeny and functional annotation. Other important genes related to the developmental and physiological/biochemical networks that may have facilitated adaptation of plants to the terrestrial environment were mined from the literature and public databases. Genes related to signaling and development of roots/rhizoids, root hairs, lateral roots, vascular tissue and stomata followed ref. 25, genes related to biosynthesis and regulation of the cuticle followed ref. 109, genes related to 3D growth followed ref. 110, genes related to symbiosis followed ref. 111, genes related to leaf development followed ref. 112, genes related to desiccation tolerance followed ref. 113, genes related to cell wall biosynthesis and regulation followed refs. 114,115,116, genes related to regulation and sporopollenin synthesis were mined from ref. 117, genes related to UV protection were mined from the GO database (GO:0009650; UV protection) and from ref. 118, genes related to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid, coumarin, flavonoid, lignin, as well as genes related to plant pathogen interaction, and rhythm were mined from the KEGG pathway and KO database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The corresponding Arabidopsis protein sequences were used as queries and searched against our 190 species dataset with NCBI BLASTP75 with an e-value cutoff of 1 × 10−5 to retrieve homologs. The recovered hits were further filtered with the characteristic PFAM domains of the specific query, with an e value of ≤1 × 10−5 and a coverage >60% of the queries. The gene family of each pathway was imported into COUNT107 to infer the gains and losses of these genes along the phylogenetic tree.

The TPS genes were identified following the method described in ref. 119. The protein sequences were searched against the Pfam-A database locally using HMMER 3.0 (ref. 120) hmmsearch with an e value of 1 × 10−5. Only sequences with the best hits from four HMM profiles that were considered as putative TPS genes are as follows: Terpene_synth_C (PF03936) and TPS N-terminal domain (PF01397), TRI5 (PF06330) and SmMTPSLs (a profile created by using 48 microbial type TPSs identified from S. moellendorffii). All the putative TPS protein sequences were subjected to a BLASTP search against the NCBI's nonredundant database using the default parameters. A TPS was annotated as ‘Microbial TPS-like' (MTPSL) protein if all the top ten best hits were from bacteria and/or fungi or highly similar to SmMTPSLs. Then all the annotated TPS protein sequences were aligned with MAFFT v5.0 (ref. 98), trimmed with TRIMAL v1.4 (ref. 121). The resulting alignment was imported into the program FASTTREE122 to generate a maximum likelihood tree using the JTT model. The plant-type TPSs and MTPSLs were further confirmed and identified on the phylogenetic tree.

The identification of NOD-like receptor genes was described in Supplementary Note 6. Stress experiments and differential gene expression analysis for Physcomitrella patens were detailed in Supplementary Note 7.

A set of 54 representative species of Viridiplantae (Supplementary Data 8) were used for HGT identification. Although we carried out a strict pipeline to decontaminate the bryophyte assemblies (‘Genome assembly, Hi-C scaffolding and decontamination') to avoid potential contaminations, we also applied strict strategies and rigorous analyses to identify HGTs, and remove candidate HGTs residing on small scaffolds, and confirmed that flanking genes are genuine plant genes (Supplementary Fig. 37).

We roughly divided the taxa in the NCBI nr database into the following seven categories according to NCBI taxonomy lineage: bacteria, fungi, archaea, viruses, metazoans, Viridiplantae and other (eukaryote species except fungi, Metazoa and Viridiplantae). We set donor groups to be species from bacteria (excluding cyanobacteria), fungi, archaea, viruses or metazoans. The putative recipient was set to be groups of various taxonomic ranks represented by each sampled species (for example, Streptophyta, Embryophyta, Tracheophyta, Spermatophyta, etc.) and was listed in Supplementary Data 9.

HGT identification in our analyses included the following three main steps: whole-genome screening to identify candidate acquired genes, elimination of contamination and high-confidence HGT filtering. A detailed flowchart of the analyses can be found in Supplementary Fig. 37. To identify HGTs in each species, the protein sequences of each species were used for searching against NCBI nr database (downloaded in December 2021) with the parameter ‘-e-value 1e-5 –outfmt 6 –max_target_seqs 50,000' using NCBI BLASTP75, and then potential HGTs were identified by the methods described in ref. 47. In brief, if the top BLASTP hit belonged to the putative donor group and the number of hits from other groups (excluding the recipient group) exceeded five, the query gene was classified as an HGT candidate. Then, we examined vertical inheritance of neighborhood genes, location of the candidate gene on a large scaffold and distribution of orthologs in closely related taxa to reduce the possibility of a candidate acquired gene being derived from sequence contamination. Finally, to obtain high-confidence HGTs, we used a series of parameters to filter those candidate HGTs which are as follows: the sequence identity between putative donor group and receipt group should be >20%; the species number in donor groups should be >50; except for the recipient groups, the top 50 species of the BLAST result should mainly belong to putative donor groups (bacteria or fungi or archaea or viruses or metazoans); candidate transferred genes with sequence identity over 80 were also carefully checked for homologous genes in closely related taxa; HGTs originating from metazoan should distribute only in Metazoa and the recipient group; and candidate transferred genes identified to be of cyanobacterial origin or acquired before the origin of the recipient group were excluded. The curated HGTs were mapped against the gene family evolution inferred by COUNT based on the 54-species tree.

For each gene potentially acquired through HGT, homologs identified through BLAST searches against our customized database were divided into the following seven categories according to NCBI taxonomy database: bacteria, fungi, archaea, viruses, metazoans, Viridiplantae and other eukaryotic species. These seven categories were then further divided into subgroups of lower taxonomic ranks (Supplementary Data 9). At least one sequence of each subgroup was selected to ensure sufficient and balanced sampling. Subgroups with fewer than three species were manually inspected to exclude sequencing contamination, such as mislabeled sequences in the nr database. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using MAFFT v5.0 (ref. 98) with default settings. Poorly aligned regions and gaps were removed manually or using TRIMAL v1.4 (ref. 121) with parameters ‘-automated1'. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed using IQTREE v2.2.0 (ref. 123), with automatically selected best-fit amino acid substitution model. Branch support values were estimated with 1,000 replicates using ultrafast bootstrapping in IQTREE (-bb 1,000).

To further confirm the function of the FBT gene (fungal body lectin domain PF07367 containing gene), we expressed this gene in vitro and added the FBT protein into the diet of the insects and calculated the growth and survival rates. The full-length coding sequence of the FBT gene from A. sandvicensis was optimized for its codons to improve the expression efficiency in the prokaryotic system, and the optimized sequence was synthesized and ligated to the pET-30a vector. The pET-30a-FBT plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE3) pLysS cells; the resulting strain was used for the expression of recombinant proteins under the control of IPTG-inducible T7 promoter. Overnight grown cultures were diluted 20-fold with fresh 200 ml LB medium and further grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm rotation till the OD600 reached 0.5. The culture was induced by adding 1 mM final concentration of IPTG and incubated at 28 °C for 3–4 h. Cells were then collected and suspended in 20 ml of 50 mM Tris–HCl cold buffer with pH 8, containing 200 mM NaCl, then disrupted by sonication at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000g for 40 min at 4 °C in a centrifuge. The supernatant from the previous step was loaded on a Ni-NTA agarose column pre-equilibrated with Tris–NaCl buffer at 4 °C. The column was washed extensively with Tris–NaCl buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, and the 6xHis-tagged protein was eluted with Tris–NaCl buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. The elution product containing pure protein was washed thrice with Tris–NaCl buffer and concentrated using Centricon (Millipore, PM10). The purified His-tagged protein was detected by western blot using an HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody (HRP-66005); the His-tagged protein is about 20 kDa in size.

The fall warm S. frugiperda and cotton bollworm H. armigera were obtained from the Agricultural Genomics Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences at Shenzhen, and reared on artificial diet124. To avoid cannibalism, larvae were raised separately in a 5.0 cm × 1.5 cm glass tube after the third instar. Two-day-old third instars of S. frugiperda and H. armigera with an average body weight of 5.15 mg per individual and 6.35 mg per individual were used for the experiments. Toxin was added to the diet of the larvae, setting the initial concentration gradient of the toxin treatment to 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 μg ml−1 diet, respectively. Larvae fed with PBS were used as a control. In total, 14 larvae were treated for each group, and three replicates were carried out. The mortalities were recorded 48 h after feeding on a toxin-containing diet. The larvae were weighed (M1) and transferred to the toxin-added diet. Larvae were reweighed 48 h later (M2). The relative growth rate (%) was calculated as ((M2–M1) × 100/M1). Toxin concentration of 4 μg ml−1 diet (corresponding to 0.47 µg toxin per mg larvae weight) caused 97.62% death in H. armigera. However, this FBT toxin did not cause mortality in S. frugiperda, and 8 μg ml−1 concentration of toxin diet (corresponding to 1.5 µg toxin per mg larvae weight) distinctly inhibited the growth rate of the larvae.

To assess the statistical differences in the weight change dynamics of S. frugiperda larvae and the mortality rates of H. armigera larvae between the PBS control and FBT protein treatment groups, we used two-sided Welch's t test. This approach was chosen due to its robustness in handling unequal variances between groups, ensuring reliable comparisons. All analyses were conducted using R version 4.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

All branches are maximally supported by both the ML bootstrap supports and ASTRAL posterior probabilities unless otherwise indicated. Maximum supports by either method were indicated as ‘*', nonsupported branches were indicated as ‘−'. Gene tree conflicts are shown on focal nodes as pie charts indicating concordance (light blue), top conflict (lime green), other conflict (red) and no signal (gray). Quartet supports are shown beside the focal nodes as bar charts, where blue, orange and gray represent quartet supports for the main topology (q1), the first alternative topology (q2) and the second alternative topology (q3), respectively.

Lipid alterations in the brain have been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. To facilitate comparative lipidomic research across brain diseases, we establish a data common named the Neurolipid Atlas that we prepopulated with isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell)-derived lipidomics data for different brain diseases. Additionally, the resource contains lipidomics data of human and mouse brain tissue. Leveraging multiple datasets, we demonstrate that iPS cell-derived neurons, microglia and astrocytes exhibit distinct lipid profiles that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Notably, the Alzheimer disease (AD) risk gene ApoE4 drives cholesterol ester (CE) accumulation specifically in human astrocytes and we also observe CE accumulation in whole-brain lipidomics from persons with AD. Multiomics interrogation of iPS cell-derived astrocytes revealed that altered cholesterol metabolism has a major role in astrocyte immune pathways such as the immunoproteasome and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation. Our data commons, available online (https://neurolipidatlas.com/), allows for data deposition by the community and provides a user-friendly tool and knowledge base for a better understanding of lipid dyshomeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases.

As one of the most lipid-rich organs in our body1, the brain heavily relies on proper lipid homeostasis. Mutations in lipid metabolic genes cause rare but severe juvenile neurodegenerative diseases such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses2 and Niemann Pick type C3. More recently, changes in lipid metabolism have been implicated in common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD)4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Parkinson disease (PD)11,12, Huntington disease13,14,15, spinocerebellar ataxia16, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)17,18 and frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) including primary tauopathies19,20,21,22. Conditions associated with neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis such as aging23, microglial reactivity to demyelination or fibrillar amyloid-β24,25,26, astrocyte reactivity27 and altered sleep cycles28 also appear to disrupt brain lipid metabolism.

Together, these findings strongly indicate that alterations in brain lipid metabolism can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. More importantly, these data suggest that lipid-targeting interventions could be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or even treat neurodegenerative conditions. The exact number of endogenous mammalian lipids is unknown. However, it is likely that thousands of individual lipid species together shape cell specific lipidomes (lipotypes) that dictate cellular function and dysfunction in the brain29. While standardized data repositories for proteomics and transcriptomics data are common30,31,32, they do not currently exist for (neuro)lipidomics data. As a result of lipid complexity and a lack of standardized tools, sufficient detail on the exact lipid species and downstream pathways that contribute to the various neurodegenerative diseases is lacking. Mapping primary disease-associated changes in the human brain lipidome is particularly challenging, as confounders such as aging, diet, postmortem interval and secondary neurodegenerative processes (for example, cell death) strongly affect lipid metabolism. While animal models have been instrumental for our progress in understanding neurodegeneration, they have limited use for the study of lipids, as the human brain lipidome is intrinsically more complex33. Furthermore, while specific brain cell types can be sorted from brain tissue23,25,34, studies of lipid metabolism in the human or rodent brain are typically performed in bulk brain tissue, not capturing cell-type-specific changes, for example, in neurons, astrocytes and microglia. The use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell) technology presents a promising solution to overcome these challenges and enables the study of cell-type-specific regulation of lipid metabolism. Especially in combination with CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing, this technology provides a powerful tool to study how disease-specific mutations and risk variants affect downstream disease phenotypes (for example, amyloid overproduction, pTau levels and α-synuclein levels)35,36,37,38. Furthermore, iPS cell models are scalable, allowing high-throughput drug discovery of lipid-targeting agents7.

To understand genotype–lipid interactions in human brain cells, we developed a standardized pipeline that combines isogenic iPS cell technology and lipidomics analysis capable of quantifying more than 1,000 different lipid species. We also generated a lipidomics data commons, the Neurolipid Atlas (available at https://neurolipidatlas.com/) that allows for user-friendly exploration of (neuro)lipidomics data. For this study, we populated the Neurolipid Atlas with newly generated data from a variety of different human iPS cell-derived disease models and states (AD, PD, ALS and FTDs), as well as novel postmortem human and mouse brain tissue, as benchmarking datasets. Using this pipeline and data analysis tool, we show that human iPS cell-derived neurons (iNeurons), astrocytes (iAstrocytes) and microglia (iMicroglia) have distinct lipid profiles resembling in vivo lipotypes. Through comparative lipidomic profiling of APOE3/3, APOE4/4 and reactive APOE3/3 iAstrocytes, we show that cholesterol esters (CEs) and triacylglycerides (TGs) accumulate in ApoE4 iAstrocytes (as in AD brain) but decrease in reactive astrocytes. Through proteomic and functional characterization, we demonstrate that cholesterol metabolism directly controls astrocyte reactivity, specifically interferon-dependent pathways such as the immunoproteasome and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation. High levels of free cholesterol enhance immune reactivity, whereas cholesterol esterification (increased in ApoE4 astrocytes) buffers immune reactivity. Overall, the Neurolipid Atlas provides a neurolipidomics data repository and research tool for the neuroscience field, forming a cornerstone for future research into cell and (neurodegenerative) disease-specific alterations of lipid metabolism. The presented datasets specifically generated for the launch of the Neurolipid Atlas constitute a large open-access collection of neurolipidomics data. Here, we exemplify the potential of our tool by combing multiple lipidomics datasets to show that altered cholesterol metabolism in ApoE4 astrocytes affects their immune reactivity.

To allow easy exploration, analysis and sharing of brain lipidomics data, we generated a novel resource that we named Neurolipid Atlas (Fig. 1a). This resource consists of two modules, for both of which data were newly generated: one module containing datasets generated from iPS cell-derived brain cells and one module containing data from human and mouse whole-brain tissue (Fig. 1a), as discussed below. To understand lipid changes in human brain cells, we developed a standardized iPS cell lipidomics pipeline capable of quantifying >1,000 lipid species across 16 different classes in a cell-type-specific manner (Fig. 1a). iPS cell-derived brain cells have been robustly shown to resemble in vivo brain cell types at the transcript level (albeit being more immature)39,40,41,42. Whether iNeurons, iAstrocytes and iMicroglia also resemble the in vivo lipidome is not known. Consequently, we differentiated iPS cells from a control iPS cell line (BIONi037-A)43 into glutamatergic iNeurons as detailed by Zhang et al.44, iAstrocytes as described by Fong et al.45 and iMicroglia as described by Haenseler et al.39. We confirmed cell fate and purity with cell-type-specific markers MAP2 (neurons), aquaporin 4 (AQP4; astrocytes) and Iba1 (microglia) (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1a–g). Subsequently, we analyzed the cellular lipidomes using comprehensive, quantitative shotgun lipidomic analysis46,47 and found that iNeurons, iAstrocytes and iMicroglia present with distinct lipid profiles (Fig. 1d–g and Supplementary Fig. 1); individual lipid species are listed in Extended Data Fig. 1h. Additionally, we compared the lipidomics data from our iPS cell-derived brain cells to previously published lipotypes of primary mouse cells isolated from brain tissue48. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were the most abundant lipid class in all cell types. Consistent with mouse brain cells, we observed the highest relative PC and PE levels in iNeurons48 (Fig. 1d,f,g). Moreover, the PC-derived and PE-derived lysophospholipids (LPC and LPE) were most abundant in iNeurons. Sphingomyelins (SMs) were highly abundant in iMicroglia, with lower levels in iAstrocytes and very low levels in iNeurons, similar to freshly isolated murine cells48 (Fig. 1d,f,g). Consistent with mouse data, phosphatidylserine (PS) was most abundant in iMicroglia and iAstrocytes but low in iNeurons48 (Fig. 1d,f,g), while iNeurons had the highest relative levels of ceramides (CERs) (Fig. 1d,f,g). Diacylglyceride (DG) levels were highest in iAstrocytes, as in the published mouse data48. Not in keeping with the mouse data were the relatively high DG levels in our iMicroglia, while phosphatidylglycerol (PG) lipids were relatively low (Fig. 1g)48. Of the lipid classes that were not measured in the previous mouse study, we found that TGs and free fatty acids (FAs) were most abundant in iMicroglia. iAstrocytes had the highest CE stores, in line with the role of astrocytes as a cholesterol supplier for other brain cell types49,50. Overall, these data indicate that iNeurons, iAstrocytes and iMicroglia recapitulate brain cells at not only the transcriptomic and proteomic level but also the lipidomic level. As for the remainder of the manuscript, all lipidomics data are available for exploration, analysis and download through the Neurolipid Atlas (https://neurolipidatlas.com/).

To compare lipid changes in iPS cell models to those seen in vivo, the second module of the Neurolipid Atlas (Fig. 1a) contains multiple new lipidomic datasets from whole human and mouse brain tissue under different disease conditions. While lipid (specifically cholesterol) changes have been frequently implicated in AD51, only few lipidomic studies have been performed on human AD brain tissue4,52,53. We determined the control (N = 13) and AD (N = 20) lipidome across three different brain areas (Fig. 2a). We selected a brain area where AD pathology is abundant (frontal cortex) and an area where pathology is generally lower (cerebellum)54. In addition, within the frontal cortex, we differentiated between gray matter (low in myelin) and white matter (rich in myelin). We found significant regional differences in brain lipid composition (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). White matter from the frontal cortex had high levels of CERs and SM, consistent with the enrichment of these lipids in myelin (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2b)48,55. On the contrary, phospholipid and storage lipid (for example, CE and TG) levels were relatively higher in gray matter from the cerebellum and frontal cortex (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2b). When analyzing age-matched (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) AD versus control brains, principal component analysis (PCA) largely separated control and AD samples in gray and white matter from the frontal cortex but less so in the cerebellum (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). This separation was driven mostly by TG and CE species (Extended Data Fig. 2c). At the class level, we found that CEs were significantly upregulated in AD in gray and white matter from the frontal cortex and trended toward increased levels in the cerebellum (Fig. 2e–g and Extended Data Fig. 2f–m). Analysis at the level of individual lipid species also showed an increase for most CE species (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c) but no single CE specie reached significance, likely reflecting high variation in FA tails of CEs in individuals. In addition, other neutral lipids such as TG (trend in all areas) and DG (significant only for white matter from the frontal cortex) were increased in persons with AD (Fig. 2e–g). Lactosyl-CERs (LacCERs) were also significantly increased in white matter from the AD frontal cortex (Fig. 2e,f). Because astrogliosis is known to be increased in late stages of AD and reactive astrocytes adopt a distinct lipid profile with increased phospholipid saturation27, we tested whether saturated phospholipid species were enriched in AD brain tissue. No consistent changes in phospholipid or TG saturation could be observed in the AD brain (Supplementary Fig. 2d,e). Our results in human AD brain, combined with previous findings in persons with AD4,52,53, strongly suggest that accumulation of neutral lipids (specifically CE) is a key lipidomic hallmark of AD.

All lipid values in this figure are plotted as a percentage of total lipids (raw concentration in Extended Data Fig. 2b,f–j).

With CE accumulation being a key lipid feature of AD, it is important to understand how it might contribute to AD pathogenesis. We previously showed that CE accumulation drives pTau buildup in human neurons7 and others showed that CE buildup alters microglial function after microglia phagocytose cholesterol-rich myelin24,25. While CE levels are highest in human iAstrocytes (Fig. 1), the possible effect of CE accumulation in these cells is unknown. Importantly, astrocytes express high levels of the AD risk gene and cholesterol carrier APOE. A common variant in ApoE, ApoE4, is the major genetic risk factor for AD, which increases the risk for AD from 3–4-fold (heterozygosity) to 14-fold (homozygosity) depending on ethnicity56,57, with even higher reported odds ratios in neuropathologically confirmed cases58. To map how ApoE4 affects the astrocytic lipidome, we differentiated isogenic pairs of APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 iPS cells to iAstrocytes. We selected isogenic pairs from the iPS cell Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI; parental line, Kolf2.1J, APOE3/3; edited lines, APOE4/4 Kolf2.1J C112R hom3 (set 1) and C112R hom2 (set 2))59,60 and a completely independent isogenic set from the European Bank for iPS cells (parental line, BIONi037-A, APOE3/3; edited line, BIONi037-A4, APOE4/4)43, all from Caucasian origin (Fig. 3a). Neither of these isogenic pairs has been characterized by lipidomic and/or proteomic profiling. The ApoE genotype of the iPS cells was confirmed by Sanger sequencing on receipt and after differentiation to astrocytes, as well as after each experiment to verify sample identity (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Successful differentiation to astrocytes was validated by astrocyte marker staining and evaluation of astrocyte marker expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)61 (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d, Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Less secreted ApoE was present in ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 3d), as has been reported in other iAstrocytes and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)5,8,10,62,63. We performed lipidomics on three isogenic pairs using our standardized iPS cell lipidomic pipeline (individual replicates in Fig. 3b–e and Extended Data Fig. 4a–c; group-level results in Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4d). Strikingly, consistently across experiments and lines, we observed an ApoE4-dependent increase in CE (Fig. 3f). This effect was mediated by an increase in all detected CE species (Extended Data Fig. 4e). Multiple TG species were also significantly increased, which resulted in a significant increase at the class level (Fig. 3b–f and Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). TGs containing saturated or monounsaturated FAs and highly polyunsaturated FAs (>5 double bonds) were most upregulated in our ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Fig. 3g). Consistent with higher levels of the neutral storage lipids, lipid droplets were increased in ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3e). SM levels were significantly downregulated in ApoE4 iAstrocytes at both the species and the class level (Fig. 3b–f and Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). The BIONi037 ApoE4 iAstrocytes also showed a strong and consistent increase in LacCER, HexCER and CER species, which was not consistently observed in the Kolf2.1J ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Fig. 3b–f and Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). We did not find evidence for increased saturation of phospholipids in our ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4f), as is typical for reactive astrocytes27. Overall, our data indicate that ApoE4 strongly drives the accumulation of CEs and, to a lesser extent, TGs in human iAstrocytes while decreasing SM levels. Lipidomics data of all isogenic pairs and biological replicates from our ApoE4 and ApoE3 iAstrocytes are available on the Neurolipid Atlas.

Our data show that ApoE4 increases CE levels in human iAstrocytes. To understand the functional consequence, we performed proteomic and transcriptomic analysis on our ApoE4 versus ApoE3 iAstrocytes (BIONi037 and Kolf2.1J set 1) (Figs. 3a and 4a–c). Notably, the proteomics and lipidomics were performed on the same batch of iAstrocytes (Methods) to allow for multiomic integration. We found 348 and 959 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in Kolf2.1J and BIONi037 ApoE4 iAstrocytes, respectively (Fig. 4a–c and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). ApoE was among these DEPs, showing downregulation in the ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Fig. 4d). We focused our analysis on proteins that were either downregulated or upregulated in both ApoE4 lines (Fig. 4e,f). Through overrepresentation analysis (ORA), we found that cell adhesion (for example, NCAM1 interactions and integrin cell surface interactions) and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related pathways (for example, collagen chain trimerization and ECM proteoglycans) were upregulated by ApoE4 in both isogenic lines (Fig. 4e). On the contrary, immune pathways (for example, immunoregulatory interactions between a lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell, MHC I antigen presentation and interferon signaling) were downregulated (Fig. 4f). This includes the term ‘endosomal/vacuolar pathway', which contained mainly MHC terms (Fig. 4f). Strikingly, proteins in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway were consistently downregulated, as were immunoproteasome subunits, two pathways directly downstream of interferon signaling (Fig. 4g). As a confirmatory readout, we stained against human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) class I and transporters associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1) and 2 (TAP2) and confirmed downregulation by western blot (Fig. 4h,i and Extended Data Fig. 5c). Decreases in HLA were also confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4j,k and Extended Data Fig. 5d) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4l,m and Supplementary Fig. 4). To be able to compare our results to previous transcriptomic studies with different ApoE4 iAstrocytes8,10, we also performed transcriptomic analysis (Extended Data Fig. 6a–f). Through unbiased gene set enrichment analysis, the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway was also found to be downregulated by ApoE4 at the transcriptome level in the BIONi037 isogenic set (Extended Data Fig. 6c), which additionally showed downregulation of interleukin and interferon immune signaling pathways, the complement cascade and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) phagosome transport, whereas translation-related terms were upregulated, as was the lipid droplet marker perilipin 2 (Plin2) (Extended Data Fig. 6c,f). When comparing to transcriptomics from other ApoE4 lines, downregulation of the interferon pathway was consistent in all ApoE4 isogenic and case–control sets from Lin et al.8 and Tcw et al.10 and trended similarly in our Kolf2.1J set (Fig. 4n,o and Extended Data Fig. 6e,g). Changes in other pathways such as the complement cascade and translation initiation were observed but the direction of change was highly variable across lines (Fig. 4n and Discussion). Overall, these data show that the ApoE4 genotype decreases ApoE levels, drives CE accumulation and inhibits interferon signaling-dependent pathways such as MHC class I antigen presentation and the immunoproteasome in human iAstrocytes.

The reduction in interferon-dependent pathways is striking, as ApoE4 is thought to enhance, not decrease, immune signaling, as astrogliosis is a key hallmark of end-stage AD5,10,64,65,66,67. Yet, our data clearly demonstrate a consistent reduction in the expression of proteins in these pathways, including five class I leukocyte antigens (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-E and HLA-F) and all specific subunits of the immunoproteasome (PSMB8, PSMB9 and PSMB10) (Fig. 4). To better understand our lipidomic and proteomic findings in the context of astrocyte immune function, we also performed multiomic analysis of reactive (treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and complement component 1q (C1q)) iAstrocytes (Kolf2.1J and BIONi037-A) (Fig. 5a). By comparing the lipidomic dataset of ApoE4 versus ApoE3 and ApoE3 versus ApoE3 reactive iAstrocytes, we found that neutral lipids were oppositely regulated (Figs. 3f and 5b,c). Whereas CEs and TGs were increased in ApoE4 iAstrocytes, they were strongly downregulated in reactive astrocytes at the species (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 7a) and class (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7b) levels. Cholesterol secretion was increased in reactive iAstrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Interestingly, LacCER was increased in both reactive iAstrocytes and ApoE4 iAstrocytes, as well as in AD brain (Figs. 2e,f and 5c). Saturated phospholipids were increased in reactive iAstrocytes (Fig. 5d) in contrast to our ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4f). This increase in saturated phospholipids was also reported in reactive mouse astrocytes27. To directly compare how the effect of astrocyte reactivity on the lipidome is conserved across species, we also tested how treatment with TNF, IL-1α and C1q affected the lipidome of mouse astrocytes (under different culture conditions) (Extended Data Fig. 8a–f). In keeping with the human iAstrocytes, reactivity strongly decreased CE and TG levels in mouse astrocytes across culturing paradigms while increasing saturated phospholipid levels (Extended Data Fig. 8c–e). However, the increase in LacCER and HexCER was not observed in mouse astrocytes and, thus, seemed specific to the human astrocytes (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 8c–e). To confirm the effect of reactivity on CE and TG levels (decrease) and LacCER and HexCER levels (increase) in human iAstrocytes, lipidomics was performed on another completely independent parental line (WTC11, M.K. lab) (Extended Data Fig. 7e–g), where the same effect was observed, indicating a robust human astrocyte lipidomic response. While ApoE4 iAstrocytes at baseline have higher CE and TG levels (Fig. 3), stimulation of ApoE4 iAstrocytes with TNF, IL-1α and C1q still reduced CE and TG levels and increased MHC I levels indicating that the ApoE4 effect can be overcome by a strong proinflammatory stimulus (Extended Data Fig. 7h–j). In these lines, an increase in LacCER and HexCER was also observed (Extended Data Fig. 7h). To test whether the decrease in CE and TG lipids in reactive astrocytes was coupled to increased HLA-reactivity, we performed proteomics on the reactive iAstrocytes (Fig. 5e–i). We found 431 and 469 DEPs in Kolf2.1J and BIONi037 reactive iAstrocytes, respectively (Fig. 5e–g). We focused our analysis on proteins that were upregulated or downregulated by reactivity in both lines (Fig. 5h,i and Extended Data Fig. 9a). ORA did not identify any significant downregulated pathways (Extended Data Fig. 9a). However, the top upregulated pathways (Fig. 5h) were the endosome and vacuolar pathway, immunoregulatory interactions between a lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell, MHC I antigen presentation and interferon signaling, pathways that were all downregulated in ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Fig. 4f). Beyond these terms, analysis showed that virtually all immune upregulated proteins in reactive iAstrocytes were downregulated in the ApoE4 versus ApoE3 iAstrocytes at baseline (Fig. 5j, bottom, and Extended Data Fig. 9b,c) and opposite to CE and TG effects (Fig. 5j, top). Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that MHC class I levels (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) were indeed increased in reactive iAstrocytes (Fig. 5k). Overall, our results indicate that ApoE4 and reactive iAstrocytes have opposing lipidomic and proteomic phenotypes. CEs and TGs are upregulated in ApoE4 astrocytes but downregulated in reactive iAstrocytes, whereas interferon signaling-dependent pathways, the immunoproteasome and MHC class I are downregulated in ApoE4 iAstrocytes but upregulated in reactive iAstrocytes (Fig. 5l).

On the basis of the reduction in CEs in reactive iAstrocytes but increase in ApoE4 iAstrocytes, we hypothesized that changes in cholesterol metabolism might directly contribute to immune phenotypes. Using proteomic analysis, we also found that a specific cluster of cholesterol synthesis genes were upregulated in reactive iAstrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 10a). To test whether cholesterol regulates immune reactivity in human iAstrocytes, we treated Kolf2.1J and BIONi037 control (ApoE3) iAstrocytes with cholesterol (Fig. 6a–e). Both MHC class I presentation and IL-6 secretion were significantly increased after cholesterol treatment (Fig. 6c,d). CEs are generated through conjugation of free cholesterol to an FA by acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs). The combined addition of cholesterol with the ACAT inhibitor avasimibe further increased IL-6 secretion, indicating that CE formation buffered the immune reactivity mediated by cholesterol treatment (Extended Data Fig. 10b). We also found that RNA levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), a master regulator of MHC class I pathway gene expression, and HLA-B were upregulated by exogenous cholesterol (Extended Data Fig. 10c), indicating that the effect of cholesterol on these pathways might be transcriptionally mediated. Moreover, the addition of cholesterol to astrocytes was sufficient to increase saturated phospholipid levels indicative of astrocyte reactivity (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 10d–h). Exogenous cholesterol also potentiated immune reactivity (as measured by MHC class I levels and IL-6 secretion) of iAstrocytes treated with TNF, IL-1α and C1q (Fig. 6f–h). Conversely, pretreatment with atorvastatin (to reduce cholesterol levels) inhibited MHC class I upregulation and IL-6 secretion upon iAstrocyte reactivity (Fig. 6f–h). Lastly, we found that the addition of free cholesterol rescued MHC I expression and IL-6 secretion in the ApoE4 iAstrocytes (Fig. 6i,j). Overall, our data indicate that cholesterol is a major regulator of MHC class I antigen presentation and immune reactivity in human astrocytes and dysregulated cholesterol metabolism by ApoE4 impairs astrocyte immune reactivity (Fig. 6k).

While repositories for RNA and proteomics datasets are common in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, similar resources are currently lacking for (neuro)lipidomics data. To standardize and allow exploration of data without prior bioinformatics knowledge, we generated an online lipidomics browser (Fig. 7), Neurolipid Atlas (https://neurolipidatlas.com/). This browser includes all data presented above, as well as (un)published lipidomics data generated together with a large group of collaborators, currently totaling more than 70 datasets over four neurodegenerative diseases and multiple treatment conditions (Supplementary Table 1). All current datasets in the Neurolipid Atlas (and in the figures of the manuscript) were newly generated for this manuscript, except for the ALS datasets that were recently published18. New datasets from our lab and our collaborators will be uploaded to the database in a continuous manner. Labs can contribute their neurolipidomics data to our resource (‘upload dataset') by providing annotated lipidomics data in line with LipidMaps shorthand notation68, a metadata sheet (methods provided on the website) and a short description of the dataset. All data will be quality-controlled (QCed) and curated by the Neurolipid Atlas team, including checking compliance with Lipidomics Standards Initiative69, before it is published online. All datasets require a digital object identifier (DOI) from the associated preprint or publication or (for unpublished data) a DOI generated through the lipidomics minimal reporting checklist69. The Neurolipid Atlas currently includes Lipidyzer data analyzed by Shotgun Lipidomics Assistant (SLA) software47 but other pipelines will also be accommodated. All neuro-related data are welcomed, including iPS cell models, as well as human and animal model brains and cerebrospinal fluid. Contact information, including for information on data uploads, can be found online (https://neurolipidatlas.com/). The Neurolipid Atlas allows for the download of all raw data and metadata, as well as in-browser analysis, which includes QC, blank filtering, normalization and the generation and customization of figures. A link to all datasets is included on the homepage. Datasets can be searched for by name, cell type, genotype, treatment type, parental line or contributing lab. Using the ‘explore dataset with SODA data browser' link, users can explore independent replicate experiments and visualize changes at the lipid class level (bar graphs) or at the species level (volcano plots, heat maps, PCA and FA analysis) and interact with the data by hovering over different lipid species. All figures and their source data can be downloaded. A comprehensive ‘quick start' guide is available on the Neurolipid Atlas homepage (https://neurolipidatlas.com/) to help users navigate the data, while a detailed manual outlining all analysis and visualization options is included with each dataset in the help section.

Lipid metabolism is affected and implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,22,24,25. Here, we generated a new resource, the Neurolipid Atlas, to facilitate insights into lipid changes associated with different neurodegenerative diseases in a disease-specific and cell-type-specific manner. Leveraging multiple datasets, we demonstrate that iNeurons, iMicroglia and iAstrocytes exhibit distinct lipid profiles that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Notably, the AD risk gene ApoE4 drives CE accumulation in human iAstrocytes and CE accumulation is also observed in the human AD brain. Subsequently, through an integrated multiomics approach, we show that CE accumulation in ApoE4 iAstrocytes represses their immune function, specifically interferon pathways, MHC class I antigen presentation and immunoproteasome pathways.

Our findings further consolidate the notion that CE accumulation is a major pathogenic hallmark of AD4,52,53. CEs in CSF were shown to correlate with progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD70. CE accumulation in neurons drives pTau accumulation and Aβ overproduction7,71,72,73. Accumulation of CEs has also been detected in microglia upon TREM2 or ApoE loss25 and inhibition of CE formation improved Aβ clearance74. In ApoE4 oligodendrocytes, CE accumulation led to perturbed neuronal myelination75. We show that ApoE4 iAstrocytes exhibit increased CE accumulation and this altered cholesterol metabolism impairs their immune function, including suppression of the MHC class I pathway. Our data show that CEs accumulate in both white and gray matter of the frontal cortex, which indicates that cells other than solely myelinating oligodendrocytes75 contribute to this phenotype. Secondary neurodegenerative processes (protein aggregation, neuronal death and demyelination) and CE accumulation in microglia might be a possible explanation for the observed CE accumulation in persons with AD24,25,26. Yet, our finding that the AD genetic risk factor ApoE4 strongly drives CE accumulation in astrocytes in the absence of pathology indicates that CE accumulation might not merely be a downstream effect of neurodegeneration but rather directly downstream of AD risk genes. How CEs accumulate in ApoE4 astrocytes needs further investigation but could involve altered import and export of cholesterol or changes in lysosomal lipid clearance76. Increases in TG levels were reported in the aging mouse brain23 and we and others9 also observed an increase in TGs in ApoE4 iAstrocytes and a trend toward increased TG levels in the AD brain (Fig. 2).

We confirm previous reports that ApoE4 increases levels of polyunsaturated TGs9,77 but also find an increase in monounsaturated and saturated TG levels (Fig. 3g). Importantly, ApoE4 iAstrocytes do not show the increase in saturated phospholipids typical for reactive astrocytes27 (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Overall, our data show that ApoE4 and AD present a unique lipotype that is primarily characterized by strong CE accumulation and changes in TGs and SM. To better understand how CE contributes to AD pathogenesis in vivo (through astrocyte immune repression and/or in other cell types), it will be important to define which cell types accumulate CE and how this accumulation potentially alters their function.

As the strongest genetic risk factor for AD (ApoE) is highly expressed in astrocytes, there is an urgent need to understand how the AD risk variant ApoE4 affects astrocytes. Here, we provide a characterization of isogenic APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 iAstrocytes from the iNDI line Kolf2.1J, which we hope will serve as a reference for the field. We also provide a full characterization of a second isogenic pair of iAstrocytes (BIONi037, EBISC). As astrogliosis is a major feature of end-stage AD78,79,80,81, we were very surprised to find major immune pathways such as interferon signaling, the immunoproteasome and MHC class I antigen presentation to be downregulated in ApoE4 iAstrocytes. To place this in context, we also generated the first lipidomic and proteomic analysis of reactive human iAstrocytes treated with TNF, IL-1α and C1q. We confirmed that reactive human iAstrocytes, as in mice27, also increase phospholipid saturation (Extended Data Fig. 8). Strikingly, the top upregulated proteomic pathways in our reactive iAstrocytes were interferon pathways including MHC class I. Furthermore, CE and TG were downregulated in reactive astrocytes but upregulated in ApoE4 astrocytes (Fig. 5j). The results provide strong evidence that ApoE4 intrinsically inhibits rather than activates astrocyte immune function. These results fit with recent reports in AD mice showing decreased immune function of ApoE4 microglia, including reduced antigen presentation82,83. Interestingly, human stem-cell-derived microglia xenotransplanted into APPNL-G-F mice were shown to transition into a human-specific HLA-expressing state and ApoE4 selectively reduced the proportion of cells acquiring this HLA phenotype84. In line with this, an AD-protective variant in PLCg2 (PLCg2-P522R) was recently shown to reduce CE accumulation in iMicroglia24 while increasing microglial MHC I levels and providing benefit through increased recruitment of T cells85. On the basis of these data, the presence of a similar ApoE4–cholesterol–immune axis in microglia, as we identified here for astrocytes, is likely but needs to be confirmed. Overall, these findings (including ours in human brain cells) indicate that ApoE4 intrinsically limits immune reactivity rather than inducing immune activation. This could indicate that the immune reactivity (of astrocytes and microglia) is needed to stave off AD and restoration (or activation) of glial activity in ApoE4 carriers might prevent AD pathogenesis. With current technologies, the hypothesis that ApoE4 suppresses glial immune reactivity before AD onset is difficult to validate in humans as postmortem material normally reflects late disease states. It would, therefore, be highly relevant to evaluate, for example, immunoproteasome levels, MHC class I expression and lipid levels in healthy ApoE4 carriers early in life, such as trough tissue obtained from normal-pressure hydrocephalus biopsies86. The exact pathway connecting cholesterol levels to interferon pathways, the immunoproteasome and MHC class I antigen presentation also needs more study. Processes such as demyelination or phagocytosis of neuronal debris could contribute to increasing levels of cholesterol in astrocytes in the AD brain. Our data indicate that cholesterol can increase IRF1 levels, which is a master regulator of MHC class I expression. Cholesterol might intersect with interferon signaling at the plasma membrane in lipid rafts87,88 or through interactions with the cGAS–STING pathway89,90,91. However, our study here clearly shows that ApoE4 affects glial immune function and that this effect is mediated by ApoE4-induced changes in glial lipid metabolism and storage.

In vitro growth and medium composition are major regulators of lipid metabolism; hence, it was striking to see that iPS cell-derived brain cells largely recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Specifically, for our iAstrocytes, the astrocytes were differentiated in medium consisting of serum that contains protein and lipid factors that are not present in the brain parenchyma under healthy conditions but penetrate the brain when the blood–brain barrier is impaired (such as in aging or AD92,93,94). To limit possible confounding effects of serum in the medium, we removed serum from our iAstrocytes during terminal experiments. In addition, we were able to recapitulate major reactive phenotypes in mature astrocytes isolated from mouse brain that were isolated and cultured without any serum (Extended Data Fig. 8). Our study also highlights significant variability across ApoE4 effects depending on the parental line in which the mutation is introduced (lipidomics effects in Fig. 3; proteomic and transcriptomic differences in Fig. 4). The effect of ApoE4 genotype is likely affected by genetic context, such as haplotype, gender or ethnicity. The variation between parental lines might be biologically meaningful. However, more studies with a higher number of isogenic sets will be required to address these questions. For the interpretation of our data, here, we focused on lipid classes (CE and TG) and Reactome pathways that were changed consistently across all isogenic sets and, where possible (for example, transcriptomics data), we compared our findings to previously published isogenic lines. We found that interferon signaling, MHC class I antigen presentation and ER–phagosome pathways were downregulated in ApoE4 iAstrocytes from all these studies (Fig. 4), indicating a robust and likely genetic context-independent effect of ApoE4 on the suppression of these immune pathways.

Overall, our data highlight the important role of lipid (particularly cholesterol) metabolism in AD. We created a new tool (the Neurolipid Atlas) as a resource of neurolipidomic datasets for different cell types, mutations, neurodegenerative diseases and model organisms. As a proof of concept, we show that iNeurons, iAstrocytes and iMicroglia have distinct lipidomes that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Our data solidify the link between AD and cholesterol, further establishing CE accumulation as a hallmark of AD. Lastly, we show that cholesterol regulates astrocytic immune function, which is impaired by the genetic AD risk variant ApoE4. We will continue to grow the Neurolipid Atlas database and invite other researchers to upload their data as well, working toward a detailed understanding of the role that lipids have in brain health and disease.

Isogenic Kolf2.1J (APOE3/3), Kolf2.1J C112R Hom3 (APOE4/4 set 1) and Kolf2.1J C112R Hom2 (APOE4/4 set 2) human iPS cells were a kind gift from iNDI (donor: 57-year-old man). Kolf2.1J C112R Hom2 (APOE4/4 set 2) corresponds to JIPSC001142 available through iNDI. Isogenic BIONi037-A (APOE3/3) and BIONi037-A4 (APOE4/4) human iPS cell lines were obtained through EBISC (donor: 77-year-old woman). iPS cells were cultured in six-well plates precoated with 120–180 µg ml−1 Geltrex (Fisher Scientific, A1413302) in Gibco Essential 8 medium (E8; Fisher Scientific, 15190617) + 0.1% penicillin and streptomycin (P/S; Fisher Scientific, 11548876), with daily full medium refreshments. iPS cell colonies grown until 90% confluency were dissociated using 1 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, 15575-038) in 1× PBS (VWR, 392-0434) and replated in E8 medium supplemented with 5 μM ROCK inhibitor (RI; Tebu-Bio, Y27632). The genomic integrity of iPS cell lines was periodically tested using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, as described below. In addition, cell cultures were regularly tested for Mycoplasma contamination.

DNA from cell cultures was isolated using a ReliaPrep genomic DNA tissue miniprep system (Promega, A2052). Samples were processed by the Global Screening Array (GSA) Consortium Project at Erasmus MC Rotterdam on the Illumina GSA beadchip GSA MD version 1. SNP data were processed and annotated with Illumina GenomeStudio software (Illumina). The iPsychCNV package was used for copy-number variant (CNV) calling, which integrates B allele frequency distribution and log R ratio to reduce false-positive detection (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.46235)95. CNVs larger than 25 kB and containing more than 100 SNPs were flagged and compared to gene lists associated with brain development and synapse Gene Ontology terms. In addition, DNA from iAstrocytes in each experiment was isolated to confirm the APOE genotype.

NGN2 transcription-based iPS cell differentiation to neurons was according to a previous study44. iPS cells were infected in suspension (in E8 + RI) with ultrahigh-titer lentiviral particles provided by ALSTEM, encoding pTet-O-Ngn2-puro (Addgene, 52047) and FUΔGW-rtTa (Addgene, 19780). To start neuronal induction, 100,000 infected iPS cells per cm2 were plated in N2-supplemented medium (DMEM/F12 + GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 31331093), 3 g L−1 d-glucose (Thermo Fisher, A2494001), 1% N2 supplement B (StemCell Technologies, 07156) and 0.1% P/S) supplemented with 5 µM RI, 2 μg ml−1 doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich, D9891) and dual SMAD inhibitors (100 nM LDN193189 (Stemgent, 04-0074), 10 μM SB431542 (Tebu-Bio, T1726) and 2 μM XAV939 (Sigma-Aldrich, X3004)). On day 2, 100% of the medium was refreshed (including all day 1 supplements except RI) and 3 µg ml−1 puromycin was added (Cayman Chemical, 13884-25). On day 3, 100% medium was exchanged for N2-supplemented medium with doxycycline hyclate, puromycin and 10 µM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma-Aldrich, F0503). Six-well plates were coated with 20 µg ml−1 poly(l-ornithine) (PLO; Sigma-Aldrich, P3655) overnight at room temperature (RT), followed by three wash steps with PBS on day 4. PLO-coated wells were subsequently coated with 5 µg ml−1 laminin (lam; BioTechne, 3400-010-02) for 2–4 h at 37 °C. iNeurons were washed with 1× PBS before dissociation with Accutase (Merck, SCR005) for 5 min at 37 °C. iNeurons were collected in DMEM (VWR, 392-0415P) and pelleted by a 5-min spin at 180g. iNeurons were resuspended and plated at 600,000 cells per well in PLO–lam-coated six-well plates in Neurobasal medium (NBM; Fisher Scientific, 11570556), supplemented with 200 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 35050038), 3 g L−1 d-glucose (Thermo Fisher, A2494001), 0.5% nonessential amino acids (NEAA; Fisher Scientific, 11350912), 2% B27 (Fisher Scientific, 17504044), 0.1% P/S, 10 ng ml−1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor (StemCell Technologies, 17189321), 10 ng ml−1 ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; Peprotech, 450-13) and 10 ng ml−1 glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (StemCell Technologies, 78058.3). iNeurons were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and medium was replaced with 50% fresh medium once a week.

The purity of iNeuronal cultures was assessed by determining the percentage of MAP2-positive cells in culture. Columbus version 2.5.2 (PerkinElmer) was used to detect intact nuclei and quantify MAP2 signal intensity in a 6-μm ring around the nucleus. The MAP2-positive neuron population was determined as the percentage of MAP2-positive cells with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) > 3. The SNR indicates the s.d. of the signal above the mean background signal and was calculated by subtracting the mean of the background from the MAP2 signal in the ring region around the nucleus and dividing the result by the s.d. of the mean background signal.

iPS cells were differentiated to neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) according to a previous study96. On day 1, iPS cells were plated at 100% density in six-well plates in NMM medium (50% DMEM/F12 + GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 31331093), 50% NBM, 100 mM GlutaMAX, 0.5% N2 supplement B, 1% B27, 0.5% ITS-A (Thermo Scientific, 51300044), 0.5% NEAA, 0.08% 2-mercaptoethanol (Fisher Scientific, 11528926) and 1% P/S supplemented with 10 µM SB431542 and 0.5 µM LDN193189. Complete medium was replaced daily for 7 days. On day 8, cells were expanded to PLO–lam-coated 6-cm dishes. Then, 1 ml of EDTA per well was added after one PBS wash and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 min. Cells were collected in clumps using a cell scraper and plated in 5 ml of complete NMM medium supplemented with 5 μM RI. On day 9, medium was exchanged for plain NMM medium without inhibitors after one PBS wash. This medium was refreshed daily for two more days. On day 12, the medium was exchanged for NMM medium supplemented with 10 ng ml−1 fibroblast growth factor (FGF; Peprotech, 100-18B). This medium was refreshed daily for two more days. On day 15, cells were incubated in Accutase after one PBS wash for 5 min at 37 °C and collected in NMM + 5 µM RI. After a 5-min spin at 1,000 rpm, the pellet was resuspended in NMM supplemented with FGF and RI before plating the NPC cells (passage 1, P1) in two PLO–lam-coated 10-cm dishes. The medium was refreshed daily with NMM + FGF for the next 3 days. NPCs were maintained at high density and refreshed every 2–3 days. NPCs were plated for control stainings (Nestin/Pax6) at P4 to confirm NPC identity, after which astrocyte differentiation was started according to Fong et al.45. One confluent 10-cm dish of NPCs was washed with 1× PBS before adding 9 ml of NMM + FGF. Cells were collected in clumps by cell scraper and transferred at 3 ml per well to a noncoated six-well plate. Plates were placed on an orbital shaker (90 rpm) in a 37 °C incubator. After 24 h, when tiny neurospheres had formed, 5 µM RI was added per well. Then, 48 h later, the medium was changed back to NMM without FGF. Next, 1 week after cell scraping of the NPCs, the NMM medium was exchanged for astrocyte medium (AM; ScienCell, 1801); subsequently, the medium was refreshed three times a week for the next 2 weeks. Neurospheres from three wells were collected and plated in one PLO–lam-coated 10-cm dish. iAstrocytes differentiated from the neurospheres were passaged to uncoated 10-cm dishes using Accutase and maintained in AM + 2% FBS (ScienCell, 1801/0010) until P4. iAstrocytes were plated for experiments when they were between P4 and P12. Columbus version 2.5.2 (PerkinElmer) was used to detect intact nuclei and quantify AQP4 and vimentin intensity in each cell. The purity of the astrocyte population was determined as the percentage of cells with an SNR > 3 over the secondary antibody control. The SNR indicates the s.d. of the signal above the secondary antibody control and was calculated by subtracting the mean of the secondary antibody signal from the AQP4 or vimentin mean intensity per cell and dividing the result by the s.d. of the mean secondary antibody signal.

iMic were generated according to a previous study39, with small modifications. In brief, iPS cells were detached with Accutase (Gibco) and collected as a single-cell suspension. After centrifugation (5 min, 300g, RT), 2.5 million cells were plated into 24-well AggreWell800 plates (StemCell Technologies; pretreated with anti-adherence rinsing solution) in 2 ml of embryoid body (EB) induction medium (mTeSR+ (StemCell Technologies) + 20 ng ml−1 stem cell factor (R&D Systems) + 50 ng ml−1 bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4; Miltenyi) + 50 ng ml−1 vascular endothelial growth factor (Miltenyi), supplemented with 10 μM Y27632 (StemCell Technologies) for the first 24 h) per well to generate EBs. To allow the formation of EBs, cells remained in AggreWell plates with daily 75% medium changes for 5 days. After 5 days, EBs were isolated and equally distributed to two six-well plates (Corning) in 2 ml of EB differentiation medium (X-Vivo 15 (Lonza), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco), 0.55 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 100 U per ml and 100 μg ml−1 P/S (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 25 ng ml−1 IL-3 (Miltenyi Biotec) and 100 ng ml−1 macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Miltenyi Biotec)) per well. The EBs were kept in EB differentiation medium at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 with full medium changes every 7 days. After 2–3 weeks, nonadherent microglial precursor cells (pre-iMics) started to be released into the medium from EBs. Pre-iMics were isolated during regular medium changes by collecting the supernatant medium and straining through a 40-µm cell strainer (Greiner). Pre-iMics isolated in weeks 3–6 after emergence were pooled and sustained in EB differentiation medium in T75 flasks (Corning) with weekly medium changes. Once sufficient cell numbers were collected, pre-iMics were plated at 15,000 cells per cm2 in T175 flasks (Sarstedt) in iMic medium (50% advanced NBM (Gibco), 50% advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco), 1× B27 supplement with vitamin A (Gibco), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 100 ng ml−1 IL-34 (Miltenyi Biotec) and 20 ng ml−1 macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Miltenyi Biotec)) and differentiated to iMics for 14 days. For each line, four replicates were plated and processed in parallel. iMics were cultivated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with three full medium changes per week. On day 14 (or on days 0, 3 or 7 for qPCR), iMics were washed briefly with PBS and detached with Accutase for 6–7 min at 37 °C until cells detached upon tapping the flask. Cells were collected with wash buffer (advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco) + 0.1% BSA fraction V (Gibco)) and centrifuged at 300g (5 min, RT) before they were resuspended in PBS and counted using a hemocytometer (Neubauer Zählkammer Improved, Bard). Appropriate volumes containing 1 million cells were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifugation tubes (Eppendorf) and centrifuged at 400g (4 °C, 5 min). The supernatant was aspirated and cell pellets were frozen to −80 °C before shipment for lipidomics analysis.

The quality and purity of EB cultures were assessed by flow cytometry. Pre-iMicroglias were isolated as described above from EB cultures. Cells were centrifuged at 300g (5 min, RT) and resuspended in 100 µl of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS, 0.1% BSA fraction V (Gibco) and transferred into low-protein-binding 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Cells were incubated with human Fc block (BD Biosciences, 564219) for 15 min at 4 °C in the dark on a rotor before 2 µl of each FACS antibody was added: APC anti-human CD45 antibody, mouse IgG1, HI30 (BioLegend, 304011) and Brilliant violet 421 anti-mouse/human CD11b antibody, clone M1/70, rat IgG2b (Biolegend, 101235). Pre-iMics were incubated with antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark on a rotor. Next, 1 ml of FACS buffer was added for washing and cells were centrifuged for 5 min (300g, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µl of FACS buffer. Cells were analyzed using a Sony SH800S cell sorter (Sony Biotechnologies). In total, 20,000 cells per sample were analyzed. Unstained cells served as a gating control. Data analysis was conducted in FlowJo (BD Biosciences).

All animals were bred and housed according to institutional and Dutch governmental guidelines and regulations. Mouse astrocytes were isolated and cultured according to a protocol adopted from Clayton et al.97. Timed pregnant C57bl6j mice were purchased from Charles River or bred in house. Brains were extracted from both male and female pups (E18–P3). Cortices were isolated after the removal of meninges; cortices from each brain were digested in Papain (LK003150, Worthington) at 37 °C for 30–45 min and triturated with supplemented DMEM + DNAse. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300g for 5 min and cell pellet was resuspended in 50% DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 31331093) and 50% NBM (Gibco, 11570556) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (StemCell Technologies, 07156), 2% B27 (Fisher Scientific, 17504044), 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, 35050038), 1% NEAA (Fisher Emergo, 11350912), 1% P/S (Fisher Emergo, 11548876), 0.3% glucose (Life Technologies), 5 μg ml−1 N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma, A9165), 20 ng ml−1 FGF2 (Peprotech, 100-18B), 10 ng ml−1 CNTF (Peprotech, 450-13), 10 ng ml−1 BMP4 (Peprotech, 120-05ET) and 5 ng ml−1 heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (hbEGF; Peprotech, 100-47) and filtered through a 100-μm filter before plating cells in a 10-cm dish (one brain per dish) that was precoated for 24 h with PLO (Sigma, P3655) followed by lam (BioTechne, 3400-010-02) for 2 h at 37 °C. On day 2, plates were washed with 1× PBS and the medium was replaced by expansion medium, 50% DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 31331093) and 50% NBM (Gibco, 11570556) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (StemCell Technologies, 07156), 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, 35050038), 1% NEAA (Fisher Emergo, 11350912), 1% P/S (Fisher Emergo, 11548876), 0.3% glucose (Life Technologies), 5 μg ml−1 N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma, A9165), 20 ng ml−1 FGF2 (Peprotech, 100-18B), 10 ng ml−1 CNTF (Peprotech, 450-13), 10 ng ml−1 BMP4 (Peprotech, 120-05ET) and 5 ng ml−1 hbEGF (Peprotech, 100-47). The medium was replaced every 2 or 3 days until plates were confluent (9–14 days). Cells were lifted by TrypLE and collected in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 31331093) before spinning at 300g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended and cells were replated for an experiment in 50% DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 31331093) and 50% NBM (Gibco, 11570556) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (StemCell Technologies, 07156), 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, 35050038), 1% NEAA (Fisher Emergo, 11350912), 1% P/S (Fisher Emergo, 11548876), 0.3% glucose (Life Technologies), 5 μg ml−1 N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma, A9165), 20 ng ml−1 FGF2 (Peprotech, 100-18B), 10 ng ml−1 CNTF (Peprotech, 450-13), 10 ng ml−1 BMP4 (Peprotech, 120-05ET) and 5 ng ml−1 hbEGF (Peprotech, 100-47); alternatively, cells were frozen in CryoStor (StemCell Technologies, 07959).

For reactive astrocyte analysis mouse astrocytes were plated. Then, 24 h after plating, the medium was replaced by experiment medium, 50% DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 31331093) and 50% NBM (Gibco, 11570556) supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (StemCell Technologies, 07156), 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, 35050038), 1% NEAA (Fisher Emergo, 11350912), 1% P/S (Fisher Emergo, 11548876), 0.3% glucose (Life Technologies), 5 μg ml−1 N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma, A9165) and 5 ng ml−1 hbEGF (Peprotech, 100-47). This condition constituted the no-FBS condition (−FBS). In parallel, astrocytes were cultured identically but 2% FBS was added to the culture medium (+FBS condition, to mimic the human astrocyte growth condition). Cells were cultured in their respective −FBS or + FBS medium for 5 days. After 5 days, the culture medium (+FBS or −FBS) was replaced by experiment medium without FBS for 24 h. After these 24 h, the medium was again replaced with experiment medium (without FBS) with or without the addition of the reactive cocktail (30 ng ml−1 TNF (300-01A, Peprotech), 3 ng ml−1 IL-1α (AF-200-01A, Peprotech) and 400 ng ml−1 C1q (204876, Sigma-Aldrich)). After 24 h, cells were lifted by TrypLE and pellets were collected and snap-frozen for lipidomics analysis. Each lipidomics or qPCR datapoint represents astrocytes from one independent mouse brain.

Lipidomic analysis was undertaken on human postmortem brain material including frontal cortex gray matter, frontal cortex white matter and cerebellum tissue from 13 control donors and 20 donors with AD. Brain tissue was obtained from the Queen Square Brain Bank, University College London Queen Square Institute of Neurology. All donor information, including postmortem delay, age, sex, APOE genotype and pathological information, is listed in Supplementary Table 2. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the National Health Service research ethics committee in accordance with the human tissue authority's code of practice and standards (license number 12198). Processing of postmortem samples for lipidomics was carried out as follows. After adding stainless-steel beads and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-grade water, brain samples were homogenized using a Next Advance bullet blender. From these homogenized samples, aliquots containing the equivalent of 5 mg of tissue were prepared as described below.

Lipidomics analysis followed standardized, quantitative protocols46,98. Briefly, 25 µl of Lipidyzer internal standard mix containing 54 deuterated standards was added to the cell pellet or 5-mg homogenized sample and extraction followed a methyl tert-butyl ether-based protocol. After drying under a gentle stream of nitrogen, samples were dissolved in running buffer (methanol and dichloromethane 1:1, containing 10 mM ammonium acetate) and injected into the Lipidyzer platform, consisting of a Sciex QTrap 5500 MS instrument equipped with a SelexION DMS interface and Nexera X2 ultrahigh-performance LC system. The order of samples was randomized before each batch was run on the Lipidyzer platform. SLA software was used to process data files and report the lipid class and species concentration and composition values47. Lipidyzer data analysis was further accomplished using SODA-light as a built-in data browser for the Neurolipid Atlas repository. Lipid species concentration datasets were imported and filtered, with individual species required to have a minimal intensity of two times the blank in at least 80% of all samples measured. If lipid species were absent or below two times the blank in >20% of all samples, they were removed. An exception was made for lipid species that were uniquely present in one group; if a lipid species was present in at least 60% of the samples (with a minimal intensity of two times the blank) within one of the experimental groups, the lipid species was reintroduced for the analysis. Because a dataset can have several grouping variables (for example, genotype, treatment and sample type), a new group variable is created by concatenating all grouping variables. This new group variable was used as the group variable for the blank filtering. No missing value imputation was applied. The SLA control software, including all up-to-date dictionaries and isotope correction algorithms can be found on Github (https://github.com/syjgino/SLA). SODA-light is a development branch of iSODA99 (https://github.com/ndcn/soda-ndcn) and part of the Neurolipid Atlas.

SODA-light was forked as a lipidomics-only instance of iSODA99, a multiomics data visualization and integration application developed on R 4.4.0. As such, SODA-light is designed for efficient data exploration, providing interactive plots with extensive flexibility in terms of input data, analytical processes and visual customization. The code for SODA-light is available on GitHub (https://github.com/CPM-Metabolomics-Lipidomics/soda-light). SODA-light version 0.2 was used for the generation of all figures in this manuscript.

Lipidyzer data analyzed by SLA can be added to the Neurolipid Atlas website by contacting the corresponding authors or the email address at https://neurolipidatlas.com/. Upload requires concentrations of individual lipid species in a sample of interest, along with blank (empty) samples and QCs (for example, serum). Human data need to be anonymized. Metadata need to be provided in the format shown in Supplementary Table 3. Metadata items in bold (left column) need to be completed by the lab that provides the data. For adding other types of quantitative (targeted) lipidomics data, please contact the corresponding authors.

To investigate differences in saturation of lipid classes between groups, the sum of the concentration of the lipid species with identical numbers of double bonds within the TGs, CEs or within all phospholipid classes was calculated. These summed values were normalized over total lipid concentration. Afterward, the fold change from each sample was calculated over the mean of the control samples.

For lipidomics, fully differentiated iAstrocytes were plated on day 1 at 17,000 cells per cm2 in AM + 2% FBS in uncoated 10-cm dishes. On day 2, the medium was replaced by AM without FBS after one PBS wash. After 24 h, on day 3, iAstrocytes were collected by Accutase dissociation after one PBS wash and counted. Cells were pelleted at 500,000 per vial using a centrifuge with a swing-out rotor. For reactive iAstrocyte lipidomics, the setup was identical; however, on day 3, the medium was replaced by AM without FBS supplemented with a reactive cytokine cocktail (30 ng ml−1 TNF (300-01A, Peprotech), 3 ng ml−1 IL-1α (AF-200-01A, Peprotech) and 400 ng ml−1 C1q (204876, Sigma-Aldrich)) or AM without FBS supplemented with an equal amount of PBS + 0.1% BSA (Tebu-Bio, 1501) as a control. On day 4, iAstrocytes were collected by Accutase dissociation after one PBS wash and counted. Cells were pelleted at 500,000 per vial using a centrifuge with a swing-out rotor. For one experiment comparing ApoE4 to ApoE3 iAstrocytes and one experiment comparing reactive to control iAstrocytes, lipidomics was performed as part of a multiomics experiment, as discussed below. Each lipidomics experiment included two or three replicate wells of iAstrocytes per condition.

For integrative analysis, we generated samples for lipidomics and proteomics from the same preparation of BIONi037 (lipidomics experiment BIONi037 replicate I) and Kolf2.1J (lipidomics experiment Kolf2.1J set 1, replicate II) isogenic iAstrocytes. Transcriptomics was performed on a separate preparation for both isogenic sets (described below). To generate lipidomics and proteomics from one preparation, on day 1, fully differentiated iAstrocytes were plated at 17,000 cells per cm2 in AM + 2% FBS in uncoated 10-cm dishes. On day 2, the medium was replaced by AM without FBS after one PBS wash. After 24 h, on day 3, iAstrocytes were collected by Accutase dissociation after one PBS wash and counted. iAstrocytes were pelleted at 500,000 per vial separately for lipidomics and proteomics. Three replicate samples were generated for lipidomics and four replicate samples were generated for proteomics. iAstrocyte pellets were stored at −80 °C until shipment for further analysis. Generation of transcriptomic samples was performed under identical conditions (1,000,000 cells per vial; three replicates) for the Kolf2.1J isogenic set (set 1), whereas, for the BIONi037 isogenic set, the cells were kept in AM medium + 2% FBS.

Similarly to above, lipidomic and proteomic samples were generated from the same preparation of reactive versus control iAstocytes for integrative analysis. Day 1 (fully differentiated) BIONi037-A (ApoE3/3) or Kolf2.1J set 1 (ApoE3/3) astrocytes were plated at 17,000 cells per cm2 in AM + 2% FBS in uncoated 10-cm dishes. On day 2, the medium was replaced by AM without FBS after one PBS wash. On day 3, the medium was replaced by AM without FBS supplemented with a reactive cytokine cocktail (30 ng ml−1 TNF (300-01A, Peprotech), 3 ng ml−1 IL-1α (AF-200-01A, Peprotech) and 400 ng ml−1 C1q (204876, Sigma-Aldrich)) or AM without FBS supplemented with an equal amount of PBS + 0.1% BSA (Tebu-Bio, 1501) as a control. After 24 h, iAstrocytes were collected by Accutase dissociation after one PBS wash. iAstrocytes from each replicate dish were divided over two vials in which (1 million for Kolf2.1J or 500,000 for BIONi037-A) iAstrocytes were pelleted for proteomic and lipidomic analysis. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C before further processing.

For iAstrocytes on the WTC11 background, differentiation was performed as previously described100, with minor modifications. Briefly, WTC11 iPS cells were edited to introduce a doxycycline-induced cassette driving proastrocyte transcription factors NFIA and SOX9. These iPS cells were differentiated into NPCs using dual SMAD inhibition and EB formation. NPCs were purified by FACS for CD133+CD271− populations. Purified NPCs were further differentiated into iAstrocytes by doxycycline treatment (2 μg ml−1; Millipore Sigma, D9891) and exposure to AM (ScienCell, 1801) for 20 days. For experiments using serum-containing growth conditions, day 20 iAstrocytes were plated at 20,000 cells per cm2 in phenol-red-free AM (prfAM) (ScienCell, 1801-prf) overnight, with a full medium change to fresh prfAM on day 21. The medium was changed to fresh prfAM every 2 days. On day 25, cells were treated with 30 ng ml−1 TNF (300-01A, Peprotech), 3 ng ml−1 IL-1α (AF-200-01A, Peprotech) and 400 ng ml−1 C1q (204876, Sigma-Aldrich). After 24 h, the medium was removed, cells were washed with 1× Dulbecco's (DPBS) and cell pellets were collected and stored at −80 °C before further processing for lipidomics. Studies with human iPS cells at the University of California, San Francisco were approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo and Stem Cell Research Committee. Informed consent was obtained from participants when the iPS cell lines were originally derived.

TMEM106B-knockout iPS cells, genetically engineered from the parental KOLF2.1J iPS cell line59, were obtained from iNDI60 through the Jackson Laboratory. These iPS cells, along with wild-type parental KOLF2.1J iPS cells, were cultured in feeder-free conditions on Matrigel in E8 medium (Life Technologies) and passaged by Accutase dissociation followed by E8 plus Chroman-I RI. A piggybac-based tet-on NGN2 transgene cassette was stably integrated into the genome of iPS cells as described previously (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.q26g744b1gwz/v1)101, followed by puromycin selection to eliminate iPS cells that did not successfully integrate the transgene. iNeurons were differentiated on six-well PLO-coated dishes, with a plating density of 500,000 cells per well on day 4, by doxycycline-induced expression of the NGN2 transgene, as described previously (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8epv5969ng1b/v1)102. Cells were harvested on day 21 after doxycycline addition and snap-frozen before lipidomic analysis. Cells from two wells were combined into one 1.5-ml tube as one sample pellet. Experiments were conducted as three independent replicates with three samples per replicate.

Day 1 (fully differentiated) BIONi037-A (ApoE3/3) astrocytes were plated at 26,000 cells per cm2 in AM + 2% FBS in uncoated six-well plates. On day 2, the medium was replaced by AM without FBS after one PBS wash. On day 3, the medium was replaced by AM without FBS supplemented with 50 µM methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD)-coupled (water-soluble) cholesterol (C4951, Sigma-Aldrich) or AM without FBS supplemented with an equal amount of sterile water (TKF7114, Baxter) as a control. After 24 h, iAstrocytes were collected by Accutase dissociation after one PBS wash. iAstrocytes from each replicate well were pelleted for lipidomic analysis. Each lipidomics experiment included one or two replicate wells of iAstrocytes per condition. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C before further processing.

Frozen pellets corresponding to ~500,000 cells were dissolved in 25 μl of PBS supplemented with one tablet of cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor per 50 ml. One volume equivalent of 2× lysis buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 50 mM DTT and 4% (w/v) SDS) was added. Samples were sonicated in a Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode) for ten cycles with 1 min on and 30 s off with high intensity at 20 °C. Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and a second sonication cycle was performed as described above. Samples were alkylated using freshly made 15 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, I1149) for 30 min at RT in the dark. Subsequently, proteins were acetone precipitated and digested using LysC (PTMScan; Cell Signaling, 39003) and trypsin (Promega sequencing-grade, V5111), as described previously103. The digested proteins were then acidified with 10% (v/v) trifluoracetic acid and desalted using a Waters Oasis HLB µElution plate (30 µm; Waters, 186001828BA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The eluates were dried down using a vacuum concentrator and reconstituted in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Samples were transferred to an MS vial, diluted to a concentration of 1 µg µl−1 and spiked with iRT kit peptides (Biognosys, Ki-3002-2) before analysis by LC–MS/MS.

Peptides were separated in trap/elute mode using the nanoAcquity MClass ultrahigh-performance LC system (Waters) equipped with trapping (nanoAcquity Symmetry C18, 5 μm, 180 μm × 20 mm) and analytical (nanoAcquity BEH C18, 1.7 μm, 75 μm × 250 mm) columns. Solvent A was water and 0.1% formic acid while solvent B was acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. First, 1 μl of the samples (∼1 μg on column) were loaded with a constant flow of solvent A at 5 μl min−1 onto the trapping column. The trapping time was 6 min. Peptides were eluted through the analytical column with a constant flow of 0.3 μl min−1. During the elution, the percentage of solvent B increased nonlinearly from 0% to 40% in 120 min. The total run time was 145 min, including equilibration and conditioning. The LC instrument was coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Proxeon nanospray source. The peptides were introduced into the MS instrument using a Pico-Tip Emitter (outer diameter, 360 μm; inner diameter, 20 μm inner diameter; 10-μm tip; New Objective) heated at 300 °C and a spray voltage of 2.2 kV was applied. The capillary temperature was set at 300 °C. The radiofrequency ion funnel was set to 30%. For data-independent acquisition (DIA), full-scan MS spectra with a mass range of 350–1,650 m/z were acquired in profile mode in the Orbitrap with the resolution of 120,000 full width at half-maximum (FWHM). The default charge state was set to 3+. The filling time was set at a maximum of 60 ms with a limitation of 3 × 106 ions. DIA scans were acquired with 40 mass window segments of differing widths across the MS1 mass range. Higher-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation (stepped normalized collision energy: 25%, 27.5% and 30%) was applied and MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 30,000 FWHM at a fixed first mass of 200 m/z after the accumulation of 3 × 106 ions or after a filling time of 35 ms (whichever occurred first). Data were acquired in profile mode. For data acquisition and processing of the raw data, Xcalibur 4.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Tune version 2.0 were used.

DIA raw data were analyzed using the directDIA pipeline in Spectronaut version 18 (Biognosys) with default settings besides the following parameters: protein LFQ method, QUANT 2.0; proteotypicity filter, only protein group specific; major group quantity, median peptide quantity; minor group quantity, median precursor quantity; data filtering, Q value; normalizing strategy, local normalization. The data were searched against UniProt (Homo sapiens, 20,375 entries) and a contaminants database (247 entries). The identifications were filtered to satisfy a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% on the peptide and protein level. Relative protein quantification was performed in Spectronaut using a pairwise t-test performed at the precursor level followed by multiple-testing correction according to a previous study104.

RNA isolation, QC, preprocessing and data analysis were performed as previously described from frozen pellets105. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from each sample using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. RNA samples for each participant were entered into an electronic tracking system and processed at the University of California, Irvine Genomics Research and Technology Hub. RNA was QCed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified by Nanodrop. RNA quality was measured as the RNA integrity number (RIN) and 260/280 and 260/230 ratios to evaluate any potential contamination. Only samples with RIN > 8 were used for library prep and sequencing. Library prep processing was initiated with total RNA of 1 µg using a Ribo-Zero gold ribosomal RNA depletion and Truseq Stranded total RNA kit. RNA was chemically fragmented and subjected to reverse transcription, end repair, phosphorylation, poly(A) tailing, ligation of barcoded sequencing adaptors and enrichment of adaptor-ligated complementary DNA (cDNA). RNA-seq libraries were titrated by qPCR (Kapa), normalized according to size (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 high-sensitivity chip). Each cDNA library was then subjected to Illumina (Novaseq 6000) paired-end, 100-cycle sequencing to obtain approximately 50–65 million paired-end reads. FASTQ files were subjected to QC and reads with quality scores > Q15 were collected. Raw reads were mapped to the GRCh38 reference genome using Hisat2 (version 2.2.1), QC, normalization and transformation before further exploratory and differential expression analysis. Raw counts were normalized and transformed using the ‘regularized log' transformation pipeline from the R package DESeq2. Statistical analyses was performed in R and differentially expressed genes detected for each covariate using FDR or Bonferroni adjustment for multiple-testing correction. PCA was performed using the plotPCA function in R with default settings. Following regularized log transformation in DESeq2, the top 500 highly variable genes were used as input for PCA and clustering of samples. DESeq2 was used to assess the statistical difference between the ApoE genotypes. Subsequently, we used the differentially expressed genes for each comparison to perform gene set enrichment analyses using Webgestalt106.

Expression data of iAstrocytes from Tcw et al.10 and Lin et al.8 were analyzed and downloaded using GEO2R32. Tcw et al. performed bulk RNA-seq on four isogenic sets of APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 iAstrocytes, as well as bulk RNA-seq on seven APOE3/3 and six APOE4/4 population iAstrocyte lines. Lin et al. performed bulk RNA-seq on one isogenic set of APOE3/3 and APOE4/4 iAstrocytes. From all five isogenic sets and the population model, we gained the differential gene expression data of APOE4/4 versus APOE3/3. We calculated the average log2 fold change in ApoE4 versus ApoE3 of the pathways that were the top ten upregulated and downregulated pathways in our APOE4/4 versus APOE3/3 (BIONi037) transcriptomics for each line or the population data. We compared the directionality in all the lines and further explored the gene expression of the pathways that had the same directionality for all the comparisons.

On day 1, iAstrocytes were plated at 30,000–40,000 cells per cm2 in 6-well, 12-well and 96-well plates depending on the specific experiment in AM + 2% FBS (ScienCell). Then, 24 h after plating (day 2), the medium was replaced by AM without FBS after one PBS wash. On day 3, if needed, medium was collected and stored at −20 °C until further analysis by mesoscale discovery (MSD) cytokine ELISA. Attached iAstrocytes were either fixed by 3.7% formaldehyde (FA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15681) for 10–15 min at RT and stored at 4 °C in 1× PBS for immunofluorescence staining, collected by Accutase dissociation for flow cytometry, lysed in Laemmli sample buffer with DTT (LSB; made in house) for western blot, lysed with RLY plus TCEP (Meridian, BIO-52073; Thermo Scientific, 20491) for qPCR or lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (made in house) for BCA analysis.

On day 1, iAstrocytes were plated at 30,000–40,000 cells per cm2 in 6-well, 12-well and 96-well plates depending on the specific experiment in AM + 2% FBS (ScienCell). Then, 24 h after plating (day 2), the medium was replaced by AM without FBS after one PBS wash. On day 3, iAstrocytes were treated with 50 µM MBCD-coupled (water-soluble) cholesterol (C4951, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 µM avasimibe (PZ0190, Sigma-Aldrich), the reactive cytokine cocktail (30 ng ml−1 TNF (300-01A, Peprotech), 3 ng ml−1 IL-1α (AF-200-01A, Peprotech) and 400 ng ml−1 C1q (204876, Sigma-Aldrich)) (dose 1) or lower titrated doses of the cocktail indicated by 0.5 (15 ng ml−1 TNF, 1.5 ng ml−1 IL-1α and 200 ng ml−1 C1Q), 0.25, 0.125 etc. Where indicated, iAstrocytes were preincubated for 1 h with 0.5 µM avasimibe (PZ0190, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM MBCD-coupled (water-soluble) cholesterol (C4951, Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.5 µM atorvastatin (HY-17379, MedChemExpress) before combined incubation with one of the previously mentioned treatments. Then, 24 h later, on day 4, if needed, the medium was collected and stored at −20 °C until further analysis by MSD cytokine ELISA. Attached iAstrocytes were fixed by 3.7% FA for 10–15 min at RT and stored at 4 °C in 1× PBS for immunofluorescence staining, collected by Accutase dissociation for flow cytometry, lysed in LSB for western blot, lysed with RLY plus TCEP for qPCR or lysed in RIPA buffer for BCA analysis.

The medium was thawed and cellular debris was removed by a 5-min spin at 2,000g. Cytokine levels were determined by MSD Il-6 V-plex (K151QXD-2, MSD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Medium samples were analyzed either undiluted or diluted 1:5 or 1:10 in diluent 2 when iAstrocytes were treated with the reactive cocktail. Raw cytokine values per well were normalized over nuclei number per well on the basis of fluorescence staining of the fixed iAstrocytes in the plate or over protein content per well determined by a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, 23225). The Pierce BCA protein assay was performed in a microplate as described in the user guide provided by Thermo Scientific.

The medium was thawed and tenfold concentrated with centrifugal filters (3-kDa molecular weight cutoff; Millipore, UFC200324). ApoE levels in the medium were determined using the human ApoE ELISA kit (Invitrogen, EHAPOE) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw values were normalized over protein content per well determined by a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, 23225). The Pierce BCA protein assay was performed in a microplate as described in the user guide provided by Thermo Scientific.

On day 1, iAstrocytes were plated at 30,000–40,000 cells per cm2 in six-well plates in AM + 2% FBS (ScienCell). Then, 24 h after plating (day 2), the medium was replaced by AM without FBS after one PBS wash. On day 3, iAstrocytes were treated with or without the reactive cytokine cocktail (30 ng ml−1 TNF (300-01A, Peprotech), 3 ng ml−1 IL-1α (AF-200-01A, Peprotech) and 400 ng ml−1 C1q (204876, Sigma-Aldrich)). The medium was collected after 24 h on day 4 and stored at −20 °C before shipment for analysis. Cells in each well were collected for lipidomics analysis. Secreted cholesterol levels in the medium samples were normalized to total lipid levels in the corresponding iAstrocyte cell pellets. For total cholesterol analysis, 1.0 ml of astrocyte conditioned medium was freeze-dried overnight. Subsequently, lipids were hydrolyzed using 200 µl of a 0.1 M ethanolic sodium hydroxide solution (80% ethanol) under nitrogen atmosphere and total cholesterol quantification using gas chromatography–MS followed published protocols107.

After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific, T/3751/08) for 5 min at RT and blocked in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% NGS (Fisher Scientific, 11540526) for 30 min at RT or normal donkey serum (Biozol Diagnostika, LIN-END9000) in the case of microglia staining. Next, the iAstrocytes were incubated with the primary antibodies in blocking solution for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Plin2 (15294-1-AP, Proteintech; 1:250), anti-AQP4 (AQP-004, Alomone Labs; 1:500), anti-GFAP (173 004, Synaptic systems; 1:1000), anti-vimentin (sc-6260, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1,000), anti-MAP2 (ab5392, Abcam; 1:500), anti-Smi 312 (SMI-312P-050, Eurogentec; 1:500), anti-Iba1 (NB100-1028, Novus Biologicals; 1:250), anti-PU.1 (MA5-15064, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200) and anti-HLA class I heavy chain (kind gift from S. Neefjes; 1:250). After three washes in 1× PBS, the iAstrocytes were incubated with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen; 1:1,000), combined with DAPI (Carl Roth, 6843.1) and optional Lipidspot 488 in Fig. 6b (70065, Bio Connect; 1:1,000) in blocking solution, for 1 h at RT. Secondary antibodies used for microglia stainings were donkey anti-Goat Alexa-488 (Jackson ImmunoResearch 705-545-147) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-568 (Invitrogen, A10042). The iAstrocytes were washed three times in 1× PBS and either left in PBS to be imaged on the CellInsight CX7 LED Pro HCS platform (Fisher Scientific) or mounted on coverslips with Mowiol 4-88 (Sigma-Aldrich, 475904) for confocal imaging on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse microscope (Amstelveen), equipped with a confocal scanner model A1R+, using a ×40 oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.3). Image analysis was conducted using Columbus version 2.5.2 (PerkinElmer) after imaging on the Cell Insight CX7 and using Fiji108 after confocal imaging on the Nikon Ti-Eclipse. Lipid droplet analysis was performed using Perkin Elmer Columbus image analysis software. Cells were first identified on the basis of segmentation of the nuclei and cytoplasm to select only those fully contained within the field of view. For quantification of lipid droplets, the ‘find spots' function was applied for automated detection and counting of lipid droplets within each segmented cell. Alternatively, to assess antibody staining intensity, the ‘calculate intensity' function was used to determine the mean fluorescence intensity per cell. The fluorescence intensity or lipid droplet number of at least 50 cells per well was quantified in each experiment.

After Accutase dissocation, FACS buffer (DPBS + 2% FBS (Fisher Scientific, A5256701)) was added to a volume of 300 µl and the iAstrocytes were transferred to a round-bottom 96-well plate. After centrifuging for 1 min at 2,000 rpm, the iAstrocytes were stained with 1:50 phycoerythrin anti-human HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C antibody (BioLegend, 311406) for 30 min at 4 °C. Following another centrifugation step, the iAstrocytes were fixed with 2% FA (Sigma-Aldrich, P6148) for 15 min at RT. After a last centrifugation step, the iAstrocytes were transferred to FACS tubes and 10,000 events of each sample were analyzed using BD LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed in FlowJo (BD Biosciences). First, a life gate was set using the forward and side scatter area, after which the single cells were gated using the forward scatter width and height (Supplementary Fig. 5). The geometric mean of the fluorescence intensity was used in the analyses.

RNA was isolated using the Isolate II RNA mini kit (BIO-52073, GC Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quantity and quality were analyzed by nanodrop. cDNA was generated by a SensiFAST cDNA synthesis kit (BIO-65054, GC Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The SensiFast SYBR Lo-Rox kit was used for performing qPCR on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysis was performed according to the ΔΔCt method to determine fold changes in RNA expression. For qPCR on iMic, the RNA Nucleospin Plus XS kit by Macherey-Nagel was used according to the kit's instructions for cell lysis and RNA extraction. The Applied Biosystems cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for reverse transcription. The list of primers used is provided in Supplementary Table 4.

After lysing the iAstrocytes with LSB, samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were shortly vortexed and loaded onto 4–15% Criterion TGX stain-free gel (Bio-Rad, 5678085). After running the gel (90 V for 30 min followed by 150 V for 45 min), the gel was transferred to a low-fluorescence (LF) PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Midi 0.45-µm LF PVDF transfer kit (Bio-Rad, 1704275). After blocking in 5% skim milk powder (Sigma-Aldrich, 115363) for 1 h at RT on a shaker, the membrane was incubated with antibodies to HLA class I heavy chain (kind gift from S. Neefjes; 1:250), TAP1 (kind gift from S. Neefjes; 1:500), TAP2 (kind gift from S. Neefjes; 1:3,000) and GAPDH (elabscience, E-AB-40337; 1:3,000) overnight at 4 °C on a rocking plate. The following day, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies IRDye 800CW or IRDye 680RD (LI-COR; 1:10,000) for 1 h at RT on a shaker. Afterward, the membrane was scanned using the LI-COR Odyssey Fc imaging system. Analysis was conducted using Image Studio Lite 5.2.5 software (LI-COR) by calculating the median intensity of the bands minus the background above and below the bands.

Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism version 10.2.3 or RStudio version 2023.9.1. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. The statistical tests used and the number of biological replicates (separate astrocyte preparations) are annotated in the figures. In all graphs, open triangles or open circles indicate the mean result per experiment. Solid dots indicate the mean result of each replicate well in the experiments. The data met the assumptions of the statistical test used; normality and equal distribution were tested. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments because automated analysis was performed. Statistical analyses were performed on the mean values per experiment. For the comparison of lipid class changes in Figs. 2f, 3f and 5c and Extended Data Figs. 2g, 8i, 9e and 10e, statistical analyses were performed on the percentage of total lipid values for each group (not fold change). One ApoE4/4 sample from lipidomics iAstrocytes BIONi037 ApoE4 versus ApoE3 I was excluded as outlier. In Fig. 6j, one outlier experiment was removed on the basis of robust regression and outlier removal (Q = 1).

Colorectal cancer (CRC) progression depends on the close interaction of tumour cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME). Although the TME contributes to poor therapy responses and immune evasion, immune cells within the TME can be therapeutically leveraged, as exemplified by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Unfortunately, only a small subset of patients with CRC benefit from ICB therapy; those with immune-activated, microsatellite unstable CRC respond, whereas the predominant group of patients with CRC, those with microsatellite-stable tumours, do not. Although challenging, modulating the TME of CRC to convert these lowly immunogenic and immunosuppressed tumours into immune-activated tumours holds tremendous therapeutic potential. In this Review we provide an overview of the cellular and molecular components of immunity in the TME of CRCs at various stages of disease as well as the mechanisms of immunosuppression and immune evasion. We further describe how systemic and local therapies for CRC impact the tumour and systemic immune microenvironments, and how immunity could serve as a therapeutic and prognostic biomarker. Lastly, we highlight novel immunotherapeutic strategies and approaches that modulate the TME of CRCs to make them amenable to immunotherapy.

(APR). The APR of the liver is triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection, tissue injury, trauma or other stressors and is characterized by, among other alterations, changes in plasma protein concentrations.

A mouse model that gives rise to inflammation-associated tumours in the colon through injection of AOM, a potent mutagen, followed by repeated cycles of mucosal inflammation induced by DSS.

Cells that ensheath neurons of the enteric nervous systems to protect them from damage and support their functions.

Fibroblast-like cells in the liver that populate the perisinusoidal space (located between hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells) and secrete collagens and other extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules upon activation.

The parenchymal cells of the liver that perform diverse metabolic functions including plasma protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and storage, detoxification and bile acid secretion.

Cells that form the inner lining of the liver sinusoids and regulate the exchange of nutrients, metabolites and toxicants between the blood and hepatocytes.

A process by which old or damaged mitochondria are degraded intracellularly.

A type of chronic inflammation with acute flares and phases of only mild inflammatory activity in between.

Abnormal build-up of fat in cells and organs, most commonly in the liver, where it is also known as fatty liver disease.

(TLSs). Clusters of B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes that develop within inflamed or cancerous tissues and exhibit several hallmark characteristics of secondary lymphoid organs such as germinal centres, T cell-rich zones and high endothelial venules.

Small clusters of cells at the invasive front of colorectal cancers (CRCs) that are not connected to the remainder of the tumour.

Drinking behavior is not only homeostatically regulated but also rapidly adjusted before any changes in blood osmolality occur, known as anticipatory thirst satiation. Homeostatic and anticipatory signals converge in the subfornical organ (SFO); however, the neural pathways conveying peripheral information to the SFO before changes in blood composition are incompletely understood. Here we reveal an inhibitory pathway from the medial septum (MS) to the SFO that is involved in the control of anticipatory drinking behavior in mice. MS γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons encode water-satiation signals by integrating cues from the oral cavity and tracking gastrointestinal signals. These neurons receive inputs from the parabrachial nucleus and relay to SFOCaMKII neurons, forming a bottom-up pathway with activity that prevents overhydration. Disruption of this circuit leads to excessive water intake and hyponatremia. Our findings reveal a septal pathway that integrates multiple layers of presystemic signals to fine-tune drinking behavior.

Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta's massive new data center in Richland Parish. When it's done, the 4-million-square-foot facility will require more than 2 gigawatts of energy to run.

On August 20, Louisiana's Public Service Commission voted four to one to approve the construction of the plants, which will be run by the utility company Entergy Louisiana. The decision was met with criticism from members of the public who testified against Entergy and Meta's plan, claiming that the process was rushed. They voiced concerns about rising energy bills and water shortages.

Documents viewed by WIRED show that state authorities agreed to grant Meta tax breaks and incentives without the company explicitly guaranteeing any full-time jobs for local workers.

Opponents of the plan were angry about the sped-up approval timeline: Entergy submitted its application in 2024, and the vote originally could have taken place this October, to give the commission's administrative law judge the chance to issue further recommendations. But Entergy filed a motion to move the vote to August, claiming that some of the parties that had previously opposed the project were now in agreement. The rescheduled vote left no time for changes.

Critics also claim the deal doesn't include stipulations like a cap on how much Entergy could charge utility customers for the construction of the gas plants and transmission lines in Meta's data center build-out—a concern as massive AI data centers can cause utility bills to spike. While Meta agreed to finance the first 15 years of a 30-year loan to construct the gas plants, the construction of the transmission line will be paid for by utility customers.

“We wanted the commissioners to attach conditions and reasonable safeguards, such as a cost cap, but they instead came to this extremely disappointing and baffling decision,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposed the Entergy application.

During the approval vote, Entergy and Louisiana's economic development officials repeatedly pointed to the projections shared by Meta, which suggest that the project would bring a $10 billion investment and upwards of 300 to 500 well-paying jobs. In its original 2024 application for the plants, Entergy referenced Richland Parish's low income levels—one in four residents lives below the poverty line—as a reason to authorize the plan.

“There has never been a better time to lift our residents out of poverty. There has never been a better time to give people in our region better jobs,” said Rob Cleveland, the CEO of Grow NELA, an economic development firm representing northwest Louisiana who testified in support of Entergy's gas plants, at the hearing.

Louisiana politicians sought to rewrite zoning laws and shifted a tax rebate for broadband into a tax exemption for data centers, all to win Meta's support in late 2024, according to January reporting from Nola.com. But the public had little time to scrutinize Louisiana's economic development promises. They also heard little from Meta, which was not legally required to take part in the hearings on Entergy's new gas plants, despite the fact that the gas plants and a new $550 million transmission line connecting energy to the data center and upgrades to a local substation (also approved on August 20) are being built entirely for the company—the latter entirely paid for by Louisiana taxpayers. Repeated attempts to force Meta to produce documents that critics claim they have not received were unsuccessful, including a July subpoena attempt.

One of Meta's tax incentive agreements with the state, which was signed last fall and viewed by WIRED, does not stipulate that Meta subsidiary Laidley, which is running the data center project, will focus on local hiring, although it does require that all jobs be fulfilled on site. (Separately, Entergy said Meta submitted a letter to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April saying that it will make “a concerted effort” to hire locally, but this assurance is not binding.)

And the tax incentive agreement does not actually require any of the jobs to be full-time to receive state incentives. Instead it defines “full-time job” to mean any 40-hour workweek fulfilled through any number of part-time jobs. Meta would need to hire these 500 “full-time” jobs by 2035 if it wants to receive the highest level of tax breaks, an 80 percent reduction on the full amount. It does require the jobs to provide health insurance and says the pay for all jobs should average out at $82,000 a year. The contract also charges Meta an “administrative fee” of $10,000 for every $1 billion it spends in the state.

When reached for comment, Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for the state's economic development authority, said that the agency still expects Meta to create 500 full-time, permanent jobs, per previous announcements. “Meta is expected to create 500 direct new jobs at the facility, which in economic development terms means permanent, full-time jobs,” Litten says.

Entergy's critics claimed the utility was reluctant to provide specifics on Meta's job numbers in the lead-up to the August vote, refusing to explain what types of jobs will be created or how Meta estimated 300 to 500 new hires. In an email to WIRED, Entergy only referred to an impact report from Grow NELA but answered no other direct questions.

“We continually asked for analysis with how they came up with this number of jobs, and Entergy has no idea about how many people will be hired,” says Susan Stevens Miller, an attorney representing the Union of Concerned Scientists and Alliance for Affordable Energy, which opposed the application.

In an August 7 filing, Entergy urged the rushed vote on its final agreement with several parties, saying Meta's subsidiary and the tech industry “prize speed to the market as vital to its competitiveness” and that “the Commission has the flexibility and agility to act at the new speed of business, while reasonably balancing the interests of other Louisiana customers.” Entergy said in a filing it had submitted ample public testimony and the public had a chance to ask questions and that moving quickly was, “the difference between securing the Project for Louisiana or missing out on this massive economic development opportunity, likely to another state willing to move at the speed of business.”

But when several members of the public asked questions during the August 20 hearing about the project, particularly around Meta's assurances of jobs, they received few details. None of the agreements between Meta and the state of Louisiana that were viewed by WIRED are available in the commission's public dockets. An earlier, six-page term sheet laying out hiring incentives was published by Power magazine in November, but it did not include further details about whether jobs could be part-time or any other details in the 93-page agreement viewed by WIRED. Advocates with the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Union of Concerned Scientists contacted by WIRED said they had never seen the full agreement until it was sent to them by WIRED.

Louisiana resident Angelle Bradford Rosenberg spoke at the August 20 approval meeting, expressing concern about the impact of the data center's water usage and its impact on local farmers. She also questioned the impact of jobs on the local economy.

“I want local businesses to be thriving,” she said during the meeting, “but if the average data center permanent jobs are 12 to 15, and y'all saying it's going to be 500, do y'all have a promise that they're going to be local jobs? ... Do we actually know that they're hiring people from Monroe, Rayville, Delhi, Holly Ridge, or are they just saying 500 jobs and they're bringing in these folks from other places?”

But the tax exemption agreement secured between Meta and Louisiana officials did not secure any guarantee of local hiring. Litten, with Louisiana Economic Development, told WIRED that separate state tax breaks that all companies in the state are eligible for do require local hiring. They include the Quality Jobs Rebate, which provides a 6 percent rebate on payroll expenses, a program set to replace it called High Impact Jobs program.

Most data centers hire specialists from out of state for the technical jobs, according to Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst who studies data center tax breaks at the nonprofit Good Jobs First. She says data centers employ a mix of low-skill and high-skill technical workers to manage servers in addition to security guards and maintenance roles. She says that while construction is happening, data centers often hire specialist electricians who travel from state to state to set up servers.

For this reason, she says, Meta is not the only tech company hesitant to guarantee local hiring when negotiating data center contracts. “They know that some of these jobs require skills that people in the local community just don't have.”

In response to questions from WIRED, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said, “We make a concerted effort to source labor locally and provide substantial contributions directly to the community.” Clayton said that for part-time construction roles, its contractors were “working on hiring local talent” and that they would host information fairs early next year. For permanent data center jobs, Clayton said Meta would be hiring “technical operators, electricians, air-conditioning and heating specialists, logistics staff, security, and more.”

The state's agreement with Meta makes clear that as public land, the property Meta is leasing is exempt from traditional taxes. It creates a menu of options for what the company would potentially owe in “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT), a common agreement that lets local governments offer tax breaks with provisions attached. The agreement offers Meta qualified exemptions from both sales tax and property tax.

To get the lowest level of property tax exemptions, Meta would need to invest $5 billion into the state and hire the equivalent of 300 full-time employees. At this level, Meta would have to pay 40 percent of the assessed property tax. If the company invests at least $10 billion by December 2032, it would get the highest exemption, paying 20 percent of the assessed property tax.

The agreement sets out hiring timelines that the company must also hit to receive these tax incentives: Meta can receive the highest property tax exemption as long as it hires the equivalent of 300 “full-time” jobs by 2030, 450 by 2032, 475 by 2033 and 500 by December 31, 2034.

Louisiana's agreements ask for more than some other states' tax subsidies. According to Good Jobs First, nearly half of state tax subsidies for data centers don't require any new jobs to be created. But Miller has concerns that the tax breaks were not necessary at all to entice a company as large as Meta. “While everyone likes to avoid taxes, they're not going to hire people in Richland [Parish] just because they're going to get a tax break,” Miller says.

Louisiana had already amended a tax rebate to create an exemption for data centers in 2024 to entice Meta; in its latest iteration, it says data centers can receive a full sales tax exemption for equipment purchases in the state as long as they hire 50 full-time jobs and invest at least $200 million by July 1, 2029. A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement.

Good Jobs First says that at least 10 states have subsidies for data centers that are worth more than $100 million each, and “have suffered estimated losses of $100 million each in tax revenue for data centers,” according to its data. In total, these states forgo more than $3 billion in taxes annually for data centers. Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion. In 2024, a pause on data center subsidies was passed in Georgia but vetoed by governor Brian Kemp.

The Franklin Farms site in Holly Ridge, the area of Richland Parish where Meta's data center is being built, was purchased by Louisiana specifically for economic development projects. In its ground lease with Meta, Louisiana offered the 1,400-acre plot to the company for $12 million, which the lease says was the cost to the state of acquiring and maintaining the land. The lease also says Meta's $732,000 a year “rent” is “credit toward the Base Purchase Price,” meaning the company will have paid for the property by a little over 16 years into its 30-year lease.

The price for the potential sale would be slightly higher if Meta does not reach minimum hiring and investment thresholds: As an example, the lease says if Meta only spends $4 billion in the state instead of $5 billion, the property would end up costing it $19 million. Louisiana Economic Development reserves the right to reclaim the property if Meta doesn't invest at least $3.75 billion and hire the equivalent of 225 “full-time” jobs by 2028. When asked if Meta plans to purchase the property, Clayton said, “We'll keep you updated on our future plans for this site.”

Meta's presence has already caused land values to jump. A nearby tract of 4,000 acres of land in Holly Ridge is for sale for $160 million, or $40,000 per acre—more than 4.5 times the price paid by Louisiana for the data center's site.

But there's also a concern that Meta could delay or abandon the data center project. The PILOT agreement its subsidiary signed with the state says the company's timeline will depend on “numerous factors outside of the control of the lessee, such as market orientation and demand, competition, availability of qualified laborers to construct and/or weather conditions.”

“My general fear is that too many data centers are being built,” Miller says. “That means some of the data centers are just going to be abandoned by the owners.”

She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer. “Essentially, the state will be stuck with this warehouse full of computers,” Miller says.

Update: 9/22/2025, 12:50 PM EDT: Wired has clarified the subhead to reflect how critics perceive the data center.

Here at WIRED, we tend to stick to journalism. We talk about our work to anyone who will listen—during podcasts, on social media, over dinner with our politely listening friends—but we tend to confine our bragging to the scoops we get, the stories we write. For our new politics issue, though, we decided to do something different and bring WIRED's work to outside, to you, directly.

For our politics issue, WIRED examines the state of tech's influence on governmental power—and the people who will change everything in the future.

Over the next few days we're going to be posting the cover of our latest issue in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, and Washington, DC. It'll be presented as wheatpasted posters, digital billboards, and even a mural. Hopefully, they'll be easy to spot, if not downright hard to miss.

Here's where you come in. We're not going to tell you exactly where the cover will be displayed. (Where's the fun in that?) Instead, we want you to go on a treasure hunt. If you live in or near one of the five cities listed above, keep your eyes peeled. If you see WIRED's new cover out in the wild, snap a photo, tell your friends.

Also, scan the QR code to read the stories in the politics issue, like editor at large Steven Levy's deeply reported piece on watching Silicon Valley transform from a countercultural tech utopia to a business sector looking to curry favor with President Trump. Or, perhaps, our investigation into how much geopolitical power Elon Musk is amassing through his SpaceX rocket launches and Starlink satellites.

Palantir Technologies, which moved from Silicon Valley to Denver in 2020, sells software that immigration authorities use to identify and arrest people, militaries use to organize drone strikes, and corporations use to manage their supply chains. Now, it also sells tote bags.

Last year, Palantir relaunched an online merchandise store, and its website was recently redesigned with a swanky interface and new payment system. A mock terminal in the lower left corner displays “code” documenting each item you view. A page titled “Core Capsule” displays an assortment of sold out items, like athletic shorts with text reading ""PLTR—TECH"" running down the right butt cheek, which sold for $99. It also shows a puffy “ergonomic"" nylon tote bag that was priced at $119, and a Palantir baseball cap that ran for $55. The site is relaunching on Thursday evening with a new merch drop.

Many companies produce branded swag for their employees and clients, including the legacy defense contractors that Palantir is trying to disrupt. Lockheed Martin sells a skunk stuffed animal, a nod to its R&D team that started secret operations under the name “Skunk Works” during World War II. Boeing sells T-shirts and keychains depicting various military aircraft, like its B-52 bomber jets and AH-64 attack helicopters. They're products that may appeal to current or former employees, or their friends and family.

But what Palantir is doing feels far more ambitious: The company seemingly wants to be a lifestyle brand. Eliano Younes—the company's head of strategic engagement, who runs the merch store and posts about it frequently on X—has been explicit about this in multiple posts.

“Palantir is THE lifestyle brand,” Younes posted on X in March. “The most pro-west, meritocratic, winning obsessed, and based brand on the face of the earth.”

But what does it mean for Palantir—a company that, in the words of one former employee, essentially sells digital “filing cabinets” to customers like Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, Heineken beer, and General Mills—to be a lifestyle brand?

Lifestyle brands sell products that people buy to express their identities, whether they're Tesla super fans, Zyn bros, or Hydroflask water bottle girlies. These brands aren't necessarily successful because they have a superior product, but rather because they're skilled at “proposing an original point of view” and “influencing a social context,” argues the book Lifestyle Brands, cowritten by management professor Stefania Saviolo and brand consultant Antonio Marazza. Using the products they sell is a symbolic act, a way to “to signal status” or demonstrate “a sense of belonging to a group.”

Generally, lifestyle brands are known for products they sell to the public. People recognize Tesla as a company that sells cars, and Zyn as a company that sells nicotine pouches. To state the obvious, Palantir is not a clothing company. And the software it does sell is not consumer-facing. Its price tag is so large that, often, giant government agencies and corporations are the only ones that can afford it. Palantir is not exactly an obvious candidate for a lifestyle brand. And yet, despite the odds, Palantir has a fan base that includes many potential merch customers.

Palantir bros are not hard to encounter online: There are several Palantir-focused subreddits, the largest of which has 109,000 members. Some people on X have been able to amass huge followings by posting exclusively about the company throughout the day.

Palantir fans can obsessively focus on the company's stock price. They can behave like American football fans when it goes up, celebrating as if their team scored a touchdown. When it gets a big contract, it's as if their team got a new star player. In this context, it makes sense that people would want to purchase merch—it's like buying a jersey.

Palantir's fan base gradually expanded during the years that contractors for immigration enforcement and the military were least popular in Silicon Valley. For fans, Palantir was a contrarian dark horse that stood by its principles, even though others detested them.

For Palantir, becoming a lifestyle brand seems more about getting the company's fans to publicly identify with its brand and its mission. This is made explicit on a white note card, with CEO Alex Karp's signature, that was included with recent orders of Palantir merch.

“Thank you for your dedication to Palantir and our mission to defend the West,” the card reads. “The future belongs to those who believe and build. And we build to dominate.”

Younes has expressed a similar sentiment. “Palantir isn't just a software company,” he wrote on X in August. “It's a world view—western values, pro-warfighter, problem solving, conviction, dominant software, etc. that's why people rep the gear.”

These values have not always been popular in Silicon Valley. In fact, historically, they've been outright rejected. In 2018, thousands of Google workers rallied against the company's involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon project analyzing drone footage with AI. Conceding to the workers, Google chose to not renew its Maven contract but said it wouldn't stop working with the Pentagon. That same year, protests against Palantir were popping up in Palo Alto in response to the company's work with ICE. (ICE did not cancel any contracts.)

However, under the second Trump administration, the tech world is beginning to openly embrace aligning with the military—both transactionally, and symbolically. In June, the Army commissioned an elite group of tech executives to be “lieutenant colonels.” Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar was joined by Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil, and current Thinking Machines Lab adviser and former OpenAI chief research officer Bob McGrew, who also worked at Palantir.

Palantir's current merch store appears to capitalize on this vibe change and communicate that the company is doubling down on its reputation, branding, and mission. In an April letter to shareholders, Karp wrote that its mission “was for years dismissed as politically fraught and ill-advised.”

“We, the heretics, this motley band of characters, were cast out and nearly discarded by Silicon Valley,” Karp wrote. “And yet there are signs that some within the Valley have now turned a corner and begun following our lead.”

One of Palantir's first merch releases was a black shirt with a giant red graphic. The oblong shape resembles an oval projection of the earth. There are three lines inside the oval that evoke latitude-longitude lines, or a wireframe globe. In the direct center, there's the Palantir logo. Symbolically, it looks like Palantir is controlling the world.

Ironically, one of the most common misconceptions about Palantir is that it's one giant database with information from every single one of its clients. The company has published several blogs trying to dispel this myth on a factual basis.

This shirt, by contrast, appears to take a different approach. It symbolically mocks, embraces, and dismisses this misconception. It seemingly was created with precisely Karp's “heretics” in mind.

At the core of Palantir's merch identity is its insistence that all of the products are “Made in the U.S.A.” Like many other companies, Palantir wants to evoke a sense of pride in supporting American workers.

But it's very expensive to produce clothes made in the United States—especially ones with custom tags and high-quality materials, as the company claims. Palantir's head of strategic development has said that the goal of the merch store, financially, is to simply break even. When the website relaunched, Younes blamed tariffs for the higher cost of the merchandise. “This will not be a new revenue stream,” he posted in May 2024. Simply put, Palantir doesn't have to do this.

In fact, Palantir has actually tried and failed to run a merch store before. Archives of the old store show a simple white website with nondescript T-shirts and hats. At the time, some customers complained that they were cheaply made and unattractive. Palantir shut it down in 2023.

Palantir isn't alone. The defense tech company Anduril, which is known for embracing working with US immigration authorities early in its history, launched a “gear store” shortly after Palantir relaunched its own. It sells shiny black flight jackets, Hawaiian shirts (not unlike the ones CEO Palmer Luckey is known to sport), and T-shirts that say “workatanduril.com” in black sans serif text overlain with “DON'T” scrawled in black graffiti, seemingly in an attempt to look rebellious and cheeky. Like Palantir, the company is eager to note when its products are “Made in the USA.”

WIRED was unable to independently confirm details about the production of Palantir and Anduril merch, including whether it was made in America, or which manufacturers they used. Neither company responded to a request for comment on the topic.

Garments made in the US are typically made by immigrants, which make up more than 40 percent of the workforce. Many of them are undocumented, and can be compensated by tasks completed rather than being paid by the hour, which overwhelmingly adds up to far below the minimum wage.

Palantir has been doing a lot of work for ICE under Trump 2.0. Since April, it has been building “ImmigrationOS,” a new system for the agency to, ideally, have “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting. (Public documents are not clear about how ImmigrationOS would do this, or what data it would use.) ICE is paying Palantir $30 million to do this.

Palantir is scheduled to provide ICE with a prototype of ImmigrationOS on September 25. On September 18, it released new merch.

For decades, Mark Lemley's life as an intellectual property lawyer was orderly enough. He's a professor at Stanford University and has consulted for Amazon, Google, and Meta. “I always enjoyed that the area I practice in has largely been apolitical,” Lemley tells me. What's more, his democratic values neatly aligned with those of the companies that hired him.

But in January, Lemley made a radical move. “I have struggled with how to respond to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness,” he posted on LinkedIn. “I have fired Meta as a client.”

This is the Silicon Valley of 2025. Zuckerberg, now 41, had turned into a MAGA-friendly mixed martial arts fan who didn't worry so much about hate speech on his platforms and complained that corporate America wasn't masculine enough. He stopped fact-checking and started hanging out at Mar-a-Lago. And it wasn't only Zuckerberg. A whole cohort of billionaires seemed to place their companies' fortunes over the well-being of society.

When I meet Lemley at his office at Stanford this July, he is looking vacation-ready in a Hawaiian shirt. In the half year since he fired Meta, very few powerful people have followed his lead. Privately, they tell him, you go! Publicly, they're gone. Lemley has even considered how he might be gone if things get bad for anti-Trumpers. “Everybody I've talked to has a potential exit strategy,” he says. “Could I get citizenship here or there?”

For our politics issue, WIRED examines the state of tech's influence on governmental power—and the people who will change everything in the future.

It should be the best of times for the tech world, supercharged by a boom in artificial intelligence. But a shadow has fallen over Silicon Valley. The community still overwhelmingly leans left. But with few exceptions, its leaders are responding to Donald Trump by either keeping quiet or actively courting the government. One indelible image of this capture is from Trump's second inauguration, where a decisive quorum of tech's elite, after dutifully kicking in million-dollar checks, occupied front-row seats.

“Everyone in the business world fears repercussions, because this administration is vindictive,” says venture capitalist David Hornik, one of the few outspoken voices of resistance. So Silicon Valley's elite are engaged in a dangerous dance with a capricious administration—or as Michael Moritz, one of the Valley's iconic VCs, put it to me, “They're doing their best to avoid being held up in a protection racket.”

Just ask Tim Cook. In May, Apple's CEO took a pass on an 8,000-mile journey to join a presidential entourage in the Middle East. Trump noticed. In Qatar, the president said he had “a little problem” with Cook and the following day threatened a 25 percent tariff on iPhones.

Not surprisingly, when I offered some of the Valley's top executives the opportunity to vent this summer, few took the bait. Vacations seemed unusually long. Calendars were so packed that not a single slot was available for the next three weeks, four weeks, six weeks … when did you say your deadline was? One CEO notorious for logorrheic gabbing to reporters told me he was trying to “decompress” on politics. “But any time you want to talk AI or AI agents, please let me know!” he said.

It used to be that when tech's leaders fell short of their lofty values, employees kept them honest. Google workers famously pressured their executives to fight for diversity and avoid military contracts. Implicit was the threat that the activists could easily find jobs elsewhere.

Then Elon Musk came along and fired 80 percent of X's employees, and the app didn't collapse. Across the industry, diversity efforts are down and military contracts are up. In an April 2024 note to Google employees, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees not to “use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.” Free expression is also out of favor inside Meta, where an employee says the environment feels like the '90s: “When you went to work, you didn't bring your politics to the office, and you may not like the boss—but you do the job so you get paid,” they tell me. “Good luck finding a company that isn't like that now.”

What's happened to Silicon Valley? Why did the Ayn Rand–loving heroes of tech become Donald Trump's bootlickers? How did one of the supposedly smartest VCs wind up posting a manifesto that declared war on “trust and safety,” “tech ethics,” and “social responsibility”? What was the point of Jeff Bezos buying The Washington Post for civic benefit, as he claimed, and then right before the 2024 election, killing its Kamala Harris endorsement and changing its opinion section to editorials on “personal liberties and free markets”? And speaking of Cook, how is it that the most effective political tactic for the head of a $3.4 trillion company is to march into the Oval Office and solemnly present to Trump a glass-and-gold tchotchke?

This is Apple! Who knows what Cook—a man who has more in common with Martians than MAGA—was thinking as he stood before Trump and unboxed the most dubious, most obsequious product in the company's near-half-century. Would Steve Jobs have done that? My guess: He'd have told his team to send over a gold-plated iPod. Collect on Delivery.

Ever since Jobs began selling the first sleek Apple II's, digital technology has been touted as America's pride and future. In its own geeky way, tech spoke truth to power. But now, says Stanford professor of social ethics of science and technology Rob Reich, “an extraordinarily tiny number of billionaires who control the information ecosystem have made allyship with the most consequential and fearsome political power in the world. There's never been a time in history when those things have been combined.”

In a perverse sense this is good news for me—I cover that ecosystem and its oligarchs, so how great is it to be reporting on history? But in every other sense it's wildly disturbing. Obviously, my stories evolved with the industry. But here's something that took me by surprise: how quickly and decisively the visionaries I chronicled aligned themselves with Trump, a man whose values violently clashed with the egalitarian impulses of the digital revolution. How did I miss that? I revisited my familiar turf—which in this era seems suddenly unfamiliar—to find out.

For the first 30 years of my life, I did not touch a computer. I viewed those machines—for much of that time, mainframes clacking in rooms I never saw—as a dehumanizing force. I associated them with the war machine in Vietnam and the monotony of corporate life. That all changed in the early 1980s when I took an assignment to write about hackers for Rolling Stone.

To my shock and delight, I learned that the burgeoning PC industry was a nerdy successor to the political and cultural activism of the late 1960s. Some of the first computer startups sprang from the Homebrew Computer Club, organized by an antiwar activist. The club's moderator had led the technology wing of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. Even Bill Gates started out as a dope-toking rebel of sorts; his partner Paul Allen was a music freak who loved Jimi Hendrix. Apple cofounders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had barely grown out of their shaggy-haired days selling the “blue boxes” that allowed people to make illegal calls. Screw the Phone Company!

But even venture capitalists seemed to vibe with the feeling of revolution—as if the Weathermen switched from making bombs to doing IPO road shows.

I began a love affair with Silicon Valley. The wizards I met were changing the world with tools designed to uplift us—to give the common person the power of an expert. The electronic spreadsheet was sold as a business tool, but it was ultimately an antiestablishment weapon, because anyone with a low-cost PC could challenge the calculations of the executive suite. When Mitch Kapor, a former teacher of transcendental meditation, founded Lotus Development Corporation, which popularized the spreadsheet in the 1980s, he told his money guy that he valued people more than profits, and wanted to invest in his employees. “I was prepared for him to say no,” says Kapor. Fortunately for Kapor, the guy said yes.

In the famous “1984” Apple commercial for the Macintosh, an athlete flings a hammer at a Big Brother figure—she was out to pulverize authority. The headline of my Rolling Stone story about the Mac said it all: “The Whiz Kids Meet Darth Vader.” (Meaning IBM. Haha.) This was a righteous battle!

Of course, Silicon Valley was never all flowers and psychedelics. “For all that it might flatter itself with counterculture roots, making money and accumulating power has always been in the mainstream,” says Kapor. And of course, the Valley's politics always accommodated a strong libertarian strain.

But even venture capitalists seemed to vibe with the feeling of revolution—as if the Weathermen switched from making bombs to doing IPO road shows. When the internet arrived like a thunderclap, the ideological soundtrack became ear-splitting. In his celebrated 1996 “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,” my friend John Perry Barlow argued that the internet transcended earthbound laws and borders. “Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us,” he wrote.

Oh my God, did we post our hopes on the internet. When I first met them, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were wide-eyed idealists. Jeff Bezos came on like a buddy, eager to point out that Amazon employees, himself included, set up their computers on repurposed wooden doors instead of pricey desks. After my first conversation with Zuckerberg, he went home to a tiny apartment with no furniture.

And then the giants of the internet scaled up their companies to impose their own concepts of expression, identity, and context. Those once humble leaders reaped unimaginable rewards. Now they can't flaunt their riches enough—multiple homes, yachts, planes.

On a typically pleasant July day, I met up with Russell Hancock, who runs a think tank called Joint Venture Silicon Valley, in the living room of his Palo Alto home. He nabbed it during the 2000 tech crash; now you can't buy a shack in Paly without near-generational wealth. Page and Zuckerberg, unsatisfied with a single homestead, have scooped up nearby properties, transforming once idyllic streets into supervillain compounds.

“The people that are doing fabulously well, they're really having a terrific time,” Hancock says. For everyone else in Silicon Valley, the wealth gap is getting more punishing, more absurd. When Apple had its IPO in 1980, Steve Jobs' net worth topped an almost-unheard-of $100 million. Now Zuckerberg is reportedly offering AI researchers that much moolah for a single year's labor. Hancock brings up the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality that's popular among the World Bank crowd. Since the '90s, “we went from 30 on the Gini to 83,” he says. “Those are the conditions for the French Revolution.”

Another big change was unfolding. For the longest time, notes Chris Lehane, a former Bill Clinton staffer who has worked for companies like Airbnb and OpenAI, software “was almost like a fourth dimension.” Tech leaders could afford to stay out west and avoid politics. But then software products started to break down entire sectors of business. “These products were physically manifesting themselves in taxis, short-term rentals, and food delivery,” Lehane says, “bumping up against existing political systems, beliefs, laws.” Sometimes people died from that incursion. Old, beloved businesses closed. Local politicians got mad. To game the system, Silicon Valley jumped to the swamp. As one technologist in the current administration tells me, “The Valley now realizes it can't ignore politics, because politics won't ignore you.”

No wonder the public took a jaundiced view of the apps they couldn't stop using. By the mid-2010s, people were attacking the big buses that transported tech workers to and from San Francisco, Mountain View, and Menlo Park, where employees pulled lattes in micro-kitchens, enjoyed midday massages, and discussed provocative left-wing politics.

Perhaps the wizards of the PC and internet age were too successful. “We overdid it,” says Andy Hertzfeld, a programming legend who helped build the original Macintosh. “We were so idealistic in thinking everyone should use a computer and that we should make them lovable and fun.” The result, he laments, is a dystopia of phone-addicted teens and even the death of the homework essay.

Essentially, the big tech companies became The Phone Company—pernicious behemoths who enshittify their products to extract more profits. You can't even get a human customer-service person on the phone. In a 2024 survey of Silicon Valley residents, three-quarters of respondents felt tech companies have too much power; nearly as many believe they have lost their moral compass.

That's why, even before Citizen Trump entered the White House in 2017, I found that the narrative in my stories had changed. I used to draw on the tale of David versus Goliath. Now I was writing the Icarus legend. I kept seeing that figure's hubris in the tech elite. And it led them to Donald Trump.

History might remember Joseph R. Biden as the doddering figure in his last presidential debate. But a shockingly wide range of people in Silicon Valley view him as a progress-hating despot. I was taken aback at the fervor of their antipathy toward Uncle Joe.

Lehane, the former Clinton spokesperson, says that the administration and its agencies neither understood tech nor took much interest in it, “other than potentially trying to stop the technology from being developed.” Chief villains of the Biden era included Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan and Department of Justice antitrust head Jonathan Kanter. They methodically filed suits against Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. Khan blocked even modest mergers, threatening the entire ecosystem of smaller startups that now found it harder to negotiate profitable exits.

Biden's people make reasonable defenses—those companies do seem to have monopolies, after all. And look what happened to the design company Figma after Khan's FTC scrutinized its potential merger with Adobe. Two years later it had a spectacular IPO.

But one of Biden's biggest, most avoidable errors may have been his failure to invite Elon Musk to a 2021 event for electric vehicle manufacturers. The apparent reason was to keep the United Auto Workers happy, though the White House later claimed it was a fight over electric vehicle provisions that cost him his seat at the table. Even Reid Hoffman, one of the few tech billionaires who's speaking out against Trump, thinks that was crazy. “You should invite the electric vehicle leader to the electric vehicle summit!” he says. “That was part of the radicalization of Elon.”

By daring to challenge the tech industry, Biden threatened the moguls' business plans. Even worse, he hurt their feelings.

Or, at least, part of the public narrative about why Musk, who had previously donated to Democratic candidates, went full MAGA. Other theories include radicalization during Covid, after the government stopped work at his California plant; radicalization by way of Twitter and too many sycophantic posts; or just that he was nuts. In any event, he got busy boosting right-wing content on X (especially his own posts), loudly supporting Trump, and of course donating almost $300 million to the Trump campaign. It used to be that “if you were Republican, or you said you were anti-tax, you had to go into hiding,” says Ryan Petersen, CEO of the logistics company Flexport. “Elon made it safe for everyone.”

Another Biden blunder, in the eyes of the tech elite, was his administration's hostility to crypto. According to one top crypto executive I spoke with, the trouble started when one of the Dems' biggest funders, crypto billionaire Samuel Bankman-Fried, was exposed as a massive fraudster. “It was an enormous embarrassment for the Democrats,” the executive told me. “So what do you do when you're humiliated? You overreact.”

Before the scandal, companies had engaged in a constructive debate over regulation. But the SBF affair fortified the hard line that the head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, decided to take. (Gensler declined to be interviewed, though he did urge me to “keep up the good work at WIRED!”) Crypto people also blame Senator Elizabeth Warren, who many saw as Gensler's supporter.

The crypto industry funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump's campaign. “We were always focused exclusively on what is good for crypto,” says Coinbase's general counsel and former federal judge Paul Grewal. By midsummer 2024, Trump, who had earlier called cryptocurrencies a fraud, was appearing at a Bitcoin conference, promising to fire Gensler and make the US “the crypto capital of the planet.”

Even Biden's AI policy turned out to be radicalizing. The field's key figures had seemed happy enough as they too debated regulation. But then AI went red-hot, and those companies needed massive investments in infrastructure—and a less restrictive set of rules. Guess who was ready to deliver. “In terms of him as a human being or a visionary, nobody's a big Trump fan,” says Peter Leyden, an author (and former WIRED editor) writing a book on “the Great Progression” of technology. “But then AI hits—it's game time. So they decided, ‘Fuck it, we're gonna hook our tree to this crazy-ass Trump.'”

In his podcasts, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen complained bitterly about Biden's policies on antitrust, AI, and diversity, and he expressed outrage that Biden would not meet with him personally. In his view, Biden—and indeed the general public—had not kept its part in what Andreessen called The Deal.

Here's how he described it to New York Times columnist Ross Douthat: An entrepreneur starts a company, makes a lot of money, and the world benefits from the new technology. “Then in your obituary, it talks about what an incredible person you were, both in your business career and in your philanthropic career. And by the way, you're a Democrat, you're pro–gay rights, you're pro-abortion, you're pro all the fashionable and appropriate social causes of the time … This is the Deal.”

By daring to challenge the tech industry, Biden threatened the moguls' business plans. Even worse, he hurt their feelings. “It's impossible to exaggerate how offended they were,” says Nick Clegg, who was Meta's president of global affairs until early this year. In July 2024, Andreessen and his partner Ben Horowitz announced that they would be donating their dollars to Trump.

Some of Andreessen's gripes were over the top—no Marc, not all young employees lean Marxist—but he wasn't the only one raging over diversity programs and political correctness. Across the Valley, it seemed, the Deal was off. “There's a general sense in tech, even in the center left, that identity politics have gone too far,” says Leyden. Trae Stephens, the Founders Fund VC and Anduril cofounder, has seen it too. “My friends who are Democrats are not switching parties,” he tells me. “They're just really tired of the Democrats.” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, had been happily affiliated with the left. Earlier this year, he said on social media that politically he's “homeless.” Though he seems to spend a lot of time with Trump.

And then there's Zuckerberg. I interviewed him frequently during Trump's first term and was convinced he had genuine compassion for immigrants. I can't recall him saying a nice thing about Trump. Sometime in the past year or so, positive words began spilling out. When Trump literally dodged a bullet on the campaign trail last summer and pumped his fist in the air, Zuckerberg called him a “badass.” Then came visits to the Joe Rogan podcast, where he griped that corporations were insufficiently manly, and Mar-a-Lago, where he reportedly blamed his former COO Sheryl Sandberg—the company's champion of diversity—for all that unnecessary policing of toxic content and misinformation (a criticism he later denied). Now, Zuckerberg is not so much about immigrants. He and his wife, Priscilla, had funded a school in East Palo Alto, a low-income enclave. They are shutting it down.

“I see Mark as a political shape-shifter whose number one goal is the survival and thriving of the company,” a Meta executive tells me. “Trump is so transactional that you can fight him and get fucked, or you can try to work with him and get a percentage of what you want.”

To tech's power elite, Trump's tit-for-tat nature is not a bug but a feature. “A lot of these guys find Trump very familiar,” says Clegg. “You go down to Mar-a-Lago, and he goes, ‘Let's do a deal.' That charm of Trump is incredibly intoxicating to Silicon Valley tech bros.”

Was Biden really so bad for tech? Democrats I spoke to who were in the White House or in Congress in those years say they were simply holding an overreaching industry to account—for its own good. “I don't think we screwed up on policy,” says Tim Wu, who was Biden's special assistant for tech and competition. “Our goal was to keep the tech industry healthy by forcing it to continue to innovate.”

The strategy doesn't seem to have worked. In the first months of 2025, the Trump administration lifted regulations that irritated the tech industry. “America's AI Action Plan” focuses on establishing US dominance. So long, regulation! The crypto bros saw not only the departure of the hated SEC chair Gensler but the passage of a bill that legitimized their industry. And Trump appointees recently overruled the Justice Department's antitrust division to allow a major tech merger to go through.

Trump's tariffs, of course, present big problems for business. But it turns out that you can run pretty well on a bended knee. Take Jensen Huang, who heads Nvidia. The administration was expected to take a hard line on selling chips to China. Huang unleashed a full-throttled lobbying effort that took him from Mar-a-Lago to Saudi Arabia. He pledged $500 billion in US investments. He bad-mouthed Biden to a congressional committee. By the time Huang was done, Trump was calling him a friend and easing export controls on his chips. When Trump spoke at an AI Summit in July, Huang was there to celebrate—and wisely not taking credit. When it was Huang's turn on stage, he got straight to the point. “America's unique advantage that no other country could possibly have,” he said, “is President Trump.”

Later, Huang learned that the administration would help itself to a 15 percent cut of gross sales to China. Not long afterward, Trump grabbed 10 percent of Intel. It seems that America's “unique advantage” is relentless in grabbing power for himself, even from those who debase themselves before him. In the long run, these deluded CEOs may realize this isn't realpolitik. It's a suicide pact.

Bradley Tusk is a political consultant for tech companies. Uber and FanDuel have enjoyed his services as they rewrote the rules of their industries, and he's used to political rough and tumble. As he sees it, Trump's tactics are the government moving fast and breaking things.

When we talk, Tusk rattles off what he views as the components of US tech exceptionalism—independent markets and institutions, freedom of speech, intellectual property protections, strong educational institutions, decent immigration policy. Then his voice gets hard. “Trump is doing the opposite of every single one of those things,” he says. “There is definitely potential that he will destroy everything that makes the US economy unique and successful.”

Trump's tariffs, of course, present big problems for business. But it turns out that you can run pretty well on a bended knee.

Start with immigration. Perhaps no group of techies has ridden Trump's coattails more than the four chatty investor-bros who host the All In podcast. Three of the “besties,” as they call themselves, were born overseas. During the election season, two besties, venture capitalists Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks, threw a fundraiser at Sacks' house with tickets as high as $300,000. Soon after, Trump rewarded them by going on their podcast. (Sacks is now Trump's AI and crypto czar.) Some of the questions were big fat softballs like, “I never understood why the [border] wall was controversial.” But even they couldn't get behind his immigration policy. Didn't Trump recognize that the tech world thrives on foreign-born wizards?

To their astonishment, he not only agreed but promised that in his administration, any foreign student who completes a degree would get a green card. The besties were giddy.

It was too good to be true. Hours later, the MAGA base aflame, the Trump campaign issued a statement negating what he'd said. Now that he's back in the White House, he and his vice president have remained two-faced—assuring tech audiences that they want the best foreign students while making it harder for companies to hire and retain that talent. At one point Trump moved to block any foreigner from enrolling in America's oldest university. That hasn't happened yet, but this summer the Department of Homeland Security proposed a new regulation that limits foreign student visas to four years—not enough to get a PhD or, for many, even an undergraduate degree. The number of students coming from overseas has tanked.

“We're definitely seeing the chilling effect,” says Harj Taggar, a managing partner at Y Combinator. While YC's international founders have so far managed to enter the country, applicants with student visas are more reluctant to leave school to join the program. He's seeing foreign students consider going to London to work or start companies. “They feel it's maybe not as safe to be here,” he says. “That makes me really sad.”

I've got a few more reasons for Taggar to feel really sad: the mass cancellation of science and research funding, for one. Goodbye, next generation of engineers and computer scientists. “In the name of punishing woke-ism, we're going to absolutely hobble the innovation engine that has created the economic gains of the last 50 years,” says Hornik, the venture capitalist.

Then there's the mounting effect of Trump's favor-collecting and favoritism—buying that chunk of Intel, claiming that slice of Nvidia's sales. In corruption-riddled countries, winners aren't chosen by merit but by apparatchiks and strongmen. Those nations are doomed to second- or third-tier status. In his preelection appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, Zuckerberg said as much himself. “At least the US has the rule of law,” he remarked. “If other governments decide that they're going to go after you, you don't always get a clear shake at defending yourself on the rules.” Guess what—now we're like those other governments! Zuckerberg, no dummy, has probably figured this out, but now he's locked into Trumpland, outplayed in a real-life game of Risk.

Many of the people I spoke with for this story are centrist liberals. They are a disheartened bunch, and talking to them was hazardous to my own heart. In interview after interview, I asked them what, if anything, might force the industry to confront its dim longer-term prospects. Their answers were vague. The midterm election? An economic collapse? One Silicon Valley figure suggested, “It could be as simple as 10 Republican senators discovering they actually have backbones.”

Or 10 big-time CEOs, I might add. They can unbend their knees and perhaps revive some of the Valley's soul. Or at least stop ripping it apart. And while they're at it, stop making it so easy for the government to usher in an AI-powered surveillance state.

Maybe that's the thing I got most wrong about Silicon Valley. Those Davids I wrote about seemed fearless and full of verve as they challenged what was possible and rode the power of the chip and the net. I mistook this for character. They may believe, as Moritz told me, that submitting to Trump's protection racket protects their shareholders. But tech giants are certainly capable of standing up for the long-term viability of their industry. And for democracy. So far they are doing the opposite. “I think they have made a bad deal,” says Tim Wu. “Everyone who thought they could work some deal with Trump ends up getting burned, if not imprisoned.”

There will probably be no reckoning. Tech leaders, like all rich people, always have alternatives to life in a declining country. Reid Hoffman has his, as he put it, “contingency plans.” Another source for this story let drop that he's getting Portuguese citizenship. Lovely country. But it's hard to imagine myself as a young reporter, roaming the streets of Lisbon and finding the excitement and promise I discovered in California. It's even harder to imagine a young reporter finding that spirit in the industry as it stands today. The way I now feel in Silicon Valley is how Sam Altman described himself politically: homeless.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Zoomtopia 2025: Innovation, AI, and the Future of Work","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/zoomtopia-2025-innovation-ai-and-the-future-of-work-179925.html","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:01:50 GMT","

The annual Zoomtopia event has become something of a barometer for the future of work. This year's virtual gathering on September 17 carried the theme “Zoom for the People,” a phrase that framed the company's strategy around empowerment, human connection, and artificial intelligence.

However, the big question looming over the event was whether Zoom could innovate fast enough to remain central in a world shifting back to the office, while also keeping pace with the AI race that has engulfed every technology company.

Let's walk through the five key questions this year's event raised — and answered, at least in part.

The elephant in the room at Zoomtopia was the undeniable drift of U.S. employers back toward in-person work. From financial services firms mandating three days a week in the office to tech companies quietly trimming remote options, the pendulum has swung back after the all-remote extremes of 2020–2022.

That shift doesn't kill the need for video conferencing, but it certainly threatens the growth curves Zoom enjoyed in its early pandemic surge.

Zoom's answer? Make meetings not just a substitute for being in person, but something more valuable. CEO Eric Yuan emphasized that Zoom is now an “AI work platform,” not just a communication tool. He underscored that the company is reinventing how people live and work, blending video, voice, and automation into workflows that aim to turn “moments of connection into milestones of completion.”

The introduction of more advanced AI Companion features and discussions about building digital twins of users suggest that Zoom wants to make remote or hybrid meetings more productive than anything that could happen in a traditional conference room.

Here's the challenge: Will that be enough? For employees who view remote meetings as second-best, or for companies convinced culture requires hallway conversations, Zoom's innovations may not entirely neutralize the gravitational pull of the office.

If one theme dominated Zoomtopia 2025, it was, to no one's surprise, artificial intelligence. Yuan's keynote featured his own AI avatar, playfully introduced as a way to “save him untold hours of laborious, repetitive tasks.”

Beyond the novelty, Zoom revealed a deeper strategy: AI Companion 3.0, which now integrates note-taking, meeting summarization, task automation, and eventually digital twin technology.

The vision is ambitious. A digital twin would know your preferences, contacts, and workflows well enough to handle scheduling, travel, and even parts of project execution. Yuan was clear that users remain the “boss,” but the promise is a personal AI manager living inside Zoom.

Other announcements reinforced the AI-first strategy. The company highlighted three priorities: improving meeting effectiveness, delivering line-of-business value across various industries, and transforming Zoom into an AI-driven platform.

Customers from Talkspace to Upwork demonstrated how AI-enhanced Zoom workflows are already creating efficiencies and new opportunities.

Still, differentiation remains tricky. Microsoft has integrated Copilot into Teams and made it a fundamental element of Windows. Google continues to build AI into Workspace and its Beam video platform. Even Cisco is layering AI into Webex.

Zoom's AI push is bold, but whether it will feel distinctly different or simply catch up remains to be seen.

Zoom's leadership used Zoomtopia to distill its strategy into three pillars, all tied to the company's mission of “connecting people to progress”:

Layered on top of those pillars are new programs designed to expand Zoom's relevance. For example, CMO Kimberly Storin introduced the “Zoom Solopreneur 50,” an index that will spotlight individuals and micro-businesses building billion-dollar dreams on the platform. This capability ties neatly into Zoom's broader ambition: to be indispensable across all tiers of the economy, from individual consultants to multinational enterprises.

If Zoom's AI narrative is about innovation, its partnership narrative is about survival. The keynote featured high-profile collaborations with Cisco and Google, both of which could easily be seen as competitors.

The Cisco deal will bring a Zoom-certified app to Cisco Room devices, underscoring Zoom's commitment to an open ecosystem. As Cisco's President and Chief Product Officer, Jeetu Patel put it during the keynote, “You can't create walled gardens…our technologies must work seamlessly together.” For enterprise customers deeply invested in Cisco hardware, this move reduces friction and keeps Zoom in the conversation.

Meanwhile, the Google Beam partnership promises a next-generation meeting experience that makes it feel like the person you're meeting is right in the same room with you. Google Beam's high-fidelity video platform, integrated directly into Zoom, is designed to enrich human connection in a way that rivals augmented or mixed reality systems.

To its credit, these partnerships show Zoom's pragmatism. The company recognizes it cannot dominate hardware or cloud infrastructure as its rivals do. Instead, it seeks to integrate and amplify its efforts. By leaning into partnerships, Zoom extends its reach, avoids isolation, and reinforces its pitch as the “Switzerland” of workplace communications.

Zoomtopia 2025 painted an optimistic picture. AI-driven features, bold digital twin visions, philanthropic commitments to AI education, and marquee partnerships gave the event plenty of headline-worthy content. The company's leaders positioned Zoom as not only a conferencing tool, but a platform that “supercharges human collaboration” with AI.

Yet skepticism lingers. The back-to-the-office trend, while not universal, is real in the United States. If more organizations default to in-person meetings, the absolute ceiling on Zoom's usage could flatten.

Furthermore, Zoom faces entrenched rivals with enormous advantages. Microsoft Teams remains bundled with Office 365. Google Workspace integrates deeply with Gmail and Docs. Cisco controls the enterprise hardware layer. All three are layering AI just as aggressively as Zoom.

The risk is that Zoom becomes a feature, not a platform. Its innovations may seem incremental rather than transformative if competitors introduce similar tools. Even the digital twin concept, while intriguing, competes with parallel visions emerging from OpenAI, Anthropic, and cloud providers.

So, is Zoom innovating sufficiently? Yes, in the sense that it continues to release new AI-driven features and expand its ecosystem. Is it adopting AI quickly enough? Absolutely, but whether it's distinctive enough remains in question. The overall strategy — simple, AI-powered, and customer-centric — is coherent and compelling. Partnerships with Cisco and Google reinforce its relevance.

In the end, Zoom may find itself fighting gravity. Hybrid work ensures a baseline demand, yet the return-to-office momentum dilutes its centrality. Competitors with broader ecosystems may outpace Zoom's standalone appeal. The company is not doomed — it is clearly still innovating — but Zoomtopia 2025 left some wondering whether innovation alone will be enough.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","The PC's Sharpened Edge: HP's Singular Focus on Security and AI","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-pcs-sharpened-edge-hps-singular-focus-on-security-and-ai-179921.html","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 12:01:44 GMT","

In the relentless arms race of cybersecurity, the advantage often goes to the side with the clearest focus. For decades, the personal computer has been the central battleground for digital conflict, the primary target for threat actors, and the last line of defense for users.

A new report from HP Wolf Security, released on September 12, illuminates a sobering reality: attackers aren't just creating new superweapons; they are perfecting the art of digital deception, using the very tools built into our systems against us.

The report's findings are a stark reminder that as technology advances, so does the sophistication of those who seek to exploit it. But beyond the immediate threats, this landscape reveals a more profound strategic truth.

In an industry of tech conglomerates juggling everything from cloud infrastructure to data servers, HP's intense, almost singular focus on the PC ecosystem is proving to be a profound competitive advantage. This concentration is not a limitation; it is the driving force behind the company's leadership in both endpoint security and the burgeoning era of the AI PC.

This week, we'll examine how HP's sharp focus on the PC ecosystem gives it a competitive edge. Then, we'll close with my Product of the Week, a car from Audi due around 2027 called the Concept C, which is on my short list of cars I want to own in the future.

The latest HP Wolf Security Threat Insights Report makes one thing clear: cybercriminals are masters of refinement. They are increasingly relying on “living-off-the-land” (LOTL) techniques, a notoriously sneaky method where they use legitimate, pre-installed tools within the Windows environment to carry out attacks.

As Ian Pratt, global head of security for personal systems at HP, notes, this creates a significant dilemma for security teams who struggle to distinguish “green flags from red.”

The report details several ingenious campaigns that highlight this trend:

As HP threat researcher Alex Holland states, “Attackers aren't reinventing the wheel, but they are refining their techniques.” By chaining together multiple legitimate tools and hiding their actions within common file types, they create a level of noise that makes traditional, detection-based antivirus software increasingly unreliable.

The data is compelling: HP found that at least 13% of email threats bypassed one or more email gateway scanners, proving that determined attackers can and will get through initial defenses.

This unique corporate structure has become HP's strategic superpower.

Unlike competitors such as Dell Technologies, whose massive portfolio spans servers, enterprise storage, networking, and cloud services, HP's business is overwhelmingly concentrated on personal systems and printing. Since its split from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), HP has been able to dedicate its engineering, research, and development resources almost exclusively to the endpoint — the device sitting on your desk or in your lap.

This focus fosters a deep understanding of the PC that a more diversified company may struggle to match. For a company like Dell, the PC is one product line among many. For HP, the PC is the core business, creating an imperative to lead in innovation, reliability, and, most importantly, security. With no sprawling enterprise division to distract, the company's success is tied directly to the quality and security of its PCs.

This dedication has culminated in the development of HP Wolf Security, a platform that operates on a fundamentally different principle than traditional antivirus software. Instead of relying solely on detecting a threat, it operates on a Zero Trust model of containment and isolation. It assumes that a threat might get through and uses micro-virtualization to open risky attachments, links, and downloads in their own isolated containers. The malware can detonate, but it's trapped inside a virtual machine, unable to harm the underlying PC or access user data. It's the digital equivalent of handling a suspicious package in a bomb disposal chamber.

This defense-in-depth approach is a direct and powerful answer to the LOTL techniques highlighted in the threat report.

HP's sharpened focus on the PC is now paying dividends in the next major technological shift: the AI PC.

The era of the AI PC is defined by the ability to run powerful generative AI models locally on the device, thanks to the integration of neural processing units (NPUs) alongside traditional CPUs and GPUs. Achieving this requires a masterful orchestration of hardware and software — a level of integration possible only for a company with a profound understanding of PC architecture.

Crucially, security is the bedrock upon which the AI PC revolution will be built. As users begin to run AI models on their personal and corporate data locally, the PC will transform into an even more valuable target for attackers. The need for a locked-down, resilient device will be non-negotiable.

In this environment, HP's long-term investment in hardware-based security gives it an almost insurmountable lead. The proven success of HP Wolf Security builds trust, making it a key selling point for the next generation of AI PCs. Customers will favor platforms that deliver powerful AI performance while protecting sensitive data with security rooted below the operating system at the silicon level.

The focus that built a best-in-class security suite is the same focus now building the most trusted platform for personal AI.

While companies like HP are building more secure systems, user vigilance remains essential. The threats described in the report prey on human behavior. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself:

The latest HP Wolf Security report serves as a crucial barometer for the cyberthreat landscape. It shows us that the future of attacks lies not in radical new inventions, but in the subtle and sophisticated perfection of old techniques designed to slip past our defenses by hiding in plain sight. Traditional, detection-based security is no longer sufficient to counter this evolving threat.

In this challenging environment, HP's unwavering focus on the personal computer has allowed it to architect a more resilient defense. By pioneering a containment-based security model, it has created a platform that can withstand the very attacks that are designed to be undetectable. This same strategic focus is now positioning HP to lead the AI PC revolution, where performance and security are not just features, but foundational requirements.

For users and businesses alike, the lesson is clear. In an age of ever-increasing digital threats, the most secure path forward is with technology forged from a clear and dedicated vision.





Audi Concept C embodies the brand's new design philosophy with a vertical frame front, retractable roof, and titanium-toned body, previewing the future of its all-electric sports cars.

For years, we've seen concept cars that feel more like fantastical sculptures than blueprints for the future. They scream for attention but often lack a clear connection to the brand that built them.

This month, however, Audi tore the veil off something truly special, Concept C. In doing so, it has not only charted its own future but has also quietly put the entire industry on notice. Concept C isn't just a car; it's a statement of intent, and frankly, it's the most compelling vision of the grand electric tourer I've ever seen.

The immediate comparison many are making is to Jaguar's recently teased Type 00 concept, a wild, low-slung hypercar with aggressive aerodynamics. While the Jaguar is a stunning piece of design, it feels like a beautiful outlier, a nod to past glories like the XJ220 rather than a logical next step.

The Audi Concept C, by contrast, feels like the perfect, evolutionary leap for its parent brand. It takes the sleek, muscular DNA of the current Audi e-tron GT (which I drive). It infuses it with technology and a breathtakingly futuristic design language. This is a car that could only come from Audi, embodying its core philosophy of “Vorsprung durch Technik” (Advancement through Technology).

Visually, the Concept C is a masterpiece of minimalist aggression. Its liquid-metal-effect paint flows over a body devoid of sharp creases, appearing almost organic. The traditional grille is gone, replaced by an illuminated “Digital Grille” that can display communication signals to pedestrians and other vehicles.

The technology beneath is even more radical. Audi hints at a next-generation solid-state battery platform, promising a range of over 600 miles and 10%-80% charging in under 15 minutes. The interior eschews physical screens entirely, instead projecting a fully holographic, AI-powered interface onto a crystal dashboard that anticipates the driver's needs. It's a seamless blend of luxury and forward-thinking tech that makes even the most advanced current EVs feel dated.



The Audi Concept C interior combines minimalist design with intuitive technology, creating a refined and distraction-free driving experience.

This car is a clear signal of where Audi's design language is headed. The hard shoulder lines of the past decade are being softened, replaced by flowing, aerodynamic surfaces. The integration of light as a communication tool will become a signature element, moving beyond simple indicators to become an interactive part of the vehicle.

The Concept C proves that the future of car design is not about adding more screens, but about making the technology disappear into a clean, intuitive, and luxurious environment.

Of course, a vision this advanced won't come cheap. Should the Concept C make it to production — and Audi insiders suggest a limited run is planned for the end of the decade — expect a price tag that comfortably exceeds $250,000. It will compete in the rarified air of ultra-luxury EVs, and based on this concept, it will be worth every penny. It is a masterful fusion of brand identity, stunning design, and plausible next-generation technology.

It's not just my Product of the Week, it's the blueprint for the car of the decade — and I really, really want one.

The Concept C images featured in this article are credited to Audi.

We're back with another Startup Radar, spotlighting up-and-coming early stage startups across the Seattle region. 

These founders are building tech to boost recruiting, marketing, cooking, and AI workflows. 

We brought back “Mean VC” to provide some AI-powered analysis of each pitch, based on the descriptions below.

Check out past Startup Radar posts here, and email me at taylor@geekwire.com to flag other companies and startup news. 

CookShelf

Founded: 2024

The business: Brings cookbook collections into the digital age with an app that lets users search their own books by ingredient or dish and then points them to the right page. The app doesn't reproduce full recipes out of respect for authors and copyright law. CookShelf, which is bootstrapped, acquired Eat Your Books last year and recently launched its app, priced at $39.99/year or $4.99/month.

Leadership: CEO Katie Thacher previously worked in product management at Amazon on Kindle apps and Amazon Music. Jane Kelly, co-founder of Eat Your Books, is COO at CookShelf. Former Amazonian Venkat Ramamurthy leads engineering.

Mean VC: “Acquiring Eat Your Books and finally giving cookbook lovers a searchable, legal way to unlock their shelves is a savvy move with a clear niche audience. But charging $40 a year for glorified indexing feels like a tough sell when most people just yell at Google or TikTok for free recipes in under 10 seconds.”

Dripwave

Founded: 2024

The business: Targets e-commerce brands with an AI-powered email campaign generator that can instantly create multiple variations of marketing emails. The idea is to help companies boost open rates and conversions. Dripwave is bootstrapped and working with brands and email marketing agencies in a private beta.

Leadership: CEO Danesh Badlani was a product manager at Microsoft. He co-founded Dripwave with Aidan Rosswood, a former engineer at Meta, and Chong Sun, a former machine learning specialist at Chewy and Amazon.

Mean VC: “Automating email campaign variations for e-commerce brands hits a real pain point where marginal gains in open rates and conversions translate directly into revenue. The problem is every Email Service Provider and marketing automation platform already bolts on ‘AI email magic,' so unless Dripwave shows 10x better results, you're just another SaaS widget fighting Mailchimp's crumbs.”

Mayura AI

Founded: 2025

The business: Described as “your personal AI workforce,” Mayura offers an array of custom-built AI tools including multi-agent workflows, document analysis, and more. It is targeting small businesses and is currently working with three entrepreneurs and two startups.

Leadership: Founder and CEO Matt Savarino spent nearly six years at Microsoft, most recently as a principal software engineer. He also was a design and frontend development manager at Disney. 

Mean VC: “Positioning as a ‘personal AI workforce' for small businesses is a bold, expansive pitch that could resonate with founders drowning in admin and workflows. But with only a handful of users and a buffet of generic features, Mayura risks being seen as yet another shiny AI sandbox rather than a must-have business tool.”

Skillsheet

Founded: 2025

The business: A candidate-sourcing platform that uses video profiles to surface communication and problem-solving skills. It also performs real-time, privacy-preserving identity verification before any recruiter engagement to prevent fake or misrepresented candidates. The bootstrapped company has a handful of paying customers.

Leadership: CEO Aniket Naravanekar previously led product at Seattle startups avante and CHEQ, and spent more than 11 years at Microsoft. Co-founder and CTO Aditi Bendre was previously a director of engineering at Microsoft.

Mean VC: “Highlighting soft skills and adding real-time identity verification tackles two glaring flaws in traditional candidate sourcing, giving recruiters something they actually complain about daily. Still, video profiles are a double-edged sword — great in theory, but in practice they risk bias, candidate drop-off, and the eternal ‘why not just use LinkedIn with a Loom link?' problem.”

Seattle's tech scene got the national treatment this past weekend as the Wall Street Journal detailed the fallout from layoffs in a city heavily dependent on Microsoft and Amazon.

The story opens with a striking anecdote from a coffee shop near Microsoft's headquarters that is seeing former tech workers apply for barista roles. It then details broader trends in the Seattle region — decreased retail spending in tech-heavy districts; restaurant closures; a cooling housing market; commercial real estate vacancies; and service businesses such as moving companies seeing slowdowns.

The story also highlighted weakness in payroll and sales tax revenue, contributing to Seattle's projected $146 million budget deficit.

Amazon and Microsoft account for nearly 40% of the workforce in the Seattle area. And after years of growth, they are cutting jobs or curbing hiring.

And while the AI boom may be a boon for their stock prices, it may slow hiring at both tech giants. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in June that he expects the corporate workforce to shrink in the next few years due to “efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Here's more from Wall Street Journal reporter Sebastian Herrera, via LinkedIn:

Of course, broader economic factors play a role in any local economy. And local and state politics are also important. But from the many sources we talked to for this story, the message was clear: This prominent tech hub that was largely built by Amazon and Microsoft is now on wobblier ground, and locals are feeling the impact. What's happening in Seattle is a study of a tech-heavy economy transforming as many tech jobs disappear or are upended by AI.

The tech industry accounts for a whopping 30% of the economy in the Seattle region, according to a report from CompTIA. That ranks second in the U.S. behind San Jose. Tech also accounts for more than 12% of the overall workforce in the Seattle area.

Perhaps it signals a need to diversify Seattle's economy beyond tech — an idea echoed by Seattle mayoral front-runner Katie Wilson in a recent interview with GeekWire.

Layoffs are also hitting the region's startup ecosystem — Rec Room, Glowforge, and LevelTen Energy have all cut staff in recent months, as noted by GeekWire's layoff tracker.

But perhaps all the layoffs and hiring pullbacks could lead to opportunity for entrepreneurship in Seattle.

The WSJ story ended with two examples of former tech workers who were laid off and launched their own endeavors. 

Tech community leaders at a recent GeekWire party noted the hiring opportunities for startups amid layoffs at larger companies — a stronger talent pool, with less competition from tech giants. There is also potential for startup creation. “There are some great people being let out of these companies — which could mean more founders and first-time founders,” said Voyager Capital's Erik Benson.

In our story last month — Can Seattle own the AI era? — investors and founders shared optimism for the city startup ecosystem, in part due to the density of engineering talent that's crucial to building AI-native companies.

Meanwhile, venture capital funding to Pacific Northwest startups has nearly doubled through the first eight months of this year, compared to the same time period in 2024, according to GeekWire's funding tracker.

So while old jobs vanish, new opportunities in AI could emerge — perhaps not at the same scale as a big tech hiring boom, but in a way that could redefine the Seattle region as a hub for startup creation.

After 5-and-a-half years as T-Mobile's CEO, Mike Sievert will step down from the role on Nov. 1 — succeeded by current Chief Operating Officer Srini Gopalan, who will look to continue building on the resurgence sparked by John Legere more than a decade ago.

The Bellevue, Wash.-based wireless company made the surprise announcement Monday morning. Sievert, 56, will become vice chairman of T-Mobile and its board, remaining on the management team to advise the company's leaders in key strategic areas, the company said.

Gopalan, 54, joined T-Mobile as COO in 2023 after five years on the board. He previously led Deutsche Telekom's Germany business, where he doubled growth and expanded its fiber network. He also held senior roles at Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, and Capital One.

Once the scrappy outsider, T-Mobile is now the largest U.S. telecom company by market capitalization, ahead of AT&T and Verizon. When Legere took over in 2012, the company was a distant No. 4 in the wireless industry. It used its “Un-carrier” strategy and a hard-won merger with Sprint to disrupt the market with lower prices, network gains, and customer perks.

In June of this year, T-Mobile declared its network the best in the nation, citing independent testing. Speaking with GeekWire after that announcement, Gopalan emphasized “liberating customers from false choices” — the perceived trade-offs between network quality and value — and expressed confidence in T-Mobile's ability to lead the market well into the future.

“We are so far ahead, and we're in such a good position to lead, not just in 5G but in 6G, as well,” Gopalan said, citing factors including its head start in deploying a 5G standalone core, its spectrum holdings, and technical advantages such as uplink carrier aggregation at 2.5 GHz.

Gopalan spoke about joining T-Mobile as a relative newcomer and being struck by the company's passion and drive. He credited earlier leadership teams for achieving so much even as they were “playing with one hand tied behind their back,” as he put it.

Sievert, a 13-year veteran of the company, has been a central figure during the Un-carrier era. Over his tenure, T-Mobile has grown from fewer than 30 million customers to more than 130 million. He previously worked at Microsoft, AT&T, E-Trade, IBM, and Procter & Gamble.

Appearing with Gopalan on CNBC after the announcement Monday morning, Sievert was asked about the timing of his decision to step down, given that he still has many years left in his own career. He said the move was driven by the fact that Gopalan is ready to lead.

True to form, Sievert leaned on superlatives — saying it's T-Mobile's philosophy to pass the baton during a “time of unbelievable success.” He pointed to the company's “greatest Q2 ever” and “greatest year of growth ever” as evidence this is the right moment to make the transition.

In that vein, he said T-Mobile just experienced its “biggest iPhone weekend” ever, with sales and customer switching from the new iPhone launch both up double digits from last year.

In the CNBC interview, Gopalan showed some rhetorical flair of his own, describing his vision for “truly unleashing the Un-carrier.” 

For years, he said, T-Mobile's disruptive strategy was constrained because it hadn't “always had the best network.” Now, he argued, the company can combine network leadership with “digital skills that are way superior to anyone else.”

Asked to define those digital skills, Gopalan pointed to AI and automation that simplifies a variety of processes, citing new tools to make switching carriers much easier. The ultimate goal, he said, is to “bring the best of tech to make life incredibly easy for customers.”

Oura Health Oy, the maker of the Oura health and fitness ring, is raising $875 million in a new Series E financing round valuing it around $10.9 billion, according to a new report from Bloomberg. 

The round, which is expected to close by the end of the month, would double the company's $5 billion valuation from its Series D round announced last December. The report notes that the Series E round could still exceed $900 million. 

Oura has sold 5.5 million rings to date, a notable increase from the 2.5 million reported in June 2024. The company is expected to generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year, doubling the $500 million it made in 2024. As for 2026, the company forecasts sales to exceed $1.5 billion. 

The company plans to use the new funding to scale production, further expand internationally, and invest in product development.

Bloomberg notes that the company's recent growth has been driven by female consumers, retail store sales, purchases made through health savings accounts, and expansion into international markets.

Oracle is shaking up its executive suite as it sets its sights set on AI infrastructure dominance. The company announced Monday that it is promoting Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to co-CEO roles.  

Magouyrk joined Oracle in 2014 from Amazon Web Services. He was a founding member of Oracle's cloud engineering team and has served as the president of Oracle's cloud infrastructure business unit for more than a decade.  

Sicilia has served as the president of Oracle's industries division since June. He held several different roles at the company since he joined through Oracle's acquisition of project portfolio management company Primavera Systems in 2008.  

Safra Catz, who has been Oracle's CEO since 2014, is moving into a new role as the executive vice chair of Oracle's board of directors.  

“Today, Oracle is recognized as the cloud of choice for both AI training and inferencing. I'm very proud of that,” Catz said in a statement. “Oracle's technology and business have never been stronger. And our breathtaking growth rate points to an even more prosperous future. At this time of strength is the right moment to pass the CEO role to the next generation of capable executives.”  

While traditionally known as a cloud infrastructure provider, Oracle has recently started to cement its place in the AI infrastructure race as well. Earlier this year, the company announced its participation in the $500 billion Stargate Project, alongside OpenAI and SoftBank, to build data centers and AI infrastructure in the U.S.  

Earlier this month, it was reported that the company inked a landmark deal with OpenAI to supply the AI company with $300 billion worth of compute. On Friday, Reuters reported that the company was signing a smaller — but still sizable — $20 billion compute deal with Meta.  

TechCrunch reached out to Oracle for more information on the transition.

Google's AI assistant, Gemini, is coming to your TV. On Monday, the company announced it's introducing Gemini for Google TV, allowing TV owners to engage in free-flowing, natural language conversations with the AI. 

When fully rolled out, this expansion of Gemini to a new platform will bring Google's AI to over 300 million active Google TV and other Android TV OS-powered devices. 

In terms of TV-related questions, Google suggests its Gemini AI could be used to help people with different interests settle on something to watch that they would both like, or to catch you up on what you missed in a past season of a favorite show. You could also get Gemini to help you find a movie or show when you can't remember the title or ask about a title's reviews to help determine if it's worth watching.

However, because it's Gemini, you can ask any other type of question, too, just as you could with the AI chatbot on your smartphone.

 For instance, kids and parents could use the AI to get homework help or brainstorm school project ideas, families could use Gemini to plan their next vacation, or individual users could leverage the AI to teach themselves a new skill, among other things.

The company stresses that Gemini's addition doesn't mean that you won't be able to do the same things you used to be able to do through the (non-AI) Google Assistant integration. Those commands will still work, says Google.

The Gemini rollout to Google TV begins on the TCL QM9K series starting today. 

Later in the year, Gemini will arrive on the Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models. More functionality will be added over time.

On Monday, eBay announced that it's acquiring Tise, a social marketplace for secondhand fashion and interior design items. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The company says the Oslo, Norway-based Tise's platform will open the door to a community of Gen Z and millennial customers. Tise's community features, such as the ability to follow sellers, like and comment on listings, and receive personalized product recommendations, along with its focus on current inventory, will enhance eBay's consumer-to-consumer experience.

Tise was the first company to receive an investment from eBay Ventures in 2022. 

“This acquisition is a natural next step in our investment in Tise, which will allow us to accelerate Tise's strategy and unlock new opportunities for innovation,” said Oliver Klinck, VP, GM Global Markets Success and C2C at eBay, in a press release. “With Tise's on-trend inventory, loyal community, and social-first approach, we'll strengthen eBay's C2C offerings, and more deeply connect with the next generation of enthusiasts.”

The company's acquisition of Tise indicates that it's looking to modernize its platform to attract younger shoppers, expand its social commerce tools, and build a stronger presence in the sustainable retail market.

The deal is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. Closing is subject to customary conditions.

“At Tise, we've always believed that making resale fun, easy and inspiring is key to a more sustainable world,” said Eirik Frøyland Rime, CEO and co-founder of Tise, in a statement. “eBay shares our vision, and with their support, we will enhance our community-driven model and enable even more people to participate in the social marketplace.”

Founded in 2014, Tise has raised $45 million in funding, according to market intelligence platform Tracxn.

TechCrunch Disrupt has always been where the future takes shape, and nowhere is that more literal than on the Space Stage, launching in San Francisco's Moscone West on October 27. In partnership with the Aerospace Corporation, this stage brings together the leaders shaping the next orbital frontier, unveiling breakthroughs in rockets, satellites, defense, and AI in orbit. 

This year's agenda brings together founders, investors, and operators who are turning bold visions into enduring businesses, even in a market where capital is tighter and expectations higher. Whether you're a space junkie, a startup builder, or an investor chasing the edge of innovation, the Space Stage will deliver insights on what's next in one of the most dynamic sectors in tech.

Don't miss your exclusive look into space tech. Register by September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT, and save up to $668 on your Disrupt 2025 pass.

With Celeste Ford, managing director, Stellar Ventures; Chris Morales, partner, Point72; and a speaker to be announced

As space becomes a bigger focus for both governments and private markets, investors are navigating new opportunities and new risks. Join these top investors to break down where capital is flowing, what startups need to show to stand out, and how the funding landscape for space is evolving.

Presented by The Aerospace Corporation

Space isn't just about rockets and satellites anymore — it's about data and decisions — and doing both fast. From autonomous systems to resilient compute and onboard intelligence, AI is becoming the backbone of how missions get managed at scale. The Aerospace Corporation and innovators break down how early-stage innovation is driving these shifts and laying the foundation for the evolving space economy.

AI is transforming countless industries, and space is no exception. The Aerospace Corporation is hosting a pitch-off at Disrupt to showcase startups working on innovative AI solutions to the hardest problems in space exploration, orbital intelligence, and infrastructure.

With Baiju Bhatt, founder and CEO, Aetherflux

As the co-founder of Robinhood, Baiju Bhatt helped redefine access to investing for an entire generation. Now he's back with Aetherflux, a company operating at the cutting edge of aerospace and deep tech. In this fireside chat, Bhatt will share why he's diving into space, what he's learned about building in radically different industries, and how founder experience translates when the stakes are literally orbital.

With Dan Jablonsky, chairman and CEO, Ursa Major, and speakers to be announced

The lines between commercial and defense technology have never been thinner and private capital is racing to fund the next generation of dual-use companies. Startup leaders join us to explore how startups are navigating this complex landscape, the opportunities (and responsibilities) that come with building dual-use tech, and what it means for the future of the aerospace industry.

With Even Rogers, co-founder and CEO, True Anomaly; Max Haot, CEO, Vast; and a speaker to be announced

The next wave of space startups is not just building rockets — it's building an entire ecosystem. The CEOs of True Anomaly and Vast Space take the stage to discuss how their companies are creating infrastructure, enabling new markets, and laying the foundations for a thriving space economy. From orbital services to next-generation satellite networks, this session explores the building blocks of a future where commercial space is a critical part of global tech.

And that's just the beginning for the Space Stage — stay tuned for more sessions and speaker reveals coming soon.

In the meantime, grab your Disrupt pass before Regular Bird savings vanish on September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT.

It sounds like Bluesky is getting serious about giving some users the boot, with the company saying it will be doing more to “enforce our moderation policies to better cultivate a space for healthy conversations.”

This is part of a broader update to the social media company's community guidelines, after Bluesky asked users in August to provide feedback on an earlier draft of these changes. In a new blog post, the company said it received comments from more than 14,000 community members, and that it “especially heard from community members who shared concerns about how the guidelines could impact creative expression and traditionally marginalized voices.”

“After considering this feedback, and in a return to our experimental roots, we are going to bring a greater focus to encouraging constructive dialogue and enforcing our rules against harassment and toxic content,” the company said. “For starters, we are going to increase our enforcement efforts.”

As part of that enforcement, Bluesky said that it will “more quickly escalate enforcement actions towards account restrictions.” When asked for more details, a Bluesky spokesperson told TechCrunch that moving forward, users who violate the guidelines will be getting fewer warnings before their accounts are deactivated.

In addition, the company will be “making product changes that clarify when content is likely to violate our community guidelines” — so perhaps users will also see more warnings before they post content that might run afoul of the guidelines.

Who gets banned and why remains a fraught issue for Bluesky (as it is for most social networks). For example, there have been recurring complaints that accounts fundraising for Palestinians in Gaza have been unfairly suspended.

More recently, many users criticized Bluesky's decision to temporarily suspend the horror writer Gretchen Felker-Martin due to her now-deleted comments about the shooting of Charlie Kirk. Writer Roxane Gay described Bluesky's decision — along with DC Comics' cancellation of Felker-Martin's “Red Hood” comic book — as “unacceptable,” “ridiculous,” and an “absolute shame.”

Felker-Martin responded succinctly to Bluesky's post announcing the new guidelines, writing, “thanks this sucks.”

In addition to criticism from its more left-leaning users, Bluesky also faces ongoing complaints that it has become a liberal echo chamber. (And there definitely seem to be users who can't take a joke.)

The company's post mentions other upcoming product changes, including a “zen mode” that would set new defaults for users who want a calmer social media experience, as well as “prompts for how to engage in more constructive conversations.”

Bluesky said the actual guidelines have been further revised based on user feedback, with more specific language in some sections, as well as a new section about protected expression, such as journalism and education.

Since these changes were announced on Friday, much of the response on Bluesky has focused on guidelines that forbid “sexual content involving non-consensual activity,” even if the content is animated, illustrated, or synthetic. (Gaming marketplaces, including Steam and Itch.io, recently faced backlash after seeming to crack down on games with edgy or even illegal adult content.) 

One user, for example, complained that Bluesky should “worry less about whether or not a cartoon has rights and more about whether real life trans and Palestinian people do.” Another said this language “has literally always been there because it's boilerplate social media stuff” and suggested that users were confused because of “bluesky's dogs–t comms.”

The Bluesky spokesperson said, “There's been some misunderstanding here — we haven't changed anything about our enforcement in this area and have no intention of doing so.”

The new guidelines are scheduled to take effect on October 15.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","An oil and gas giant signed a $1 billion deal with Commonwealth Fusion Systems","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/22/1123870/commonwealth-fusion-eni/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The power purchase agreement makes Eni the second major customer for Commonwealth's first commercial fusion power plant.

Eni, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, just agreed to buy $1 billion in electricity from a power plant being built by Commonwealth Fusion Systems. The deal is the latest to illustrate just how much investment Commonwealth and other fusion companies are courting as they attempt to take fusion power from the lab to the power grid. 

Commonwealth Fusion Systems is trying to bring a long-promised technology to reality.

“This is showing in concrete terms that people that use large amounts of energy, that know the energy market—they want fusion power, and they're willing to contract for it and to pay for it,” said Bob Mumgaard, cofounder and CEO of Commonwealth, on a press call about the deal.   

The agreement will see Eni purchase electricity from Commonwealth's first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. The facility is still in the planning stages but is scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.

The news comes a few weeks after Commonwealth announced a $863 million funding round, bringing its total funding raised to date to nearly $3 billion. The fusion company also announced earlier this year that Google would be its first commercial power customer for the Virginia plant.

Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is widely considered one of the leading companies in fusion power. Investment in the company represents nearly one-third of the total global investment in private fusion companies. (MIT Technology Review is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)

Eni has invested in Commonwealth since 2018 and participated in the latest fundraising round. The vast majority of the company's business is in oil and gas, but in recent years it's made investments in technologies like biofuels and renewables.

“A company like us—we cannot stay and wait for things to happen,” says Lorenzo Fiorillo, Eni's director of technology, research and development, and digital. 

One open question is what, exactly, Eni plans to do with this electricity. When asked about it on the press call, Fiorillo referenced wind and solar plants that Eni owns and said the plan “is not different from what we do in other areas in the US and the world.” (Eni sells electricity from power plants that it owns, including renewable and fossil-fuel plants.)

Commonwealth is building tokamak fusion reactors that use superconducting magnets to hold plasma in place. That plasma is where fusion reactions happen, forcing hydrogen atoms together to release large amounts of energy.

The company's first demonstration reactor, which it calls Sparc, is over 65% complete, and the team is testing components and assembling them. The plan is for the reactor, which is located outside Boston, to make plasma within two years and then demonstrate that it can generate more energy than is required to run it.

While Sparc is still under construction, Commonwealth is working on plans for Arc, its first commercial power plant. That facility should begin construction in 2027 or 2028 and generate electricity for the grid in the early 2030s, Mumgaard says.

Despite the billions of dollars Commonwealth has already raised, the company still needs more money to build its Arc power plant—that will be a multibillion-dollar project, Mumgaard said on a press call in August about the company's latest fundraising round. 

The latest commitment from Eni could help Commonwealth secure the funding it needs to get Arc built. “These agreements are a really good way to create the right environment for building up more investment,” says Paul Wilson, chair of the department of nuclear engineering and engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Meanwhile, company emissions are up 50% since 2019.

Even though commercial fusion energy is still years away at a minimum, investors and big tech companies have pumped money into the industry and signed agreements to buy power from plants once they're operational. 

Helion, another leading fusion startup, has plans to produce electricity from its first reactor in 2028 (an aggressive timeline that has some experts expressing skepticism). That facility will have a full generating capacity of 50 megawatts, and in 2023 Microsoft signed an agreement to purchase energy from the facility in order to help power its data centers.

As billions of dollars pour into the fusion industry, there are still many milestones ahead. To date, only the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has demonstrated that a fusion reactor can generate more energy than the amount put into the reaction. No commercial project has achieved that yet. 

“There's a lot of capital going out now to these startup companies,” says Ed Morse, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. “What I'm not seeing is a peer-reviewed scientific article that makes me feel like, boy, we really turned the corner with the physics.”

But others are taking major commercial deals from Commonwealth and others as reasons to be optimistic. “Fusion is moving from the lab to be a proper industry,” says Sehila Gonzalez de Vicente, global director of fusion energy at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force. “This is very good for the whole sector to be perceived as a real source of energy.” 

A recent test shows that Quidnet's technology can store energy in pressurized water underground for months at a time.

Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation.

Forecasts aren't looking quite as rosy for the green fuel, though China is still a bright spot.

Global warming is driving emissions, which are driving global warming, which is driving ...

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","This medical startup uses LLMs to run appointments and make diagnoses","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/22/1123873/medical-diagnosis-llm/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 09:10:47 GMT","

“Our focus is really on what we can do to pull the doctor out of the visit,” says Akido's CTO. 

Imagine this: You've been feeling unwell, so you call up your doctor's office to make an appointment. To your surprise, they schedule you in for the next day. At the appointment, you aren't rushed through describing your health concerns; instead, you have a full half hour to share your symptoms and worries and the exhaustive details of your health history with someone who listens attentively and asks thoughtful follow-up questions. You leave with a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and the sense that, for once, you've been able to discuss your health with the care that it merits.

Once cautious, OpenAI, Grok, and others will now dive into giving unverified medical advice with virtually no disclaimers.

The catch? You might not have spoken to a doctor, or other licensed medical practitioner, at all.

This is the new reality for patients at a small number of clinics in Southern California that are run by the medical startup Akido Labs. These patients—some of whom are on Medicaid—can access specialist appointments on short notice, a privilege typically only afforded to the wealthy few who patronize concierge clinics.

The key difference is that Akido patients spend relatively little time, or even no time at all, with their doctors. Instead, they see a medical assistant, who can lend a sympathetic ear but has limited clinical training. The job of formulating diagnoses and concocting a treatment plan is done by a proprietary, LLM-based system called ScopeAI that transcribes and analyzes the dialogue between patient and assistant. A doctor then approves, or corrects, the AI system's recommendations.

“Our focus is really on what we can do to pull the doctor out of the visit,” says Jared Goodner, Akido's CTO. 

According to Prashant Samant, Akido's CEO, this approach allows doctors to see four to five times as many patients as they could previously. There's good reason to want doctors to be much more productive. Americans are getting older and sicker, and many struggle to access adequate health care. The pending 15% reduction in federal funding for Medicaid will only make the situation worse.

But experts aren't convinced that displacing so much of the cognitive work of medicine onto AI is the right way to remedy the doctor shortage. There's a big gap in expertise between doctors and AI-enhanced medical assistants, says Emma Pierson, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley.  Jumping such a gap may introduce risks. “I am broadly excited about the potential of AI to expand access to medical expertise,” she says. “It's just not obvious to me that this particular way is the way to do it.”

AI is already everywhere in medicine. Computer vision tools identify cancers during preventive scans, automated research systems allow doctors to quickly sort through the medical literature, and LLM-powered medical scribes can take appointment notes on a clinician's behalf. But these systems are designed to support doctors as they go about their typical medical routines.

What distinguishes ScopeAI, Goodner says, is its ability to independently complete the cognitive tasks that constitute a medical visit, from eliciting a patient's medical history to coming up with a list of potential diagnoses to identifying the most likely diagnosis and proposing appropriate next steps.

Under the hood, ScopeAI is a set of large language models, each of which can perform a specific step in the visit—from generating appropriate follow-up questions based on what a patient has said to to populating a list of likely conditions. For the most part, these LLMs are fine-tuned versions of Meta's open-access Llama models, though Goodner says that the system also makes use of Anthropic's Claude models. 

During the appointment, assistants read off questions from the ScopeAI interface, and ScopeAI produces new questions as it analyzes what the patient says. For the doctors who will review its outputs later, ScopeAI produces a concise note that includes a summary of the patient's visit, the most likely diagnosis, two or three alternative diagnoses, and recommended next steps, such as referrals or prescriptions. It also lists a justification for each diagnosis and recommendation.

ScopeAI is currently being used in cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care clinics and by Akido's street medicine team, which serves the Los Angeles homeless population. That team—which is led by Steven Hochman, a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine—meets patients out in the community to help them access medical care, including treatment for substance use disorders. 

Previously, in order to prescribe a drug to treat an opioid addiction, Hochman would have to meet the patient in person; now, caseworkers armed with ScopeAI can interview patients on their own, and Hochman can approve or reject the system's recommendations later. “It allows me to be in 10 places at once,” he says.

Since they started using ScopeAI, the team has been able to get patients access to medications to help treat their substance use within 24 hours—something that Hochman calls “unheard of.”

This arrangement is only possible because homeless patients typically get their health insurance from Medicaid, the public insurance system for low-income Americans. While Medicaid allows doctors to approve ScopeAI prescriptions and treatment plans asynchronously, both for street medicine and clinic visits, many other insurance providers require that doctors speak directly with patients before approving those recommendations. Pierson says that discrepancy raises concerns. “You worry about that exacerbating health disparities,” she says.

Samant is aware of the appearance of inequity, and he says the discrepancy isn't intentional—it's just a feature of how the insurance plans currently work. He also notes that being seen quickly by an AI-enhanced medical assistant may be better than dealing with long wait times and limited provider availability, which is the status quo for Medicaid patients. And all Akido patients can opt for traditional doctor's appointments, if they are willing to wait for them, he says.

Part of the challenge of deploying a tool like ScopeAI is navigating a regulatory and insurance landscape that wasn't designed for AI systems that can independently direct medical appointments. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School, says that any AI system that effectively acts as a “doctor in a box” would likely need to be approved by the FDA and could run afoul of medical licensure laws, which dictate that only doctors and other licensed professionals can practice medicine.

The California Medical Practice Act says that AI can't replace a doctor's responsibility to diagnose and treat a patient, but doctors are allowed to use AI in their work, and they don't need to see patients in-person or in real-time before diagnosing them. Neither the FDA nor the Medical Board of California were able to say whether or not ScopeAI was on solid legal footing based only on a written description of the system.

But Samant is confident that Akido is in compliance, as ScopeAI was intentionally designed to fall short of being a “doctor in a box.” Because the system requires a human doctor to review and approve of all of its diagnostic and treatment recommendations, he says, it doesn't require FDA approval. 

At the clinic, this delicate balance between AI and doctor decision making happens entirely behind the scenes. Patients don't ever see the ScopeAI interface directly—instead, they speak with a medical assistant who asks questions in the way that a doctor might in a typical appointment. That arrangement might make patients feel more comfortable. But Zeke Emanuel, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who served in the Obama and Biden administrations, worries that this comfort could be obscuring from patients the extent to which an algorithm is influencing their care.

Pierson agrees. “That certainly isn't really what was traditionally meant by the human touch in medicine,” she says.

DeAndre Siringoringo, a medical assistant who works at Akido's cardiology office in Rancho Cucamonga, says that while he tells the patients he works with that an AI system will be listening to the appointment in order to gather information for their doctor, he doesn't inform them about the specifics of how ScopeAI works, including the fact that it makes diagnostic recommendations to doctors. 

Because all ScopeAI recommendations are reviewed by a doctor, that might not seem like such a big deal—it's the doctor who makes the final diagnosis, not the AI. But it's been widely documented that doctors using AI systems tend to go along with the system's recommendations more often than they should, a phenomenon known as automation bias. 

At this point, it's impossible to know whether automation bias is affecting doctors' decisions at Akido clinics, though Pierson says it's a risk—especially when doctors aren't physically present for appointments. “I worry that it might predispose you to sort of nodding along in a way that you might not if you were actually in the room watching this happen,” she says.

An Akido spokesperson says that automation bias is a valid concern for any AI tool that assists a doctor's decision-making and that the company has made efforts to mitigate that bias. “We designed ScopeAI specifically to reduce bias by proactively countering blind spots that can influence medical decisions, which historically lean heavily on physician intuition and personal experience,” she says. “We also train physicians explicitly on how to use ScopeAI thoughtfully, so they retain accountability and avoid over-reliance.”

Akido evaluates ScopeAI's performance by testing it on historical data and monitoring how often doctors correct its recommendations; those corrections are also used to further train the underlying models. Before deploying ScopeAI in a given specialty, Akido ensures that when tested on historical data sets, the system includes the correct diagnosis in its top three recommendations at least 92% of the time.

But Akido hasn't undertaken more rigorous testing, such as studies that compare ScopeAI appointments with traditional in-person or telehealth appointments, in order to determine whether the system improves—or at least maintains—patient outcomes. Such a study could help indicate whether automation bias is a meaningful concern.

“Making medical care cheaper and more accessible is a laudable goal,” Pierson says. “But I just think it's important to conduct strong evaluations comparing to that baseline.”

 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The End of Those Annoying Cookie Pop-Ups on Websites?","https://gizmodo.com/europe-gdpr-cookie-pop-ups-2000662057","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:10:33 GMT","

The global influence of the EU's cookie laws is due for a revamp later this year.

Cookies hold visitor information for websites and are crucial for some basic functions, like remembering your username. But they can also be a privacy nightmare. Your data gathered by these cookies can be sold to third-party companies and used for targeted advertising.

To deal with the murky implications of cookies, the European Union enacted a sweeping cookie law in 2009, based on a previous privacy directive. With this new law, websites had to ask European visitors for consent to use cookies. Many companies have switched their systems to include consent pop-ups for users worldwide, rather than creating separate European versions of their sites, so it has also affected Americans.

Although the aim was to give power back to the users and let them decide which cookies they were okay with or not, the law has since had unintended consequences, the main one being “cookie fatigue.” Users are now bombarded with consent pop-ups so often that they rarely read them, choosing to just blindly click to accept the cookies. So the consent pop-ups make you feel like you are secure, but are not actually good at offering real protection.

The EU has been trying to address this issue for some time now. Early last year, they tried to do so with a “cookie pledge” that had major platforms owned by the likes of Amazon, Apple, Meta, and ByteDance sign an optional agreement promising to improve the cookie pop-ups. That unsurprisingly must not have worked out as well as they hoped.

Now, EU officials are planning to present a rule that addresses this concern for good in December, Politico reported on Monday. They are holding meetings with the tech industry to agree on a strategy, and many ideas have reportedly been floated.

In a note sent to an industry focus group, the European Commission floated the idea that users can have set preferences for cookies in their browsers rather than having each website individually ask for consent, Politico reports.

Danish authorities have suggested completely dropping consent banners for cookies that are used for “technically necessary functions” like simple statistics, rather than the ones deemed more harmful, like third-party data sharing.

Other European officials believe the cookie rules should be incorporated into the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a sweeping online privacy law that shaped the internet when it passed in 2018. It also upset big tech companies, many of which have been hit with major penalties over breaching it. Meta, for example, was hit with a $1.3 billion fine in 2023 for violating user data privacy on Facebook.

The GDPR triggered an avalanche of cookies when it passed. Cookies are technically subject to GDPR, but that law is not the primary way the EU governs cookie use; they have the ePrivacy Directive for that.

The GDPR is supposed to have a “risk-based approach,” Politico notes, instead of the strict consent requirements put forth by the ePrivacy Directive. This means that if cookie governance is switched over to the GDPR, it will be up to the tech companies to adjust how they deal with cookies based on the level of risk associated with the data they are harvesting.

No matter how the EU eventually decides to address its cookie and consent pop-up problem, there is undoubtedly room for improvement.

Consent pop-ups in general have been criticized by data privacy experts as a surface-level remedy that can be easily manipulated by tech companies. One way that they do that is via “dark patterns,” aka deceptive design techniques they use to manipulate your behavior online. The European Union is set to address those concerns next year in a new piece of legislation called the Digital Fairness Act.

Spider-Man: Brand New Day‘s filming may take a pause after Tom Holland suffered a mild on-set injury. Joachim Rønning's next film after Tron: Ares is heading to Paramount. Plus, 20th Century may have found its next Alien director. To me, my spoilers!



According to Entertainment Weekly, Hayden Panettiere is confirmed to return as her fan-favorite character, Kirby Reed, in Scream 7.

Deadline reports Paramount has acquired the rights to Joachim Rønning's next film, Here Be Monsters, described “as an intense survival thriller at sea reminiscent of films like Alien and The Thing” with “franchise ambitions.” Ridley Scott is attached to produce.

According to a new rumor from World of Reel, Demián Rugna (Where Evil Lurks, Terrified) may be 20th Century's top choice to direct the next theatrical Alien project.

A handbag posted to Instagram by make-up artist Giovanna Ponci seemingly reveals every character's costume in Avengers: Doomsday—including the returning X-Men. Head over to Comic Book to have a look (and appreciate Mystique's comic-accurate white dress finally making the transition to screen).

Deadline reports a poorly timed stunt caused Tom Holland to suffer a “mild” concussion while filming Spider-Man: Brand New Day. The actor was briefly “hospitalized amid filming on the Glasgow set” and will refrain from filming for the next few days to recover. Sony and Marvel are reportedly discussing how to continue production in the meantime.

Universal has released two separate trailers for a French remake of The Incredible Shrinking Man starring Jean Dujardin.

Elsewhere, the ancient but fledgling medium of theater demands human sacrifice to keep its performances running in the trailer for Theater Is Dead.

 

Finally, HBO Max has released a “this season on…” trailer for Gen V‘s second year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Gizmodo Science Fair: A ‘Window' That Harvests Drinking Water From Desert Air","https://gizmodo.com/gizmodo-science-fair-a-window-that-harvests-drinking-water-from-desert-air-2000640971","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 11:00:39 GMT","

An international team of engineers is a winner of the 2025 Gizmodo Science Fair for creating an atmospheric water harvesting device that could improve access to potable water in the most remote, arid regions of the world.

Can we pull water out of thin air, even in the driest places on Earth?

Engineers led by Xuanhe Zhao, a professor of mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), created an atmospheric water harvesting “window” (AWHW) that produces clean drinking water in extremely resource-limited conditions. It's compact, completely self-sustainable, and only requires one input: sunlight.

“I invent soft materials to solve hard problems for the world,” Zhao told Gizmodo.

The core water-harvesting component of the AWHW is a hydrogel. This material is made from a hydrophilic polymer network and enriched with hygroscopic salts that readily absorb water from the air. It looks a bit like black bubble wrap, with small domed structures that swell when saturated, then shrink back down as they dry out. That swelling-shrinking transformation, inspired by origami, maximizes the material's efficiency, Zhao said.

The next step was to design a chamber that captures the water collected by the hydrogel. They initially attempted to build a pyramid-shaped chamber, but this resulted in a large footprint for the device and sacrificed efficiency. So, Zhao asked his team, what would the simplest possible design look like?

The engineers ultimately sandwiched the hydrogel between two glass sheets coated with a cooling layer to create a black, window-sized vertical panel. When this panel is placed outside overnight, the hydrogel soaks up water vapor as temperatures drop and humidity rises. During the day, sunlight heats the gel and causes the captured water to evaporate, condense onto the glass, and then trickle down the panels and out through a tube for collection.

“This window-like design turns out to be very effective,” Zhao said.

The team tested their atmospheric water harvesting window (AWHW) for one week in Death Valley—the driest region of North America. The results, published in the journal Nature Water in June, showed that this device is effective even in extremely low-humidity conditions. It worked across humidity levels ranging from 21 to 88% and produced water at rates of up to two-thirds of a cup (160 milliliters) per day. What's more, this water was ready to drink immediately.

“We were so surprised by this,” “Will” Chang Liu, co-first author of the Death Valley study and former MIT postdoc, told Gizmodo. “It works pretty well at such low relative humidity.” This test also showed that the team's vertical configuration is central to its efficiency, allowing the hydrogel panel to harvest water from both sides, Liu added.

“We are truly proud and excited about this work—and about the potential to help people most in need of safe drinking water,” Zhao said.

More than 2 billion people around the world lack access to clean drinking water, according to data from the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund. Experts expect that figure to rise as population growth, economic development, poor resource management, and climate change drain Earth's fresh water supply.

Developing a way to provide safe, manageable drinking water for people living in resource-limited regimes “is a grand challenge for the world,” Zhao said. Most people experiencing water scarcity lack access to terrestrial resources such as rivers, aquifers, and lakes, but there is a vast reserve of fresh water that's present everywhere on Earth: the atmosphere.

“There is seven times more fresh water in air than in all the world's rivers,” Zhao said. Harnessing even a small fraction of the millions of billions of gallons of water vapor in the atmosphere would go a long way toward improving access to clean water. Many people living in rural, water-stressed areas also lack reliable electricity and the resources necessary for technical equipment maintenance, Zhao explained. To overcome those gaps, an atmospheric water harvesting system needs to be simple, self-sustaining, and robust.

The hydrogel-based AWHW passively responds to the environment, no electricity required, Liu explained. This makes it especially well-suited for enhancing off-grid water security, she said.

“If you deploy this facility in those regimes, you can supply life-saving drinking water to people,” Zhao said.

This isn't the only team working to develop an atmospheric water harvesting device. Though other designs have proven effective, the AWHW improves on them in several key ways.

Designs made from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as some of the most efficient so far. These ultra-porous materials absorb water quickly and are effective in humidity levels as low as 14%, but they're not very cost-effective, Liu said. What's more, MOFs don't swell or stretch when absorbing water, limiting their vapor-carrying capacity. Hydrogels, on the other hand, absorb water molecules into the volume of their materials, allowing them to hold more water. Additionally, their network of micro- and nanopores speeds up water absorption and release.

Not all hydrogels are created equal, however. Many designs—including MIT's—use hydrogels enriched with salts to enhance their water-absorbing abilities. This often leads to salt leakage that contaminates harvested water. The AWHW overcomes this problem by adding glycerol into the hydrogel. This liquid compound naturally stabilizes salt to prevent it from crystallizing and leaking into the water. For added protection, his hydrogel contains a microstructure that lacks nanoscale pores, further preventing salt leakage. As such, salt levels in water produced by the AWHW are significantly lower than those of other hydrogel-based designs.

“Without further purification, it's directly drinkable,” Zhao said.

Even though the Death Valley test showed that the AWHW works well in extremely arid conditions, Zhao and his team are still working to improve the device's efficiency. Their ultimate goal is to produce enough water to supply entire households, even in desert climates. To that end, they are developing arrays of multiple panels that work together to further amplify water capture.

The team plans to test the device in other locations, including Morocco, where collaborator Youssef Habibi directs the Sustainable Materials Research Center at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, Liu said. Now an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the National University of Singapore, Liu also hopes to test the AWHW in Singapore's humid, tropical climate. After that, the next steps are scaling up manufacturing, making this technology affordable for people, and getting the word out.

The MIT team, led by Xuanhe Zhao, also consisted of “Will” Chang Liu, Xiao-Yun Yan, Shucong Li, and Bolei Deng. Non-MIT-affiliated contributors include Nicholas X. Fang of the University of Hong Kong, Hongshi Zhang of the University of Singapore, Youssef Habibi of Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, and Shih-Chi Chen of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Minesto, a marine energy technology developer based in Sweden, is a winner of the 2025 Gizmodo Science Fair for deploying the first operational, megawatt-scale tidal energy kite in the Faroe Islands.

Can we use an underwater “kite” to turn ocean tides into renewable energy?

In February 2024, Minesto's Dragon 12 tidal energy kite delivered its first electricity to the national grid in the Faroe Islands. This 40-foot-wide (12-meter-wide), 28-ton subsea powerplant is the largest and latest of three tidal energy kites Minesto has installed in the Faroe Islands since 2020. This one generates far more electricity.

Dragon 12 is called a kite because it produces electricity by “flying” underwater while tethered to the ocean floor, but it looks more like a small plane. Its wing uses hydrodynamic lift to move the kite while an onboard control system steers it in a figure-8 pattern. As it flies, a turbine shaft located at the rear of the kite turns a generator. Clean energy then travels through a cable inside the tether to a seabed umbilical, which transmits power to the onshore grid.

The figure-8 path allows Dragon 12 to accelerate faster than the current flowing past it, reducing the size of the kite and rotor necessary to generate power. Indeed, Dragon 12 is up to 15 times lighter per megawatt than other similar technologies, according to Minesto. Its design also maximizes energy production, allowing the turbine to operate in flow conditions as low as 3.9 feet per second (1.2 meters per second).

Dragon 12 produces power automatically and autonomously, Minesto's Chief Technology Officer Bernt Erik Westre explained. Once the kite's onboard sensors detect that flow conditions are conducive to energy generation, it's off to the races. “We just tell the system to fly, and then it will decide whether conditions are okay to fly in, and it will start,” Westre told Gizmodo. “If they're not anymore, it will stop.”

In the Faroe Islands, Dragon 12 operates at a depth of 164 feet (50 meters). Minesto's tidal energy kites “cannot ever get to the surface, unless we detach them with a special tool,” Westre said. Unlike fixed-bottom wind turbines, tidal energy kites are invisible from the shoreline, and ships can safely sail over them. This, coupled with the fact that these power plants can operate in low-flow conditions, opens up a much larger marine renewable energy market, Westre explained.

Within the first two weeks of testing in the Faroe Islands, Minesto verified Dragon 12's functionality and power production performance. The kite has been delivering clean energy to the national grid ever since, with a 25% increase in power output after Minesto lengthened its tether in May.

“If you want lightweight, renewable energy that's invisible, you know who to call,” Westre said.

Before joining Minesto in 2016, Westre was working as a naval architect for the oil industry. Ultimately though, the impact this industry was having on the global climate and wealth disparity became too stark to ignore. Westre wanted to be a part of the solution, not the problem.

“I guess I came to a point where I wanted to be able to look my children—and eventually grandchildren, if I ever get any—in the eye and say, ‘I made a shot at it,'” he said. Plus, “We were making the world's richest companies even richer, and that didn't feel right anymore.”

Minesto, founded in 2007, doesn't just aim to reduce the world's reliance on fossil fuels. The company's offbeat approach to commercial marine power production aims to maximize the amount of electricity people can harness from the ocean. Its tidal energy kites do this by operating across a wider range of conditions than traditional technologies. This, Westre hopes, will open up a vast, untapped market for tidal energy extraction.

Minesto is developing a new class of megawatt-scale renewable energy technology that produces predictable, clean power in untapped parts of the ocean. While it isn't the only company working toward this goal, its technology comes with several advantages. The main selling point is its ability to efficiently generate power in low-flow conditions.

“The [design] principle has been the same since 2007, which is to fly or move the turbine rather than keep it stationary underwater,” Westre said. “By doing it that way, the market—or global potential—is so much larger.”

Stationary systems—such as fixed-bottom tidal turbines—could theoretically operate in low-flow conditions too, but they would have to be huge, he explained. The fact that Minesto's tidal energy kites move allows them to harness energy from slower currents while reducing cost and consumption of materials.

Another key advantage of this system is that it operates completely below the surface with minimal impact on marine wildlife. This avoids visual pollution that can negatively impact tourism and discourage public support for renewable energy projects.

Minesto made big strides toward commercialization in 2024. As it continues building out its tidal energy provisions in the Faroe Islands, it's working towards installing a first-of-its-kind tidal energy array with multiple Dragon 12 kites. The first phase will have a capacity of 10 megawatts—an initial step towards its eventual 200-megawatt capacity.

“10 megawatts on the Faroe Islands will make a difference,” Westre said. Once the array reaches its full capacity, it could meet 40% of the Faroe Islands' expected electricity needs in 2030, according to Minesto partner Svenska Kullager Fabriken, a Swedish bearing company.

In June, the Swedish Energy Agency awarded Miensto and its partners $2.6 million to build a complete microgrid installation in the Faroe Islands. That project is expected to be complete by 2026.

Minesto is led by CEO Martin Edlund, CTO Bernt Erik Westre, and COO Johannes Hüffmeier.

A very rare Apple-1 computer sold for a significant amount more than the auctioneer's estimate in Boston this weekend. Last week, we reported on the rare Byte Shop wooden case Apple-1's impending auction. At the time, it had scaled to $144,311 in pre-live bidding, with an estimate of $300,000. On Saturday, RR Auctions achieved a sale of $475,000 (w/BP) for its client. That's nearly 60% better than expected.

Ahead of the auction day (Saturday), RR Auctions shared an interesting video showing this Apple-1 in action, which might have helped propel sales.

Above you can see this Byte Shop wooden cased computer, thought to be just one of just nine surviving examples (from 50 made), being used for coding and executing programs. In the brief clip, you can see the cassette interface, keyboard, and Apple Basic being used. The hands-on demonstration ends with the ‘Apple the 30th ASCII Demo' running, with text-based imagery of Jobs, Wozniak, and the Apple logo output to the included monitor.

There were a number of factors in this sample's favor that allowed it to significantly leapfrog the estimate. Above, we mentioned that it is a 1-in-9 rare surviving sample. It is also remarkably complete – check our previous article for a list of what was included in this auction.

Beyond the vintage physical computer equipment, this machine also had some extra provenance. It is known as the ‘Moore Apple-1', which is “a complete and working setup owned by the first female graduate of Stanford Law School, June Blodgett Moore.""

Technology artifacts, especially those closely associated with Apple, are still hot property. There will have been plenty of enthusiasts and collectors with their eye on this, and many will have abundant disposable income.

The auction of the 'Steven Jobs' signed Apple Computer Company check also ended on Saturday. Encapsulated and graded as a ‘Mint 9', it was expected to fetch $25,000. However, it was already almost that price in pre-live bidding. On the day, it ended up going for $46,250 (w/BP).

RR Auctions' final prices include a ‘Buyer's Premium' (BP) of 25%. Given this, we can assume the hammer price at the conclusion of the Apple-1 auction was $380,000, and $95,000 was added to the settlement for the BP, to give the $475,000 (w/BP) total. That's quite a nice fee for the auctioneers, and comes with the territory for collectors who want to get their hands on computing relics in this manner.

The Steve Jobs check, which sold for $46,250 (w/BP), will have reached an auction hammer price of $37,000.

In order to catch up to America's AI dominance.

Deep in the Yangtze River basin, one of China's most prosperous economic regions, the country is betting big on rice fields scattered across a 760-acre island, located in the municipality of Wuhu. According to the Financial Times, this agricultural land will soon host some of Beijing's biggest servers dedicated to serving wealthy areas nearby, which will represent one part of the plan to build the ""Stargate of China,"" as described by an executive tied to one of the project's suppliers.

Currently, China only accounts for about 15% of the global AI compute power, far less than the ~75% held by the United States, according to a study by Epoch AI. In an effort to better compete with America, China is taking a different, measured approach that will see it consolidating already-existing but dispersed data centers into one unified network... to be linked together using Huawei's UB-Mesh tech.

On the other hand, the aforementioned farmland will be converted into a ""data island"" housing massive data centers for four companies: Huawei, China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. These servers are strategically placed near major cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing — all of which will benefit from this upgrade, whose goal is to speed up inference for people living in the area. Think faster responses in agentic AI applications, for instance.

 




The Wuhu project is worth a reported $37 billion on its own — significantly less than the $500 billion Stargate project that serves as its aspiration — and while Wuhu's ""mega-cluster"" is the focal point, there's actually a lot more in motion. China has designated Ulanqab in Inner Mongolia to supply Beijing and Tianjin, Guizhou in the south to feed Guangzhou, and Qingyang in Gansu to serve Chengdu and Chongqing; these new data centers are intentionally in close proximity to large civilian populations, while existing data centers in remote areas are being rewired to focus on training LLMs.

That narrative further extends to AI chips sitting idle in faraway facilities located in remote but energy-dense provinces. From 2022, China catalyzed the construction of server farms in said regions, but due to low demand in the vicinity, a lot of hardware ultimately was never used, and just sat underutilized while demand was soaring elsewhere (because local governments were reluctant to give them up). Now, the plan is to link these data centers using the aforementioned UB-Mesh tech to serve as redundancy, and to sell surplus compute.

 




Interestingly, a stockpile like that isn't worrying Beijing anymore, as Wuhu is offering subsidies that cover up to 30% of the cost of procurement for these AI chips. Clearly, China wants to transform its underdeveloped terrain fast. Especially when the country is not allowed to receive most high-end AI GPUs made by Nvidia, they rely on local options that can't match capacity, which is part of the reason smuggling these accelerators is a huge prospect — even if Nvidia is not worried, given the practicality.

At the moment, China and the U.S. are locked in a ruthless battle for chip dominance, with the former playing catch-up as the latter works to limit any counter. Export restrictions have forced Beijing to develop homegrown AI stacks, which can ironically threaten U.S. leadership more by reducing foreign reliance. Coupled with these ambitions to massively scale AI compute near both urban centers and rural areas, China is emerging as a competitor that won't back down.

With EUV locked out by sanctions, China is leaning on DUV multi-patterning and fledgling domestic scanners.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


When Dutch officials revoked ASML's license to export Twinscan NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems to China under U.S. pressure, it closed the door to the only machines capable of producing sub-7nm chips at scale.

That single policy decision has defined what some analysts are calling the semiconductor cold war, where SMIC and its peers cannot buy the equipment needed for modern AI accelerators, and every shipment of advanced tools is now scrutinized as if it were a weapons transfer.

What the blockade hasn't done is stop China's fabs. Instead, it has forced an awkward reliance on older deep ultraviolet (DUV) machines (via TrendForce) and sparked a parallel race to design local replacements. It's a strategy of necessity, one that accepts higher costs and lower yields in exchange for continuity and independence.

EUV machines are some of the most complex industrial systems in existence. Packed with thousands of U.S.-origin components and priced at hundreds of millions of dollars a piece, they are the foundation of every 5nm and 3nm chip shipping, or planning to ship in the future. China has none, and the U.S. has made sure of that.

Successive rounds of sanctions since 2022 have blocked not just EUV exports, but also the most advanced immersion DUV systems, including ASML's Twinscan NXT:1970i and NXT:1980i. The Netherlands and Japan joined those restrictions, and even service contracts for ASML machines installed in China are being scrutinized. ASML itself has admitted that a China-based employee stole proprietary EUV data, highlighting how valuable the technology has become.

The policy has pushed chip procurement into murky territory. Grey-market Nvidia GPUs continue to flood in through Hong Kong and Singapore despite being explicitly banned, with seizures measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But smuggling a workstation card is one thing; sneaking in a 180-ton lithography scanner is another. On that front, Washington's chokehold on export controls has held up.

 




Deep ultraviolet lithography predates EUV by decades. Using 193nm argon-fluoride lasers, immersion DUV systems comfortably support 28nm nodes, with yields and costs increasing dramatically as nodes shrink further. With multi-patterning (exposing the same wafer multiple times with different masks) they can be stretched down to 7nm-class geometries. Intel's disastrous 10nm rollout proved how costly and yield-sensitive that approach can be, but it remains the only path available to Chinese fabs.

SMIC's Kirin 9000-class parts, built for Huawei, already demonstrate the limits of this strategy. It's widely believed that they were fabricated with DUV and heavy use of multiple patterning. The chips work, but at lower volume and efficiency than anything coming out of Taiwan or South Korea.

For now, Chinese fabs are leaning on their existing ASML DUV fleets. Nearly half of ASML's second-quarter equipment tooling shipments in 2024 went to China, despite the political pressure in Washington. Those sales are a reminder of just how dependent Beijing still is on imported tools. But the window is closing, and the focus is shifting.

Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment announced in 2023 that it had built a 28nm immersion scanner, the SSA800-10W. It's crude compared to ASML's Twinscan line, but it represents the first domestically developed immersion tool, and critically, it was designed without U.S. intellectual property. According to a TrendForce report, SMIC is testing a prototype from Yuliangsheng, a Huawei-linked affiliate of SiCarrier, which also rated for 28nm, but with ambitions to scale toward 7nm with multi-patterning.

A fully domestic DUV scanner, even if mired in yield problems, would insulate Chinese foundries from future Western policy decisions. Let's not forget that China has previously made it clear that strategic self-sufficiency matters more than perfect parity with TSMC or Samsung.

Nobody expects China's DUV tools to rival ASML's. The gap is at least a decade, and without EUV, the economics are punishing. Multi-patterning consumes more wafers, introduces more points of failure, and demands ever more sophisticated etch and metrology equipment to hold yields together. Every advanced chip that comes off a DUV line in Shanghai costs more than its equivalent in Hsinchu.

Even with low yields, however, a 7nm-class domestic chip is better than none at all. Huawei has already rebuilt much of its smartphone supply chain around local vendors, and state mandates now require Chinese firms to source 50% of their chips domestically.

Meanwhile, ASML's chief executive has said China is ten to fifteen years behind. That may be true in technology, but sanctions are accelerating the drive to close the gap. Each ban entrenches the incentive to localize, and each domestic stepper tested at SMIC or Huawei's labs makes the next round of controls less decisive.

That is the paradox of the so-called semiconductor cold war. EUV has been locked down, but in the process, DUV has become the backbone of a new, homegrown ecosystem. For Washington, the risk is that every workaround makes China a little less dependent. And for China, the bet is that a decade of inefficiency is worth the price of eventual independence.

The US FDA has approved pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph (Keytruda Qlex, Merck), a subcutaneous version of the intravenous formulation of Keytruda, for adults and children aged 12 years or older.

The new approval is for all solid tumor indications approved for the intravenous formulation. Prescribing information, including indications, can be found at Drugs@FDA. Recommended dosing for the subcutaneous formulation is either 395 mg pembrolizumab and 4800 units of berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph every 3 weeks or 790 mg and 9600 units of the agents, respectively, every 6 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or as indicated in the prescribing information.

Efficacy and safety of Keytruda Qlex was evaluated in the randomized, open-label MK-3475A-D77 trial of 377 treatment-naive patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutations. No significant differences were observed in pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints or response rates between those randomly assigned to receive the subcutaneous formulation and those who received the intravenous formulation.

PK endpoints were Cycle 1 AUC0-6 weeks and Cycle 3 Ctrough. The trial met the predefined acceptance margin for the PK endpoints with the lower boundary of the geometric mean ratios above the prespecified threshold of 0.8 for comparability. 

Overall response rates were 45% and 42% with subcutaneous and intravenous treatment, respectively, and no notable differences were observed in progression-free and overall survival.

Hydroxychloroquine did not slow progression from incomplete to full-blown systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in patients who had antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity and met one or two SLE classification criteria.

“Targeting the [incomplete lupus erythematosus] population for early intervention has the potential to decrease or prevent severe SLE manifestations,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Nancy Olsen, MD, Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania. It was published online on September 16, 2025, in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

There was a predominance of White patients older than 30 years in the study population. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine levels were not measured during the study, making it impossible to determine if subtherapeutic dosing affected the results.

The study received support through awards from the National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, and other sources. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Usgena (ustekinumab; STADA  Arzneimittel AG) — a biosimilar for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis — has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which recommended its approval at its September meeting as an accessible alternative to existing biologics.

The active substance of Usgena, ustekinumab, is an immunosuppressant interleukin (IL) inhibitor. It functions as a fully human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23. By inhibiting the interaction of these cytokines with the IL-12 receptor subunit beta 1 on immune cell surfaces, ustekinumab disrupts downstream signaling involved in the differentiation and activation of Th1 and Th17 cells. This mechanism modulates key inflammatory pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated conditions such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis.

The CHMP mentioned that Usgena shows comparable quality, safety, and effectiveness to the reference medicine Stelara (ustekinumab), which gained European Union approval on January 15, 2009. 

The EMA evaluates biosimilars using the same rigorous standards as for all biological medicines. Developers must demonstrate high similarity to the reference product, with no clinically meaningful differences, through comprehensive comparability studies.

The biosimilar will be available in various formulations, including 45 mg and 90 mg injection solutions in vials or prefilled syringes, plus a 130 mg concentrate for infusion solution in vials.

Usgena is intended to treat:

Usgena requires use under the direction and oversight of physicians skilled in diagnosing and managing the conditions for which the medicine is approved. 

Detailed recommendations for Usgena use will be described in the summary of product characteristics, which will be published on the EMA website after the European Commission grants marketing authorization.

Chronic psychological stress is common. A 2023 survey revealed that about one quarter of US adults reported high stress levels, and three quarters reported that chronic stress affects their daily lives.

Emerging evidence suggests that chronic stress not only exacts a high toll on mental health but also can wreak havoc on all levels of gastrointestinal (GI) functioning, all the way down to the microbiome.

“Chronic stress can change the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome and essentially tips us toward an imbalance or dysbiosis,” Aasma Shaukat, MD, MPH, gastroenterologist with NYU Langone Health and director of GI Outcomes Research, Gastroenterology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, said in an interview with Medscape Medical News.

“This basically means that the normal balance of microorganisms that essentially we think are beneficial gets reduced, and the colonies considered to be more harmful proliferate,” she explained.

Numerous studies published in the past 5 years have linked chronic stress to modest but reproducible shifts in the composition of the microbiome.

A study of frontline healthcare workers during COVID-19 revealed that the pandemic was associated with significant depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as gut dysbiosis that persisted for at least half a year.

Notably, healthcare workers had low gut alpha diversity, indicating a less resilient and diverse microbiome, a state often associated with dysbiosis and increased risk for various diseases and negative health outcomes.

A two-cohort study of healthy adults found higher alpha diversity in those reporting low stress levels. It also found a link between stress and enriched levels of Escherichia/Shigella, an overgrowth of which has been linked to various conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease.

In addition, a 2023 systematic review of human studies concluded that stress is associated with changes in specific genera — namely reductions in gut-healthy Lachnospira/Lachnospiraceae and Phascolarctobacterium, which produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids that support the health of the intestinal lining and modulate the immune system.

Stress during specific life stages also appears to alter the gut microbiome.

For example, in a study of postpartum women, those at an increased risk for parenting stress showed lower alpha diversity on the Shannon diversity index.

Research involving mother-child pairs tied adversity — such as maltreatment of the mother during her childhood, prenatal anxiety, and hardship in the child's early life — to distinct microbiome profiles in 2-year-olds, supporting a stress-microbiome pathway relevant to socioemotional outcomes, the authors said.

Emerging evidence indicates a link between the gut microbiome and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

A recent systematic review found differences in gut microbial taxa between individuals with PTSD and trauma-exposed controls without PTSD. A separate analysis pointed to a potential causal impact of gut microbiomes on the development of PTSD.

Stress interferes with the brain's production of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which controls anxiety, mood, sleep, and many other functions in the brain, Shaukat told Medscape Medical News.

“But serotonin also crosses the blood-brain barrier, and actually, the gut has more serotonin receptors than the brain, so an imbalance of serotonin can actually affect the gut microbiome through signaling at the neurotransmitter level,” Shaukat explained.

Stress can also affect sleep, and sleep itself has regulatory properties for gut bacteria, Shaukat noted.

“Stress also lowers our immunity, and this can make the gut barrier susceptible or permeable to bacterial toxins that can pass through and breach the gut barrier and be released into the bloodstream, which can trigger inflammation,” Shaukat explained.

The gut-brain-microbiome axis remains an emerging field of study. “We're learning more and more about this, and we need to because the microbial colonies are so diverse and we haven't nailed it down yet,” Shaukat said.

In the meantime, what can clinicians tell patients?

Aside from managing stress, which “is easier said than done,” patients can improve their diet, Shaukat said.

“What we tell patients is to essentially increase their intake of gut-friendly foods that preferentially grow the bacterial colonies that are beneficial for us,” Shaukat said. This includes fermented foods, yogurt, kimchi, chia seeds, kombucha, pickled vegetables, and whole grains.

A recent randomized controlled trial of healthy adults found a “psychobiotic diet” — a diet high in prebiotic and fermented foods — was associated with less perceived stress and subtle beneficial shifts in microbial composition.

“These foods can help keep the gut in good health and may actually also reduce or mitigate some of the effects of stress,” Shaukat said.

“Eating well is something I think we should all think about and maybe prioritize when we're going through a stressful situation or looking to kind of mitigate the effects of stress and the anxiety and depression it can cause,” she advised.

Shaukat said she also encourages patients to engage in regular physical activity, which benefits the gut microbiome by helping to regulate gut motility. Exercise can also boost mood and help relieve stress.

“A balanced Mediterranean diet and regular activity is truly the secret for gut health,” Shaukat said.

Patients may be tempted by the probiotic supplements lining drugstore shelves, but there “isn't great evidence for probiotic supplements,” she said. “What we can get from dietary sources far outweighs what can be put in a pill.”

Shaukat disclosed having no relevant disclosures.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Daily actions are driven by habit rather than conscious choice","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250921/Daily-actions-are-driven-by-habit-rather-than-conscious-choice.aspx","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 01:12:00 GMT","

Habit, not conscious choice, drives most of our actions, according to new research from the University of Surrey, University of South Carolina and Central Queensland University. 

The research, published in Psychology & Health, found that two-thirds of our daily behaviors are initiated ""on autopilot"", out of habit. 

Habits are actions that we are automatically prompted to do when we encounter everyday settings, due to associations that we have learned between those settings and our usual responses to them. 

The research also found that 46% of behaviors were both triggered by habit and aligned with conscious intentions, suggesting that people form habits that support their personal goals, and often disrupt habits that conflict with them. 

While there have been previous attempts to estimate the prevalence of habits in our day-to-day lives, this study used a new method to capture habits in action. The international research team surveyed 105 participants from the UK and Australia, sending six random prompts to their phones each day for a week, asking them to describe what they were currently doing, and whether it was triggered out of habit or done intentionally. 

The study found that 65% of daily behaviors were habitually initiated, meaning people were prompted to do them out of routine rather than making a conscious decision. 

Our research shows that while people may consciously want to do something, the actual initiation and performance of that behavior is often done without thinking, driven by non-conscious habits. This suggests that ""good"" habits may be a powerful way to make our goals a reality. 

For people who want to break their bad habits, simply telling them to ""try harder"" isn't enough. To create lasting change, we must incorporate strategies to help people recognise and disrupt their unwanted habits, and ideally form positive new ones in their place."" 

Professor Benjamin Gardner, Professor in Psychology, University of Surrey and co-author of the study

The findings may have broader implications for public health and wellness interventions. The researchers recommend that initiatives designed to help people adopt new behaviors, like exercising or eating healthier, should focus on building new, positive habits. 

For example, for someone trying to take up exercise, inconsistent exercising may not be enough. The most effective strategy would involve identifying an everyday situation in which exercise can realistically be done – for example, at a certain time of day, or following a regular event, like leaving work – and consistently doing some exercise in that situation. 

Likewise, to break a bad habit like smoking, simply wanting to quit may not cut it. The most effective strategies would involve disrupting triggers (e.g. avoiding places where they used to smoke) and creating new routines (e.g. chewing gum after a meal instead of having a cigarette). 

Dr Amanda Rebar, Associate Professor at the University of South Carolina and lead author of the study said: 

""People like to think of themselves as rational decision makers, who think carefully about what to do before they do it. 

""However, much of our repetitive behavior is undertaken with minimal forethought and is instead generated automatically, by habit."" 

Dr Grace Vincent, Sleep Scientist and Associate Professor at Central Queensland University and co-author of the study, said the findings offer hope to people trying to develop healthier lifestyles: 

""Our study shows that two-thirds of what people do each day is sparked by habit, and most of the time those habits are also aligned with our intentions. 

""This means that if we set out to create a positive habit, whether that's around better sleep hygiene, or nutrition, or general wellbeing improvements, we can rely on an internal ""autopilot"" to take over and help us maintain those habits. 

""Unfortunately, not all habits are created equal. Exercise was the exception in our findings, as it was often triggered by habit, but less likely to be achieved purely ""on autopilot"", compared to other behaviors.""

Today marks a milestone in global health governance as the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) enter into force. This reflects a renewed global commitment to cooperation in the face of public health emergencies, shaped by hard-earned lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The IHR are global regulations that guide 196 States Parties, including all 194 WHO Member States, on their rights and obligations concerning public health risks. They recognize that infectious diseases and other public health risks do not respect borders, and that coordinated global action is critical.

The origins of the IHR can be traced back to the 19th century, when the expansion of travel and trade accelerated the spread of disease from port to port, prompting the introduction of quarantine measures. Initially governed by bilateral and regional treaties, these efforts were made global under the International Sanitary Regulations in 1951 following the founding of WHO. These regulations were later renamed the IHR and have since evolved to meet the changing landscape of global health.

In 2024, WHO Member States adopted amendments by consensus at the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in Geneva. One of the changes is the introduction of a new level of global alert – a ""pandemic emergency"" – to trigger stronger international collaboration when a health risk escalates beyond a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and poses the risk of becoming, or has already become, a pandemic, with widespread impact on the health system and disruption to societies. The amendments also introduce the establishment of National IHR Authorities by governments to coordinate IHR implementation, and include provisions to strengthen access to medical products and financing based on equity and solidarity.

These changes were driven by lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. The last major revisions were adopted in 2005 following the SARS outbreak.

The strengthening of the International Health Regulations represents a historic commitment to protect future generations from the devastating impact of epidemics and pandemics. We know that no one is safe until everyone is safe. The IHR amendments reaffirm our shared responsibility and solidarity in the face of global health risks.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General 

Alongside the amended IHR, Member States also adopted the WHO Pandemic Agreement at this year's World Health Assembly and are actively negotiating an annex to the agreement on Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing.

States have the sovereign right to implement legislations related to health policies. Under the IHR, WHO serves as the Secretariat, without authority to compel action by countries.

Eleven of the 196 IHR States Parties rejected the 2024 amendments. For them, previous versions of IHR continue to apply, though rejections may be withdrawn at any time. WHO will support IHR States Parties, as requested, in integrating the amendments to the regulations into national legal frameworks and strengthening institutional capacities to work together to build a safer, healthier future for all.

Scientists reveal how your daily cup of coffee may guard against liver disease, connecting population trends with the molecular pathways that drive inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer.



Review: Coffee for the liver: a mechanistic approach. Image Credit: I love coffee / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal Biochemical Pharmacology, researchers collated and synthesized decades of scientific literature across epidemiological, clinical, and experimental data to elucidate coffee's hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) benefits.

The review details how coffee's bioactive compounds, particularly caffeine, polyphenols, and diterpenes, exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, gut microbiome-modulating, and epigenetic-regulating effects, thereby slowing the progression of liver damage and reducing the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.

These findings offer a valuable resource for coffee consumers and healthcare professionals seeking to enhance their overall well-being.

Patients with hepatitis C drinking 3+ cups daily saw triple the response rate to older antiviral therapy (peginterferon/ribavirin) compared to non-coffee drinkers, hinting at a potential treatment boost.

The liver serves as the body's metabolic command center, responsible for a range of critical housekeeping functions, including processing nutrients, filtering toxins, and synthesizing essential proteins. Unfortunately, this heavy workload, combined with recent surges in viral infections, alcohol consumption, and metabolic disorders, makes the liver vulnerable to damage and conditions like cirrhosis and cancers, resulting in an unprecedented spike in liver disease prevalence.

While the liver does display the remarkable ability to regenerate (replace damaged or lost tissue with fresh/healthy cells), persistent chronic damage can result in systemic liver inflammation, which if left unchecked can progress to fibrosis (the formation of scar tissue), cirrhosis (advanced, irreversible scarring), and ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer.

While decades of research have produced several medical treatments for some liver conditions, the general consensus remains that prevention and management through lifestyle factors remain paramount. Among these, coffee consumption has consistently emerged as a powerful protective factor against liver disease in epidemiological studies. 

Individuals who practice regular coffee consumption demonstrate a significantly lower risk of developing various liver diseases and experience slower disease progression. However, these studies are largely observational and cannot prove direct causation. 

Furthermore, while consumers are often advised to drink coffee in moderation, the physiological benefits of coffee in lay terms remain unclear.

Coffee's diterpenes, cafestol and kahweol, independently trigger liver detox enzymes, enhancing protection against toxins and potentially lowering cancer risk beyond caffeine's effects.

This narrative review addresses the knowledge gap by comprehensively collating and elucidating decades of scientific research to synthesize and explain the hepatoprotective actions of coffee.

The review draws on a wide array of sources, from large-scale population studies to detailed molecular experiments in the lab, focusing on coffee's key bioactive compounds (caffeine, chlorogenic acids, diterpenes). It systematically investigates how each of these components interacts with the cellular pathways that drive liver damage.

Crucially, the review details coffee's five main lines of defense: its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, metabolism-modulating, and gut microbiota-balancing properties. It also explores emerging evidence for epigenetic regulation via microRNAs (e.g., miRNA-122).

By connecting epidemiological trends to specific molecular targets, this work provides clear, mechanistic explanations for coffee's long-observed benefits, while acknowledging limitations such as inconsistent results in hepatitis B cohorts.

Regular coffee intake consistently lowered key liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, GGT) – established markers of liver cell damage – across viral hepatitis, alcohol-related disease, and MASLD patients.

This review confirms that regular coffee consumption is associated with a significantly reduced risk of liver disease across all studies.

A meta-analysis included in the review found that regular coffee drinkers have a 29% lower risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the most common chronic liver condition worldwide.

The benefit is even more pronounced for liver fibrosis in MASLD patients, with several demonstrating a 30% reduction in risk. Notably, these protective effects appear to scale to more severe outcomes.

Multiple meta-analyses have found that coffee consumption is associated with up to a 40% reduction in the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer.

This benefit appears to be dose-dependent, with the greatest degree of protection observed in individuals who consume three or more cups daily, highlighting the importance of dosage in achieving the desired outcomes. However, this protective effect was attenuated in patients with hepatitis B who had high viral replication.

At the molecular level, the review details how coffee's bioactive compounds can synergistically produce improved outcomes when administered together, rather than independently. For example, caffeine and chlorogenic acids activate the body's innate antioxidant defenses by boosting a key protein called Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). These bioactives further suppress a primary inflammatory pathway, Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), thereby reducing the production of tissue-damaging cytokines.

Furthermore, caffeine and other coffee-derived compounds have been observed to directly inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells, the key cell type responsible for producing the scar tissue that leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis. 

Coffee also modulates the gut-liver axis by promoting beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium) and reducing intestinal permeability, which lowers toxin influx to the liver. Emerging evidence suggests epigenetic effects, such as modulation of miRNA-122, may further regulate fat metabolism and inflammation.

Unfiltered coffee drinkers might miss some benefits: Filtering removes certain diterpenes linked to cholesterol concerns, but also potentially reduces some protective effects seen in espresso or French press preparations.

This review provides strong associative evidence of coffee's physiological benefits, particularly in relation to liver protection. The world's third most popular beverage has been shown to provide a robust defense against the primary drivers of liver disease, including oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and gut dysbiosis, which are attributed to its rich blend of bioactive compounds.

While coffee should be consumed in moderation as a part of a broader healthy lifestyle and should not be viewed as a ""cure"", the beverage represents a simple, accessible, and effective dietary strategy for mitigating liver damage. 

Potential risks include anxiety or arrhythmias in caffeine-sensitive individuals, elevated cholesterol from unfiltered coffee (e.g., French press), and potential interactions with medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., certain antidepressants). 

More clinical trials are needed to validate preclinical findings; however, this review solidifies coffee's status as a key functional food in preventing and managing chronic liver disease, transforming a simple daily ritual into a scientifically backed health intervention.

Abselion, a pioneering life sciences technology company focused on simplifying biomolecule quantification, today announced the launch of its Protein G Total Antibody Quantification Kit. The new kit is designed for use with the company's Amperia™ benchtop platform and complements the existing Protein A-based format, enabling researchers to quantify a broader range of antibody isotypes and species using the same protocol-guided, user-friendly workflow and highly sensitive electrochemical readout. Abselion's extended antibody quantification offering reflects continued investment in expanding the capabilities of its flexible Amperia platform to help streamline decision-making and optimize bioprocess workflows for scientists working across diverse antibody discovery and development settings.

Abselion's Amperia benchtop platform is a simple-to-use solution for rapid and accurate automated quantification of a range of biomolecules, without optics or fluidics. The Protein G Total Antibody Quantification Kit is supplied in a ready-to-use format, including Protein G-coated sensor strips, assay plates, detection reagents, and assay buffers. The kit is suitable for use with purified or partially purified antibody samples in research and process development settings. Combined with Amperia's intuitive software and step-by-step guidance, it allows researchers to generate reliable antibody titer data without the need for complex setup or specialized training.

The assay uses sensor strips pre-coated with Protein G, enabling direct capture of antibodies from a sample. After incubation, a labelled detection molecule binds to any remaining unoccupied Fc-binding sites on the sensor. The assay takes place directly on the sensor tip, where the bound analyte triggers an electrical signal, which is read instantaneously by Amperia. As antibody concentration increases, fewer sites are available for detection, resulting in a lower signal. This inverse occupancy format produces a signal that is inversely proportional to antibody concentration.

Current quantitative methods, such as bio-layer interferometry and surface plasmon resonance, are often limited to centralized analytical laboratories due to their cost and complexity of operation. This can lead to analytical delays and requirements for sample storage. Abselion's Amperia system offers a robust, cost-effective, automated alternative for efficient, accurate antibody titer measurement. By introducing a Protein G-based option, users working with humanized antibodies, rodent IgGs, or engineered variants can now run reliable titer measurements without the need for revalidating or redesigning their assay setup.

Antibody-based research and development often involves a wide variety of formats, subclasses, and species. Having the flexibility to choose the most appropriate assay without adjusting workflows can simplify decision-making and improve efficiency.

This launch reflects Abselion's commitment to evolving its platform in response to real-world research needs. Expanding our antibody quantification offering with Protein G allows us to better support scientists working with a broader range of antibody formats, and reflects our ongoing focus on making practical, application-driven tools more accessible.""

The Basic to Breakthrough series chronicles how investments from the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science at our National Laboratories have led to new technologies that are changing our world. 

While teaching in Oklahoma, a Brazilian dentist began pursuing his idea for a new technology that would ultimately lead him to eastern Tennessee. There, he had access to the discovery science expertise and world-class research facilities at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). He used these resources to develop and test his breakthrough: the world's first long-acting antibacterial adhesive resin for dental restorations. 

The dentist, Fernando Luis Esteban Florez, a tenured associate professor and researcher at the University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry, is working to prevent the secondary tooth decay that bacteria cause around the edges of dental restorations, such as fillings and crowns. These secondary cavities are why most restorations need to be replaced on average every five to seven years.

""My idea was to develop dental adhesives that would provide long-term protection from oral bacteria,"" said Esteban Florez, the lead inventor.

In the U.S. alone, a long-acting antibacterial dental adhesive could help prevent more than 60 million dental procedures per year and save patients over $5 billion annually. But as a dentist with limited training in scientific research, developing and testing my idea for antibacterial nanoparticles and putting them in a clinical product seemed out of reach.""

Fernando Luis Esteban Florez, University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry

Esteban Florez and Sharukh Khajotia, the college's associate dean for research and innovation and a co-inventor, learned about the DOE Office of Science's User Facilities. These 28 User Facilities, located at National Laboratories around the country, provide state-of-the-art research facilities to the global science community at little or no cost to users. Esteban Florez and Khajotia submitted a user proposal to ORNL to work with scientists at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) and the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). 

""I'm grateful for the DOE's user program, which enabled me, a dentist without advanced scientific training, to access the world-leading expertise and resources at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It saved me six to eight years of development time,"" said Esteban Florez.

With the help of the world-class researchers at these nanomaterials and neutron science facilities, the co-inventors created multifunctional nanoparticles with long-lasting antimicrobial properties. These nanoparticles can be added to resins and other polymers used in medicine, dentistry, public health, and engineering. 

The team modified titanium dioxide nanoparticles that produce highly reactive chemicals, known as reactive oxygen species, that can kill bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. Unlike with antibiotics, microbes cannot develop resistance to these chemicals.

The nanoparticles were then dispersed in an adhesive resin commonly used by dentists. Researchers examined samples of the experimental adhesive resin using a helium-ion microscope at CNMS and small-angle neutron scattering using the Bio-SANS instrument at HFIR. With these tools, they determined the optimal particle shape, modifications, and dispersion method.

""The benefit of using Bio-SANS is that it allowed us to see how the proteins bonded to the nanoparticles and how well the particles dispersed within the polymer resin,"" said Khajotia. 

According to Esteban Florez, the experimental results showed that for the first time in dentistry, nanoparticles had dispersed without clustering and functioned well within a polymer and displayed strong antibacterial properties without light irradiation. 

""We are currently talking with a leading dental products company about commercializing this patented technology for a wide range of products,"" said Esteban Florez. ""This extremely versatile antibacterial and antimicrobial polymer technology can work in countless applications, including dental restorations, teeth whitening products, medical devices and equipment, and in paint on surfaces throughout public places, such as at hospitals and airports, to reduce levels of bacteria and viruses.""

Childhood exposure to chemicals used to make plastic household items presents growing health risks that can extend long into adulthood, experts from NYU Langone Health report.

This is the main conclusion after a review of hundreds of the latest studies on the topic, publishing online Sept. 21 in the journal The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.

The article is being released to coincide with a gathering of experts the same week in New York City to discuss the global impact of plastics on human health.

In their report, the authors outline decades of evidence that substances often added to industrial and household goods may contribute to disease and disability, particularly when they are encountered early in life. The review focuses on three classes of chemical - phthalates used to make plastic flexible, bisphenols, which provide rigidity, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which help materials resist heat and repel water.

The results of the studies, which together assessed thousands of pregnant mothers, fetuses, and children, tied these toxins to a wide range of long-term health concerns, including heart disease, obesity, infertility, and asthma.

Our findings point to plastic's role in the early origins of many chronic diseases that reverberate into adolescence and adulthood.""

Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP, study lead author and pediatrician 

""If we want kids to stay healthy and live longer, then we need to get serious about limiting the use of these materials,"" added Trasande, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

The chemicals are found in a range of items, such as food packaging, cosmetics, and paper receipts, notes Trasande, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health. Experts have found that as plastics are used, heated, or chemically treated, microplastic and nanoparticles are released and become ingested.

Chemicals used in plastic materials have been shown to prompt an overactive immune response (inflammation) throughout the body's tissues as well as disrupt the function of hormones that influence many bodily processes. The substances are also believed to affect brain development, with numerous studies linking early-life exposure to IQ loss and neurodevelopmental issues such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The Lancet review also explored strategies to reduce the use of plastic and to help safeguard human health.

""There are safe, simple steps that parents can take to limit their children's plastic exposure without breaking the bank,"" said Trasande, who serves as director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Division of Environmental Pediatrics and NYU Langone Health's Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.

Replacing plastic containers with glass or stainless steel, and avoiding microwaving and dishwashing plastic, have proved helpful, he says.

Trasande adds that by offering clear guidance, health care providers can empower parents to make informed decisions about the products they use and steer them toward safer options. He also suggests that clinicians partner with schools and community organizations to engage younger generations about the health risks of plastic exposure.

At the policy level, the researchers call for stricter regulatory measures to reduce the use of nonessential plastic items, particularly in low-income communities with profound heath disparities.

Their review comes on the heels of the most recent round of negations for the United Nations' Global Plastics Treaty, which took place in Geneva last month. The developing treaty represents an international effort to tackle plastic pollution, with more than 100 countries calling for legally binding caps on production.

According to Trasande, the findings in the article support the urgent need for a strong agreement to help protect not only the environment but human health as well.

He notes that while the economic value of the plastics industry is commonly raised as a barrier to enacting regulations, the resulting health care costs from exposure are enormous, with his research estimates reaching roughly $250 billion per year in the United States alone.

The Global Plastics Treaty will be part of the discussion during NYU Langone Health's 2025 Plastics, Human Health, and Solutions Symposium. At the event, experts will discuss the latest research on the health impact of microplastics, recent policy developments, and the critical role of regulations in addressing this public health crisis.

Despite its health risks, plastic can play an essential role in pediatric medicine, such as its use in ventilators and feeding tubes for premature infants, nebulizers for children with asthma, and masks that help prevent the spread of infection. The findings, the researchers say, do not challenge the need for the material in health care but instead highlight the dangers of its unnecessary use elsewhere.

The symposium will be held at NYU Langone Health on Sept. 22. The event will also be live streamed on YouTube for registered attendees.

Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants R01ES022972, R01ES029779, R01ES032214, R01ES034793, and P2CES033423. Further funding was provided by several Argentinian foundations as well as the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia.

Along with Trasande, Marina Olga Fernandez, PhD, at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research in Buenos Aires, Argentina, serves as study senior author.

Another study co-investigator is Aleksandra Buha Đorđević, PhD, at the University of Belgrade in Serbia.

Researchers at The University of Osaka have developed a groundbreaking, minimally invasive method for recording brain activity through blood vessels. This technique could potentially transform the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions like epilepsy and paving the way for advanced brain-computer interfaces. It eliminates the need for invasive open-brain surgery, offering a safer and more accessible way to monitor and stimulate brain function.

Current methods for directly measuring brain activity require invasive procedures, either removing part of the skull to place electrodes on the brain surface or inserting electrodes directly into brain tissue. While non-invasive methods like EEG exist, they lack the precision needed for detailed analysis. This new method bridges the gap, offering high-fidelity recordings without the risks associated with traditional invasive approaches.

The research team, led by Professor Takufumi Yanagisawa used a catheter to insert ultra-thin wire electrodes into the cortical and deep veins of pig brains. They successfully recorded brainwaves from these vessels with accuracy comparable to traditional methods. Notably, they were able to capture activity from deep brain regions previously difficult to access non-invasively. Stimulating electrodes in the motor cortex also successfully evoked muscle responses in the face and shoulders.

This less invasive approach promises improved diagnoses and treatments for epilepsy and other neurological disorders. It also unlocks new possibilities for understanding deep brain functions and developing next-generation brain-computer interfaces, potentially allowing individuals with severe paralysis to communicate and control devices.""

A UK study reveals that simply reordering hospital meal options, without changing recipes, may deliver significant health and climate gains.

Study: Strategic menu optimization could reduce carbon emissions and saturated fat consumption: a simulation modelling study of UK hospital inpatient meals. Image credit: 135pixels/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of B: Biological Sciences examined the impact of strategic menu optimization on saturated fat consumption and carbon emissions in an inpatient environment. The study used simulation to predict whether strategic menu swaps in a hospital inpatient setting could reduce carbon emissions and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake.

Efforts to change food consumption behavior via legislation may not last permanently, despite some studies showing that they promote environmentally sustainable and healthy food choices. Moreover, in specific settings (e.g., hospitals), traditional interventions may not be practical or appropriate, as patients are more concerned with enjoying food than its sustainability.

One study under the Transforming UK Food Systems (TUKFS) Programme noted reductions in carbon footprint and SFA intake of about 31% and 6%, respectively, by strategically designing menus in a university hall of residence. This suggests that there could be benefits across other sectors beyond a university setting.

In the UK, 42% of workers report eating in a canteen. Diners' menu choices affect nutritional and environmental outcomes, depending on both the menu options selected and those not selected. Competition between menu items matters, and by altering the choice architecture, one can influence the frequency of selection of each dish and thereby influence target outcome variables (e.g., carbon footprint).

The primary objectives of this study were to investigate the feasibility of modeling hospital data and to determine the expected level of predicted reductions. Researchers convenience-sampled NHS hospitals across the 12 UK regions that made their weekly inpatient dining menus publicly available. The focus was on weekday menus (H01-H12) serving the day's main meal. Since hospitals did not publish recipe-level data, the carbon footprint and SFA content were calculated using ingredient lists from BBC Good Food recipes and the Klimato tool.

All dishes served at a mealtime on weekdays were extracted, with the first three dishes available daily across all sites making up a baseline dataset. Furthermore, food preference data from 50 online survey participants recruited via Prolific and matched by region were collected for each hospital because food choices can differ across individuals and areas. The optimizing approach generated a single menu that minimized carbon footprint and SFA intake across 50 people across 5 days of the week, rather than at an individual level.

The weekly menu, i.e., five groups of three dishes, formed a total of 1,401,400 unique combinations, which was reduced to 113,400 after applying a requirement that at least one vegetarian dish be offered daily. Across these combinations, for each participant, identification was done for the five dishes that they would most likely choose in a week.

These results were then combined, for each site, to compute the average weekly SFA consumption for all participants and the carbon footprint. The differences in predicted weekly SFAs and carbon footprints were computed relative to the baseline to calculate the efficacy of strategic menu design.

The menu optimization was suitable for 11 out of 12 hospitals. One site had to be dropped from the analysis because it offered only six unique dishes across the week, greatly limiting the number of unique menu combinations. For the remaining sites, while targeting a reduction in carbon footprint as the sole objective, a predicted reduction of 12.7–29.3% was achieved. The corresponding reductions for SFA consumption were between 6.5% and 31.5%. The results were broadly similar for carbon footprint and SFA intake when they were minimized jointly, i.e., 9.1 to 29.3% and 5.0 to 26.5%, respectively.

There was considerable variation across hospital sites in the potential for reductions, with some menus showing much greater opportunities to cut carbon emissions and saturated fat than others. The size of the reduction mainly depended on the range of variation in targeted variables across menu combinations, and on how the baseline menu compared with the optimized menu.

In sum, simulation modelling showed that strategic menu swapping has the potential to reduce SFA consumption and food carbon footprint. The main strength of this approach is that it can be simultaneously applied with other strategies based on reformulation. Additionally, hospitals could choose other variables to minimize, such as sugar or salt consumption, or maximize variables like fibre intake. Finally, since no meal needs to be removed from the menu, caterers do not have to change their recipes.

The key limitation of the current study is that the hospital selection might not have been representative, as only those hospitals were chosen that made their menus publicly available. Furthermore, the participant sample recruited was younger on average than typical hospital inpatients. The modelling strategy failed to consider side dishes (e.g., mashed potatoes) and special dishes (e.g., gluten-free).

The authors emphasized that these are early-stage estimates, and real-world implementation is premature until further trials are conducted. Practical challenges such as logistics, costs, and stakeholder acceptance must be addressed before wider rollout.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study uncovers widespread ignorance of cystitis and UTI prevention","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250922/Study-uncovers-widespread-ignorance-of-cystitis-and-UTI-prevention.aspx","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:07:00 GMT","

A new international study has uncovered a concerning lack of public understanding about cystitis and urinary tract infections (UTIs) – common health issues that disproportionately affect women. The findings, which also highlight widespread misconceptions about prevention and treatment, underscore the urgent need for education to combat rising antibiotic resistance.

In a survey of over 3,000 adults across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, 35% of respondents could not correctly define cystitis as a bladder infection, with some confusing it for a skin condition or even food allergies. Among younger adults aged 18–24, fewer than half (45%) were able to identify cystitis correctly.

Despite medical consensus that women are significantly more affected by UTIs, only half (51%) of respondents recognised this, while nearly 1 in 5 men incorrectly believed that men are more commonly affected. Encouragingly, awareness was higher among women themselves, with 63% correctly identifying their increased risk compared to just 38% of men.

UTIs are often preventable, but knowledge of basic prevention strategies is worryingly low:

Only 21% of all respondents could identify all three key prevention strategies, and 1 in 6 couldn't name a single correct preventive measure. Women are three times more likely to identify the three correct ways of prevention.

Many teenagers today are sexually active without understanding the risks of bladder infections. Young women in particular are more vulnerable because of their anatomy, yet too often they think the contraceptive pill protects them from all risks and that condoms are unnecessary. We urgently need to address this through school education and social media, otherwise we risk a new generation of young women suffering repeated urinary tract infections and even long-term bladder damage.""

Jane Meijlink, Chair, International Painful Bladder Foundation

While not all UTIs require antibiotics, 16% of respondents incorrectly believe they are always needed-a misconception that fuels antibiotic overuse and resistance. Even among those affected, awareness of the risks associated with antibiotic resistance is not widespread. Almost half of respondents either underestimated or were unaware of the growing difficulty in treating UTIs due to antibiotic resistance.

""Urinary tract infections affect over 400 million people worldwide and cause approximately 240,000 deaths each year, with rising antibiotic resistance making them harder to treat,"" said Prof. Gernot Bonkat (CH), chair of the EAU Infections Guidelines Panel. ""This study shows that raising public awareness, as well as education about symptoms, causes, and treatment, is still essential to prevent infections, reduce suffering, and slow the spread of resistance. Importantly, not every infection needs to be treated with antibiotics-judicious use is key to combating resistance. ""

Ferroptosis, a regulated cell death mechanism, is emerging as a promising target for cancer therapy. The process is mediated by the activity of acyl-CoA synthetase family member 4 (ACSL4) protein. This study focuses on the role of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), known for promoting various aspects of tumor progression in ACSL4 pathway regulation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study can help in improving the therapeutic efficiency of immunotherapy in treating RCC. 

Ferroptosis is a newly discovered regulated cell death mechanism, which involves the rupture of the outer membrane of cell and mitochondrial collapse. The mechanism involves lipid peroxidation, a degradation process of lipid which is the main component of the cell membrane. The process is dependent on the accumulation of iron. Recent research works suggest that it plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression, thus providing new opportunities in cancer treatment.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 85% of cases. Treatment options for this particular type of cancer are still limited and researchers are exploring effective diagnostic and therapeutic targets for RCC. Understanding how the ferroptosis pathway is regulated in RCC can help in developing a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RCC. Previous studies established the role of acyl-CoA synthetase family member 4 (ACSL4) protein in mediating this cell death mechanism. The protein binds to polyunsaturated fatty acids, incorporates them in the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane, and drives the ferroptosis process.

Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is another protein of interest involved in RCC tumor progression. PRMT5 regulates methylation, a biochemical process where a methyl group is added to a molecule, such as DNA, RNA, or proteins.

In this study, a research team led by Dr. Meng Zhang from Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, China, decided to understand the role of PRMT5 and ACSL4 in the ferroptosis regulation of RCC.

Our recent research work revealed that PRMT5-mediated methylation of ALKBH5, a protein involved in RNA metabolism, leads to immune escape in colorectal cancer. We wanted to understand how PRMT5 influences RCC progression and if it affects the ferroptosis process in RCC by regulating ACSL4 methylation."" 

Dr. Meng Zhang, Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University

The study was published online in Volume 8 of the journal Research on August 01, 2025.

The researchers used renal cancer cell line to conduct this study. The group also screened around 765 epigenetic compounds to identify the novel regulators involved in ferroptosis of renal cancer cells. Different assays were conducted to study cell viability, protein expression, and ferroptosis pathway regulation. Patient samples were analyzed to understand RCC prognosis. Some animal model-based studies were also conducted to understand the clinical implications of the findings.

The study revealed that PRMT5 regulates the methylation of ACSL4. ""ACSL4 has arginine, a basic amino acid at the 549th position. PRMT5 regulates the methylation of ACSL4 at this position,"" explains Dr. Zhang. Dimethylation of the arginine, a process where two methyl groups are added, destabilizes the ACSL4 protein. The methylated ACSL4 (meR549-ACSL4) binds to UBR5, a protein involved in protein degradation.

As ACSL4 promotes ferroptosis, its degradation makes the renal cancel cells resistant to ferroptosis. ""We wanted to understand how PRMT5 affects the ferroptosis process. We inhibited PRMT5 expression in the cancer cells and noticed an increase in ferroptosis,"" mentioned Dr. Zhang, while talking about the role of PRMT5. Thus, PRMT5 induces ferroptosis resistance in renal cancer cells, increasing their viability.

Ferroptosis reinforces the antitumor effect of immunotherapeutic treatments. When PRMT5 was inhibited, the researchers noticed an elevation in the ferroptosis process and an improved effect of immunotherapeutic treatment. Additionally, the research team identified a PRMT5 inhibitor called GSK3326595 which could function as a novel antitumor agent. Integrating this newly identified antitumor agent with a programmed death-1 blockade can have potential therapeutic implications.

Combined therapeutic strategies, often involving the simultaneous application of two or more treatment modalities, are increasingly used to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance in various diseases. In RCC, PRMT5 inhibition can be introduced along with immunotherapy strategies to sensitize the RCC cells to ferroptosis and improve the efficiency of the therapy. Further research and clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficiency of this combination therapy.

Macrophages rely on lysosomes to balance microbial killing with self-protection, generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during phagocytosis. Using platinum nanoelectrodes, researchers at Wuhan University tracked these reactive molecules in real time, revealing that lysosomal pH acts as a chemical dial. Acidic conditions favor hydrogen peroxide, while mild alkalinization promotes nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and nitrite. This precise pH-dependent control shapes immune responses, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signaling, offering insights for therapies targeting macrophage function.

Macrophages, the sentinels of the innate immune system, are tasked with a delicate balancing act: they must destroy invading pathogens while limiting damage to surrounding tissues. Central to this function is phagocytosis, the process by which macrophages engulf and neutralize microbes. During this process, macrophages generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), highly reactive chemical molecules that serve both as microbicidal agents and as signaling mediators. While the importance of ROS and RNS in immune defense is well established, the precise mechanisms that regulate their production and timing within macrophages have remained poorly understood.Recent research has highlighted lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles known as cellular waste disposers, as pivotal regulatory hubs in immune signaling. Lysosomes not only digest pathogens but also create microenvironments that influence the chemistry of ROS and RNS production. It is speculated that the acidity within lysosomes, typically maintained at low pH, might dictate which reactive species are generated and in what quantity. But how exactly does lysosomal pH control the chemical arsenal of macrophages during phagocytosis, and could pH manipulation alter ROS/RNS production?To address this question, a research team led by Dr. Wei-Hua Huang from Wuhan University, China, and Dr. Christian Amatore from Xiamen University, China, developed a nanoelectrochemical sensor that enables real-time monitoring of ROS and RNS dynamics directly inside lysosomes. The study was published in Volume 8 of the journal Research on June 5, 2025.The study showed that lysosomal acidity acts as a fine-tuning mechanism that directs the balance between different reactive species. When lysosomal pH dropped below 5.0, protonation of superoxide anions facilitated the conversion to hydrogen peroxide without changing the production rates of superoxide and nitric oxide precursors. This shift increased oxidative activity within the lysosome while keeping overall ROS generation controlled. Conversely, alkalinization of lysosomes to pH levels above 6.0 promoted higher initial nitric oxide production, which subsequently led to peroxynitrite and nitrite formation. Both acidic and alkaline conditions elevated oxidative stress and stimulated proinflammatory signaling, suggesting that deviations from the optimal lysosomal pH can have significant consequences for immune regulation.This finding underscores that lysosomes are not passive containers but active chemical modulators, controlling the release and conversion of reactive molecules according to local acidity.The interplay between ROS and RNS species is also an interesting part of the study. Acidic lysosomes favored hydrogen peroxide formation, optimal for killing certain bacteria, while mild alkalinization promoted peroxynitrite and nitrite accumulation, which may target other pathogens or signal to neighboring immune cells. This nuanced chemical regulation allows macrophages to tailor their microbicidal arsenal to specific microbial threats, an adaptive feature that had long been hypothesized but never directly visualized.The use of nanoelectrochemical sensors is novel. Previous approaches relied on bulk cell measurements, which averaged ROS/RNS signals across the entire cell and obscured localized dynamics. The nanometer-scale electrodes penetrated the phagocytic cup without disrupting normal cell function, allowing repeated measurements over time. This precision enabled the researchers to map the kinetics of ROS and RNS in unprecedented detail, revealing that temporal regulation and chemical conversion within lysosomes are highly pH-dependent.The study has therapeutic potential as well. Dysregulated lysosomal pH has been implicated in chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and impaired microbial clearance. Modulating lysosomal acidity could therefore provide a targeted strategy to enhance or suppress macrophage activity. For example, stabilizing lysosomal pH in aged or immunocompromised individuals might boost pathogen clearance, while controlled alkalinization could reduce excessive oxidative stress in autoimmune diseases.Overall, the study highlights lysosomal pH as a critical determinant of ROS and RNS homeostasis during phagocytosis. By providing real-time, nanoscale insights into reactive species dynamics, the research illuminates a previously hidden layer of immune regulation: how macrophages balance killing microbes while avoiding self-harm.

Scientists have created a low-cost gluten sensor that combines lateral flow strips with smartphone imaging, exposing hidden contamination in everyday foods from fries to salads and offering peace of mind to millions on gluten-free diets.

Study: Empowering Gliadin Detection: A Visible-Code Semiquantitative Lateral Flow System for Rapid and Reliable Results. Image credit: Daisy Daisy/Shutterstock.com

Wheat bread has been a central part of the human diet for centuries. Yet today, gluten, the main wheat protein, is suspected of triggering potentially serious food reactions. This means the need to test foods for gluten in such individuals. A recent paper published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry presents a newly developed gluten detection system that could revolutionize food analysis.

About 8% of children and 13% of adults have food allergies, mainly to wheat, peanuts and tree nuts, milk, eggs, soy, fish, sesame, and shellfish. These allergies cost about $25 billion in healthcare alone. Tests are needed to accurately identify allergen-containing foods, especially since those with food allergies tend to be more food-insecure.

Wheat-related conditions include celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder, not a classic allergy) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Gluten-related immune reactions are triggered primarily by the gliadin component of this wheat protein. Being largely insoluble, gliadin precipitates to form fibers in the presence of glutenin, increasing the chances of cross-contamination and making it difficult to detect.

Cross-contamination and mislabeling of restaurant items and mass-produced foods are quite common despite regulatory policies and statutes. Patients with celiac disease often cannot eat out safely or have a limited range of safe foods.

Gluten testing based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or electrochemical sensors is typically costly and complex. This prompted the current study, which sought to develop a reliable yet simple test.

The new system, termed LEO (lateral flow enhanced by optical imaging), combines lateral flow assays with smartphone-based image analysis aided by Internet of Things technology.

Lateral flow assays are tests that detect the presence of a target substance in a liquid sample. They are used widely to detect pesticides, cancer-related biochemicals, and food allergens. However, they provide only qualitative results and have mediocre accuracy.

This innovative next-generation test strip combines competitive and sandwich detection methods. The lateral flow testing technology is integrated with image processing software, measuring the food's gluten content.

The competitive and sandwich detection regions have different sensitivity thresholds, providing a fixed detection range. Thus, the test includes:

The combined format remarkably boosts the accuracy of the system. Absence of the O line indicates an invalid test. The presence of gliadin <5 ppm causes both O and E to appear. Between 5 and 10 ppm, all three lines appear.

At gliadin >10 and 20 ppm, the E line signal weakens while the hook effect affects the L line, leaving the O and L lines visible. If the O line alone is seen, it indicates that both E and L lines have disappeared due to the hook effect.

This portable system can tell whether the sample contains gliadin in less than three minutes, since it extracts gliadin using an ionic liquid. Moreover, it strongly correlates with ELISA results, with >98% agreement. Its detection limits of 5–10 ppm are well below the 20 ppm threshold that the Food and Drug Administration has for such tests.

The LEO assay results agreed well with those obtained by conventional ELISA testing, but took less than three minutes compared to three hours for ELISA.

The test system correctly detected and quantified gliadin in the sample across a range of up to 40 ppm concentrations. It was highly specific for gluten even when milk was present, since only wheat-containing samples produced signals. The gluten recovery rate was 100% in spiked rice noodle tests, showing efficient extraction under controlled conditions. The LEO interface, coupled with a smartphone, can create a shareable map of local restaurants serving gluten-free food.

Real-world tests of supposedly gluten-free dishes on a restaurant menu confirmed the high accuracy. The foods tested include burgers, salads with dressing, pizza, and beer. Over 95% of gluten-free products contained <20 ppm of gluten.

French fries were an exception, showing significant cross-contamination from the fryers used. The salads contained gluten, probably because of cross-contamination during mixing in bowls that previously held croutons or perhaps due to the dressing.

In addition, both LEO and another widely used strip-based antibody assay were used to compare commercial food products like Ferrero or M&M's chocolate, bagels, Lay's potato crisps, or Lotus Biscoff Spread. In contrast to LEO, the other strip test requires a prepared sample, a buffer that needs to be refrigerated, and more time.

The results were highly consistent. The gluten levels ranged between 0 and >20 ppm. Gliadin levels in some foods were below the ELISA detection threshold but were picked up by LEO.

The linked LEOMyFood app uploads the test results to the cloud. The results are documented with dates and locations and can be shared, creating evidence-based “food maps.”

“With its fast, accurate results and user-friendly design, LEO supports safer food choices for individuals with celiac disease and is suitable for personal, clinical, industrial, and regulatory use.” Compared to other gluten tests, it can reduce the risk of missed detections from the hook effect, is cost-effective at <$10 per test, and needs no extra equipment.

In the future, it may be extended to other common food allergens, thus ensuring food safety and promoting a secure food supply chain. Ruling out contamination can help people with dietary restrictions avoid accidental, potentially dangerous exposures.

Its adaptability could allow it to detect other compounds, including nucleic acids and toxins. “We believe that the portable LEO has the potential to revolutionize food analysis.”

U.S. Under-20 Men's National Team head coach Marko Mitrović has selected the 21 players that will represent the United States at the 2025 FIFA Under-20 World Cup that will take place in Chile from Sept. 27-Oct. 19.

The USA kicks off Group E play on Monday, Sept. 29 against New Caledonia (7 p.m. ET; FS1, Universo), faces France on Thursday, Oct. 2 (4 p.m. ET; FS2, Universo) and closes the group stage against South Africa on Sunday, Oct. 5 (4 p.m. ET; FS2, Telemundo). All three matches will be played at Estadio El Teniente in Rancagua.  

The participation in FIFA tournaments by U.S. Soccer's Youth National Teams is part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship. 

“We are very excited about the group of players that will represent the United States at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Chile,” said Mitrović. “Wearing your country's crest in a World Cup is a special moment for every player and as a Federation, we're proud that each player has developed through our American soccer pathway. We are grateful to the clubs that released their players in support of our mission and now our goal is to make our country proud.”

The U.S. will look to build on its history of success at the U-20 World Cup as the only nation to reach the quarterfinals of the last four tournaments and one of just two countries to qualify for the last six editions alongside New Zealand.

The USA qualified for the World Cup with a runner-up finish at the 2024 Concacaf Men's U-20 Championship in Mexico. Twelve players return from the squad that helped the U.S. clinch a sixth-straight U-20 World Cup berth and 18th overall appearance in the competition. 

GOALKEEPERS (3): 12-Adam Beaudry (Colorado Rapids; Castle Pines, Colo.; 7/0), 21-Duran Ferree (San Diego FC; San Diego, Calif.; 1/0), 1-Diego Kochen (FC Barcelona/ESP; Miramar, Fla.; 5/0) 

DEFENDERS (7): 2-Reed Baker-Whiting (Seattle Sounders; Seattle, Wash.; 7/0), 18-Luca Bombino (San Diego FC; Saugus, Calif.; 9/0), 5-Noah Cobb (Colorado Rapids; Chattanooga, Tenn.; 13/0), 16-Ethan Kohler (SC Verl/GER; Campbell, Calif.; 12/1), 3-Nolan Norris (FC Dallas; Fort Worth, Texas; 16/0), 17-Francis Westfield (Philadelphia Union; Philadelphia, Pa.; 7/0), 4-Joshua Wynder (Benfica/POR; Louisville, Ky.; 11/1) 

MIDFIELDERS (6): 19-Matthew Corcoran (Nashville SC; Dallas, Texas; 5/1), 8-Benjamin Cremaschi (Parma/ITA; Key Biscayne, Fla.; 9/2), 14-Taha Habroune (Columbus Crew; Columbus, Ohio; 14/2), 6-Brooklyn Raines (Houston Dynamo; Chicago, Ill.; 15/1), 15-Pedro Soma (San Diego FC; Coconut Creek, Fla.; 15/2), 10-Niko Tsakiris (San Jose Earthquakes; Saratoga, Calif.; 23/8)

FORWARDS (5): 11-Luke Brennan (Atlanta United; Atlanta, Ga.; 10/2), 7-Cole Campbell (Borussia Dortmund/GER; Peachtree City, Ga.; 3/0), 20-Zavier Gozo (Real Salt Lake City; Eagle Mountain, Utah; 11/2), 13-Peyton Miller (New England Revolution; Unionville, Conn.; 6/1), 9-Marcos Zambrano (Real Salt Lake; Gladwyne, Pa.; 13/6)

The U-20 MNT players will begin gathering on Monday, Sept. 22 in Rancagua, Chile following this weekend's club matches in North America and Europe.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2005, are age-eligible for the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Mitrović selected 11 players born in 2005, eight born in 2006 and two born in 2007. The youngest members of the USA's 2023 U-20 World Cup roster, defender Joshua Wynder and midfielder Niko Tsakiris return for a second edition of the tournament, while forwards Peyton Miller and Zavier Gozo are also age-eligible for the 2027 FIFA U-20 World Cup. 

The roster features players from 19 clubs, including 16 from 12 different Major League Soccer teams. San Diego FC leads the way with three selections, followed by two each from Colorado Rapids and Real Salt Lake. Five players are based abroad: two in Germany, and one player each in Italy, Portugal and Spain.

Additionally, Chris Applewhite (Nashville SC) and Edward Davis (Philadelphia Union) will join the team as training players for the week leading up to the tournament.

The USA qualified for the 2025 U-20 World Cup after a runner-up finish at the 2024 Concacaf U-20 Championship in Mexico. The USA rolled through the group stage with wins against Jamaica (9-0), Cuba (4-0) and Costa Rica (1-0), before a 1-0 quarterfinal victory against Guatemala and 2-1 semifinal win over Panama. Despite taking the lead, the USA fell 2-1 in extra time to hosts Mexico in the final. 

Twelve players from the Concacaf qualifying roster return for the World Cup: goalkeepers Adam Beaudry and Duran Ferree; defenders Luca Bombino, Noah Cobb, Ethan Kohler and Nolan Norris; midfielders Taha Habroune, Brooklyn Raines, Pedro Soma and Niko Tsakiris; and forwards Zavier Gozo and Marcos Zambrano.

The U-20 World Cup has been a proving ground for international stars around the globe and it's certainly served its purpose in developing big contributors for the USMNT at future senior World Cups. Since first participating at the 1981 FIFA World Youth Championship, 44 players that represented the USA at a U-20 World Cup went on to make a senior FIFA World Cup roster. 

Twelve of those 44 players also went on to earn 100 caps for the USMNT: Jeff Agoos, Jozy Altidore, Marcelo Balboa, DaMarcus Beasley, Carlos Bocanegra, Michael Bradley, Paul Caligiuri, Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Kasey Keller and Tony Meola. 

More recently, nine players with U-20 World Cup experience were part of the USA squad at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar: Kellyn Acosta, Tyler Adams, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Luca de la Torre, Sergiño Dest, Shaq Moore, Josh Sargent, Tim Weah and DeAndre Yedlin. 

The 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup will feature 24 countries divided into six groups of four teams. The top two finishers in each group, as well as the four best third-place teams advance to the Round of 16. From there, the tournament will feature a knockout bracket to the tournament final.

All three of the USA's group stage games will be played at Estadio El Teniente in Rancagua. The capital city of Santiago, as well as Talca and Valparaiso will also serve as hosts for the tournament. ","{'href': 'https://www.topdrawersoccer.com', 'title': 'Top Drawer Soccer'}","soccer"

NFL Themed Connections: Sports Edition 

Some big names delivered as the USMNT's Europe-based contingent featured in domestic action in their respective leagues over the weekend. Whether it was Christian Pulisic dominating or Malik Tillman progressing, here's how they fared.

Welcome to this week's USMNT player tracker.

Christian Pulisic is no stranger to breaking records.

Last season was a special one for Pulisic at Milan, as his 11 goals and nine assists in Serie A, following on from 12 goals and eight assists in 2023-24, established him as the only American in the last 20 years to record 20 goal contributions in multiple seasons in a top-five European league.

And on Saturday, after his double helped Milan to a 3-0 win away at Udinese, he ticked over another milestone.

That brace took Pulisic to 59 goals in those top five leagues (Pulisic has played in the Bundesliga, Premier League and Serie A), meaning he eclipsed Clint Dempsey, who held the previous record with 57.

The Italian media were quick to offer their plaudits. “Literally unstoppable. He's always the one scoring,” wrote La Gazzetta dello Sport. “Back in the starting XI, he netted the opener that unlocked the match and then completed his brace. A nightmare for Udinese's defence.”

2 & 1 – Christian Pulisic is the second #USMNT player to record 2 goals and an assist in a match in the top 5 European leagues over the last 20 years (Jordan Pefok for Rennes vs. Nîmes in 2018). Special. pic.twitter.com/WLBIQmvHTh

Corriere dello Sport were equally enamoured: “Back as a starter and an absolute protagonist of the match. Two goals, one assist, and the opponents were almost always forced to stop him with fouls. Captain America.”

After Pulisic started the previous two league games on the bench, it now seems clear that new Milan manager Max Allegri knows the American is a player upon whom he can always rely.

After a mixed start to his time at Bayer Leverkusen, Malik Tillman took a step forward on Sunday.

The midfielder scored the goal that looked like ensuring a win for Kasper Hjulmand's side, only for visitors Borussia Monchengladbach to equalise in added time. Tillman bent a 70th-minute shot into the net with the help of a deflection, and it was the breakthrough his bright performance deserved.

So he will be disappointed that Gladbach, featuring Joe Scally at right-back, grabbed a late point.

Tillman had endured a tough night last week in Leverkusen's 2-2 Champions League opener with Copenhagen, and was taken off five minutes after the break. But new Leverkusen manager Hjulmand is a fan of the 23-year-old and is willing to be patient.

“We have to remember that this is not only Malik, it's also players like Eli (Ben Seghir), other players like (Ernest) Poku, Claudio (Echeverri),” Hjulmand said in his press conference after that draw on Thursday.

“We have a lot of very, very (high) potential, good young players. They just came here; they are playing their first minutes. It takes some time to adapt, and it takes some time to get to know each other.

“That's one of the great things about this squad. There's so much potential, there's so much quality. But you cannot expect it just to be like that from the beginning. We have to nurse it, we have to train and see and give feedback.

“Malik is a great player. He will also adapt, and we will try to help him. I will try to help him as much as possible.“

The end of the Gladbach game saw three USMNT team-mates on the field, with late substitute Gio Reyna joining the action with Tillman and Scally.

Aside from reigning champions Liverpool, only one other team are yet to lose a game in the Premier League. And with their 2-1 win over West Ham on Saturday, Crystal Palace maintained their strong start to the campaign.

One of the big reasons behind the south London club's run, which actually stretches to 17 games in all competitions? Chris Richards. Their USMNT centre-back has picked up where he left off the last campaign to put himself in the bracket of the English top flight's best defenders.

The defender was superb against West Ham — whether it was the goal-line clearance from Lucas Paqueta, or nipping the ball from Callum Wilson as West Ham tried to break at pace.

After they saw out a nervy win, Palace manager Oliver Gasner joked that the players need to look after his heart. But with Richards in his ever-reliable back three, he can at least have faith nobody will breach the Eagles defence easily.

Oh, and next up? Liverpool at Selhurst Park…

Some wrote Brenden Aaronson off early this season. As Leeds United look to stay in the Premier League, the naysayers claimed manager Daniel Farke would need better quality in midfield.

Benched for the first three games, it looked like the 24-year-old may have to accept a less pivotal role than that enjoyed as his side stormed the Championship last term.

But he did not let that narrative get him down, and he has now started the last two games in a wide-midfield role. On Saturday, Aaronson played 90 minutes in that position and Leeds finally clicked, coming from behind to defeat Wolves 3-1.

Before the game, Farke had called for patience with a player who is still developing at the top level. “We know Brenden has challenges in his offensive game in terms of decision-making, being a bit clearer and more straightforward,” he told the Yorkshire Post. “This is something we speak a lot about.

“It's important not to put too much weight on his shoulders. Sometimes, the feeling with Brenden is that we are a bit over-critical in public. It's not like I press a button and do my magic and he's a completely different player. In training, we bring him more into positions where he has to make decisions.

“Sometimes, because he is so on it, he is perhaps losing a bit of his calmness. But it's not helpful if everyone is always criticising him.”

In Italy, Weston McKennie must have thought he'd done enough to win back his own starting place after starring in Juventus' recent win over Inter and the frenetic Champions League draw with Dortmund.

But he was back on the bench for Saturday's 1-1 draw at Hellas Verona, and coach Igor Tudor did not see fit to use him as a substitute, either.

See if Pulisic can help Milan progress in the Coppa Italia on Tuesday. Last term, they lost the final 1-0 to Bologna, and this time around, they face Lecce in the second round (12pm, Paramount +).

Tanner Tessmann was the star as Lyon beat Angers 1-0 last Friday in Ligue 1, scoring the game's only goal and shining in central midfield. Watch if he can maintain that fine form in the Europa League as his side take on Utrecht on Thursday (3pm, Paramount +)

Saturday sees two Americans go head-to-head in the Bundesliga, as Tillman's Leverkusen face James Sands' St Pauli (9:30am, ESPN+). The latter was booked as St Pauli lost their unbeaten start with a 2-0 reverse at Stuttgart on Friday, but has otherwise had a strong start to the season after recovering from injury.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Jude Bellingham: Xabi Alonso Reveals Change of Plan for Real Madrid's Returning Star","https://www.si.com/soccer/jude-bellingham-xabi-alonso-change-plan-real-madrid-returning-star","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso has clarified that Jude Bellingham's position in his team will be as an attacking midfielder.

The England international has occupied a range of roles across his first two seasons in the Spanish capital. The failure to adequately replace Karim Benzema forced the natural midfielder into an uncharacteristically advanced role which sparked the best scoring form of his career.

Following the acquisition of Kylian Mbappé in the summer of 2024, Carlo Ancelotti shifted Bellingham into a more withdrawn midfield position, prompting his goal tally to drop from 23 to 14 despite playing 600 more minutes across his second campaign.

Alonso, who hurriedly replaced Ancelotti ahead of the Club World Cup, spent the summer tournament openly experimenting with a range of formations. Bellingham started all six matches as Madrid made it to the semifinals while operating in a vast array of roles, shifting between one of the most attacking outlets to one of the more defensive. 

Shoulder surgery forced Bellingham to miss Madrid's first five fixtures of the new campaign before making his long-awaited return as a late substitute against Espanyol on Saturday.

Madrid have made a perfect start to the season under Alonso, collecting six wins from six, but the Spanish coach insisted that Bellingham would be warmly welcomed back into the first-team setup. Exactly where that would be on the pitch was also cleared up. 

“Jude's position is as an attacking midfielder,” Alonso told assembled media over the weekend. “He has an incredible range of movement, and the more we can find him, the better our performance. The Club World Cup was a different experience. With him and [Eduardo] Camavinga, we have two additional options, two top-class players.”

Recently departed Real Madrid cult hero Lucas Vázquez replied to Bellingham's post hailing his return with the simple line: “Star is back.” Who is overshadowed by this blinding beacon remains to be seen.

Aurélien Tchouaméni is the only midfielder to start all six games this season and has effectively locked down the central defensive role. Federico Valverde, Madrid's answer to Steven Gerrard in the eyes of Alonso, is never far from the teamsheet.

Arda Güler would be the most obvious figure to make way for Bellingham. The ever-improving Turkish playmaker has received warm praise from Alonso after bulking up over the summer to add some gusto to his innate grace.

New York Knicks forward Josh Hart isn't just a fan of basketball. He also follows European soccer very closely.

Hart was on a recent episode of ""Men In Blazers,"" where he revealed to the world that he is a fan of Chelsea FC.

""I've been like a die-hard, like really dedicated fan, and I've been supporting them since I was 16, 17. Before then, I think it was the 2010 World Cup, y'all know that U.S. Soccer is not the greatest, you know, it's getting there, but it's not the greatest,"" Hart said. 

""15 years ago, I actually found myself supporting England. I was supporting England, and my two favorite players on that squad was Frank Lampard and John Terry. Obviously, they were proper Chels. I kind of went over there and started supporting them, and it just kind of took off. So you know, London is blue, and y'all know what it is.""

""London is blue."" 🔵Josh Hart tells Rog about his Chelsea fandom, including shoutouts to Frank Lampard and John Terry.MiB Live in NY presented by @MLS and @Walmart ⚽️ pic.twitter.com/XE4aPZpgCi

Hart claimed he had 25-30 Chelsea shirts in his closet at one point, making him a true supporter of the club.

Hart also mentioned how the FIFA World Cup taking place in the United States can do a lot for the growth of the sport in the country.

""I think it's going to be an amazing experience for everyone here,"" Hart said. 

""But more importantly, the youth here that are playing soccer. Now they get to see these guys close, see the skills, see the passion, and that's going to continue to drive football here. I think it's something that's going to take it to another level.""

The Knicks are hoping they can be in the NBA Finals while the start of the FIFA World Cup takes place. The Knicks could play in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on June 4 while the world's biggest soccer tournament starts on June 11 in Mexico City and Zapopan, Mexico.

MetLife Stadium, which is located in nearby East Rutherford, N.J., will host one of the games on June 13, which is the first day any games will take place in the United States.

The Athletic has live updates of the 2025 Ballon d'Or ceremony.

Hello! Mikel Arteta's ‘finisher' saved the day for him. But who will rescue Pep Guardiola's philosophy?

On the way:

⛔ Anti-football at the Emirates?

😬 Emery's ‘lazy' Villa dig

👋 Madrid boycott Ballon d'Or

📐 Sneaky Bergvall corner routine

Gabriel Martinelli, the Arsenal winger, is a ‘finisher' in more than one way. He scores goals, in the traditional sense of the word, but the Brazilian is also living up to a second definition adopted by his club manager, Mikel Arteta.

‘Finishers' in Arteta's lexicon are those players who step off the bench and consummate a team performance for him. Martinelli did it in the Champions League last Tuesday, breaking down Athletic Club within seconds of coming on as a substitute and yesterday he did it again, reining in Manchester City with a late, late equaliser at the Emirates.

Changing a match with substitutions is not a new phenomenon. It has been the point of them forever and a day, and the two half-time changes made by Arteta when 1-0 down against City — Bukayo Saka for Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze for Mikel Merino — begged the question of whether he had simply got his starting line-up wrong. Arteta, fairly or otherwise, is never far away from accusations of over-caution.

But the concept of the ‘finisher' has been growing in sport generally. Eddie Jones, the world-renowned rugby coach, coined the term as he devised ways of effectively closing out a game by using the full depth of his squad. Our Stuart James wrote in 2022 about baseball pitcher Mariano Rivera using his brief forays into the field to see the New York Yankees over the line. Psychologically, the terminology helps make fringe squad members feel valued.

Martinelli rose to the task, dropping in a dead-eye lob with 93 minutes on the clock (above). It is another footnote in the Arsenal-City rivalry, and it spared Arteta a costly defeat. Although nobody was happier with that 1-1 draw in north London than Premier League leaders Liverpool.

Arteta's caution yesterday was nothing in comparison to counterpart Pep Guardiola's. City's football in this game goes down as the least Pep-like display any of us have seen (albeit one that nearly worked). They fed on 33 per cent possession and Guardiola's decision to replace Erling Haaland with Nico Gonzalez left them without a centre-forward from the 77th minute onwards.

The balance of the contest generated a headline this morning that I never expected to read: one about Guardiola and anti-football. Included in the wider article is a graphic (above) that shows how much City's defensive line is retreating, positioned an average of 26 metres out this season, compared to 35 metres out in 2024-25. It's almost as if one punishing year has bitten Guardiola badly.

Remember that day in 2023 when Arsenal turned up to play City at the Etihad and took a men-against-boys hiding? You'd call it a different lifetime. And if you think back to the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup final last season (not to mention the Club World Cup), it has to be said that Guardiola has lost the knack of winning key games. City were very close to victory yesterday — but already, in the title race, they're losing all margin for error.

On the substitutions front, Enzo Maresca's attempt to handle a crisis at Manchester United on Saturday was a veritable shambles. Chelsea lost goalkeeper Robert Sanchez to a red card only five minutes into the game after he halved Bryan Mbeumo outside the box (above). Three alterations followed in quick succession, including the withdrawal of Cole Palmer, to no avail.

Maresca has to watch his back constantly. A poor week in Europe and domestically will only fan the flames of scepticism about his long-term suitability for the Chelsea job. But if you're after a crisis, look no further than Aston Villa: three points from the first five league fixtures, a 1-1 draw with a promoted Sunderland team who had 10 players for almost an hour yesterday, and manager Unai Emery calling his team “lazy” afterwards. Something will have to give there soon.

The Ballon d'Or ceremony takes place in Paris this evening, an event described by Dermot Corrigan as “the most glamorous and important event in the football calendar”. It's the most egotistical, I'll give him that.

Vanity levels peaked with Vinicius Junior's no-show last year, and if the men's prize for 2025 is going to the Bernabeu (which, realistically, it won't) then nobody from Real Madrid will be there to collect it. The club are boycotting tonight's festivities, just as they did in 2024.

Dermot's exploration of Madrid's grievances strongly suggests they stem from the top and Florentino Perez himself. Perez, their all-powerful president, is spoken about as a man who thinks “Spain can be divided into those who love Real Madrid and those who hate them”. It's apparent that he's taken to thinking the Ballon d'Or voters are conspiring against them.

Madrid haven't publicly acknowledged any of their nominations. Their in-house media channels aren't touching on the Ballon d'Or at all. You'd be mistaken for thinking the ceremony isn't happening — which, if we're reading the room correctly, is precisely how Perez and Madrid want it.

Set-piece routines are becoming an arms race and here, above, was Tottenham Hotspur's Lucas Bergvall taking things to extremes during Saturday's 2-2 draw away to Brighton… by sneaking to the near post via a run behind the goal in anticipation of a corner.

Sadly for him, it's against the rules to leave and re-enter the pitch without the referee's permission and match official Chris Kavanagh was having none of it. Nice try, though.

...

After a disastrous start, Italy's qualifying campaign for the 2026 FIFA World Cup finally kicked into gear during the international break, with Gennaro Gattuso managing to stamp his authority over his newly inherited side.

Things couldn't have got off to a worse possible beginning, though, when the Italians were thumped 3-0 by Norway in Oslo, a result that cost former manager Luciano Spalletti his job. But now, business has finally picked up.

In his first game in charge, Gattuso managed to mastermind a 5-0 drubbing of Estonia, with the Azzurri shedding their low-scoring skin at halftime to net five unanswered second-half goals. Then, Italy continued in their newfound high-scoring ways, winning a 5-4 thriller against Israel thanks to Sandro Tonali's last-gasp goal. Now, the four-time world champions are back in contention, and the excitement of an epic comeback is beginning to build in Bel Paese.

But it isn't just in Southern Europe where anticipation ahead of next summer's North American spectacle is reaching a fever pitch. On the other side of the planet, Australians are also raring to go. Not only have the Socceroos already punched their tickets to the FIFA World Cup after finishing as runners-up to Japan in their qualifying group, but now their esteemed online casinos are rolling out some epic football-themed slot games in a bid to get Aussies in the mood for next June and July.

Inspired by the planet's biggest sporting event, the popular IgnitionCasino Australia has developed a range of games that have resonated strongly with its dedicated user base. Titles such as “Hat Trick Hero” have become particularly popular among both fans and slot enthusiasts alike, with the accessibility of these games drawing significant praise: They can be enjoyed at any time on a smart device with a stable internet connection.

But, while IgnitionCasino's digital experiences are capturing the attention of the virtual sports world, real-world drama is unfolding on the pitch. For Italy, their bid to end a 12-year World Cup qualifying drought is alive and well, but how did their last two ultimately unsuccessful qualifying campaigns begin in comparison to this year's? Let's find out.

This year, Italy is playing catch-up. Eight years ago, in qualifying for Russia 2018, that wasn't the case. Gian Piero Ventura made the perfect start to that campaign, with the goals of Ciro Immobile powering the Azzurri to victory on the road against Israel in their opener.

Italy would back that up with a draw against heavyweights Spain in Turin, thanks to a late equalizer from Daniele De Rossi, and further positive results would follow. Immobile struck a 92nd-minute winner on the road against North Macedonia, as well as goals in the victories against Liechtenstein (twice) and Albania. However, in the return game against Spain, the wheels came off the qualifying campaign.

La Roja ran out 3-0 victors when they welcomed Italy to the Bernabeu, putting them in pole position. Italy then dropped further points in their home game against North Macedonia, officially consigning them to the playoffs. We all remember how that ended, with Sweden triumphing across two legs and ensuring that the Italians missed the World Cup for the first time since 1958.

Despite missing the 2018 World Cup, Roberto Mancini managed to shockingly lead Italy to European Championship glory in the summer of 2021, with his side famously beating hosts England at Wembley on penalties. As such, they headed into the qualifying campaign for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar with a chip on their shoulder. However, a series of draws early on would hinder their hopes of direct qualification.

Italy beat Northern Ireland in their opener in Parma, with Immobile on song once more. Back-to-back 2-0 away victories at Bulgaria and Lithuania then put the Azzurri in pole position. But following those triumphs, back-to-back slip-ups cost Mancini's men dearly. His side was held to a 1-1 draw at home to Bulgaria in Florence, before a goalless draw against Switzerland opened the door for the hosts to seize top spot.

Another draw between those two sides, this time a 1-1 finish in Rome, meant that qualification would be decided in the final qualifier. Italy headed to Northern Ireland knowing that a win would be enough. Instead, they drew 0-0, meaning that Switzerland's 4-0 victory at home to Bulgaria was enough to secure their spot in Qatar.

For the second straight qualifying campaign, Italy would head to the playoffs. This time, they were stunned by North Macedonia, with Aleksandar Trajkovski's last-minute winner allowing them to progress and ensuring the Azzurri's wait to feature on the grandest stage that the beautiful game has to offer would extend beyond a decade.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

by Francisco Quatrin September 22, 2025

A rule change that could redefine the history of soccer is reportedly under discussion at FIFA. In an effort to modernize the game—similar to the introduction of VAR at the 2018 World Cup in Russia—soccer's governing body is said to be considering altering one of the sport's most dramatic moments: the penalty kick.

Former Spanish referee Eduardo Iturralde revealed on Cadena Ser's Carrusel Deportivo that FIFA's head of referees, Pierluigi Collina, is pushing an idea that would radically change the way penalties are executed.

Under the proposal, if the goalkeeper saves a penalty—whether by catching the ball or parrying it—the play would end immediately. The attacking player would no longer be able to follow up on a rebound. Instead, the defending team would restart play with a goal kick.

What remains unclear is what would happen if the ball rebounds off the post or crossbar without the goalkeeper touching it. That detail, according to reports, would need to be clarified if the rule change moves forward.

Should the proposal gain approval, it would not take effect until after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada from June 11 to July 19. This means that the historic tournament in North America will be the last World Cup played under the current penalty regulations.

It's important to note that FIFA does not unilaterally control the rules of the game. That responsibility lies with the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the only body authorized to create, amend, or abolish the Laws of the Game.

The IFAB is made up of eight members: four from FIFA and one each from the four British football associations (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland). Because soccer originated in the UK, these associations retain equal voting power.

For any rule change to pass, at least six votes are required. FIFA's four votes give it the effective power of veto: if all four FIFA representatives oppose a proposal, it cannot move forward, even if the British associations vote in favor.

Arsenal and Manchester City played out a dramatic 1-1 draw on Sunday, with the two Premier League rivals unable to be separated through 98 or so minutes. Erling Haaland had given the visitors an early lead, before Pep Guardiola remarkably decided to park the bus to try and sneak the win. Those efforts went up in smoke in added time as Gabriel Martinelli scored to clinch a point for the Gunners.

Having both slipped up domestically already this season, this wasn't quite a 'must win' affair for either side, but definitely more of a 'must not lose'. In the end, perhaps a draw in which neither team showed much attacking endeavour will please both parties.

City seemed content to sit in and create chances on the break, while Arsenal didn't exactly throw the kitchen sink at their visitors in order to force the leveller. It was a pretty just outcome and neither can really have any complaints about how it ended.

Taylor Fritz backed up his upset of Carlos Alcaraz on Saturday with a 6-3, 7-6(4) win against Alexander Zverev on Sunday to clinch the Laver Cup for Team World.

The California native's two wins against Top 3 players in the PIF ATP Rankings accounted for five points in a 15-9 victory in San Francisco, Team World's third Laver Cup triumph in four years.

""We're going to have a fun night,"" Fritz said before the trophy ceremony. ""Definitely popping some champagne in the locker room in a few minutes.""

Fritz picked up where he left off on the event's famous black court, dictating early in the points with aggressive rally balls that pierced through the slow conditions. Controlling the court by hugging the baseline, the American applied constant pressure to Zverev until he was broken for the first time at 4-3 in the second set.

Zverev, who appeared limited physically at the start, was suddenly in full flow as he made a final push. But Fritz raised his own game to meet the challenge in a dramatic closing stretch, with both players finding their best tennis as the pressure peaked.

The victory delivered new Team World captain Andre Agassi the Laver Cup in his debut on the sideline, with the American legend's joyful presence lifting his team throughout the competition.

""Just seeing these guys on the bench getting pumped up, seeing a legend of the sport like Andre jumping out of his seat cheering for me, it's impossible not to be so fired up and just give it everything you have,"" added Fritz, who won 23 of 26 net points and closed the match with a backhand volley winner.



Earlier, Alcaraz redeemed himself for his loss to the American with a pair of clutch wins that were ultimately not enough to spark a European comeback. After beginning the day with a doubles victory, the Spanish superstar delivered once again in a must-win matchup against Francisco Cerundolo to keep his team alive.

Emerging with a blue nasal strip, the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings breathed new life into Team Europe by dominating from the first ball with power and creativity. In a 6-2, 6-1 triumph, Alcaraz won the first five games of both sets in a stress-free outing that belied the stakes. Cerundolo suffered his first Laver Cup loss, falling to 3-1 in the competition.

The victory cut Team World's lead to 12-9 in the first-to-13 event, with each Sunday match worth three points.

Alex de Minaur moved Team World within one match win of Laver Cup glory by beating Jakub Mensik 6-3, 6-4. The Aussie escaped 0/40 in the match's final game to give his team a 12-6 lead.

""I'm so used to fighting off break points on my serve. I do that for a living,"" said a jovial De Minaur, who saved all five break points against him. ""I'm not a bot like some of the players in Team World.""

De Minaur earned seven points for Team World this weekend, beating Zverev and teaming with Alex Michelsen for a doubles win on Saturday, when wins counted for two points.

""It's a great team event. I do my best every time I step on the court and I'm glad I was able to get a couple of wins for Team World this weekend,"" he said.

In Sunday's opener, Alcaraz and Casper Ruud changed the complexion of the event with a much-needed doubles win for Team Europe. After Team World swept Saturday's play without dropping a set to lead 9-3, Alcaraz and Ruud cut the deficit to 9-6.

The Europeans earned a 7-6(4), 6-1 win against Michelsen and Reilly Opelka, battling back from 1/4 in the first-set tie-break to take control. Alcaraz and Ruud did not face a break point in the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats, but they needed 11 break points before finally breaking their opponents early in set two.

""We stayed really strong, really solid. We did what we had to do and I think that it worked pretty well,"" Alcaraz said of their patience.

Two points defined the match. At 1/4 in the tie-break, Team World thought they came out on top in a thrilling exchange only to find that Michelsen's reflex volley sailed just beyond the baseline. That started a run of six straight points to seal the set, followed by a run of five consecutive games in set two.

Midway through the second set, Alcaraz hit the shot of the match: a preposterous drop volley that left Michelsen stranded despite the American standing well inside the service line.

""Sometimes a lot of ideas come to my mind,"" Alcaraz said of his shotmaking abilities. ""I just enjoy making the choices. I think in that position it was the only shot or the best shot I could choose in that moment.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","With Rafa watching, Rincon completes full-circle triumph at Nadal Academy","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rincon-challenger-2025-feature","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:20:22 GMT","

Daniel Rincon glanced up from the baseline and suddenly froze. Leading 2-0 in his second-round match at the ATP Challenger Tour event held at Rafa Nadal Academy by Movistar, the Spaniard spotted Rafael Nadal himself watching from the stands.


“I saw him looking and I lost six games in a row,” Rincon said with a laugh, speaking with ATPTour.com. “I got a bit tight there.”


The nerves did not derail Rincon for long. The 22-year-old regrouped, won the match and went on to capture the trophy at the very place where he trained and graduated from in 2021.


While competing in the final, Rincon again spotted the former World No. 1 Nadal watching, although the match was almost halfway over, so Rincon “didn't have too much time to think about it”.


Rincon's triumph at his stomping grounds — with friends, family and other supporters (like Rafa!) in attendance — completed a full-circle moment for him.


“It was the best week of my life, by far. I really cannot compare it to anything else,” said the No. 209 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I thought about how it could be before the final, or the feelings of winning there, but it was even more than I imagined. It was unbelievable.”

Both of Rincon's Challenger triumphs have featured memorable moments. When he won his first Challenger title last year in Tampere, Finland, his luggage was lost. He battled through the opening rounds with only three racquets, borrowed strings and grips.

“I was going with a little bag on court, I was looking like an amateur player going to practise on a Sunday,” Rincon said at the time. “Just with three t-shirts and going to do laundry every day.”

In Manacor, the 22-year-old rallied from 2-5 in the third set of his first two matches and also needed a decider in his quarter-final and semi-final matches.

Nadal's presence added to the storybook week, even though Rincon did not have the chance to speak with the 92-time tour-level titlist during the tournament.

“In the second round, I knew he was coming,” Rincon said. “I have some people who are close to him and they knew he had to come do some media things and he was going to stay a little bit for the match, so I was trying not to look, but at the same time looking like, ‘When is he going to come?' So the first day, I was basically looking for him.”

Rincon's connection to the Rafa Nadal Academy runs deep. He first arrived at the state-of-the-art facility as a 16-year-old in September 2019. The Manacor Challenger final was being played on his first day, so it is fitting he would one day claim a special victory at the same event.
Rincon reflected on his journey: ""Now that I actually played the final, who would have thought when I was just 16 and working with my two suitcases that I would play there?""

Carlos Alcaraz will face Sebastian Baez on his debut at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, following the draw on Monday.

The Spaniard is competing at the ATP 500 hard-court event for the first time and is seeded to meet eighth seed Frances Tiafoe in the quarter-finals and Norway's Casper Ruud in the semi-finals.

Alcaraz, who will take a 2-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead into his meeting with Baez, returned to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings earlier this month when he defeated Jannik Sinner in the US Open final to clinch his sixth major.

Ruud, a titlist in Madrid this year, faces Japanese wild card Shintaro Mochizuki in the first round, while Tiafoe plays a qualifier. The American Tiafoe reached the final in Tokyo in 2022. Also in the top half, seventh seed Denis Shapovalov, a two-time Tokyo semi-finalist, opens against German Daniel Altmaier. The Canadian is competing for the first time since his marriage to Mirjam Bjorklund earlier this month.



Second seed Taylor Fritz won the trophy in Japan in 2022. The American plays Canadian Gabriel Diallo in the first round and could meet fifth seed Tomas Machac in the quarter-finals. The Czech Machac begins against a qualifier.

Third seed Holger Rune, a potential semi-final opponent for Fritz, meets former Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic in the first round. Rune could play Alex Michelsen in the second round and sixth seed Ugo Humbert in the quarter-finals. Last year's finalist Humbert begins against Jenson Brooksby.

The ATP 500 event will be held from 24 to 30 September.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Agassi on Laver Cup learnings... Delusion & less talking","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/agassi-laver-cup-2025-reaction-sunday","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 09:33:45 GMT","

Andre Agassi has enjoyed his fair share of highs on a tennis court. The American reached No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings and won 60 tour-level titles, including eight majors.

Almost 20 years after his retirement, Agassi wrote another chapter into his tennis playbook when on Sunday as captain, he led Team World to victory against Team Europe at the Laver Cup in San Francisco. It is a weekend that will live long in his memory.

“Everybody played a part in making this one of the most memorable weeks I've ever spent on a tennis court,” Agassi said on Sunday night. “And that's saying something, because it was a lot of years I've been out there in one form or another with a perceived team, but this really was a team. So proud of the guys. Just unflappable. They never stopped believing.”



From the sidelines, Agassi, alongside vice captain Patrick Rafter, helped Taylor Fritz, Joao Fonseca, Alex de Minaur and Francisco Cerundolo earn singles victories, with De Minaur and Michelsen also triumphing in a doubles rubber during the three-day event. Even with his decades of experience, Agassi found himself learning from the group he was leading.

“I think the common theme that I took away from this group is just how confident they are in what they can do on a tennis court. It's not delusional. I mean, it can be delusional… But it was amazing to watch their calm in the midst of storms,” Agassi said. “What I learned is kind of what I continue to learn, which is try to do more listening than talking and try to stay out of their way.”

Fritz was the star man for Team World in San Francisco. He earned his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win against Carlos Alcaraz on Saturday and then backed that up by overcoming Alexander Zverev on Sunday, securing the decisive points for Team World.
“It was going to be tough to come back and play like I played on [Saturday]. Funny thing, I was leaving the hotel. I saw Roddick, who I haven't really spoken to too much in the past, and he said, ‘Don't worry, you'll play better today', joking about how well I played against Carlos,"" Fritz said.
“We had to pick the line-up for today and we sat down as a team and I was the one that wanted to put myself in the slot that I put myself. So, when it came down to it, I just had to perform. It's a matchup that I obviously feel somewhat comfortable in. No matter what, I was just going to compete as hard as I could for the team and do everything I could do.”
The hosts earned a 15-9 victory in San Francisco but after eight editions, Team Europe holds a 5-3 lead against Team World. The event returns to the O2 in London next year and will be held from 25-27 September.

Amanda Anisimova, Mirra Andreeva and Jessica Pegula will headline the WTA 500 Ningbo Open, held from Oct. 13 through Oct. 19. The same week, Naomi Osaka and Elise Mertens will lead the Japan Open field.

Five Top 10 players will be in Ningbo, China for the 2025 Aux · Ningbo Open, which kicks off on Oct. 13 and runs through Oct. 19.

US Open finalist Amanda Anisimova leads the WTA 500's 28-player singles field, and she'll be joined by Mirra Andreeva, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, China's Qinwen Zheng and Elena Rybakina.

Other notable names in the draw include Elina Svitolina, Karolina Muchova, Emma Navarro and Paula Badosa.

Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova.

The draw for the China Open, the ninth WTA 1000 event of 2025, is out. Iga Swiatek, fresh off her third title of the year in Seoul, is the No. 1 seed, while defending champion Coco Gauff is No. 2. Another key storyline will be the return to action of hometown hero Zheng Qinwen, playing her first tournament since undergoing right elbow surgery in July.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Zheng, the No. 7 seed, has not competed since her first-round exit at Wimbledon to Katerina Siniakova. She will open against either Suzan Lamens, a quarterfinalist last week in Seoul, or compatriot Wang Yafan. Her section of the draw doesn't get any easier from there: the 22-year-old is projected to face No. 26 seed Linda Noskova in the third round. Potential fourth-round opponents include No. 10 seed Clara Tauson, Montreal champion and No. 21 seed Victoria Mboko and Siniakova.

The 32 seeded players all have first-round byes. Swiatek will start against either Yulia Putintseva or wild card Yuan Yue, while Gauff will face either Kamilla Rakhimova or Lucia Bronzetti.

Two former major champions are unseeded threats in the draw as they also make their way back from injury layoffs. Barbora Krejcikova takes on Anna Blinkova in her opener, with the winner to play Seoul finalist and No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova. Meanwhile, Bianca Andreescu returns to action for the first time since injuring her ankle in Montreal a month ago. The Canadian faces Magda Linette, with No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova awaiting the winner.

Australian Open champion Madison Keys joined US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka on the sidelines, withdrawing from the tournament on Monday due to injury.

Projected fourth-round matchups

[1] Iga Swiatek vs. [16] Emma Navarro[12] Naomi Osaka vs. [5] Jessica Pegula[4] Mirra Andreeva vs. [14] Daria Kasatkina[10] Clara Tauson vs. [7] Zheng Qinwen[6] Jasmine Paolini vs. [11] Elina Svitolina[13] Karolina Muchova vs. [3] Amanda Anisimova[8] Elena Rybakina vs. [9] Ekaterina Alexandrova[15] Belinda Bencic vs. [2] Coco Gauff

Here's how the draw breaks down by quarter:

First quarter

Swiatek is projected to face No. 28 seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round, No. 16 seed Emma Navarro in the fourth round and No. 5 seed Jessica Pegula in the quarterfinals. The Pole is one of three former champions in the draw, and is bidding to reclaim the title she previously won in 2023. The player she defeated in that year's final, No. 19 seed Liudmila Samsonova, is another potential last-16 opponent.

Pegula's section is one of the most intriguing in the draw. She is projected to meet No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu, who will be making her tournament debut, in the third round; she currently owns a 2-1 head-to-head lead over the Briton, including 2-0 on hard courts. Whoever emerges from that tussle could face either 2019 champion Naomi Osaka, the No. 12 seed, or No. 23 seed Marta Kostyuk in the last 16. Osaka has been resurgent over the past two months, reaching the Montreal final and US Open semifinals to rocket back into the Top 20.

First-round matches to watch: Ann Li vs. Camila Osorio, Rebecca Sramkova vs. Elena-Gabriela Ruse

Second quarter

After winning back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, Mirra Andreeva solidified her Top 5 status by compiling a 31-8 record this year through Roland Garros. Since then, the 18-year-old's results have been quieter: she's 7-5 since Roland Garros, and just 2-2 since Wimbledon. The No. 4 seed in Beijing, where she was a quarterfinalist last year, Andreeva will open against either wild card Zhu Lin or a qualifier. She'll have to navigate a section that includes big-hitting No. 29 seed Dayana Yastremska in a potential third round.

In the last 16, Andreeva could face either No. 14 seed Daria Kasatkina or her regular doubles partner, No. 17 seed Diana Shnaider -- two more players in need of a deep run at the close of the season, given their respective season records of 19-21 and 24-21. Shnaider could face a tricky opener against fast-rising 19-year-old Maya Joint, who made her first career WTA 500 semifinal last week in Seoul. The Australian teenager opens against a qualifier.

Zheng has a mixed record against the young talents in her section. She's 2-0 against Noskova, but has yet to defeat Tauson in two meetings -- once in juniors and once in pros. Meanwhile, Mboko joins Raducanu as a player who is making her debut in Beijing as a seed. This time last year, the 19-year-old Canadian was ranked No. 356; now, she's a WTA 1000 champion on the verge of the Top 20. Mboko will bid to notch her first win since lifting the Montreal trophy against either Siniakova or Anastasia Potapova.

First-round matches to watch: Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. Jaqueline Cristian, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [WC] Wei Sijia, Katerina Siniakova vs. Anastasia Potapova, Suzan Lamens vs. [SR] Wang Yafan

Third quarter

Fresh off leading Italy to a successful defense of their Billie Jean King Cup title last week, No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini enters Beijing on a high. She could face a tricky opponent off the bat, though -- 2018 runner-up Anastasija Sevastova, whom she barely escaped in three sets at Wimbledon. Sevastova's ranking is still down at No. 221, but since returning from an ACL injury in April the Latvian has already scored wins over Pegula and Jelena Ostapenko. She'll need to defeat Kimberly Birrell in the first round to set up a rematch against Paolini.

Paolini's route doesn't get any easier after that. She's projected to face No. 27 seed Sofia Kenin -- against whom she has yet to win a set in three meetings -- in the third round. Kenin is searching for some form -- the 2020 Australian Open champion hasn't won back-to-back main-draw matches since Roland Garros -- but throughout her career has a track record of hitting her hot streaks with little warning.

In the last 16, Paolini could resume her rivalry with No. 11 Elina Svitolina -- a matchup that has provided some thrilling contests this year. Svitolina got the better of Paolini twice on the Grand Slam stage in three-setters at the Australian Open and Roland Garros, but Paolini managed to notch her first win in the series last week at the Billie Jean King Cup. To get there, Svitolina will have to navigate a section that contains Andreescu, Veronika Kudermetova and Tatjana Maria.

The third quarter is led by No. 3 seed Amanda Anisimova, competing for the first time since reaching her second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open. The American will play her first match as a Top 5 player against either Hailey Baptiste or Katie Boulter, and is projected to face home favorite and No. 31 seed Wang Xinyu in the third round.

A potential fourth-round meeting between Anisimova and No. 13 seed Karolina Muchova, last year's runner-up, could make for a fascinating stylistic clash. The pair have only played once previously, with Anisimova advancing via retirement at Roland Garros 2022.

First-round matches to watch: Magda Linette vs. [SR] Bianca Andreescu, Tatjana Maria vs. Marie Bouzkova, Katie Boulter vs. Hailey Baptiste

Fourth quarter

Gauff's up-and-down form in 2025 has seen the American at her gritty best during the clay swing, which culminated in her second major title at Roland Garros -- but also fail to reach a final on any other surface, with her service yips returning to afflict her during the North American hard court swing. She's projected to face No. 25 seed Leylah Fernandez, whom she has a 2-0 head-to-head lead over, in the third round. In the last 16, Gauff could then meet either No. 15 seed Belinda Bencic or No. 22 seed Jelena Ostapenko, both of whom have also struggled for form in recent months after standout results earlier in 2025. Since reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, Bencic's record is just 2-3, while Ostapenko has won just three out of nine matches since Roland Garros.

No. 8 seed Elena Rybakina has landed in a section full of dangerous opponents. The big-serving Kazakhstani will have to be prepared to take on a barrage of variety in her opener against either Wimbledon quarterfinalist Laura Siegemund or Caty McNally, two players with net-rushing instincts and every shot in the book. Rybakina is 6-1 overall against Siegemund, but was forced to retire in her only previous meeting with McNally.

In the third round, Rybakina is projected to face Iva Jovic, the 17-year-old who was ranked outside the Top 100 in June but who has surged into the No. 32 seed spot here after capturing her first WTA title in Guadalajara two weeks ago. Despite Jovic's inexperience -- Beijing will be just her 11th tour-level event -- this is already a familiar matchup for her; Rybakina defeated her in straight sets at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros this year.

Two-time major champion Krejcikova's return from a back injury this year has been riveting to watch -- not least due to the number of unlikely comebacks the Czech has pulled off. Since June, she's won from match points down on four separate occasions, the latest of those being an escape from 6-4, 5-2 down against Raducanu last week in Seoul. If Krejcikova's second-round clash against Alexandrova happens, it could be one to circle; with a 41-20 record so far, Alexandrova is quietly putting together a career-best season, and the 30-year-old could be eyeing a Top 10 debut in the closing two months. Alexandrova has a 3-2 head-to-head advantage over Krejcikova, though they have not played since 2021.

Whoever emerges from that match could have to face either No. 20 seed Elise Mertens or McCartney Kessler -- both two-time titlists this year -- in order to reach a potential last-16 meeting with Rybakina.

First-round matches to watch: Laura Siegemund vs. Caty McNally, Barbora Krejcikova vs. Anna Blinkova, Ashlyn Krueger vs. Maria Sakkari

Italy secured a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup final by defeating Ukraine 2-1, with Jasmine Paolini leading the charge. Paolini rallied to win her singles match and teamed up with Sara Errani for the decisive doubles victory. In the other semifinal, the United States will face Great Britain, who are aiming for their first title.

Italy advanced to the Billie Jean King Cup final for the third consecutive year after its doubles pair secured a decisive victory to defeat first-time semifinalist Ukraine 2-1 on Friday.

Jasmine Paolini played a starring role for the Italians, rallying to win her singles match before teaming with Sara Errani to clinch the doubles point.

Kostyuk gives Ukraine the early lead

World No. 26 Marta Kostyuk gave Ukraine a strong start, defeating Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-2, 6-3. The 23-year-old Ukrainian did not face a single break point and converted four of eight chances on Cocciaretto's serve. The win improved Kostyuk's record to 3-0 against the Italian and to 10-3 overall in singles at the Billie Jean King Cup.

Paolini rallies to even the score

World No. 8 Paolini responded in the second singles match, coming from a set and a break down to beat No. 13 Elina Svitolina 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Svitolina, who led their head-to-head 2-0, appeared headed for another victory after building a 6-3, 4-2 lead. But Paolini stormed back, earning her sixth win in her last seven Billie Jean King Cup matches to level the tie at 1-1. Svitolina, seeking a record-extending 19th victory for Ukraine in the competition, was left disappointed as her team's dream of reaching its first final was put on hold.

Paolini returns with Errani to seal the final berth

Italy turned to its experienced doubles duo, Paolini and Sara Errani, to finish the job. They faced Kostyuk and Lyudmyla Kichenok, breaking early for a 3-0 lead before closing out the first set 6-2.

Although the Ukrainians jumped ahead 3-1 in the second set, the Italians reeled off five straight games to complete a 6-2, 6-2 victory and book their spot in Sunday's final. The win underlined Paolini's histrionics in the competition for the second year running. The 29-year-old had come also come from behind in her singles match against Wang Xinyu earlier in the week to help the Italians move into the last four.

In the other semifinal on Saturday, 18-time champion United States will meet Great Britain, which is seeking its first Billie Jean King Cup title.

The Americans advanced with a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan, clinched by Jessica Pegula and Taylor Townsend in doubles. Britain moved through after Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter won singles matches in straight sets against Japan.

SAN FRANCISCO—When it comes to team events in men's tennis, the sport's preeminent rivals have long been the United States and Australia.

But in the case of the 2025 Laver Cup, the two tennis superpowers joined forces to bring Team World its third victory in the last four years.

Playing nearly as well as he did last night when he beat Carlos Alcaraz, Fritz broke Zverev in the German's opening service game and, save for a hiccup when he served at 4-3 in the second set, was quite dominant, winning 79 percent of his first serve points and 70 percent on his second. Even then, a spirited comeback from Zverev made matters much tougher in the late stages of the second set. In the end, though, Fritz rapidly took charge of the second set tiebreaker, a beautiful backhand topspin lob winner taking him to a 3-0 lead. Fritz closed it out on Team World's first championship point with a deft backhand volley winner.

Fritz's victory upped his head-to-head record versus Zverev to 9-5, including the last six in a row. It also helped turn around what had been a frustrating September for the 27-year-old American. On September 2, Fritz lost in the quarterfinals of the US Open after having reached the finals there a year ago. Just over a week later, with a chance to clinch a Davis Cup tie for the U.S. versus Czechia, Fritz was beaten by Jiri Lehecka in a tight three-setter. But here in San Francisco, Fritz earned two victories that thoroughly revealed how impressively he can compete.","{'href': 'https://www.tennis.com', 'title': 'Tennis.com'}","tennis"

At 19 years old, Joao Fonseca scored a crucial victory in his Laver Cup debut, defeating Flavio Cobolli in straight sets to prevent a Team Europe blowout on Day 1. Fritz took that momentum into Days 2 and 3, scoring back-to-back victories over Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev to help lead Team World to its third Laver Cup victory.“Just the energy from the team, it feels…the moments of winning feel so much better and the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,” Fritz explained on court. “So, it fires me up so much. I've always felt like I play my best tennis in these team environments.”

The win is also Team World's first since former world No. 1 Andre Agassi stepped into the role as Captain, taking over for John McEnroe after the Hall of Famer ended a seven-year tenure in 2024.“Seeing these guys on the bench, getting pumped up, seeing a legend of the sport like Andre jumping out of his seat, cheering for me,” Fritz said. “It's impossible not to be so fired up and just give it everything you have every point.”Suffice to say Team World—Fonseca included—will have plenty to celebrate after pulling off a significant upset this weekend.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Max Verstappen was never headed on Sunday in Baku to claim his fourth win of the 2025 campaign.

Max Verstappen admits his lights-to-flag victory in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was ""fantastic"" having comfortably controlled Sunday's race to take back-to-back Formula 1 wins.

The Red Bull driver was never headed over 51-laps on the streets of Baku, having held the lead from pole and, after an early Safety Car restart, slowly pulled away from Carlos Sainz and then George Russell, the pair completing the podium.

""I think this weekend has been incredible for us,"" said Verstappen after his fourth win of the 2025 campaign.

""Of course, last [F1] weekend was already great, but for us to win here again is just fantastic. I think also in the race, the car was working really well on both of the compounds [of tyre]. We had clean air all of the time and then you could look after your tyres and it was pretty straightforward.

“Of course, it's not easy around here. It was very windy today, so the car was always moving around a lot, but of course, I'm incredibly happy with this performance.”

With Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri crashing out on the opening lap and title rival Lando Norris only seventh, Verstappen has closed the gap to the top of the table down to just 69 points with seven races remaining.

But the Dutchman was cautious about his title chances despite McLaren enduring its worse weekend of the season and missing out on the Constructors' Championship in Baku.

“It's difficult to say at the moment, but for sure, the last two race weekends have been amazing for us,"" said Verstappen on mounting a title challenge.

""Singapore is a completely different challenge again with the high downforce, but we will see what we can do there.”

It was a strong day for Red Bull, with Yuki Tsunoda claiming his best result for the team in sixth having applied late pressure to Racing Bulls driver Liam Lawson in the closing stages.

""Happy with it, especially the pace I showed today is a lot different to other race weekends,"" said Tsunoda.

""I think I got supported a lot from the team to change massively like this internally and also the efforts I put in over the weeks, definitely shows some improvement there.

""Everything matches well and to be able to secure this result, which definitely is a positive. Some bits I can improve for sure and sharpen up more quality but was a good race.""

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Carlos Sainz scored his first podium for Williams by finishing third at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Carlos Sainz struggled to describe ""how good this feels"" after clinching a stunning first podium with Williams at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Sainz has endured a tough season with the Grove-based outfit since joining from Ferrari, and arrived in Baku on a run of six Sunday's without registering a point.

However, the Spaniard emphatically turned his form and luck around, setting the second-fastest time in a chaotic Qualifying session, before maintaining his position in the top three for the 51-lap duration, with only Mercedes' George Russell able to make his way past into second.

“Honestly, I cannot describe how happy I am or how good this feels,” said Sainz after the race. “It tastes even better than the first-ever podium that I did.

“We've been fighting hard all year and, finally today, we just proved that when we have the speed. We've had it all year, and when everything comes together, we can do some amazing things together.

“We nailed the race – not one mistake, and we managed to beat a lot of cars that, yesterday, I wasn't expecting to beat.”

Despite his recent scoreless streak, Sainz has consistently shown the pace of the Williams, with various factors resulting in his inability to score – including technical issues and on-track collisions.

Asked about his pride at the ability shown by both himself and the team to convert a strong grid position into a podium, Sainz added: “I'm extremely proud of everyone at Williams for pushing through a very difficult year.

“We've proven to everyone the massive step that we took compared to last year. We are on the rise, we are heading in the right direction.

“Unfortunately, with me, we've had a lot of bad luck, a lot of incidents, and it was very difficult to convert all of that pace into results. But now I understand why it all happened, because the first podium needed to come like this, and it's just life. Life sometimes brings you those bad moments to give you a very nice one, and this tastes much better than anything I was expecting.

“A life lesson – to keep believing, to keep trusting the team around you, your procedures and everything around you, because sooner or later, it always pays off.”

We've been fighting hard all year and finally today, we just proved that when we have the speed — we've had it all year — and everything comes together, we can do some amazing things together. And yeah, today we nailed the race. Not one mistake, and we managed to beat a lot of cars that yesterday I wasn't expecting to beat.

Q: We talked a little bit earlier in the week about how you've had pace at a lot of the races in the last few — it's just been a failure to convert for a various amount of reasons. How proud are you of yourself on track, and the team, of course, for their ability to convert from a strategy standpoint today?

CS: Yeah. I'm extremely proud of everyone at Williams for pushing through our very difficult year. I think we've proven to everyone the massive step that we took compared to last year. We are on the rise; we are in the right direction. Unfortunately, with me, we've had a lot of bad luck, a lot of incidents — very difficult to convert all that pace into results. But now I understand why it all happened, because the first podium needed to come like this. It's just life, you know? Life just sometimes brings you those bad moments to give you a very nice one, and this stays much better than any other thing that I was expecting. So, just a life lesson, to keep believing, keep trusting yourself, your team around you, your procedures, everything that you're doing — because sooner or later, it always pays off.

Q: Cool. We'll go and join with your team. Congratulations.

CS: Thank you very much.

Q: P2 for George Russell today. You said before the race that a podium was a possibility, and you had incredible pace on those Hard tyres. We even heard you pre-empt a message from the pit wall to extend that stint. Was that the key today to get ahead of Carlos?

George RUSSELL: Yeah. I mean, firstly, congrats to Carlos and Williams. Amazing result for them. I think for us, really happy to be back on the podium. It's been a bit of a rough weekend for me personally, but the car was great. Lewis came in P4 as well, so happy with that.

Q: You talked about a rough week for you personally — a bit under the weather. So how tough was it to sort of focus, and how are you feeling after 51 laps?

GR: Yeah, I was pretty glad when I saw the chequered flag, to be honest. I was fortunate — I felt much better today than I felt on Friday and Saturday. So yeah, looking forward to a bit of rest now. But as I said, just happy with the result. And for us as a team, trying to beat Ferrari in the Constructors' was a good step towards that.

Q: Absolutely. Well, congratulations. Go get some rest. Max, 67th win of your career, second in a row. That looked like Max 2023 — as straightforward as it gets. Did it feel that easy from inside the car?

Max VERSTAPPEN: They're all a bit different, but I think this weekend has been incredible for us. Of course, last weekend was already great. But yeah, for us to win here again is just fantastic. And I think also in the race, the car was working really well. On both of the compounds, we had clean air all the time, and you could then look after your tyres. And yeah, it was pretty straightforward. Of course, it's not easy around here — very windy today, so the car is always moving around a lot. But yeah, of course, incredibly happy with this performance.

Q: After the conditions we saw yesterday and all the problems in qualifying — you mentioned the wind, similar conditions today. How surprised were you that there weren't more incidents, that we didn't have more Safety Cars or even a red flag? Is that the drivers just learning from yesterday, or was it maybe not as hard today?

MV: I think in the race, always, you have to be a little bit more careful, right? Also, with tyre management and stuff, you want to make the one-stop work. So I think everyone was a bit more cautious with that anyway. Plus, of course, the compounds that we're running today — Medium and Hard — they weren't really used that much up until today, and that all helped. And yeah, for sure I was happy that there were not too many Safety Cars.

Q: Max, two wins on the trot. This Red Bull car seems to have really taken a step forward the last few weeks. Are you confident that this sort of pace, this sort of relative competitiveness can continue all the way to the end of the season?

MV: Difficult to say at the moment, but for sure the last two race weekends have been amazing for us. Singapore — completely different challenge again with the high downforce. So we'll see what we can do there.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Very well done, Max. A very dominant victory for you today. Just how sweet was the performance?

MV: I think overall, just a great weekend for us. I think for sure, you know, starting up front was key, especially in the beginning, just managing your tyres to go long. But, yeah, overall, very happy with how the race was going. I mean, I could go very long in that first stint. The car was doing pretty much what I wanted it to do. Just how much you commit, right, to push around here, which is not always easy with the layout of the track, the wind as well. It was quite tough today with that. But, yeah, we just stayed out until basically everyone pitted. And then there were only a few laps left on the medium, clearing a few backmarkers, which took a bit of time. But after that, just bringing it home. And for us, that's another just great result. A bit unusual. This season has been really swinging left and right, but at least now two weekends in a row, it's been going really well.

Q: You say it's been swinging left and right. Was this the best the car has felt all season?

MV: I guess together with Monza. Yep. Monza has never really been a particularly strong track for us, so to do that, that was already a big plus. And I guess all in all for me here in Baku, it's been alright, but never amazing — apart from maybe '21, '22, I guess. But the rest has always been a bit difficult. So, yeah, to have a weekend like this, it was very important.

Q: How much of a risk was it to start the race on the Hard tyre given that you hadn't run on it up until that point?

MV: Well, not so much from knowing how good it would be. It's more like the start or an untimely Safety Car. So as soon as we crossed, like, 20 laps into the race, I was a bit happier, but it was a bit of a risk. I think it's a bit unusual, of course, when you're on pole, to start on the hardest compound that is available. But we did it, and I think it was the right call. We said before the race, well, one way or another one strategy will work, and we'll come out of the race happy with it. Luckily, we chose the right one.

Q: Now, Max, you're only 69 points behind Oscar Piastri in the Drivers' Championship. Given the recent upswing in competitiveness, does it give you a smidgen of hope that the title is within range again?

MV: I mean, I don't rely on hope. But it's seven rounds left – 69 points is a lot. So I personally don't think about it. I just go race by race, what I have been doing basically the whole season — just trying to do the best we can, try to score the most points that we can. And then after Abu Dhabi, we'll know.

Q: And given where the car is now, do you have a little bit more hope going to Singapore, a race where Red Bull's never won?

MV: Well, I have never won. Red Bull has won, right? We'll see. It's completely different. High downforce. A lot of deg on the tyres, so we'll see what happens. I really don't know at the moment.

Q: Alright. Very well done today. Thank you very much, Max. George, let's come to you. Great race by you. What was the key to the climb up to P2 today?

GR: I think it was just staying out of trouble, to be honest. I don't think we had a spectacular weekend, to be honest. And, obviously, Carlos just did an amazing job, and Liam also did a great job yesterday qualifying ahead of us. But all of the cars who we ordinarily fight sort of made mistakes or underperformed, and we sort of picked up the pieces. So, obviously, really happy to finish P2 all things considered. But also, I think the cool temps helped us a little bit. So just good to capitalise on all of those things.

Q: Do you have a better race car or qualifying car at the moment?

GR: I think it's very dependent circuit to circuit. Definitely, this weekend, the conditions and the circuit layout probably suited our car better than we'll see in Singapore. But right now, the field is so compact and overtaking is pretty difficult. So it seems like anybody can do an amazing lap and get themselves up the order. And, to be honest, it's pretty incredible seeing the likes of Carlos, Hülkenberg, Hadjar on the podium this season.

Q: You've been under the weather all weekend. Sounding a bit like Barry White. Just how tough was it physically for you?

GR: Well, fortunately, it was Baku. Even though it's one of the toughest circuits, mentally and physically it's maybe one of the easiest. So today I'm much better. Friday and Saturday, I was really rough. And, you know, had it been Singapore, as an example, I think I probably would have called it a day on Friday, to be honest, and probably wouldn't have done the race. So, yeah, sort of fortunate timing. And I haven't been ill for a couple of years, actually, so it just all sort of hit me at once these days, but I'm on the up now.

Q: Quick word on the Constructors' Championship, please. Mercedes in P2, four points now ahead of Ferrari. How do you see this one playing out over the remaining seven races? Do you expect it to go to the wire, or do you think one of you will gain an advantage?

GR: Well, I think right now with the current form, there's as much chance of Max finishing ahead of us as there is Ferrari, to be honest.

MV: Red Bull, no?

GR: Yeah, team Verstappen! But, yeah — sorry, I lost my train of thought there. It just swings so quickly. Ferrari were looking amazingly strong on Friday here, and they've always been great here. You know, Charles has been on pole four times here, and they could have easily been one-two on the grid. And with how difficult overtaking is, they probably would have finished one-two as well. But, obviously, they had a bad qualifying, and they came away with single-figure points, and we were the ones coming away with 30 points, so nobody knows.

Q: Very well done. Thank you for that. Carlos, if we could come to you. First podium for Williams — very well done. What was the key to this result, first of all?

Carlos SAINZ: The key was probably just nailing a perfect weekend from practice, quali, to race. It's what I've been looking for since the beginning of the season — just to nail a perfect weekend. I think we had almost a perfect one in Jeddah when we scored maximum points, but then the rest of the season has been really up and down with a lot more downs than ups. Very unlucky in some cases. Job not well done in others — by me or by other things that were in our control. But I always said to the team from the beginning that whenever a first big opportunity of fighting for a podium comes, as long as we have everything under control and nothing goes wrong and we prove to everyone what we're doing, and we get that podium, then I'll be OK. And it's exactly what ended up happening today. We had our chance starting from P2. Probably, if you asked many of us yesterday, we didn't believe the podium was actually achievable with so many fast cars behind. But I think we've had good pace this year, we just didn't have many opportunities to show it. Today we had a very good opportunity to show our very good pace, and we managed to stay on the podium. Only George managed to beat us with very good pace, but it was a very well executed race.

Q: Is that what makes this so special? You said earlier that this tastes sweeter than your first ever podium in Formula 1.

CS: Yeah, 100%. This one means even more just because of, obviously, a year ago when I put my bet on Williams, and I said I'm going to this team because I truly believe in this project, and I truly believe that this team is on the rise. I'm very comfortable in this working environment, also very comfortable with everyone around me. And I have actually been pretty fast all year with the car. I think out of everyone that's changed teams — which is not an easy task nowadays — I've been very competitive from the first race, very quick, but I didn't have results with me. I didn't have results to prove to myself, the team, and everyone that some good things were about to come. But, in the end, they did. I think life has taught me many times that this sometimes happens — that you have a run of misfortune or bad performances, but then suddenly life gives you back if you keep working hard with something really sweet like this.

Q: Carlos, you've got your first podium for Williams before Lewis has got his first podium for Ferrari. Can we get your thoughts on that?

CS: What everyone else does is not my business, to be honest. What I care about is that the first opportunity that I had to score a podium with Williams, and the first opportunity Williams had to score a podium, we took it, we scored it, and there it is.

Q: Final one from me. What else is possible with this car in 2025?

CS: Not much more than this, to be honest. I think the podium is — unless something crazy happens — maybe our best chance. Probably Vegas will be our next best track to try and maybe put together a top five or a top six, which is what we sometimes can achieve when everything goes right. Apologies, it's a tough ask. I'll fight for it if it comes, like you've seen today. But the rest, for example in Qatar, I don't think we will score points. That's how much our performance swings. But then we will have the Austins, the Mexicos. We will be a pure midfield car where we can maybe get in the points and keep our championship going. So excited to see what happens in those races.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Jesus Balseiro – Diario AS) Question to Carlos. Third place is quite nice, but was it ever possible to be second today? Do you think you could have done anything different, obviously on strategy, to keep George behind?

CS: Yeah. Obviously, I was racing for second the whole race, but I think it was around the first 10 laps of the Hard tyre where I was expecting to be clearly quicker than George on a new Hard versus his old Hard that I said, ""If now I can put my car in front of him before he boxes, we have a chance for P2."" But then they started telling me his lap times on those used Hards versus my new Hard, and I saw there was no chance. They were just simply too quick for us today. So congrats to him and Merc for that. Kimi was also coming quick behind, and I had to change my focus to getting the P3 rather than fighting for the P2.

Q: Carlos, when you saw Max with the Hard tyre at the start, did you think that was a good opportunity for you?

CS: No. I thought maybe I could have done the same, if I knew. But I knew we had measured during the whole weekend that the left-hand side of the grid was a lot less grip than the right-hand side. So even if I was on a step softer compound, I knew that even with a good start and the short run to Turn 1, with that left side being very dirty, it was probably not enough to get him at the start. I still got a decent start, but it was not enough to put him under pressure. And I think for the Hard tyres, he must have done a good start.

Q: (Aynur Mehdiyeva – Racebrief.com) My question is for Carlos. First of all, congratulations with your first podium with the Williams team in Baku. Did you follow some specific strategy during the race?

CS: No. No. I just knew — I think on long runs on Friday, I saw my lap times and I saw that I'm
actually very quick, very competitive. So if it's not easy to overtake back there, they're going to struggle to get to me because I'm not slow. That's why yesterday, I said I was dreaming about the podium, but in reality, I was kind of believing that if we nailed everything, we could actually make it happen because our pace has genuinely been good all year in this kind of tracks. I've been quick. The car has been quick. And if we nail everything, I thought a top five was possible. And if we do everything perfect, maybe even the podium.

Q: (Rodrigo França – Car Magazine Brazil) Question to the three drivers, please. Next Grand Prix will be in Singapore. Is this the most difficult race of the F1 season? And if so, why?

MV: Depends on a lot of things. If the car is shocking to drive, yes, it's really hard to keep it in a straight line. But if the car is nice to drive, then it's more about just the physicality of it. But at the same time, if everything's going well, then you can relax a bit more, and then naturally it's less physical as well. So, I don't know. Let's wait and see. I mean, it's for sure always hot and you're sweating a lot, so you have to prepare for that. But I guess we've all done that — heat training and stuff — preparing for these kinds of races. Basically, just getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. I don't mind it. It's a cool track. Of course, I've never won there, but it's a cool feeling to drive there, and I hope this year we'll be a bit more competitive.

GR: Same.

CS: Yeah. I think Singapore is very tough physically, but I think driving-wise, the race we just had here in Baku is probably the toughest of the year given the wind, the walls. The speeds that we do here is, for me, tougher as a driver than Singapore. But Singapore is more physically demanding.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Victory went to Max Verstappen in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which started with a dramatic crash for championship leader Oscar Piastri.

Max Verstappen dominated the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after championship leader Oscar Piastri crashed out on the opening lap.

Verstappen controlled Sunday's race in Baku, winning by almost 15 seconds from George Russell and Carlos Sainz. With Lando Norris only seventh and Piastri a non-scorer, the Red Bull driver also closed the points gap to 68.

Following a chaotic opening lap, which included Piastri's Turn 5 crash, the race became a tactical battle, with teams attempting to use the undercut to move their drivers up the order.

Boosting their points totals with much-needed strong performances were Kimi Antonelli, Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda in fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively, with the trio fending off Norris in seventh.

Following a strong start to the weekend, Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc could only manage eighth and ninth places for Ferrari.

""These are very, very heavy times,"" the Oscar-winning actress said at a press conference ahead of the European premiere of her new film, 'Couture.'


							By 

	Lily Ford



Angelina Jolie was swiftly made to answer on the chaotic political landscape in her native U.S. at a press conference for her new film, Couture.


	Alongside director Alice Winocour and the cast of Couture ahead of the film's European premiere at the San Sebastian Film Festival in northern Spain on Sunday night, the Oscar-winning actress admitted she wanted to be careful about what she said on the topic.




	“It's a very difficult question,” the Maria star began. “I have to say that I love my country and I don't, at this time, recognize my country. I've always lived internationally. My family is international. My life, my world view, is equal [and] united. Anything, anywhere that divides or limits personal expressions and freedoms [for anyone] I think is very dangerous,” she added. “I think these are such serious times that we have to be careful not to say things casually. So I'll be careful in a press conference…. But these are very, very heavy times.”

Couture stars Jolie as Maxine, a 40-something American film director tasked with making a short piece of work for a Paris Fashion Week show. Amidst the glitz and chaos of fashion's most frenzied week on the calendar, Maxine is diagnosed with breast cancer, an experience the actress herself has also had to make decisions on, given her family history of cancer. Jolie had a preventative double mastectomy in 2013.

	“I did choose to have that because I lost my mother and my grandmother very young, and I have the  BRCA1 gene,” Jolie said, “so I chose to have that a decade ago.”


	“Those are my choices,” she continued. “I don't say everybody should do it that way, but it's important to have the choice. As Alice said, it's uniting for not just women, of course, but anybody who's gone through something [similar].”


	Jolie was emotional when asked a question about wearing a necklace in the film that belonged to her mother, who died at age 56 from ovarian cancer in 2007. “It's very hard to speak about my mother,” she said. “You would love my mother. I did wear my mother's necklace. I also wore her ashes…I think probably everybody in this room has been sitting in a hospital room — maybe some of you have been through heavier things.”


	“I wish that she had this community,” she continued. “I wish she was able to speak more openly and people respond as graciously as you have and not feel as alone. I think she would have told Maxine to live every day and focus on life and don't take anything at home for granted. Sorry if I didn't answer [properly], but I'm very emotional.”


	The movie examines how Maxine's life intersects with two others: Ada, a young model from South Sudan (Anyier Anei) who escapes a fraught future only to end up in a more frivolous environment, and Angèle (Ella Rumpf), a French makeup artist who dreams of being a writer. Louis Garrel stars as Maxine's cinematographer, with whom she strikes up a relationship.

An ACLU open letter supporting free speech and condemning Kimmel's suspension draws the support of a long list of Hollywood luminaries. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Hundreds of Hollywood celebrities have signed an open letter by the American Civil Liberties Union supporting free speech and condemning Disney's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live!


	The letter states that efforts to pressure artists, journalists and others with retaliation for their speech “strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.” The message closes by calling on all Americans to fight to defend our right to speak freely.




	Some of the signatories (full list of names below) include Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Selena Gomez, Tom Hanks, Olivia Rodrigo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Keaton, Regina King, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Natalie Portman, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and Kerry Washington.

	“We now find ourselves in a modern McCarthy era, facing exactly the type of heavy-handed government censorship our Constitution rightfully forbids,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, which organized the letter. “The silencing of Jimmy Kimmel and jawboning of media outlets through lawsuits and threats to their licenses evoke dark memories of the 1950s. We must remember, however, that Senator McCarthy was ultimately disgraced and neutralized once Americans mobilized and stood up to him. We must do the same today because together, our voices are louder and together, we will fight to be heard.”

	











	Kimmel was suspended following a comment in his monologue about MAGA's reaction to the murder of Charlie Kirk that went viral and FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action” against the talk show host. Carr's threat was followed by affiliate owners Nexstar and Sinclair says they would preempt the show, which spurred ABC to suspend Kimmel “indefinitely.”


	The move by the FCC and ABC has been followed by widespread condemnation — even among some Republican leaders such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — and pledges to boycott Disney and its subsidiaries.


	Here is the letter and the full list of names: 


	“We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech. Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.


	Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.


	We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.

	











	Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power — because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.


	This is the moment to defend free speech across our nation. We encourage all Americans to join us, along with the ACLU, in the fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights.”

The Marvel star is expected to return in several days.

Film Editor


Tom Holland suffered an injury on the U.K. set of Spider-Man: Brand New Day on Friday, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.


	Insiders described the injury as a mild concussion, and say Holland will be taking a break from filming for several days. Sony, which is behind the movie, will meet Monday to decide how to move forward with the production. Nobody else is said to have been injured.




Spider-Man: Brand New Day is perhaps the most important movie on Sony's upcoming slate. The previous film, 2021's Spider-Man: No Way Home, stands as the studio's highest-grossing movie of all time with $1.91 billion in ticket sales. The previous movie, Far From Home, became the first Spidey movie to top $1 billion, and was just Sony's second, after James Bond pic Skyfall.

	The film is also critical for the future of Marvel Studios, which co-produces the movie with Sony, as it is its only feature before December 2026's Avengers: Doomsday arrives.


	While Holland's previous three Spider-Man films hailed from director Jon Watts, the new installment is from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton. It will pair Holland with Marvel mainstays Mark Ruffalo (the Hulk) and Jon Bernthal (the Punisher), with Spider-Man regulars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon returning. Spidey newcomers to the mix include Stranger Things‘ Sadie Sink and Severance‘s Tramell Tillman, while Michael Mando is back as the Scorpion after a brief role in Holland's first Spider-Man movie, 2017's Homecoming.


Brand New Day has a release date of July 31, 2026.

Host Whoopi Goldberg said the show was waiting to see if Kimmel made a public comment first.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	After not addressing the the suspension of their ABC colleague Jimmy Kimmel last week, the hosts of The View wasted no time getting into the subject Monday.


	“Did y'all really think we weren't gonna talk about Jimmy Kimmel? I mean, have you watched the show over the last 29 seasons?” Whoopi Goldberg said to begin Monday's show. “No one silences us.”




	She added, however, that after the news of Kimmel's suspension broke on Sept. 17, the show “took a breath” to see if Kimmel would make a public comment (he has not yet). Goldberg noted that they did the same thing when CBS announced it was ending The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. So they didn't talk about Kimmel's suspension on Thursday's live episode of The View or Friday's pretaped installment.

	“You can [dislike] a show and it can go off the air,” Goldberg continued. “Someone can say something they shouldn't and get taken off the air. But the government cannot, cannot apply pressure to force someone to be silenced.”


	The show then played clips of Republican Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy saying FCC head Brendan Carr had overstepped in threatening to examine ABC affiliates' licenses over remarks Kimmel made about the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.


	Ana Navarro added that she lived under both right-wing and left-wing dictatorships growing up in Nicaragua, and that silencing speech is part of the dictator playbook, regardless of ideology. “They want to scare us into silence and self-censorship,” she said.

	











	Alyssa Farah Griffin — who worked in the White House during President Donald Trump's first term — said standing up for free speech, even speech that doesn't align with her personal beliefs, “is not just a long-standing American position, it's a conservative position. … What made me a conservative was that as imperfect as our system is, the Constitution gets it pretty damn right. The First Amendment is first for a reason.”

Oliver also sharply criticized President Trump and FCC chairman Brendan Carr and made a plea with Disney CEO Bob Iger not to give in to their demands: ""Giving the bully your lunch money doesn't make him go away, it just makes him come back hungrier each time. They are never going to stop.""

Managing Editor, Digital


	John Oliver used the main segment of his HBO show Sunday night addressing the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel.


	Last week, Disney suspended the host of Jimmy Kimmel Live! following the ABC late-night host's remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.




	The dramatic move followed Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr threatening to take action against ABC affiliates in the wake of a Kimmel comment that many took as suggesting the shooting suspect, Tyler Robinson, was a MAGA Republican during his Monday monologue.

	“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.

	After station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they would not be airing Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the wake of those comments, Disney made the decision to suspend Kimmel indefinitely. The company has faced backlash from Hollywood A-listers, current and veteran late-night hosts, politicians and the public for its decision, with many accusing Disney of bowing to pressure from the Trump administration.


	On Sunday's Last Week Tonight, Oliver started off his main segment by noting Kirk's tragic death.


	“A person getting shot is tragic and a person getting shot for their ideas is horrifying,” he said. “That is true no matter what those ideas are, and I also recognize that for many, especially those who are the targets of some of Kirk's ideas, it has been hard to stay quiet as they see flags lowered to half staff, and claims that he debated things the right way. But setting all of that aside, it does seem like some are now willing to weaponize Kirk's death to do things they've been wanting to do for years, whether it's going after liberal groups, trans people, or their remaining critics in the media, and under some shamelessly flimsy pretext, all of which brings us back to Jimmy Kimmel.”

	











	Oliver noted he appeared on Kimmel's show the very night Kimmel made this comments. He defended Kimmel and said he was unclear about what was offensive about Kimmel's remarks.


	“While you may have seen headlines saying he got in trouble for remarks about Charlie Kirk himself, or even remarks about his death, that's not strictly accurate,” Oliver noted. “The comments that got him in trouble weren't about Kirk. In fact, Kimmel's first comments after his murder were a post reading, ‘Can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents, and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence,' ” Oliver added, quoting a social media post by Kimmel.


	“What got Kimmel in trouble was a passing reference on Monday night. Now at the time there were still rumors flying around regarding the killer's motivations, including that he was on the far right, something that Kimmel alluded to like this,” he said, showing a clip of Kimmel's aforementioned remark.


	“Yeah, that was it,” Oliver said. “Weirdly, I was actually a guest on his show that night and I didn't even register that comment and that's only partly because I wasn't really paying attention,” he quipped. “And I'm not alone in that. After Kimmel's suspension, many struggle to pick the offensive line out of his monologue, as YouTube is filled with comments under the video like, ‘I'm still waiting for the offensive part.' And, ‘What did he say that got him fired? I'm rewatching the last week of episodes and haven't heard it yet.””

	











	Oliver continued: “The point is, Kimmel didn't denigrate Charlie Kirk or make light of his killing. The worst thing you could say is that he appears to have been wrong about the shooter's ideology, which, OK. But he was also pointing out that many on the right seem desperate to weaponize Kirk's death, an argument that's aged pretty well, given, you know, everything that's happened to Kimmel since. Because that one line set off a firestorm in some corners of conservative media.”


	Oliver also noted that Nexstar has a motivation to keep the Trump administration happy, since it's currently in the process of acquiring competitor Tegna and needs regulatory changes for that deal to be completed.


	“Nexstar badly needs FCC approval, so it is hardly surprising that when Carr specifically said companies should pull Kimmel off the air or face consequences, it quickly complies,” Oliver said. “Basically, Brendon Carr said jump, and Nexstar took his dick out of their mouth for just long enough to say how high exactly.”


	Oliver also called out Sinclair as another “major owner of TV stations who were also apparently exploring merger options that would require FCC approval [that] announced that they too would not air Kimmel's show, and Sinclair even cited Carr's remarks in their statement, saying, ‘We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr's remarks today,' and come on, Sinclair. As I believe Olandria once said to Huda on Love Island, ‘Don't embarrass yourself going too hard for a man.' Just solid advice for the islands of love and for business.”

	











	Oliver went on to note that Carr wasn't “trying to dissuade people from connecting the dots here as when one media reporter asked him for a comment, he sent back a smiley emoji” and sent a gif of The Office to CNN in response.


	“It's from The Office, and that's, that was the actual response by the chairman of the FCC,” Oliver said, adding: “Look, I like The Office. Who doesn't like The Office? Sure, I could have done without seasons 8 and 9, but if it's on at a hotel, I'm not kicking it out of bed. That said, I want you to run through your friend list in your head right now and pick out the person most likely to text you a GIF from The Office. Do you have them in your mind? They're your least favorite friend, right? Just be honest. They're the one you invite to stuff just because you're afraid no one else will show up. They're a third-string friend, they're your backup's backup, and if you're thinking, ‘There's nothing wrong with sending Office GIFs,' I'm afraid that person might be you.”


	Oliver again emphasized that what went down was very easy to see.


	“Look, the sequence of events here could not be clearer because it was all done in plain view,” he said. “Carr leaned on broadcasters to take down Kimmel. They did that, sometimes even directly citing Carr while doing so, and then Carr celebrated with a fun GIF. That sure seems like a pretty clear case of the government pressuring companies to censor speech.”


	Oliver went on to say that Kimmel's suspension feels like a “turning point.”

	











	“Not because comedians are important, but because we are not,” he said. “If the government can force a network to pull a late night show off the air and do so in plain view, it can do a fuck of a lot worse.”


	He quipped that he and his show are in a “different situation” because he isn't on broadcast TV and HBO parent company Warner Bros. Discovery doesn't own broadcast networks, meaning that it's less susceptible to pressure from the FCC  than Disney, which owns ABC. Oliver then showed a news clip of Paramount Skydance reportedly prepping a bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.


	Cut to Oliver shouting expletives. “It was fun while it lasted, guys. Whatever happens next, let me say now, it has been the honor of my life to age like a haunted painting before your very eyes,” he joked.


	Oliver then noted the importance of free speech and the First Amendment. 


	“It should be clear to everyone that the First Amendment is absolutely critical in this country,” he said. “That is something even Brendan Carr knows, given that he once tweeted, ‘Free speech is the counterweight. It is the check on government control. That is why censorship is the authoritarian's dream.' And I'm guessing that Trump is currently enjoying that dream so much he could break his bed sheets in half.”


	Oliver then urged Disney to stand by Kimmel and his staff and shared ways in which viewers could “encourage” them to do that, including by canceling their subscriptions to Disney+ or Hulu. 

	











	He then wrapped up his segment by addressing Disney CEO Bob Iger directly.


	“Hi there, Bob, we haven't met, but you probably know me as America's third favorite Zazu,” the character Oliver voiced in The Lion King. “Congratulations on recasting that role, by the way, it was a fun thing to learn about after the fact,” he joked. 


	“Anyway, one day, the history of the time we're living through is going to be written, and when it is, I'm not sure it's those in this administration who are even gonna come off the worst,” he continued. “Now don't get me wrong, they're going to come off terribly. But history's also gonna remember the cowards who definitely knew better, but still let things happen, whether it was for money, convenience or just comfort. And I know, this is something of a tough sell, and it can be a bit of anathema to risk-averse business leaders, but I will say this: If we've learned nothing else from this administration's second term so far, and I don't think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn't make him go away, it just makes him come back hungrier each time. They are never going to stop.”


	He continued: “At some point, you're going to have to draw a line, so I'd argue why not draw it right here. And when they come to you with stupid, ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could win in court, Instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use four key words that they don't tend to teach you in business school. Not ‘OK, you're the boss.' Not ‘whatever you say goes.' But instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go away, and that is, ‘Fuck you, make me.'”

The first Black executive and woman to chair a major record company, her tenure at Epic is just one success story in the trailblazer's five-decade career.


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



Sylvia Rhone, the first Black industry executive and woman to chair a major record company, is exiting her post as chairwoman/CEO of Epic Records. Effective at the end of this month, Rhone's departure comes six years after she was promoted to chair/CEO in 2019. Prior to that, Rhone had served as Epic's president since 2014.


	In a statement to global Sony Music employees obtained by Billboard, Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer said, “Today, I want to take a moment to reflect on the extraordinary career of Sylvia Rhone. In an industry defined by its constant evolution, Sylvia has adapted and embraced change, time and time again. Her journey is more than just a list of accomplishments. She is a trailblazing executive with a distinguished background and unwavering commitment to supporting artists.


	“She has made history including becoming the first woman to be named Chair of a major record company and guided some of the biggest artists in our business across every genre. Sylvia's influence is rooted in an understanding of music's power to connect with people. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“And as Chairwoman and CEO of our Epic Records, she has shepherded No. 1 chart successes with 21 Savage, Future, Travis Scott and Tyla among others. It has been our honor to work with a true icon and our collective responsibility to continue to build on her work at Epic Records. Thank you, Sylvia, for your leadership and inspiration.”


	In a letter obtained by Billboard that Rhone addressed to “My Sony Family,” she said in part, “It's been an extraordinary journey: 11 years since my promotion to President of Epic Records and six years since my appointment as chairwoman and CEO. This role at Epic represents the third time in my career that I've been the first woman and first Black person to serve as CEO of a major record label owned by a Fortune 500 company.


	“And today, I am moving on from this historic role at Epic and I'm very excited about the future. I've always been surrounded by excellent teams, but our current one at Epic is extraordinary. Spanning multiple generations, our team understands music's history, finds meaning in complex data, and anticipates emerging trends. From Travis Scott, Future and 21 Savage, to Meghan Trainor, Tyla and Madison Beer, Zara Larsson to Giveon and Mariah The Scientist,  Q-Tip to Andre 3000 and the late, great Ozzy Osbourne, Epic artists thrive through bespoke campaigns that honor their unique voices and goals … From day one, we set out to build something special at Epic — and we have.


	“This moment of my transition invites reflection on a journey that has been wide-ranging in its scope and impact … I am blessed to have worked with some of the most brilliant and influential artists in the history of recorded music. And I've discovered this: when we channel our strength and creativity in service of a vision, and collaborate with artists who do the same, we create music that reflects our world, questions our assumptions and uplifts our spirits. This is a kind of magic, a deeply human connection. Right now, when music's DNA is being reimagined, when artists face existential challenges, and when all of us are building the future in real time, there is little that is more profound.


	“I am forever grateful for my prior teammates from over the years. Not only did we work great music, but we also created an amazing network of advocacy and goodwill! Thanks to Rob Stringer for his trust and camaraderie and to Doug Morris for empowering me to shatter the glass ceiling … I have worked in our industry since vinyl ruled, and women were rarely if ever in line for C-level or even vice-presidential roles. I am proud of my achievements, and of my commitment to those who take inspiration from them.”


	There is no word at this time as to who will succeed Rhone, whose exit further illuminates the underrepresentation of women and people of color in music's top C-suite echelon. Her departure follows in the wake of three other label chair/CEO exits: Capitol Music Group's Michelle Jubelirer and Atlantic Music Group's chair/CEO Julie Greenwald — both in 2024 — and UMG Nashville's Cindy Mabe earlier this year. Former Motown chair/CEO Ethiopia Habtemariam left that post at the end of 2022.


	Currently the only U.S.-based woman chair/CEO in the major label system is Taylor Lindsey at Sony Music Nashville, who joined the label at the top of 2025. And Def Jam Recordings' Tunji Balogun is now the only Black chair/CEO heading a major record label. Outside of the labels, Jody Gerson is the global chair/CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group and was just named to the board of Gap. Carianne Marshall is also co-chair/COO at Warner Chappell Music. Other high-ranking women within the major label setup include Wendy Goldstein, president/CCO of Republic Collective; Lilia Parsa, president of Capitol Records; Michele An, president/head of creative strategy at Interscope; Annie Lee, COO of Interscope Capitol Labels Group; Michele Anthony, executive vp of UMG; Jaqueline Saturn, president of North America at Virgin Music Group; Dawn Olejar, COO of Verve Label Group; Susan Mazo, executive vp/chief impact officer at UMG; Jenifer Mallory, president at Columbia; Juliette Jones, COO of Alamo; Rayna Bass, co-president at 300; Marsha St. Hubert, co-president at 10K; Cris Lacy, co-president/co-chair at Warner Nashville; and Clio Massey, co-president at Arista, among others.


	Over the course of her 11-year tenure at Epic, Rhone helmed a diverse global roster of established and rising stars such as Future, Travis Scott, 21 Savage, Tyla, Andre 3000, Camila Cabello, GIVEON, Mariah the Scientist, Meghan Trainor, Judas Priest and the late Ozzy Osbourne. Over the last two years, the label has scored chart wins by Future (a trio of Billboard 200 No. 1s with We Don't Trust You, We Still Don't Trust You and Mixtape Pluto), 21 Savage (American Dream) and Travis Scott (UTOPIA) as well as the top 10 Hot 100 mega-hit “Water” by South African artist Tyla, who won the first-ever Grammy for best African music performance in 2024.


	A division of Sony Music Entertainment — along with sister frontline labels Columbia Records, RCA Records, Alamo Records and Sony Music Nashville — Epic registered a significant gain in year-end 2024 current U.S. market share, jumping to 2.59% from 2.31% to secure eighth place. And in terms of year-end 2024 overall market share, the label claimed eighth place with 2.67%. Currently, Epic stands at 1.66% for 2025.


	Rhone's trailblazing, five-decade career evolution from record label secretary to chairwoman/CEO in the still overwhelmingly male-dominated music business has inspired generations of women pursuing C-suite roles in the industry. The music-loving Harlem, NY native and Wharton School graduate's ascension dates back to 1974 when she eschewed a banking career for an entry-level secretarial job with independent label Buddah Records. Subsequent learn-the-ropes jobs with labels including ABC Records and Ariola Records led to Rhone being hired by Elektra Records as northeast regional promotions manager of special markets in 1981.


	Five years later in 1986, Rhone was promoted from her then-post as Atlantic Records' director of national Black music promotions to vp/gm of Black music operations at Atlantic. Two years later, in 1988, she was elevated to senior vp of Atlantic's Black music division. During her Atlantic tenure, Rhone guided the careers of, among others, LeVert, En Vogue and Brandy. As an early champion of hip-hop, she also brought artists such as MC Lyte, The D.O.C., Yo-Yo and Kwame to the forefront.


	When Atlantic established East West Records America in 1990, Rhone broke music's executive glass ceiling for the first time when she was named the new label's chairman in 1990. Its roster ran the gamut from rockers Pantera and AC/DC to pop/soul band Simply Red and hip-hop duo Das EFX.


	Rhone shattered the glass ceiling once more when she made history as the first Black woman to be appointed chairman and CEO of a major record company — Elektra Entertainment Group (EEG) — in 1994. Piloting the merger of Elektra, East West and Sire Records into EEG, Rhone developed a diverse roster that included Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, Metallica, Yolanda Adams, Anita Baker, Tracy Chapman, Phish, Natalie Merchant and Jason Mraz.


	Exiting Elektra after a 10-year tenure in 2004, Rhone was named president of Universal Motown Records, executive vp of Universal Records and chairman of the Universal Motown Record Group that same year. Two years later, the Universal group was split into two labels, Universal Republic Records and Universal Motown Records. Named president of the latter label, Rhone released key projects via both Cash Money Records (Lil Wayne, Drake, Nicki Minaj) and Motown (Kelly Rowland, Erykah Badu, Akon, Kid Cudi). A year after leaving Universal Motown in 2011, Rhone established her own boutique label, Vested In Culture, in partnership with Epic Records. Two years later in 2014, she began her 11-year tenure with Epic — first as its president then as chair/CEO.


	Over the course of her pioneering career, Rhone has won a host of accolades, including the City of Hope's Spirit of Life Award, the Black Music Collective's Recording Academy Global Impact Award, the Black Music Action Coalition's BMAC Clarence Avant Trailblazer Award and the Vanguard Award at the inaugural Black Women in Music dinner last year. Named Billboard's Women in Music executive of the year in 2023, Rhone was saluted as “a force, an alchemist, a savant of creative artistry and an inspiration to all women for the glass ceilings you have conquered.”

""I think we're all fearful for what comes next,"" McLachlan said in a statement at Sunday's (Sept. 21) premiere.

	In what appears to be a growing backlash to Disney's temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Sarah McLachlan said she and other scheduled performers at Sunday night's (Sept. 21) premiere of the doc Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery would not be taking the stage in a show of support for free speech.

	











	“It's a gift for all of us to see [this film], but also I've grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with, the stark contraction to the many advances we've made watching the insidious erosion of women's rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech,” McLachlan said in a statement at the premiere of the documentary that chronicles her launch of the history-making all-female touring music festival in 1997. 


	McLachlan did not specifically mention Kimmel or his suspension, but it seemed clear what she was referring to as the Lilith doc is airing on the Disney-owned Hulu; Disney is also the parent company of ABC.

	“I know you're expecting a performance tonight, and I'm so grateful to all of you for coming, and I apologize if this is disappointing, but we have collectively decided not to perform but instead to stand in solidarity in support of free speech,” McLachlan added after she and Jewel were expected to perform at the premiere. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the invitation to the premiere did not specify who was slated to perform, but only promised “special surprise performances,” with a source telling the magazine that McLachlan and Jewel were slated to take the stage with another surprise guest.

	











	“I think we're all fearful for what comes next, and none of us know, but what I do know is that I have to keep pushing forward as an artist, as a woman to find a way through, and though I don't begin to know what the answer is, I believe we all need to work towards a softening to let in the possibility of a better way, because I see music as a bridge to our shared humanity, to finding common ground,” McLachlan added.


	McLachlan then leaned into the lessons she said she'd learned from launching the Lilith Fair at a time when promoters and naysayers told her that audiences did not want to attend a show with more than one female headliner. “If Lilith taught me anything, it taught me there is a great strength in coming together to lift each other up instead of tearing each other down,” she said. “So I really hope this documentary inspires everyone to continue to try and create positive change in your communities, to keep lifting each other up, keep championing the causes you believe in with kindness and empathy because ultimately we're all in this together.”


	Amid calls for boycotts of its amusement parks, streaming service and related businesses, the scotched performances at The Ford in L.A. were the first notable public fallout for Disney after it suspended Kimmel's show last week following his monologue jokes about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. 


	“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said in the monologue of his Sept. 15 show in comments that appeared to drew the ire of the Trump administration and many on the right as investigators continue to search for the motive in the shooting.

	











	After station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they would be pre-empting Kimmel in the wake of the comments, ABC parent company Disney said it would suspend the show indefinitely. The decision has set off a firestorm of controversy, drawing backlash and outrage from fellow late night hosts, A-list actors and free speech advocates who fear the move is a capitulation to the Trump administration and an erosion of the nation's bedrock free speech rights.


Olivia Rodrigo, who appears in the Lilith film, took to her socials over the weekend to voice her frustration over Kimmel's suspension, saying she was, “so upset over this blatant censorship and abuse of power. I stand with Jimmy Kimmel and I stand for freedom of speech.”

Stern made his first comments on Monday morning (Sept. 22) about the action against his friend, saying his response for now is to cancel his Disney+ subscription.

	Gil Kaufman



Howard Stern has never been shy about expressing his opinion, and on Monday morning (Sept. 22) the SiriusXM superstar broke his silence on what he called a troubling situation that is near and dear to his heart for several reasons: the suspension of his friend Jimmy Kimmel from ABC.


	Stern opened Monday's show by breaking his recent vow to not talk about politics after vehemently speaking his mind during the most recent presidential election, saying, “I can no longer keep my mouth shut.” 

	











	“I feel obligated to say something, because s–t's getting outta control,” said Stern, who has famously been a free speech advocate for more than half a century amid his own battles with censorship and government entities threatening to curtail his right to speak freely on the airwaves. “This involves the network ABC. They did something really dumb and f-kin' horrible,” Stern added, before going into a classic fake-out bit complaining about the changes to the network's dating show The Bachelor.




	“Everyone knows what happened with Jimmy Kimmel. The bottom line is you really don't need my voice to know that something horrible happened at ABC,” Stern said about the network's decision to temporarily suspend Kimmel's show from the air amid backlash over the late night host's comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. 


	Stern, who said he considers Kimmel one of his closest showbiz friends and who frequently has the comedian on his SiriusXM show, said on a personal level the network's decision was painful to him because he loves Kimmel and wife Molly McNearney, whom he called “dear dear friends.” 


	“I believe Jimmy is such a big talent, and quite frankly so is his wife. They're two of the funniest people I have ever met,” Stern said, noting he's so enamored with the couple's comedic chops that he “shuts down” around them so as not to try to compete with their quick wit. Noting that many people have written to him asking “what should we do?,” Stern said he is doing something.


	“I feel all of this is a smokescreen to stop talking about what's really going on. We got a problem with inflation, gas prices, groceries, there's all kinds of problems,” said Stern, who said he's spoken to Kimmel but did not ask if the suspension — which was applauded by President Trump, who also encouraged NBC to do the same to Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers — is permanent or if the veteran late nighter fears he might get fired.


	“I just know when the government begins to interfere… when the government says, ‘I'm not pleased with you, so we're going to orchestrate a way to silence you' it's the wrong direction for the country. It isn't good, and I should know.” Stern then recalled that in the 1990s the Federal Communications Commission put pressure on the shock jock's then-parent company, Infinity Broadcasting, by threatening to slow down its planned merger with Viacom over its objections to the content of Stern's notoriously envelope-pushing morning show.

	











	Stern was able to survive that battle, but he said now ABC, as well as many universities, broadcasters and social media company owners, were being put in the same position, and, he said, “they all bent the knee and they all cower.”


	“The basis of this country is the government doesn't tell you what to say,” Stern told his listeners.


	While he said he feels for ABC and their tough position, “someone's got to step up and be f–kin' saying, ‘hey, enough, we're not gonna bow.'” Stern was clear that he's not trying to lead any boycott movement, but, like many others, he pledged to cancel his Disney+ subscription out of protest to say he doesn't support the action on Kimmel.


	“It's a scary time when the government starts threatening you, which is not right,” Stern said. “And I don't think ABC should have to be in this position. It's ridiculous. But I know most broadcasters would agree with me. I don't care what they broadcast, whether they're these right-wing types, or left-wing types, whatever type you are we can't have the government in this country dictating [speech].”


	Stern had been off the air since the Kimmel suspension was announced last week, but in his first chance to weigh in, he said it was chilling to read that ABC's action came after FCC chairman Brendan Carr made what sounded like a threat to the network during an appearance on a right-wind podcast last week. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”


	The latter was widely interpreted as a threat by Carr to launch investigations and regulatory action against licensed broadcasters who air Kimmel's show; shortly after, the owners of dozens of local ABC affiliate stations said they would be be pre-empting Kimmel. While many democrats and free speech advocates interpreted Carr's comments as an attempt to chill free speech, even such stalwart Trump supporters as Republican Sen. Ted Cruz — who leads the FCC oversight committee — characterized Carr's statement as a dangerous slippery slope. 

	











	“I got to say that's right out of Goodfellas,” Cruz said of the implied Carr threat that he likened to the mob rules in the legendary Martin Scorsese gangster flick. “That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, ‘Nice bar you have here. It would be a shame if something happened to it.'” 


	Another staunch conservative, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, called Carr's comments “absolutely inappropriate. Brendan Carr has got no business weighing in on this,” Paul told NBC News's Meet the Press over the weekend. The FCC does not have legal authority to censor what Kimmel says on his show and many critics have said that Carr's comment amount to an illegal action called “jawboning,” which is the improper use of threatened government action to influence a private entity. 


	Whether or not you like Kimmel, Stern said, “it's about freedom of speech. It's one thing if ABC wanted to fire Jimmy because they didn't like him, or he had low ratings… They didn't want to fire him. They're being pressured by the United States government. We can't have that, not if we're gonna have a democracy. And companies have to say f–k you.”


	Well aware that the Kimmel headline will be quickly pushed off the top of news feeds by the next outrage, Stern encouraged fellow defenders of free speech to bond together and accept that “each of us are obligated to be the watchdog for each other's rights and freedoms… we can't turn our heads, we can't pretend this didn't happen.”

The comedian's show was yanked from ABC following his comments after the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk.

	Hannah Dailey



Selena Gomez, Olivia Rodrigo and hundreds of other artists are speaking up after Jimmy Kimmel Live! was pulled from the airwaves.


	In an ACLU letter signed by more than 400 entertainers, some of the most famous names in pop culture rallied together to show support for Jimmy Kimmel following the suspension of his late-night program on ABC. “We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech,” the letter reads.


	“Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation,” it continues. “In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives and entertainers across the board.”

	











	Ben Platt, Cyndi Lauper, Debbie Gibson, Joe Keery, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Rufus Wainwright, Sheryl Crow and Tom Morello were also among the musicians who signed the letter, which ended with a call to action to “fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights,” regardless of political affiliation. Actors such as Meryl Streep, Joaquin Phoenix, Florence Pugh, Adam Scott, Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Lena Dunham, Mark Ruffalo and Natalie Portman also added their names.

	The letter comes less than a week after ABC announced that it was indefinitely suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live! following pressure from the Federal Communications Commission. (The Walt Disney Co. owns ABC, Hulu and ESPN, among other media properties.) Brendan Carr, the FCC's chairman, had threatened to revoke the licenses of the network's affiliates who continued to air Kimmel's program in light of comments the host made about the fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk earlier in September.

	











	“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel had said on the program.


	Rodrigo — who appeared on Kimmel in 2021 and 2023 and teamed up with the program to surprise trick-or-treaters last year — shared her own personal statement denouncing the suspension on Instagram Stories shortly afterward. “So upset over this blatant censorship and abuse of power,” the pop star wrote Sept. 20. “I stand with Jimmy Kimmel and I stand for freedom of speech.”

Unlike past Grammy Salute specials where other artists cover the subject's songs, this special was built around a filmed EWF concert at the Hollywood Bowl.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	Fifty years after Earth, Wind & Fire broke through to the top tier of pop and R&B bands, they were subjects of a two-hour Grammy salute that aired on Sunday (Sept. 21). The airdate was a clever touch – “the 21st night of September” is line from one of their most famous hits, “September.”


	Unlike past Grammy Salute specials where other artists cover the subject's songs, this special was built around a filmed EWF concert at the Hollywood Bowl, where the band was backed by the LA Philharmonic. But there were also inserts of performances of EWF classics by Jonas Brothers, Jon Batiste and Janelle Monáe and a warm, mostly spoken, tribute by Stevie Wonder.


	EWF have been showered with awards and honors in this century. The band was voted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Five members of the group were voted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010. They received a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy in 2016 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2019.


	Fulwell Entertainment and Grammy Studios produced A Grammy Salute to Earth, Wind & Fire Live: The 21st Night of September. Ben Winston (who is an executive producer of the annual Grammy telecast), Patrick Menton (a co-executive producer of that show) and Harvey Mason jr. (CEO of the Recording Academy) served as executive producers.


	Fans of these Grammy Salutes specials won't have long to wait for the next one. A Grammy Salute to Cyndi Lauper: Live From the Hollywood Bowl will air on Sunday, Oct. 5 (8-10 p.m., ET/PT). Guests include Joni Mitchell, Cher, Angelique Kidjo, John Legend, SZA, Mickey Guyton, Trombone Shorty and Jake Wesley Rogers, with a video tribute from Brandi Carlile.


	Here are the five best moments from A Grammy Salute to Earth, Wind & Fire Live: The 21st Night of September.




	The special, like the Bowl concert itself, opened with three of EWF's million-sellers, “Shining Star,” “Sing a Song” and “Got to Get You Into My Life.” The group didn't just cover The Beatles' brassy classic from Revolver, they thoroughly reinvented it. White won a Grammy for his bold, even audacious, arrangement of the song, which was easily the best thing to emerge from a movie that was a notorious flop – Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.


	Earth, Wind & Fire included full-length versions of “That's the Way of the World” and “Shining Star” in their set, but we were also treated to covers of the songs by Janelle Monáe and Jonas Brothers, respectively. JoBros, the only non-Black artists on the show, did a very credible job on “Shining Star,” which was EWF's only No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.


	Jon Batiste performed “Can't Hide Love,” a lesser-known EWF song which was the follow-up to “Sing a Song.” EWF didn't include that one in their Bowl set.


	In an insert, Wonder talked about his “great admiration for Maurice White,” and shared that when he heard “Shining Star,” it inspired him to write “I Wish,” the lead single from Songs in the Key of Life.


	Wonder didn't add, but we will, that Songs in the Key of Life kept EWF from landing a third consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. Spirit, which followed their chart-topping That's the Way of the World and Gratitude, peaked at No. 2, unable to dislodge Wonder's masterwork from the top spot.


	(Wonder was the subject of his own Grammy Salute special in 2015, Stevie Wonder: Songs in the Key of Life – An All-Star Grammy Salute.)


	EWF is probably best known as purveyors of upbeat pop/R&B/funk hits, but their ballads were every bit as good. The group included several in their show – “That's the Way of the World,” “Reasons,” “Fantasy” and “After the Love Has Gone.” The latter song, the band's first collaboration with David Foster, was EWF's only track to receive Grammy nods for record and/or song of the year.


	The fact that EWF was equally good on upbeat material and ballads is a key reason for their longevity.


	EWF includes just three original (or nearly original) members – Verdine White, Maurice White's younger brother; Ralph Johnson; and Philip Bailey, who was introduced as “The Voice.”


	The group's mastermind, Maurice White, died nearly 10 years ago.


	EWF is one of those groups where the songs are the stars, more than the individual band members. The Four Seasons, ABBA and The Temptations are also in this little club, which ensures the longevity of the material.

Political Editor


Howard Stern weighed in on Jimmy Kimmel's suspension from his ABC late-night show following a threat from Donald Trump‘s FCC chairman Brendan Carr.


	“I don't know what their plan is, but it looks like they might be firing [him],” Stern, referring to ABC and Kimmel, said on his SiriusXM show Monday. “And then I read sometimes that they're not gonna fire him. I don't know. I have spoken to Jimmy. I didn't ask him these questions, I just asked him how he was doing personally.”


	Stern added, “I just know when the government begins to interfere, when the government says, I'm not pleased with you, so we're gonna orchestrate a way to silence you. It's the wrong direction for our country. And I should know. I've been involved in something like this and now ABC is put in the same position and it's unfortunate that ABC even has to be in this position. They shouldn't have to be in this position. I feel for them too, in this. But that someone's gotta step up and be f*cking saying, ‘Hey, enough, we're not gonna bow.'”

	Stern also said that he canceled his Disney+ subscription.


	“Now it might sound stupid, but the thing I did this morning, I'm canceling my Disney+. I'm trying to say with the pocketbook that I do not support what they're doing with Jimmy.”


	Stern is the latest comedian/talk figure to come to Kimmel's defense. ABC has not said what it plans to do, other than that Kimmel's show would be taken off the air “indefinitely.” A week ago, the late-night host had said during his monologue, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.”

	











	That generated a furor on the right, with Carr chiming in Wednesday on Benny Johnson's podcast. Carr said, “We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”


	Hours later, station group Nexstar said it was pulling the show from its ABC affiliates “for the foreseeable future.” Soon after, ABC announced the suspension.


	Stern's platform, SiriusXM, falls outside the FCC's oversight. But when he was on broadcast radio, he had a long history of battles, and fines, for running afoul of the agency's indecency rules.

Howard is irrelevant as late night talk shows

I believe Donald Trump is wrong for doing this to Jimmy Kimmel and I believe they need to put Kimball back on the air and Trump needs to stay out of it

What evidence do you have that Trump had anything to do with this? Sinclair filed the FCC complaint and both they and Nexstar told ABC they were pulling Kimmels show, that by the way, nobody even watches.

I wonder how Iger will write about this if he writes another book?

The President Of The United States said last night that he HATES half our country. Why is that not a bigger story???

Don't worry, it's not even half.

If ABC threatened their affiliates with Monday Night Football if they pulled Kimmel this wouldn't be an issue.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


	Whoopi Goldberg kicked off today's episode of ABC's The View by addressing the elephant in the room: “Did y'all really think we weren't going to talk about Jimmy Kimmel? I mean, have you watched the show over the last 29 seasons? No one silences us.”


The View drew speculation from viewers and commentators last week when the daytime talker failed to address the suspension by ABC of Kimmel's late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live! (Friday's episode was taped on Thursday.)


	Today, Goldberg explained the show's decision last week. “When the news broke last week about Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, we took a breath to see if Jimmy was going to say anything about it first.” She added that the show took the same approach when news of the upcoming cancellation of CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

RELATED: Brendan Carr's Threats On Networks May Be “Jawboning”, And Courts Don't Like It, Legal Experts Say


	Goldberg then slammed the FCC's apparent role in Kimmel's suspension. “Someone can say something they shouldn't and get taken off the air,” she said, “but the government cannot apply pressure to force someone to be silenced.”


	Goldberg added: “We talk about freedom of speech a lot because we are always in somebody's mess because somebody has decided that we have said something that's offensive. But we fight for everybody's right to have freedom of speech because it means my speech is free, it means your speech is free.”


	Co-host Ana Navarro started her comments on the Kimmel controversy by thanking View viewers for “demanding truth and courage from us. You deserve it.” She then decried the use of Charlie Kirk to silence debate when Kirk himself was a free speech advocate.

	











RELATED: Howard Stern Says ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Suspension Amid Trump Pressure Is “Wrong For The Direction Of The Country”


	“I have to tell you this,” Navarro continued. “I lived through a right-wing dictatorship in Nicaragua and I lived through a left-wing dictatorship in Nicaragua. This is what dictators and authoritarians do. It does not matter the ideology. At first, they come with it for the people with big platforms, at first the silence the press, but then they come for all of us because their intent is to scare us into silence and self-censorship.” 


The View‘s conservative voice, Alyssa Farah Griffin, said, “The First Amendment is the first for a reason, because you need to be able to hold those in power accountable.” 


	Following last week's news of the Kimmel suspension, FCC chairman Brendan Carr said his agency should investigate whether The View is exempt from FCC's equal opportunity or equal-time rule.

Jimmy Kimmel told the truth. He had to pay for it in this current environment.

Brave ladies.  If you pay us enough $$$ we will all shut up when you tell us to shut up.  Oh, now it's okay to express our outrage?   Blah blah blah.   It's almost like their audience who thought their show was built on principle is finding out it was actually built on paying for their vacation homes.

Whew!  Five days later and with a flimsy excuse, but now that The View has commented on their parent company's decision to suspend Mr. Kimmel, I can finally sleep at night.

Too little too late,

Better late than never but still not watching ABC, Disney/Hulu until Kimmel is back on the air.

	In a largely dialogue-free trailer, with a Ludwig Göransson score, we see images of Mandalorian and Grogu looking like they're doing some sort of deal with Sigourney Weaver, the latter trying to steal her food using the Force; Baby Yoda riding along with the Babu Frik posse (the little alien introduced in the last Star Wars movie, Rise of Skywalker); one of the Hutts in an arena; and AT-ATs along a ridge (which funny enough looks like the same snowy cliff where young Han Solo from Solo: A Star Wars Story hijacked that train).

	











	The movie technically kicks off the summer 2026 box office on Memorial Day weekend since there isn't a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to do so. Can it beat Lilo & Stitch‘s opening ($146M domestic) to notch the best start ever over the Memorial Day weekend holiday?




			Watch on Deadline		







	The last Star Wars movie to play Memorial Day weekend was 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story, and though it's the lowest-grossing Star Wars live-action movie ($213.7 million U.S.-Canada, $392.9M worldwide), the pic opened to $103M over four days stateside, making it the 11th-highest debut for the holiday.


	Jon Favreau, creator of The Mandalorian Disney+ series, directed the big-screen feature. Disney has reversed engineered a few TV properties before for the big screen and succeeded: High School Musical 3: Senior Year in 2008, which opened to $42M and legged out to $90 domestic and close to $253M worldwide; Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert that same year, which debuted to $31M (arguably still highest opening over a Super Bowl weekend) and ended its run at over $65M stateside, $70M global; and 2010's Hanna Montana: The Movie, which bowed to $32.3M and made $79.5M U.S. and $155.5M global. Surely, a Star Wars TV property can do better than all three.

	











	In addition, in the spirit of a 1950s monster movie, we have the first one-sheet for the movie:

It feels like this trailer was released now to distract from the Kimmel drama at ABC and the loss of subscribers for Disney +. There was no reason to release this trailer eight months before release. A trailer for a high profile movie like this is usually released when there are alot of eyes on it,  but that's not the case right now.

Sorry Disney. Not trading free speech for baby Yoda.

looks fun. awesome.

After Andor this is a let down, especially given the current state of affairs.

	Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Ben Affleck, Ben Stiller and Lin-Manuel Miranda are among the more than 400 artists to sign on to an ACLU letter calling out “government threats to our freedom of speech” in the aftermath of ABC‘s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel.


	“Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country,” the open letter states.


	“Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.”

	











	The letter does not name Donald Trump or his FCC chair, Brendan Carr, but they are cited in a website introduction. The letter notes, “We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.”

	“Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country,” the letter states. “We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.”

	











	Others signing the letter include Robert DeNiro, Selena Gomez, Kerry Washington, Jason Bateman, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ariana DeBose, Jane Fonda, Jim Parsons, Joaquin Phoenix, Frances McDormand, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Regina King, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jean Smart, Noah Wyle, Diego Luna, Natalie Portman, Olivia Rodrigo, Martin Short and Ramy Youssef. 


	On his show last Monday, Kimmel said during his monologue, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.”


	That generated furor on the right, with Carr chiming in Wednesday on Benny Johnson's podcast. Carr said, “We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”


	Hours later, station group Nexstar said it was pulling the show from its ABC affiliates “for the foreseeable future.” Soon after, ABC announced the suspension.

Kimmel was going to get canned anyway, they just did it earlier than expected. Where was this furor when Bidens admin treated Facebook lol

Do you REALLY not know the difference between conduct violations and squashing 1st amendment rights?

Having a late night show isn't a 1st amendment right, genius.

“If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.”

Apply it to Kimmel for sure. But if this is ‘the moment', then go back apply to the people who were canned but you stayed silent on.

Reece, where you at?

Embarrassing.

Agreed what the FCC and Trump are trying to do is embarrassing.

					By Glenn Garner 

Associate Editor


	Following his big night at last weekend's 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, where he won Outstanding Scripted Variety Series and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series, John Oliver had his work cut out for him on Sunday's Last Week Tonight.


	The comedian pulled no punches as he called out Nexstar and Sinclair, claiming they had to get Brendan Carr‘s “dick out of their mouth” to carry out the apparent FCC-sanctioned campaign against Jimmy Kimmel.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We were off last week, and a lot happened since our last show,” said Oliver in his monologue before launching into the recap, including Trump's royal visit to the U.K., where protesters projected a photo of the POTUS with Jeffrey Epstein on the side of Windsor Castle.

	











	“That does make me genuinely proud of the country I'm worried I'm gonna be deported to after this show airs,” he continued, “because we're gonna dive straight in with our main story tonight.”


	Catching his audience up on Disney‘s announcement that Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be “preempted indefinitely.” The suspension has been criticized by many as an attack on free speech, following the FCC's warning about his Charlie Kirk comments.


	Oliver slammed Disney CEO Bob Iger, urging him to take a stand against the Trump administration while warning Iger about his legacy. 


	“History is also going to remember the cowards who definitely knew better but still let things happen, whether it was for money, convenience, or just comfort,” Oliver said.


	“Look, at some point you're going to have to draw a line. So I'd argue, why not draw it right here?” he added.

	











	“And when they come to you with stupid, ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could win in court instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use four key words they don't tend to teach you in business school?…And that is, ‘F— you, make me.'”


	As Nexstar attempts to double its size by acquiring competitor Tegna, Oliver explained, “The point is, Nexstar badly needs FCC approval, so it is hardly surprising that when Carr specifically said companies should pull Kimmel off the air or face consequences, it quickly complied.


	“Basically, Brendan Carr said ‘jump,' and Nexstar took his dick out of their mouth for just long enough to say, ‘How high, exactly?'” added Oliver, noting that Sinclair then followed suit, while also pursuing merger options that require FCC approval.


	“The sequence of events here could not be clearer, because it was all done in plain view,” Oliver explained. “Carr leaned on broadcasters to take down Kimmel. They did that, sometimes even directly citing Carr while doing so, and then Carr celebrated with a fun GIF. That sure seems like a pretty clear case of the government pressuring companies to censor speech. And it's not like Trump is even trying to hide it.”


	Oliver then pointed out that he should be safe at HBO as it isn't on broadcast and therefore, “much less susceptible to pressure from the FCC,” adding: “That is obviously very good news for us, and I really don't see why that situation should change anytime soon.”


	The comedian then played clips of news coverage about Paramount‘s potential bid for Warner Bros., launching into an expletive-laden rant.


	Known for his ‘Prove Me Wrong' debates and MAGA POV, activist Kirk was shot dead at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10 in a tragedy that has sent shock through the political and media worlds.


	Having previously mocked Trump over POTUS' take on the NFL and TikTok, Kimmel offered his blunt assessment of the aftermath of Kirk's death in his opening monologue on his Sept. 15 show: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Worlds begin to cross in a compelling (if scattered) Task","https://www.avclub.com/task-recap-season-1-episode-3","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 03:05:00 GMT","

Part of what made Mare Of Easttown such a cultural sensation was that it had a clear central hook: watching Kate Winslet give a transformative, stripped-down performance while her character tried solving a tense whodunnit. But while Task shares the references to Wawa and water ice, it's turning out to be a very different kind of show. Instead of a central mystery, the first episode seemed to be setting up a Heat-style two-hander, in which we're eagerly anticipating the inevitable confrontation between FBI Agent Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo) and burglar Robbie Prendergast (Tom Pelphrey). But though that's definitely the show the poster is selling, these past two episodes have expanded the world of the series in a way that's lost even that hook. 

With the kidnapping twist and the introduction of the Dark Hearts motorcycle gang as major POV characters, Task has now become a sort of amorphous slice-of-Delco-life character study for a dozen major players that's also sometimes a tense FBI action procedural/drug running drama. And while that's not inherently a bad thing, I do think it makes the series a little harder to grab onto at times. Individually, I like pretty much every scene we get in “Nobody's Stronger Than Forgiveness.” But, taken together, I'm not sure they add up to a particularly cohesive episode—even in a “this is one chapter of a seven-hour movie” way. 

Still, given that the writing is strong, the acting is top-notch, the action is tense, and the editing has a compelling dream-like quality to it, I'm not sure how much that really matters either. I don't know how I'd elevator pitch this series to someone who asked me what it's about (family, faith, and the FBI, I guess?). But I felt sucked into most of this week's installment—starting from the opening argument between Robbie and Maeve. As we've heard before, Robbie is obsessed with the idea of death having meaning, even if he has to find it retroactively. And that's leading him down a slippery slope in which he continues to justify worse and worse decisions in the name of finding a solution that makes it all worthwhile. 

I was also really struck by the monologue from Philly drug lord Freddy Frias (Elvis Nolasco), in which he negotiates for a 50-percent cut to help Jayson and Perry find their missing drugs. It seems like an outrageous request at first. (Jayson and Perry offer 25-percent.) But once Freddy recounts a brutal attack he experienced at the hands of some racist bikers and highlights the racism inherent to the Philly drug trade itself, it becomes clear he's negotiating for more than just money. He's reclaiming the power his white rural neighbors would deny him.

If you squint, you could probably say that this whole episode is about power and powerlessness. There are through-lines about sexism and domestic abuse, as well as a beautiful scene where Maeve teaches Sam to swim with a much gentler touch than her own father did. Rather than (literally) throw a kid into the deep end, Maeve empowers Sam by teaching him to float. As she puts it, “That's the thing about getting older. You get to choose what you take from your parents. And what you leave behind.”

It's the same sort of idea Emily is struggling with as she goes to visit her brother Ethan (Andrew Russel) in prison. She's desperately trying to hold her family together even as she knows they can never return to the way things once were. That makes it especially devastating when she overhears her dad tell her older sister that he doesn't want Ethan to return home. A happy flashback to the day Tom and his wife Susan (The Killing's Mireille Enos) welcomed Ethan and Emily into their family underlines just how much was lost in the tragedy. Still, after the Brandis family stuff was a real highlight last week, it feels a little tacked on here, like the show is checking that box instead of truly investing in the emotional drama. 

Instead, the most compelling parts of “Nobody's Stronger Than Forgiveness” hinge on the show's three main worlds (Robbie/Cliff, the FBI task force, and the Dark Hearts motorcycle club) and the question of if/when/how they'll cross paths. Some meetings come sooner than expected. After setting up the mystery last week, this episode fairly casually reveals that the Dark Hearts mole is Eryn (Margarita Levieva), the girlfriend of chapter president Jayson. 

As at least one of you predicted in the comments last week, Eryn had an affair with Robbie's brother Billy and when Jayson found out, he killed him for it. Eryn then teamed up with Robbie and Cliff to help them get revenge, but now each side blames the other for escalating things to murder and kidnapping. Meanwhile, Tom and Grasso openly pay a visit to Jayson in order to float the idea of the FBI and the biker gang working together to rescue Sam and flush out their mole. (The gun that killed Sam's parents was used by a member of the Dark Hearts in a 2017 shootout with their rivals, the Vipers.)

Given how quickly and easily the show's worlds cross paths elsewhere, “Nobody's Stronger Than Forgiveness” pulls a fun fake out as the task force manages to track down the name Cliff Broward from one of Peaches' old co-workers. When the team go to raid Cliff's house, however, they find a woman named Shelley (Mickey Sumner) and her shithead husband Ray (Peter Patrikios) trying to rob the place instead. Earlier in the day, Cliff and Robbie had turned to Ray to help them sell their massive payload of drugs, only for Cliff's old cellmate to double cross them and try to steal the score for himself. It's another one of those twists that almost makes the show feel like a dark comedy. 

The raid itself is tense and thrilling, even if Tom getting pushed down the stairs and then seeing a vision of his dead wife feels, uh, a little on the nose. It also gives each of our newbie task-force members something to process. Thuso Mbedu proves her tremendous acting chops in the interrogation room scene where Aleah connects with Shelley over her own experience with brutal domestic abuse. Meanwhile, Lizzie drunkenly laments her tendency to freeze on the job, which is what got her placed on this task force to begin with. Thankfully, Grasso is there to cheer her up with a sweet toast (and an awkward helping of “not all cops”).

The whole thing serves as a sort of mini case of the week for the FBI half of the show, which helps propel us into next week as Tom and Grasso use Ray to help them lay a trap for Cliff and Robbie. (Everything with Ray's interrogation is also darkly funny.) It's just that when the episode then cuts away to a scene of Perry flirting with bartender Donna to get info on the gang's mole, the impact starts to feel diluted. There are only so many characters we can care about in a seven-episode miniseries that wants to focus more on emotion than plot. And Task could probably benefit from a less-is-more approach in terms of how much it wants to tackle each week.  

At least the end of the episode finds a hook that could propel the series the way the whodunnit angle did for Mare. It turns out that in addition to Eryn leaking Dark Hearts information to Robbie and Cliff, someone in the FBI has been feeding information to the Dark Hearts too. That puts Lizzie, Aleah, and Grasso in the hot seat—although, personally, my money is on Tom's boss Kathleen McGinty. Martha Plimpton feels like a big enough get that you want to do something interesting with her, and we know Kathleen isn't too thrilled with the FBI now that she's being forcibly retired.  

Given how unusually Task has been structured so far, though, it's hard to say whether that mystery will carry us through the rest of the season or whether it's just a hook to take us into next week. Either way, hopefully it'll give the show a slightly stronger narrative spine from which to hang all its many compelling character scenes.

There hasn't been a lot of news out of the Wasteland since Furiosa failed to repeat Mad Max: Fury Road‘s box office success last year. While some believe Furiosa to be a thrilling and expansive follow-up to one of the great action films of our time, it did not ignite the same level of enthusiasm as its predecessor. So it goes. However, over the weekend, the Mad Max Bible, a podcast dedicated to all things Max, reported that director George Miller was working on a Mad Max TV series called The Wasteland. We'll be slipping on our Mad Max-branded, rumor-mill certified leather jacket for this one, which is to say, please, take all this with a big old grain of salt.

Mad Max Bible‘s sources say that the series would be a prequel to Fury Road and see Max building a new Interceptor, while also fending off guest appearances from Chumbucket and Scrotus. There's no word yet on whether Piss Boy will make an appearance, but the podcast notes that Miller will not be directing the series.



The basis for The Wasteland comes from a few places within Fury Road and Furiosa‘s 25-year incubation process. First, as Miller has said numerous times, both films were written along with another script for a video game called The Wasteland, which would expand the mythology present in Fury Road and Furiosa. The Wasteland was eventually abandoned and later turned into the 2015 Mad Max video game. However, Miller, ever the perfectionist, was unhappy with the finished product and took his name off the game before release. Nevertheless, when The Wasteland game fell apart the first time, it became an unreleased novella written by Fury Road co-writer Nico Lathouris and later a movie script, which is now, allegedly, being retrofitted into an HBO Max series. The script includes characters hinted at but never fleshed out in the films and explains those flashbacks at the start of Fury Road. Though, as Mad Max Bible points out, Miller has been trying to get a Mad Max TV show off the ground since the late '80s. The ten-minute report is a short but guzzaline-fueled drive down memory lane and a much-needed oasis in our current Mad Max desert.

Last year, Miller said that he hoped to make a sixth Mad Max movie, entitled Mad Max: The Wasteland, but it depended on a healthy Furiosa box office to get the green light. When Furiosa fell apart at the box office, it seemed unlikely that we'd ever see Scrotus again. Perhaps we shall ride eternal on the Wasteland with him once more.

The opportunity to reprise his iconic lead role from “Dawson's Creek” at a long-awaited cancer benefit live show in New York City was significant to James Van Der Beek, who is currently battling cancer himself. 

Unfortunately, illness has prevented the actor from performing. His understudy? A-Lister and 3-time Tony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Van Der Beek shared this news on his Instagram the evening of Sunday, September 21. The reunion is set to take place on Monday, September 22.  

A post shared by James Van Der Beek (@vanderjames)

The “Dancing with the Stars” alum admitted that two stomach viruses have left him bedridden in Austin, Texas, keeping him from joining his castmates and fans at the benefit performance.

Van Der Beek expressed his deep dismay at missing the opportunity to thank friends, family, and fans for showing up for him and other cancer survivors when he needed it most. Still, the beloved actor reassured supporters that the show would go on, with an “overqualified understudy” filling in for him.

“Can't believe I just got to type that,” Van der Beek wrote.

The 90s star admitted Miranda would have been #1 on his wishlist for the iconic role of Dawson had he not thought himself available.

“[He's] someone my kids would definitely consider an upgrade over me,” Van der Beek wrote. “Plus, he already knows how to get to the theater. So that's convenient.”

Miranda's award-winning musical Hamilton began playing at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on August 6, 2015, and the theatre remains home to the Broadway show.

Van Der Beek's one-night-only charity event will also take place at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. 

The event, titled “The Dawson's Creek Class Reunion,” marks the first time the cast will reunite on stage since the original series wrapped in May of 2003.

According to “Broadway Direct,” show stars including Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, and Busy Phillips will reunite on stage for a live reading of the show's pilot episode to benefit F Cancer and James Van Der Beek.

F Cancer self-describes as a nonprofit organization that focuses on prevention, early detection, and support for those affected by cancer.

Van Der Beek credits his “angel” co-star Michelle Williams with putting the live show together.

After Van Der Beek was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer in August 2023, he publicly encouraged others to get screened for the deadly disease. 

In a recent interview with “USA Today,” the actor disclosed how his cancer diagnosis has been difficult, but has also given him a deeper sense of self-love. 

“Cancer's a wild thing,” he said. “It really does force you to look at your own mortality and decide what's important and decide really what you want to live the rest of your life without.”

What's important to James Van Der Beek is the community and support for cancer research that will inevitably come from this charitable event, now featuring Lin-Manuel Miranda.

“Everyone please enjoy all the love in that room,” the actor wrote. “Shine some on my family. I will be beaming and receiving from afar in a bed in Austin.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Wizard of Oz' Actress Passes Away","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/elaine-merk-binder-wizard-passes-tributes/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 00:10:37 GMT","

Elaine Merk Binder, who played one of the munchkins in “The Wizard of Oz,” has passed away at the age of 94. Notably, she is one of the last surviving actors from the classic film. Now, tributes are pouring in for the actress, who was a part of one of the most iconic films of all time. 

According to Variety, Binder's daughter, Annette Phillips, confirmed the news on September 21. Her cause of death is not mentioned in the report. Regarding her appearance in the film, she can be seen during the performance of “Come Out, Come Out.” She is one of eight dancers in a pavilion. Binder is at the rear in a green dress. She was eight years old in the film. 

Binder once said of appearing in the movie, “I tried out for the ‘Wizard of Oz' Munchkins. For me, it was scary. It was my first big call for girls from a major studio.”

She continued, “I was relieved when Bud told the dance director, ‘She's O.K.' I did not have to perform like the others did. And they selected me as one of the eight who would both dance and sing.”

Binder then said, “We learned later that they had added girls to the Little People because they had the mistaken impression that the Little People were not athletic.”

Binder didn't have a long career in Hollywood as she went on to pursue other endeavors. However, many are paying tribute to her as she is a part of film history. One person on X wrote, “Elaine Merk Binder, among the last surviving Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz, has passed away at 94, leaving behind a cherished legacy in film history.”

Someone else wrote, “A piece of Hollywood history fades away. Elaine Merk Binder reminded us how timeless “The Wizard of Oz” truly is. Rest in peace.”

Another fan of the film said, “Elaine Merk Binder's passing marks the end of an era for “The Wizard of Oz.” At 8, she danced as a Munchkin, bringing joy to millions. Her life extended far beyond: degrees in music, education, and more, plus a tech career. A reminder that even small roles leave lasting magic. Rest in peace.”

Binder had acting experience before “The Wizard of Oz,” as she appeared in the “Our Gang” shorts. In addition to “Oz,” her final film was 1937's “Nothing Sacred,” in which she appeared with Carole Lombard and Frederic March. 

Binder was offered a contract with Paramount, but she declined in order to pursue her education at Occidental College. She later completed a master's degree from Cal State. She later studied computer science and theology and then worked as a computer consultant. Binder will be missed.

Hugh Jackman gave fans an unforgettable and wholesome night on September 20 at Radio City Music Hall when he brought out Pink and her 14-year-old daughter, Willow Sage Hart. The surprise moment, part of his From New York, With Love concert series, filled the iconic venue with joy as the trio shared the stage for heartwarming performances that left the crowd cheering.

A post shared by Hugh Jackman (@thehughjackman)

The 56-year-old actor, who stars in “Deadpool” & “Wolverine”, thrilled the crowd when he introduced Pink as his special guest, calling himself a “massive fan.” But the biggest surprise came when Pink's 14-year-old daughter, Willow Sage Hart, stepped out for her first-ever performance at the legendary venue.

Jackman had teased the appearance weeks earlier in a playful Instagram video. “I've had some amazing guests, but I'm super excited… I think you might have heard of her: Pink is her name,” he joked, hinting at the star-studded moment to come.

Together, the trio delivered a show-stopping performance of “A Million Dreams” from The Greatest Showman and Pink's beloved hit “Who Knew.” Dressed in a striking red ballgown, Willow confidently took center stage, leading the chorus of her mom's 2006 track from I'm Not Dead and earning cheers from the crowd.

Pink later shared clips of the special moment on Instagram, where celebrity vocal coach Eric Vetro praised the teen's talent. “Now THAT'S a talented family! Willow, you really have your mom's magical and powerful vocal cord genes!” he wrote, applauding her budding star power.

A post shared by P!NK FANCLUB (@pink_fanclub)

Before the show, Pink shared a behind-the-scenes video of herself and Willow driving to Radio City. “Hi everybody, we're on our way to Radio City to sing with Hugh Jackman,” Pink said as she asked her daughter if she was nervous. Willow replied, “So scared… It's Radio City!”

Her mom reassured her, saying, “Aw, you're going to do so good.” Later, Pink called the night “unforgettable.”

Fans cheered loudly for Willow during her performance, giving her a warm welcome to the iconic stage. Jackman noted that it was the first time both Pink and Willow had performed at Radio City Music Hall.

The moment added even more excitement to Jackman's From New York, With Love concert series, which began in January and will wrap up with three final shows on October 3 and October 4.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jimmy Kimmel's Sister Thanks Mark Ruffalo for Standing Up for Her Brother","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jimmy-kimmel-sister-thanks-mark-ruffalo/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:10:21 GMT","

Jimmy Kimmel's sister has shown her gratitude to actor Mark Ruffalo for standing up for her brother following ABC‘s suspension of ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!‘ after the host's controversial remarks about Charlie Kirk's passing.

Jill Kimmel, 54, a producer and actress known for her work on ‘TMI Hollywood' and ‘Sunday Night Circus,' responded to a post Ruffalo made on social media in which he suggested the show should not be cancelled.

Taking to his threads profile, where Ruffalo has 3.7 million followers, the star of ‘I Know This Much Is True' responded to a post about Disney's stock dropping 7% since ABC — the flagship property of the Disney Entertainment division of The Walt Disney Company — suspended ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!'

Ruffalo wrote, “It's going to go down a lot further if they cancel his show. Disney does not want to be the ones that broke America.”

The post prompted Jill to respond appreciatively by writing, “You're always on the correct side of history, Mark! Thank you for speaking up!!”

Kimmel's sister wasn't the only one to thank Ruffalo. Another user wrote, “Thank you so much for using your voice & success for the greater good of society.”

Someone else showed their appreciation by replying, “Mark, it's well known that you get pretty large checks from Disney. And yet at the risk of very real personal & financial consequences, you still step up and speak out. THANK YOU.”

That is, of course, a noteworthy fact. Ruffalo is arguably most famous around the world for his portrayal of Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With Marvel Studios being owned by The Walt Disney Company, it's a bold move by the actor to speak out against them.

Ruffalo isn't the only star to speak out against Disney following the suspension of ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' — nor is he the only Marvel Cinematic Universe star to do so. Fellow MCU Hulk Tatiana Maslany — who, of course, plays She-Hulk in the hugely popular franchise — took to her Instagram account to post a story in which she wrote, “Cancel your @disneyplus @hulu @espn subscriptions!”

Moreover, in addition to those thanking him for standing up for Kimmel, several of the users who responded to Ruffalo's Threads post made their thoughts on Disney very clear.

Referencing the boycotting of the retailer following the rolling back of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, one user commented, “Treat Disney like we treated Target.

Another user wrote, “Cancelling now as I text this lol. Stand together.”

Someone else said, “I will miss your Marvel movies but I just can't give them the money. Time to invest in a DVD player again.”

It remains to be seen what will ultimately happen to ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' following its suspension by ABC. However, the company may be forced to think twice about a permanent cancellation of the show if the fan backlash is anything to go by — especially if more stars of Mark Ruffalo's stature speak out against it. Fans of the show will undoubtedly be eagerly awaiting the outcome of the situation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Everything Charlie Hunnam Has Said About Returning for a ‘Sons of Anarchy' Reboot","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/charlie-hunnam-return-jax-teller/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:10:21 GMT","

Few television roles have defined an actor quite like Charlie Hunnam's portrayal of Jax Teller in “Sons of Anarchy.” For seven seasons, the British actor led Kurt Sutter's gritty FX biker drama, transforming from a little-known performer into the face of one of the most popular shows on cable television.

When the series ended in 2014, Hunnam admitted that saying goodbye to Jax wasn't easy. “I felt when I finished ‘Sons' that it was a real process to get back to center, and try to exorcize him out of my psyche for as much as possible. Because I'd been living with him for eight years, you know, trying to bring him to life,” Hunnam told Cinema Blend in 2017 while promoting “King Arthur.”

He described the process as a form of grief. Speaking to Glamour, he revealed he even made excuses to visit the set after filming wrapped.

“I knew the security guards and for a couple of days said, ‘Oh, I forgot something.' So they'd let me onto the set, and I'd just walk around at night because I wanted to be in that environment and go through a personal process of saying goodbye.”

Reflecting in 2020, Hunnam told People that “Sons of Anarchy” gave him confidence in his craft and career. “I think I went into ‘Sons of Anarchy' being a pretty unaccomplished actor in terms of my skill set,” he admitted.

“I wasn't one of these people that were born enormously and innately talented. I had to really cultivate a skill set.”

He compared his seven years on set to a college education.

“I cultivated a lot of my skill set by going to work and shooting 10 pages a day for seven years. Those were my college days. I went in knowing very little about the process of acting and came out knowing a little bit more.”

But as much as the series gave to him, Hunnam consistently said there was one thing he would never do—return to Jax.

For years, Hunnam was adamant that Jax Teller's story was over. In the same People interview, he was direct about fans constantly asking him about reprising the role.

“I would never, ever put that cut back on,” he said. He wouldn't even wear the character's rings for Halloween.

“It was a very deep experience,” Hunnam explained. “I lived with that character inside me for years, in a very real way. In a way that manifested in ways that I could never even [have] imagined. When he died, he died.”

That meant no cameo on the FX spinoff “Mayans MC,” either. In 2018, he told Entertainment Tonight that he wouldn't consider it.

“I had become that character, had become so deeply integrated into who I was, I literally didn't realize until the day we wrapped and we put him to rest … I went through a period of two or three weeks of, like, real bereavement.”

Now, though, Hunnam seems to be softening his stance. In 2023, during an interview with Access Hollywood, he hinted that he was considering a return to the role that defined his career.

“Since you asked, I have an idea that I'm exploring in its infancy where [Jax's return] could be a possibility,” Hunnam said. “It would be something that I would be incredibly excited about, so we're sort of, like I said, in the infancy of exploring the viability of the idea. But next time I talk to you, hopefully I'll have more information on that.”

All seven seasons of “Sons of Anarchy” are currently streaming on Hulu. 

Charlie Hunnam will next appear in “Monster: The Ed Gein Story,” premiering October 3, 2025, on Netflix.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tom Holland Steps Away From ‘Spider-Man' Filming After Suffering an Injury","https://entertainmentnow.com/marvel-studios-movies-comics/tom-holland-injured-spider-man/","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 02:48:45 GMT","

Tom Holland was injured on the set of “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” on Friday, requiring him to take a break from filming.

On Sunday, September 21, 2025, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed Holland suffered a concussion while on the set of the new “Spider-Man” movie. Luckily, the concussion is mild and no one else has been injured. According to The Sun, Holland acquired the injury during a botched stunt for the film.

“Spider-Man: Brand New Day” is the fourth movie in the “Spider-Man” franchise. The film is set to release in 2026, according to Rotten Tomatoes. The previous film, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” came out in 2021 and starred Holland alongside his fiancée Zendaya, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire, and Marisa Tomei.

“Spider-Man: No Way Home” was Sony Pictures Entertainment's highest-grossing film, according to The Numbers. “Spider-Man: Far From Home” is Sony's second highest-grossing movie. That is to say the “Spider-Man” movies are an incredibly important money-maker for Sony.

“Spider-Man: Brand New Day” will star Holland once again as the titular character. Zendaya will join her fiancé in the role of MJ. “Stranger Things's” Sadie Sink will be joining the franchise for the first time. Mark Ruffalo will reprise his role as Bruce Banner.

This fourth “Spider-Man” movie will introduce a new director to the franchise, although he's familiar to the MCU. Destin Daniel Cretton, who previously directed “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” has taken on the important role.

According to Deadline, filming began in Scotland in August. Holland previously shared his excitement to begin filming, saying, “Now, we're really gonna lean into that old-school filmmaking and shoot in real locations, which is why we're starting in Glasgow and we're gonna use the streets of Glasgow to build this massive set-piece that we're putting together.”

However, the film is not exclusively being shot in Glasgow. There's also a London set, which Holland and Zendaya were spotted at in August, according to People.

Due to his injury, Holland must take a break from filming. The exact length of that break is undetermined at this point. Tomorrow, Sony employees will meet to discuss adjusting the filming schedule. However, Holland is expected to return to filming at some point.

Despite his concussion, Elle reported that Holland and Zendaya attended the Brother's Trust gala in London on Saturday, September 20. The trust was founded by Holland's parents in 2017 to raise money for charitable causes.

The gala included a trivia component, which Holland hosted. There were prizes, including playing golf with the “Uncharted” actor. Jacob Batalon, another “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” actor, attended the gala as well.

Hopefully, Holland makes a full recovery soon and is able to return to both work and his personal life.

The American Civil Liberties Union has released an open letter this morning signed by 400 Hollywood celebrities expressing their dismay at Disney pulling “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off ABC. The letter notes how essential free speech is for the U.S. film and TV industry to engage in its business at all, while acknowledging that “this moment is bigger than us and our industry.” 

Tom Hanks, Lily Wachowski, Regina King, Ben Stiller, and Meryl Streep were among those, also including music stars such as Olivia Rodrigo, who signed.

The letter does, however, stop short of suggesting any further action that those who care about Kimmel's silencing — a move that outright required Disney to act against its own business interests to appease the Trump administration — and doesn't even call for a boycott of Disney or for subscribers to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions, which Tatiana Maslany, star of the Disney+ series “She-Hulk,” did advocate for on social media.

It also falls short of the extraordinary open letter for Deadline from Emmy-winning “Andor” writer Dan Gilroy, who at least acknowledged the extraordinarily difficult position the Trump administration put Disney: “Disney suspended Jimmy Kimmel for speaking his mind,” Gilroy wrote. “I deeply disagree but acknowledge it was a difficult decision. If you believe otherwise, wait until fate knocks on your door and demands you choose between conscience and hardship — because if you work in this industry that day is coming.”

 










Read the full letter, posted on the ACLU‘s site, below. And see afterward for the full list of those who signed:

We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech. Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.

Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.

We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.

Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.
 










This is the moment to defend free speech across our nation. We encourage all Americans to join us, along with the ACLU, in the fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights.

The little green guy is back.

The “Star Wars” alien who launched a million gifs, Grogu, a.ka. “Baby Yoda,” is back in the first teaser for Jon Favreau‘s “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” hitting theaters May 22, 2026. Watch it below.

This'll be a big moment for Lucasfilm, as it'll be the first “Star Wars” theatrical release in six and a half years… and a big test for the staying power of its Disney+ streaming series. Will “The Mandalorian,” which streamed for two beloved, and one less beloved, seasons on the service that it helped launch successfully translate to the big screen?

 










A kind of “Star Wars” version of “Lone Wolf and Cub,” with the title character warrior (Pedro Pascal) taking in an infant from the same species as Yoda and eventually adopting him as his own, “The Mandalorian” was launch content for Disney+ in 2019 and created by this movie's helmer, Jon Favreau. It's been a pioneering series in many respects, especially for its breakthrough use of an LED Volume for creating realistic backgrounds on-set while actors are shooting as opposed to compositing in visual effects later. The tech has been adopted by many other series, including the whole suite of “Star Trek” shows on Paramount+.

“The Mandalorian and Grogu” looks very faithful to the series, with the two characters wandering the galaxy and getting into adventures. If anything it may be a reset to the series' status quo: Mando's ship, the Razor Crest, was destroyed in Season 2, and yet here it is in the teaser seemingly restored to life. The Anzellans (like Babu Frik!), little mechanically-inclined aliens no bigger than Grogu who resented his hugs (“Bad baby! No squeezee!”) in Season 3, are back as well.

New this time around, though, is Sigourney Weaver as a New Republic military official. Given her jacket, it looks like she might be a starfighter pilot, but time will tell. It seems that our dynamic duo will run afoul of the ongoing conflict between the New Republic (what the Rebel alliance has turned into at this period five-plus years after “Return of the Jedi”) and the Imperial Remnant, which we know in the “Ahsoka” series is building toward a big conflict with Lars Mikkelsen's baddie Grand Admiral Thrawn.

And also, we get a glimpse for the first time of a musclebound Hutt here, apparently leading his own version of galaxy far, far away UFC octagon, that has been widely reported to be voiced by Jeremy Allen White. From “The Iron Claw” to the Hutt clan.

Watch the teaser for “The Mandalorian and Grogu,” in theaters May 22, 2026, below.

In “Him,” the latest horror film from Jordan Peele‘s Monkeypaw Productions, promising quarterback Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers) gets a second chance at a career after a deranged fan injures and sidelines him. The catch: He can't tell if his new mentor's unorthodox training methods are intended to help him, kill him, or serve some other kind of insidious purpose that is impossible to discern.

As Cameron embarks on a nightmarish training regimen under the guidance of fading pro legend Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), he finds his grip on reality quickly slipping away; he also is forced to undergo a series of tests that seem increasingly dangerous and designed to cause him lasting physical and psychic damage.

Ultimately, “Him” takes the idea that greatness in sports requires immense personal sacrifice and runs with it, asking the question of what that really means when there are no limits to what one is willing to sacrifice — or to what others are going to expect of someone whose talent can be marketed, sold, and profited from. 

 










For director and co-writer Justin Tipping, the key to expressing Cameron's mental and physical disintegration was finding a visual language that combined two very different worlds. “ It was about sitting down and trying to find the sweet spot within the Venn diagram of sports and horror,” Tipping told IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “There was a lot of trial and error, because to serve both is sometimes impossible.”

Often Tipping found himself leaning into the horror in terms of the visuals while the narrative beat was connected to sports, or vice versa. “It was a daunting but fun and exciting exercise,” Tipping said. “The classic set-up for sports drama is diametrically opposed to the set-up for the kind of horror we were leaning into.” 

Tipping had two sets of visual references for the film, looking to movies by directors like Alejandro Jodorowsky (“The Holy Mountain”), Stanley Kubrick (“The Shining”), and Adrian Lyne (“Jacob's Ladder”) for inspiration while also riffing on Nike ads and televised sporting events. “And just anything Lynchian because of that uncanny valley of behavior that's neither here nor there, but it's close enough to reality that you buy it,” Tipping said. 

Tipping created a graph for himself and his department heads that charted the characters' descents into madness and their shifting power relationships, and this was used to create a visual arc in which the visual style would evolve to reflect the nightmarish horror rising to the surface and taking over the world as we recognize it. “In the first act we're leaning into an ESPN '30 for 30′ feel,” Tipping said, though he noted that right from the beginning there are touches to let the audience know that something isn't right.

 










“There are little subliminal choices working for us in the horror sense, like the fireplace on behind a little kid,” Tipping said. “There's no reason why it should be on. It's daytime.” In the film's early passages, Tipping also puts the audience on edge by contrasting two editing styles, moving between rapidly cut sports montages like something out of a Gatorade ad and static, voyeuristic frames influenced by Michael Haneke and early Yorgos Lanthimos films like “Dogtooth.” 

When Cameron arrives at Isaiah's compound, it marks a shift in the narrative that Tipping underlines with visual metaphors for descent. “The shot of him going down the escalator is like the first gate of hell,” Tipping said, adding that he told his department heads, “We're going to treat him like a piece of meat going down a conveyor belt.” 

While the production design by Jordan Ferrer and the lighting from cinematographer Kira Kelly are designed to create a steadily increasing sense of unease, Tipping also wanted to be sure that the world Cameron enters wasn't too forbidding. “We shot it to be sexy so that it was nice to be there,” Tipping said. “It needed to be hypnotic so that the audience would get seduced just like our character.”

The design of Isaiah's lair is filled with subliminal details that let the audience know Cameron can't escape — even before we know he should want to. The angles of the rooms are all curved, and there's a circular quality to the sets that gives the impression that nothing leads anywhere. “That's where the choice for curvature came into play,” Tipping said. “For a lot of those scenes we could only build half the hallway, but I knew that we could shoot with French overs and he could just keep walking forever.”

 










Tipping takes the notion of a spiral in football and runs with it, creating some of the film's most hallucinatory effects in the process. “ We leaned into the idea of madness spiraling, and it's just a never ending loop,” Tipping said. In order to make it feel like time has no meaning in Isaiah's compound, Tipping made sure there were no clocks, and that if there were dates they were conveyed via Roman numerals to maintain the sense of surrealism.

That said, Tipping always wanted to keep the film rooted in the real world — even if it was only a matter of a few mundane details. “[Isaiah's compound] is the structure where he lives, so we needed to make it feel a bit homey, even though it's so weird,” Tipping said. “How do we make it feel everyday, even though it's not? So I just put Amazon boxes next to the door.”

Calibrating the movie's unusual tone and its balance between nightmare and reality was extremely tricky, as was figuring out how much information to disseminate to the audience; give them too much and the dreamlike quality of the film would collapse, give them too little and the response could be anger and confusion. Tipping says the movie went through an arduous testing process to fine-tune the tone, and that finding the right note for the movie's chilling ending was particularly challenging.

 










“The calibration was so specific,” Tipping said. “One or two too many jokes from Tim Heidecker [who plays Cameron's agent] threw it all off, and one or two too many beats of violence slowed it down.” Tipping credits Peele and co-producer Ian Cooper with helping him find the balance, and with protecting the film so that he could conduct such radical experiments in a studio-financed production.

“Something like this probably doesn't exist without a Jordan Peele behind it,” Tipping said. “Because Jordan had my back, I was able to get away with a lot.”

Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson‘s knack for casting is one of his (many) strong suits as a creator. From recognizing the dramatic brilliance of someone like Adam Sandler, consistently finding new dimensions of repeat stars like Julianne Moore and John C. Reilly, and discovering brand-new stars like Alana Haim, PTA has one hell of an eye for star power (and all credit to his long-running partnership with casting director Cassandra Kulukundis, who has cast nine of 10 ten films).

For his latest, “One Battle After Another,” PTA again assembles an enviable cast: Oscar winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro, and continuing collaborator Sean Penn, plus Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall making their PTA debut, and breakout star Chase Infiniti. The film is Infiniti's first — TV fans have already been treated to her work in “Presumed Innocent,” and she will next lead the “Handmaid's Tale” spin-off series “The Testaments” — and it's a hell of a debut for the actress.

As IndieWire's own David Ehrlich noted in his glowing review of the film, Infiniti is “magnetically self-possessed” and an “instant movie star.” (Having seen the film yesterday: when he's right, he's right.)

 










After a special screening of the film in VistaVision held in New York City on Sunday afternoon, DiCaprio, Taylor, Infiniti, del Toro, Hall, and Penn stuck around to chat about the feature in a wide-ranging Q&A. In the film, Infiniti plays the daughter of DiCaprio (as the bomber Ghetto Pat, who eventually goes undercover as “Bob Ferguson”) and Taylor (as the revolutionary leader Perfidia Beverly Hills). DiCaprio shares plenty of screen time with the young star and was eager to talk about her performance, both on and off the screen.

“It was beautiful to watch Chase come into an ecosystem like this, because I remember my first feature-length film and trusting so much in the director, the director is literally everything to you, and that bond started immediately with the two of them,” DiCaprio said.

DiCaprio's first role was — and this is true! — in the direct-to-video sequel “Critters 3,” but he quickly followed that up with roles in two still-signature films for him: “This Boy's Life” (directed by Michael Caton-Jones) and “What's Eating Gilbert Grape” (directed by Lasse Hallström). And it seems that the actor still keenly remembers what it was like on those early sets. 

“Benicio likes to say it was like watching a great boxer with the boxing coach, and they gave each other small signals and nods, and yeses and nos,” DiCaprio continued. “And they continued on. They had this sort of unspoken relationship that was beautiful to witness. It reminded me of when I was younger and my first film.”

 










Asked about her experience, Infiniti was quick to note the support she received from everyone, which engendered a level of trust that seems common on a PTA set.

“I think that the strongest thing that I felt was just love from everybody,” she said. “From Leo and Teyana and Sean and Regina and Benicio, not to mention Paul, I was just surrounded by so much love and support from day one. … Having that, and an overall understanding of trust, and knowing that Paul trusts me, I trust Paul, and then I trust every single one of my scene partners, I think that the love and the trust more than anything made me feel confident to play and thrive in the environment. It was a bit scary walking into, but in the end, it was the best experience.”

Warner Bros. will release “One Battle After Another” in theaters on Friday, September 26.

Home is not just a point on a map. In the music of Joan Shelley, it's often embodied by the people who make up a place. For a long time, Shelley's musical (and literal) home was Louisville, where she was born and raised, where she absorbed so much of the folk music that still inspires her, where she caught her first glimpse of musical community, and where she has collaborated regularly with local players and artists. In the years between 2022's The Spur and last year's Mood Ring, however, the woman who once daydreamed about spending humanity's final moments in her beloved Kentucky, “holding my dear friends and drinking wine,” relocated much further north, to small-town Michigan, with her partner Nathan Salsburg and their daughter.

Throughout her career, Shelley has brought that conception of home wherever she's gone, whether to End of an Ear Studio in Louisville, where she recorded songs for Mood Ring, or to Wilco's Loft in Chicago, where she made 2017's Joan Shelley with two generations of Tweedys. Most recently, she brought it to Toronto, where she fell in with a crew of local musicians to record her sixth album, Real Warmth. Working closely with Ben Whiteley, who plays bass for the Weather Station and Jake Xerxes Fussell and who produced the new record, Shelley and this community of artists devise musical palettes that help bring out new rhythmic elements in her music.

Her collaborators make their presence known immediately. On opener “Here in the High and Low,” they lend a fresh counterpoint to her lilting melodies, the electric guitars and spry percussion churning up an assertive energy. It's an invocation, meant to welcome and rouse you. There have always been jazzier undercurrents running through Shelley's music, but here they come to the forefront, especially when Karen Ng's saxophone flutters around the edges of “On the Gold and Silver.” Real Warmth indulges more instrumental passages, like the coda of “Field Guide to Wild Life,” although sometimes her fellow musicians crowd out the deft picking that has always been a hallmark of her albums.

Generally, these Canadians help chase down Shelley's idea of home as something to protect, as a place full of people whose pain she would readily bear for them. “God, if I could guard you, take your fire, then burn me now,” she sings on “Everybody”; she might be addressing her partner or their daughter, or her band, or anyone listening to the song. Whiteley and their crew—which includes Weather Station singer Tamara Lindeman, Doug Paisley, Salsburg, and Shelley's daughter—make her songs sound a little less solitary. In turn, she invites the listener into the music: “Join in the song, join in the band,” she sings on “Here in the High and Low.”

These songs are full of the kind of quiet ruminations found in so much of her music, but they also offer more pointed declarations of support and outrage. Real Warmth includes what may be her angriest song, “The Orchard,” a protest anthem full of violence and carnage that evokes any number of contemporary crises: Gaza, or Ukraine, or Annunciation Catholic School. “A child like mine was orphaned by design, a gruesome plan,” she sings, her voice resolute and hardened. It must be the bleakest line she's ever penned: an admission that some people can cause suffering without care or concern. Shelley's indignation and confusion lend a different kind of immediacy to this album, a higher set of stakes—as though we're hearing someone sing at the frayed edges of her patience.

Shelley has described Real Warmth as a salve against the horrors of the world, which hardly distinguishes it from her previous albums: She has always offered up her songs as balms against despair, which made 2019's Like the River Loves the Sea such a reassuring album during the pandemic. But in these new songs, she considers what she wants out of making music in the first place. “I've been waiting for a sound to take me out of my meanness,” she sings on “Everybody,” a relatable sentiment for anyone who has checked the news in the last, say, hour. Shelley sounds emboldened by this new crew of Canadian collaborators, especially on “New Anthem,” one of her most declarative songs. “I want the anthem that feels like first love,” she sings, as though reciting a list of demands. “I want the chorus that warms like fire.” Real Warmth makes it easy to believe that music can be that lifeline out of the darkness, or at least a roadmap to home.

Rian Treanor's style of electronic music is daunting. The sounds are microscopic and synthetic, either glowing like LEDs or gleaming like cold steel, but they leave sizzling craters on impact. Melody and rhythm merge into a rapid-fire spray that makes a mockery of musical modes and scales even while he works within them, thanks to Max/MSP devices that the English artist designs himself. It can feel solitary, almost maddening—the work of an artist obsessively trying to one-up himself. Which makes it surprising that his collaborations are actually some of his best work, whether he's playing with a Ugandan fiddle player or his father, experimental electronic luminary Mark Fell. It's hard to imagine another artist entering his impenetrable world, but those pairings push his sound, whether to new extremes of melody or new realms of weirdness.

Treanor's latest partnership, with Scottish singer and academic Cara Tolmie, began with a live performance in 2023 at Counterflows Festival in Glasgow. It culminates with this album, recorded a year later in Stockholm. Treanor's stickiest and most bracing record yet, Body Lapse lodges in the mind even as it scrambles it. Tolmie's style of “internal singing”—grunts, vocal squeaks, sharp breaths, wails—is consumed by Treanor's programmatic methods, and becomes part of the fabric of his music, occasionally bursting out in jagged shards. There's a cliché about man versus machine in here somewhere, but Treanor has met his match in Tolmie, who can muster up otherworldly sounds from her diaphragm to spar with Treanor's sharpest notes. His rhythms range from dancehall-style syncopation to empty space and low-end rumbling more befitting a psychological thriller.

And, at its best, Body Lapse is truly thrilling. Opener “As the Unified Field Bursts” cuts up Tolmie's voice into chipmunk squeaks, the kind that defined a whole era of post-dubstep, then turns them into machine-gun fire over scorched earth. If ever there was an opener meant to scare squeamish listeners away, this is it. There are moments of eerie silence and grumbling bass that leave room for keening vocals, like on “Sleep Guessings,” whose jarring silent-loud dynamics remind me of Tilt-era Scott Walker, though not quite as terrifying. The eerie “My Little Loophhole” balances saccharine melodies with jackhammer percussion, sounding a bit like SOPHIE's evil twin, hell-bent on destruction.

But Body Lapse's volatility can start to wear. “My Little Loophole” dissipates into a mist that undercuts its power, and the album's sequencing sags in the middle. The otherwise approachable centerpiece “Ereh Am I,” which features some truly gorgeous, harp-like work from Treanor, goes on for over eight minutes. It's a canny fusion of Dry Cleaning and “Bob Dylan's 115th Dream,” impishly calling out Treanor by name, but it starts to feel like a narrative in search of a purpose halfway through.

The wonderfully titled “Incongruous Diva,” a true mind-meld between Treanor and Tolmie, embodies the power of the rest of the LP. Here Tolmie sounds discombobulated, angry at her inability to get words out. It comes to a head with a guttural, spittle-flecked utterance of the word “fucking,” a fucking to end all fuckings, as if it were expelled involuntarily. “Incongruous Diva” underlines the depth of her internal singing as Treanor's broken rhythm heaves underneath. But it's also hard to listen to, as shocking and uncomfortable as touching a raw nerve.

Body Lapse's irritable mood swings and gauntlet-like progression can occasionally make it feel more like a live set awkwardly forced into the shape of an album. It's a remarkable entry in an already stunning catalogue, but maybe one you're less likely to revisit than more varied records like File Under UK Metaplasm or Saccades. With Body Lapse, Treanor has succeeded in one-upping himself with the musical equivalent of an uppercut, a fist fused out of wires and sinewy muscle. It's about as painful, but also as badass, as that sounds.

Let me let Verses GT introduce themselves. Longtime collaborators Jacques Greene (Philippe Aubin-Dionne) and Nosaj Thing (Jason Chung) are officially stepping out as a duo with a self-titled album centered on collaboration. “Trust is the key word and concept around this project,” says Aubin-Dionne. Verses GT isn't just an album, it seems, but an immersive audiovisual experience (live shows, music videos, light displays—“an all encompassing banner for a new collaborative world,” trumpets their Bandcamp) painstakingly crafted across a bevy of glamorous metropolises in hot pursuit of that elusive little thing called vibe. It's a risky proposition: A concept like this can feel a little overwrought, a little too “creative”-as-noun, a little for sale, Wales Bonner Sambas, never worn. But Aubin-Dionne and Chung are gifted producers with extensive histories of creating banger after banger, and it's no surprise that the music ultimately speaks for itself, album rollout be damned. Verses GT focuses their chameleonic, collaborative impulses, utilizing guest features and the duo's signature R&B influences to gratifyingly moody effect.

As solo artists, Jacques Greene and Nosaj Thing have spanned their own respectively wide sonic ranges: the former often flipping '90s R&B samples into glimmering, levitate-off-the-dancefloor tracks, the latter incorporating features from indie stalwarts like Julianna Barwick and Panda Bear into unusually sensuous, synthy mixdowns and producing for Chance the Rapper and Blonde Redhead. Together, though, the duo's vision shines pretty singularly: Verses GT compresses the center of their Venn diagram to a fine point, layering UKG-esque breakbeats over a relatively subdued palette of synths that throb with a mixture of anxiety and hope.

Verses GT doesn't just succeed in pinpointing a specific feeling: The whole album pulses with a mutable, introspective quality that brings palpable life to even the most stripped-back arrangements. Album standout “Left” is a triumph in steamy subtlety, with a few well-timed gasps and dreamy piano riffs cutting through to give us glimpses through the fog. And the stark choral ambience of opener “Fragment” ramps up the tension before giving way to the distant horns and breakbeats of “Unknown,” which skitters along at a very Burial-esque frequency (if perhaps in a timeline where Burial shook more ass).

Both Aubin-Dionne and Chung are typically adept at tempering vocals to each song's vision, which they really flex on the soft grooves of “Your Light” (feat. George Riley) and the trip-hoppy “Angels” (feat. TYSON), melding their voices as languidly into their respective tracks as ever. It's jarring, then, to hear the stridence of “Forever” (feat. KUČKA), particularly when sandwiched between the breezily distorted “Wan” and the six-minute “Found”—which, for what it's worth, does such an excellent job incorporating a harsh breakbeat into soft synth melodies that it never feels a second too long. “Forever” could feasibly have worked as a neon-drenched standalone in the vein of tracks like Jacques Greene's 2023 strobelight-conjuring tech-house anthem “Believe,” but within the hyperspecific context of Verses GT, it just feels like they turned all the lights on mid-show, to party-foul effect.

Ultimately, Verses GT finds its footing again as “Angels” fades out into the ethereal “Vision + Television,” where haunting strings and synth melodies circle vulture-like over sawtoothy basslines that seem to writhe in place. It's a fittingly bleary-eyed end to an album that's more Eyes Wide Shut than Project X, a club jaunt that invites us, maybe a little too eagerly, to stick around and get comfortable: lean into the blurriness, acclimate to the thickness in the air. But there's no need for self-consciousness or over-explanation. Aubin-Dionne and Chung don't need to tell us how to move; Verses GT compels us to.

							By 

	Jon Blistein



Howard Stern called ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel “really dumb and fucking horrible,” and said he's cancelling his Disney+ subscription in protest.


	Stern, who was off last week, addressed the still-simmering controversy when he returned to his SiriusXM show Monday, Sept. 22, saying, “When the government says, ‘I'm not pleased with you, so we're going to orchestrate a way to silence you,' it's the wrong direction for our country. It Isn't good” (via Billboard and USA Today).


Jimmy Kimmel Live is still off the air after being pulled “indefinitely” last Wednesday following an uproar from conservatives over a joke Kimmel made about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk. Trump's Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, had called on licensed broadcasters to stop airing the show, and not long after, Nexstar and Sinclair — which own myriad ABC affiliates around the country — announced that they would preempt his program. ABC made its decision to pull the show soon after.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“You can't support this kind of a move,” Stern said of Kimmel's suspension. “I don't care whether you like Jimmy or not. It's about freedom of speech. If ABC wanted to fire Jimmy because they didn't like him, or he had low ratings — they didn't want to fire him. They're being pressured by the United States government. We can't have that, not if we're going to have a democracy.”


	Stern said the situation was especially “painful” because he's a longtime friend of Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney. “I believe Jimmy is such a big talent, and quite frankly, so is his wife,” Stern said. “They're two of the funniest people I have ever met.”

	











	The host also noted his own battles with the FCC during the early Nineties. At that time, the agency went after Stern over material they deemed indecent, as opposed to anything overtly political, though there are some echoes with the current situation. For instance, the FCC not only fined Stern's former parent company, Infinity Broadcasting, millions over the content of his shows, but threatened to revoke its broadcasting license, and even held up its acquisition of three radio stations. (The sale ultimately went through.) Nexstar, the first company to say it would preempt Kimmel, is currently seeking to pull off a $6.2 billion merger with Tegna, which will require the FCC's approval.

Tom Holland was injured on the set of Spider-Man: Brand New Day on Friday, Rolling Stone has confirmed.


	The actor suffered a mild concussion and will take a break from filming for the next few days out of an abundance of caution. Details surrounding Holland's accident remain unknown. Nobody else was injured during the incident, and production will continue.


	Holland stepped out on Saturday to host a Posh Pub Quiz event with The Brothers Trust, the charity he runs with his three brothers: Sam, Harry, and Paddy Holland. He was photographed alongside his fiancée and Spider-Man costar Zendaya at the event, which was held at Christie's auction house in London.


	A rep for Holland did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.


Spider-Man: Brand New Day, the fourth film in the franchise, is due in theaters on July 31, 2026. While Jon Watts directed Holland in the previous three Spider-Man films, the new installment sees Destin Daniel Cretton in the director's chair.

	“It's day one, my fourth ever day one on Spider-Man. It's funny, putting the suit on, it feels different this time, somehow. It's also the first time we ever had fans on set day one, so it's really exciting to share this with them,” Holland said in the video. “We've got some familiar faces on set. I'm just going to do my best, hopefully get it right, no pressure.”

Travis Kelce got a monetary slap on the wrist for unsportsmanlike conduct after making an “obscene gesture” at a recent game. 


	Kelce was fined $14,491 after gesturing to his groin as a taunt to the opposing team following a play during Sunday, Sept. 14's game against the Philadelphia Eagles at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, NBC Sports reports.


	After making a 23-yard reception, Kelce could be seen making the gesture while running down the Philadelphia sideline. Video of the moment quickly spread across social media. Should he choose to do so, Kelce can appeal the fine through an official process.

The NFL fined #Chiefs TE Travis Kelce $14,491 for unsportsmanlike conduct/obscene gestures last week. The gesture was … well, you can figure it out. pic.twitter.com/l7ZcuQ6RYJ


	During the same game, Kelce was caught telling his teammates, “I'm sick of this shit” before the broadcast went to break.


	But Kelce wasn't the only Chiefs player to get hit with a fine during the game. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley was fined $46,371 for “impermissible use of the helmet/launching” when he appeared to intentionally lower his helmet before colliding with Chiefs safety Chamarri Conner.

	The Chiefs lost the game in a 20-17 defeat. The loss was in part attributed to a mistake Kelce made during the game's fourth quarter, when he fumbled a pass, allowing the Eagles to intercept the ball. The Eagles ultimately scored a touchdown off the play.

	Forty years ago, Bob Dylan‘s impromptu comments at Live Aid inspired Willie Nelson, Neil Young, and John Mellencamp to stage the original Farm Aid in Champaign, Illinois. And on Saturday night, Bob Dylan returned to the Farm Aid stage to celebrate the event's 40th anniversary at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota.


	Dylan was added to the lineup just days before the event, and questions swirled about his appearance until the minute he took the stage. Was he going to perform with his regular road band or repeat his 2023 surprise Farm Aid set by playing with 3/5th of the Heartbreakers? Would he hide himself from the audience as he's done at recent Outlaw Music Festival shows or actually take off his hoodie and reveal his face to the crowd? Would he let the screens project his set to the entire stadium or force everyone to squint or break out binoculars? And would he let the livestream share his performance with a global audience online?

	











	He wound up wearing the hoodie, though not pulled as tightly around his face as it has been at recent shows, and he agreed to both the projection screens and the livestream. There weren't closeups, the stage was pretty dark, and much of the stadium audience had a hard time seeing him clearly, but these were major concessions given his history. Very few Never Ending Tour shows have been professionally filmed like this, let alone broadcast on the Internet.


	The set was a truncated version of his Outlaw show featuring “All Along The Watchtower,” Bo Diddley's “I Can Tell,” “To Ramona,” “Highway 61 Revisited” and “Don't Think Twice, It's All Right.” Every single song dates from the Sixties, even the Bo Diddley cover.

	











	Unlike his appearances at Farm Aid in 1985 and 2023, Dylan didn't do the obvious move and play “Maggie's Farm.” Earlier in the night, however, Margo Price performed it with Billy Strings and Jesse Welles.


	Dylan, Billy Strings, Jesse Welles, and Margo Price were part of a stacked Farm Aid bill that also included Kenny Chesney, Waxahatchee, Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats, Steve Earle, Lukas Nelson, and Wynonna Judd in addition to board members Neil Young, John Mellencamp, and Willie Nelson.

	Neil Young came out after Dylan and played a politically-charged set that opened with his anti-Trump screed “Big Crime” before ripping through “Rockin' In The Free World,” “Long Walk Home,” “Be The Rain,” “Southern Man,” “Hey Hey, My My (Into The Black),” and “Old Man.”


	As always, Willie Nelson closed out the show with a set of classics. Nearly every guest from throughout the day came out for “Will the Circle Be Unbroken?” “It's Hard To Be Humble,” and “I'll Fly Away.” Unsurprisingly, Bob Dylan was the lone holdout.

	During an appearance on The Tonight Show, Eric Church reflected on owning Taylor Swift‘s first gold record, which she gave him after replacing him on tour in 2006.


	“My first major arena tour, I was invited to no longer be a part of,” Church told Jimmy Fallon of the Rascal Flatts trek, although he didn't mention the artist by name. “That's all I'm going to say about that one. But when I was no longer invited to be a part of it, it was at Madison Square Garden here. And if you're going to not be invited to be a part of something, that's the place, Jimmy.”


	The following day Church got a call from Swift. “I actually found out about it online, that I had been replaced by this — I think she was 16 — blond-haired [singer]. She had a song called ‘Tim McGraw.' And so she calls. And it actually was great.”


	Swift told Church she hoped there was no bad blood between them and that she loved what he did. “I said, ‘Listen, Taylor, I have seen this crowd. This crowd is going to love you. I love what you do,'” Church recounted. “I said, ‘This is going to really be great for you and you owe me your first gold record when this happens.' Here's what's crazy: It took, like, seven days.”

	











	He recalled being at a music festival “not even 30 days later” when Swift walked on to his tour bus with the gold record for her debut LP. “She walks up and she inscribed it, ‘To Eric, thanks for playing too long and too loud on the tour. Sincerely, Taylor,'” Church said. “You could just tell then. Just an artist. An artist.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Today, the gold record is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. “They don't let me have it,” Church quipped. 


	The country singer also performed on the late-night show, taking the opportunity to showcase his song “Johnny.” The track comes off his most recent LP, Evangeline vs. the Machine, which dropped in May. 


	Earlier this year, Church revealed he was once roped into a Taylor Swift copyright lawsuit after the superstar mentioned his song during a deposition. Back in 2017, Swift was sued by the songwriters behind 3LW's “Playas Gon' Play” for using the lyrics “players gonna play, haters gonna hate” in her hit “Shake It Off.” The lawsuit sparked a years-long legal battle that was ultimately voluntarily dismissed in late 2022. But during her deposition months earlier, Swift claimed she first knew of the lyric from Church's song “The Outsiders.”

And two weeks later, I got served by the people that were suing her!”


	He added, “It's since been settled. But I was like, ‘How did this even happen?'”

	Artists — including Sarah McLachlan and Jewel — scheduled to take the stage at the Los Angeles premiere of the new documentary Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery canceled their performances on Sunday in a move to stand for free speech. The film about the historic Nineties festival is being distributed by ABC New Studio, whose parent company Disney continues to deal with the fallout over its decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel for his comments on Charlie Kirk's death.


	According to The Hollywood Reporter, invitations to the premiere promised “special surprise performances.” Sources revealed to THR that McLachlan and Jewel were set to perform. Puck‘s Matt Belloni also reported that Olivia Rodrigo, who appears in the documentary as well, was meant to be a surprise guest.


	McLachlan introduced the film and confirmed that the performances were canceled due to Kimmel's controversial suspension.

	“It's a gift for all of us to see [this film], but also I've grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with, the stark contraction to the many advances we've made watching the insidious erosion of women's rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech,” McLachlan said. “I think we're all fearful for what comes next, and none of us know, but what I do know is that I have to keep pushing forward as an artist, as a woman to find a way through, and though I don't begin to know what the answer is, I believe we all need to work towards a softening to let in the possibility of a better way, because I see music as a bridge to our shared humanity, to finding common ground.”

	











	She continued: “If Lilith taught me anything, it taught me there is a great strength in coming together to lift each other up instead of tearing each other down. So I really hope this documentary inspires everyone to continue to try and create positive change in your communities, to keep lifting each other up, keep championing the causes you believe in with kindness and empathy because ultimately, we're all in this together.”

	McLachlan joins many artists who have stood in solidarity with Kimmel, show was taken off air after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they wouldn't air his show in the wake of his comments. Many have accused Disney of bowing to pressure from the Trump administration and suppressing freedom of speech. Jimmy Kimmel Live! has been suspended indefinitely.

These final last few days of summer were full of wild conspiracies on social media and local wildfire reports.

On Saturday and Sunday (September 20th and 21st), people from all across the state came to Loveland for the Great Colorado Air Show.

The skies were full of all elite airshow performers and aircrafts like the Red Thunder Airshows, Wings of Blue, and Mini Jet Airshows.

I live in Windsor, so over the course of the weekend I'd hear the planes zooming overhead. My cats started freaking out and running to get a look outside. The noise sounded like it was straight out of some sort of alien movie.

There were a few people online who definitely believed they were seeing a possible UFO.

I was scrolling through various community Facebook groups when the show was going on and I saw several people asking about the noise and if anyone else was seeing these unidentified flying objects.

With the whole airshow-UFO mix-up behind us, Larimer County had a new reason to worry on Sunday: a massive fire.

In a social media statement from the county sheriff's office, an incident in Wyoming early on Sunday morning caused flames so big, they could be seen all the way in Northern Colorado.

It could be seen in parts of Larimer County including Loveland.

Officials made sure to alert Larimer County residents that they were not in any danger.

The incident involved a Union Pacific Railroad train traveling through Laramie County and a ruptured natural gas pipeline, according to reports. The pipeline caught fire near rail cars carrying hazardous materials close to mile marker 350 on Interstate 80.

This fire was seen 60 miles away from the original scene.

Union Pacific representatives confirmed to officials that it was the Kinder Morgan Pipeline and that the train was about 40 feet from the rupture.

Officials did confirm that the fire was under control by 9:00 AM Sunday (September 21) morning.

Luckily no one was injured because of this incident.

Union Pacific Railroad and the National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating the case going forward.

THE HOME OF WATCH CULTURE


As only a casual anime watcher, I must admit that when Tissot announced its collaborative PRX with UFO Robot Grendizer last year, I wasn't sure what to make of it. In Australia, Grendizer isn't a household name – but in Europe, it was extremely popular, being one of the first anime series to make its way to the continent (in particular, its French dub was the first-ever anime series to be telecast in France). And it seems that plenty of watch fans love it, too. MB&F's Max Büsser is a fan, as is Tissot CEO Silvain Dolla, which is probably why the collab happened in the first place, and also probably why it's making an encore to mark Grendizer's 50th anniversary in 2025.



Like the initial Grendizer release, it takes the form of an automatic 40mm PRX, but immediately differentiates itself from 2024's release thanks to its black PVD-coated case and bracelet. Actually, this marks a first for Tissot: just as 2024's Grendizer PRX was the first-ever analogue PRX without a date window, this 2025 model is the first-ever PRX with a blacked-out case and bracelet. (Last year's forged carbon PRX has a similar look, but that only has a rubber strap – this PRX has a black bracelet, too!)



The date-window-less dial returns, this time sporting a slightly different Grendizer graphic: this time, the hulking robot is clenching his fist, like it's about to break through the dial. During the day, the dial appears black (save for Grendizer's eyes, which pierce with a bright yellow gaze), but at night, the outlines of the graphic come to life in Super-LumiNova. Also, like the initial release, the seconds hand is shaped like Grendizer's ‘Double Harken' weapon, and you'll find an inner-bezel engraving at 12 with the name of the anime in Japanese.



Powering this mecha-inspired mechanical watch is the Powermatic 80 movement, which, as the name implies, offers an 80-hour power reserve and is regulated by an anti-magnetic Nivachron balance spring. The movement's rotor is engraved with a Grendizer graphic, too. The watch comes housed in a capsule shaped like Grendizer's ‘Spazer' UFO, which is itself housed within a striking gold and black outer box boasting drawings specially created for this limited edition, created and hand-signed by Grendizer creator Go Nagai.



The Tissot PRX 40mm UFO Robot Grendizer is a limited edition of 1975 individually numbered pieces, in honour of the year Grendizer first aired. Price: US$825

THE United Architects of the Philippines' (UAP) anticipated National Conference of Architects 2025 (NCA2025) will take place on Oct. 23-25 in the culturally rich city of Bacolod. With the theme “SANDAG: Championing Justice to the Architectural Profession,” it is a clarion call to reaffirm the Filipino architect's identity and elevate the public's understanding of the profession's vital role in shaping the nation's built environment.

The term Sandag, a Hiligaynon word meaning “to strengthen, support, or protect,” was conceived by the Organizing Committee led by this author, the UAP NCA2025 director; it serves as the event's philosophical backbone. It encapsulates the spirit of solidarity and resilience that will define the proceedings, as architects from across the archipelago unite to fortify professional advocacy, elevate competence, and reinforce ethical practice.

At the heart of NCA2025 is a groundbreaking initiative led by UAP National President, Ar. Jonathan V. Manalad, PhD, FUAP, PIEP. During the General Assembly, President Manalad will officially launch the Justice to the Profession Initiative, a bold, strategic campaign confronting the long-standing issue of illegal practice in architecture. With an allocated dedicated budget, the UAP is taking decisive legal steps to pursue cases against unauthorized practitioners. It is sending a powerful message that the profession's sanctity will be rightfully recognized and protected, respected, and defended with vigor and resolve.

This administrative initiative is emblematic of a deeper commitment to uphold the dignity of every licensed Filipino architect.

Another conference milestone is the return of Pacific Paint (Boysen) Philippines, standing shoulder-to-shoulder again with Davies Paints Philippines. This renewed partnership, championed by Ar. Mark Louie M. Soriquez, executive director for the Commission on Convention, Assemblies, and Exhibits, marks a significant moment of unity within the industry. Their joint presence will anchor the inaugural UAP Regional Exhibition of Construction and Building Materials (Regionex 2025), a visionary showcase of cutting-edge technologies, sustainable solutions, and regional innovation led by Regionex director, Ar.

Older generations tend to be more amenable to the idea of extraterrestrial life, while younger people are more skeptical, the survey shows

A new survey has found that nearly eight in ten Russians (79%) believe in the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth and many are open to the idea that aliens may already be among us. The poll was conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTSIOM). 

Older respondents were more likely to accept the idea that such beings may already be present on Earth, while younger people expressed greater skepticism. A belief in extraterrestrial life was also slightly more common among men at 83%, versus 76% of women.

Nearly half of those surveyed (46%) believe alien visitors may be secretly observing Earth while concealing their presence from humanity.

When asked how they would feel if it were confirmed that humans are not alone in the universe, 77% said they would be ""curious."" Others reported feeling ""anxiety"" (30%) or ""hope"" (15%).

As for what aliens might do if they arrived on Earth, the majority of respondents said they would likely merely observe rather than invade: 61% think they would simply watch humans, 19% believe they would try to establish friendly relations, and 10% fear they might attempt to seize control of the planet.

Respondents were also asked which books they would recommend to alien guests to help them understand humanity. The most common answer was 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy (15%), followed by the Bible or the Gospels (9%). 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky and '1984' by George Orwell were each chosen by 4%.

The survey included 1,606 Russians aged 18 and older. It was conducted online using a representative sample of participants selected by the research center. The margin of error does not exceed 2.5%, meaning the results are considered accurate within that range 95% of the time, according to VTSIOM.

The beads appear above a swirling hexagonal jet stream at the gas giant's north pole, and could emerge from interactions between its magnetosphere and atmosphere.

The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered strange ""dark beads ""above a four-armed star pattern in Saturn's atmosphere. The surprising structures are unlike anything scientists have seen before, and they're not sure what they are.

The unusual features were discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST's) Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) as it peered into the gas giant's atmosphere above the hexagonal storm that swirls at the planet's north pole.

The astronomers expected to see emissions across broad bands of the infrared spectrum in the atmospheric layers above the vortex. Yet what they noticed instead were dark, bead-like features — separated by vast distances yet possibly interconnected — drifting slowly in the charged plasma of the planet's ionosphere, and a lopsided star-shape structure in the stratosphere beneath. They published their findings Aug. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

""The results came as a complete surprise,"" Tom Stallard, a professor of astronomy at Northumbria University in the U.K., said in a statement. ""These features were completely unexpected and, at present, are completely unexplained.""

 




Saturn's Hexagon was first discovered in 1980 by NASA's Voyager spacecraft and imaged in fine detail by the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited the planet from 2004 to 2017. It rises as an 18,000-mile-wide (29,000 kilometers) six-sided tower whirling above the planet's surface, making a complete rotation roughly once every 10 hours.

Scientists believe that the hexagon is driven by a jet stream circling the planet's pole, and owes its unique shape to the properties of the gases in Saturn's atmosphere. Yet the exact reasons it has this flow and shape aren't known for certain; and neither is the behavior of the upper atmosphere above it, due to the very weak emissions coming from it.

To investigate, the astronomers focused JWST's NIRSpec instrument on Saturn's ionosphere and stratosphere, located 684 miles (1,100 km) and 373 miles (600 km) above the planet's nominal surface, respectively.

Over 10 hours, the telescope tracked positively-charged hydrogen molecules (H3+, involved in many reactions in the planet's atmosphere) across Saturn's ionosphere and methane molecules throughout its ionosphere, revealing the strange structures.

""We think that the dark beads may result from complex interactions between Saturn's magnetosphere and its rotating atmosphere, potentially providing new insights into the energy exchange that drives Saturn's aurora,"" Stallard said.

The asymmetric star pattern, meanwhile, may somehow be tied to the hexagonal storm pattern, he said.

""Tantalisingly, the darkest beads in the ionosphere appear to line up with the strongest star-arm in the stratosphere, but it's not clear at this point whether they are actually linked or whether it's just a coincidence,"" he added.

To understand what could be causing the features, and their effects on Saturn's atmosphere, the team hopes to conduct followup observations with JWST. Saturn is currently at its equinox, meaning the patterns could change drastically as the sun shifts across the planet's face. On Sept. 21, the ringed planet will also be at its closest point to Earth — the best time to observe Saturn with telescopes and to attempt to parse its many mysteries.

The first trailer for The Healing has arrived and it teases a slow-burn supernatural nightmare in the spirit of films like Midsommar. Directed by Denis Kryuchkov, the movie follows Lyuba, played by Alena Mitroshina, who escapes her abusive husband and joins friends at a secluded retreat. 

What starts as a hopeful search for renewal quickly spirals into eerie rituals, strange visions, and a sinister atmosphere that makes you question whether this refuge is a sanctuary or a trap.

The cast also includes Wolfgang Czerny, Vyacheslav Chepurchenko, Ekaterina Solomatina, Victoria Skitskaya, Maxim Khanzhov, and Hermes Zygott. 

The official synopsis reads: “In the vein of cult horror classics like MIDSOMMAR, Lyuba flees her abusive husband for a mysterious retreat with friends. Surreal rituals and haunting visions reveal dark secrets, pushing her to confront a terrifying choice: escape or succumb to a chilling fate.” 

The trailer promises an unsettling journey into psychological terror with striking imagery that suggests The Healing will be one of the year's most unnerving horror experiences.

                Worker argues that the withdrawal of platform access constitutes dismissal
            

The Fair Work Commission (FWC) recently dealt with a case where a psychic reader brought an unfair dismissal application against his alleged employer. 

The case arose when the worker found that his platform access was withdrawn in April 2025, following approximately three and a half years of providing telephone psychic readings through the company's website.

The worker argued he was an employee entitled to unfair dismissal protection, maintaining that his engagement with the psychic services platform created an employment relationship subject to Fair Work Act protections. 

The company contested the application on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that the worker operated as an independent contractor using their platform to provide services directly to customers rather than working under employment arrangements.

The psychic services company operated an online platform where members of the public could select and pay for telephone consultations with various psychic readers advertised on the website.

Customers would choose their preferred reader and be charged on a timed basis for calls, with conversations lasting a maximum of 30 minutes before requiring reconnection through the same payment process.

The worker was introduced to the platform in 2021 through another psychic reader and was already familiar with the website as a viewer before becoming a service provider.

No written contract existed between the parties, with engagement terms established through verbal arrangements and practical operation of the platform access system.

The company provided the worker with website access codes and a silent telephone number that allowed him to identify calls from platform customers.

The only formal requirement imposed was a minimum of three hours logged-in time per week, though this could occur at any time of the worker's choosing, and his actual availability varied considerably, with extended periods of complete absence.

The worker received a proportion of customer payments for actual call time only, not for periods spent logged into the system waiting for calls.

Platform monitoring automatically tracked call duration, with payment rates increasing slightly if the worker maintained eight consecutive hours of availability.

However, this premium structure had minimal practical impact due to irregular usage patterns.

No employment benefits accompanied the payment arrangement; the worker received no annual leave, public holiday pay, or superannuation contributions.

Payments were not subject to taxation withholding, reflecting the platform's treatment of workers as independent service providers rather than employees subject to standard payroll obligations.

The worker's earnings fluctuated dramatically, earning only $25 in the twelve months preceding April 2025 and approximately $1,000 over the entire relationship period.

Payments were made fortnightly when amounts were due, though extended periods without any calls or earnings were common throughout the engagement.

Evidence revealed extremely limited contact between the worker and platform management throughout the three-and-a-half-year relationship, with the company representative describing the arrangement as providing access codes and test calls before leaving workers ""on their own.""

No personal instructions were given regarding how to conduct readings, with the worker exercising complete discretion over advice provided to customers.

The worker generally told clients he was not providing qualified expert advice, though whether this represented company instruction or personal choice remained unclear from available evidence.

Apart from occasional group emails containing general platform information, direct communication between the worker and management was virtually non-existent.

The worker operated from home or any location of his choosing, using his own telephone equipment to receive calls routed through the platform's numbering system.

The company provided only login credentials and call identification numbers, with all other equipment and workspace supplied by the worker independently.

The FWC applied section 15AA of the Fair Work Act, introduced in August 2024, to address High Court decisions that had narrowed employment classifications.

The new provision requires assessment of relationships based on ""real substance, practical reality and true nature"" rather than contractual terms alone, considering both written agreements and practical performance.

This legislative change reversed previous restrictive approaches and returned to multifactorial analysis examining control, independence, equipment provision, payment methods, and business integration.

The Commission noted that a comprehensive assessment must consider the totality of working relationships, including how contracts operate in practice rather than theoretical rights and obligations.

The worker's case was evaluated under established common law principles, examining whether he operated as a servant in another's business or conducted his own independent undertaking.

Factors including work scheduling freedom, payment structure, equipment provision, and supervision levels were weighed to determine the relationship's true character.

The FWC found compelling evidence of independent contractor status through the worker's substantial autonomy over when and how work was performed, minimal platform operator control, and a task-based payment structure.

The worker's ability to determine availability schedules, conduct readings without supervision, and operate concurrent services through other platforms demonstrated independent business operation.

Evidence that the worker provided similar services through Facebook and TikTok during the same period reinforced findings of independent operation rather than exclusive employment commitment.

The minimal earning requirements and absence of ongoing work guarantees contrasted sharply with traditional employment relationships, providing regular hours and predictable income.

While acknowledging that customers might perceive the worker as representing the platform business, the Commission determined that this factor was outweighed by stronger indicators of independent contractor status, including the provision of equipment, payment methods, and operational autonomy throughout the relationship.

Animal psychic Jackie Weaver is renowned for reading pets' minds around the world, and it seems Reach journalist, Vikki White's cat Humphrey has a sixth sense too.

Just five minutes before Jackie arrived at Vikki's home, the normally laid back British Blue Shorthair was on high alert.

Usually found lounging by his food bowl or snoozing in his favourite carrier, Humphrey had scarpered by the time the psychic knocked on the door, reports the Mirror.

With animal psychic readings booming on social media platforms like TikTok, Vikki decided to give it a go, naturally seeking out the crème de la crème.

Jackie has worked with some famous pets, including Coronation Street legend Bill Roache's dogs and actor Matthew Rhys' horses, but could she read Vikki's pride and joy?

Luckily, Humphrey's curiosity won out, and by the time Vikki had heard all about Jackie's impressive career, he was back, just in time for his reading.

And it's fair to say he wasn't too keen at first. Meeting Jackie, he jumped onto the kitchen table, rolled onto his side to lure her in, and then to Vikki's horror, went for the kill.

First came a warning bite, followed by several whacks with his paw, his tail lashing furiously.

""You told me you weren't mean,"" laughed Jackie, as Humphrey turned upside down and attacked her again.

After the bumpy introduction, they were soon ‘chatting away'.

""I'm going to ask him to tell me about himself,"" Jackie said, laughing. The first thing Humphrey shared? ""I do lazy really well.""

Spot on. He admitted to getting under Vikki's feet too – no surprise, given his attempts to take her out on the stairs.

Humphrey also revealed he enjoys when Vikki's young daughter covers him with a blanket and draws pictures of him. Occasionally, he cheekily taps her on the head with his paws.

Vikki asked Jackie why he won't sleep in her daughter's room. Humphrey says she needs to be less hands on and stop talking in her sleep. ""He's saying: 'I'm just looking'"" explained Jackie. ""That's his advice to her."" He even mentioned the word ""biscuits"", stunning, as Vikki's daughter used to sneak cat treats upstairs to tempt him, until she was told to stop.

Humphrey is childlike himself, Jackie added, noting his habit of switching between the top and bottom of Vikki's bed. He also mentioned his local cat pals, ""a small, cute tabby"" matching a neighbour's cat, and a ""black and white tuxedo"" moggie who pops in sometimes.

So how would Humphrey sum up his life? ""Very easy indeed."" His only complaint is the vet, he insists his teeth and ears are fine, with the occasional furball his only ailment.

Surprisingly, he expressed a fondness for the outdoors, particularly the back garden, and requested ""cat mint"", a plant he loved in Vikki's old garden.

""I had no idea I was psychic for a long time,"" says Jackie of how she got started in the business. ""I got to my early 40s and got stage four cancer, they only gave me four weeks to live. That was in 2005 and it wasn't my time to go, I had loads of chemotherapy.

""At that point I had no physical strength. We had horses and dogs and I booked an animal communicator as a treat to come and talk to them.

""She talked to my rescue dog who told her I could communicate too and the penny dropped. She showed me how to do it - when it comes into your head it often sounds like your own thoughts and you have to learn to distinguish between the two.""

Jackie is busier than ever, with clients ranging from everyday pet owners to high-flyers and celebrities.

She specialises in spirit work and end-of-life readings, describing it as the most rewarding - and most needed - part of her work.

""Animals are so accepting of going to heaven,"" she says, detailing how she often passes on a dying pet's last request.

Her work spans a range of creatures, from horses and dogs to ferrets, and even a kangaroo.

She recently took on her first bearded dragon. ""It told me: 'My skin's actually soft' Jackie recalled.

""He looked very spiky in the photo, but his owner confirmed the skin on his belly was soft.""

Another client was a guide dog who became unusually stressed when his blind owner, who rode horses, took her wheelbarrow over to the manure heap at the stables.

""She pulled the wheelbarrow behind her and the dog told me: 'She's not got a guide',"" said Jackie. ""I suggested she started pushing the wheelbarrow in front of her and her dog was fine watching her from then on.""

Jackie declined to reveal her fees, asking instead for donations to animal charities.

She works worldwide, mainly by phone, and can communicate with pets from a photo, a description, or even just their name.

Her services are especially sought after in the United States and Australia.

Vikki, naturally sceptical, was surprised at how accurate Jackie's reading of Humphrey proved.

While there were no earth shattering revelations, she took away plenty of insights and reassurance.

By the time Jackie left, it was clear Humphrey was a very happy cat and it was easy to see how these readings bring comfort to owners whose pets have passed away.

Tucker Carlson has been accused by Jewish groups and Israeli media outlets of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories about the the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

The conservative commentator and former Fox News host evoked the death of Jesus during his address at the memorial for Kirk on Sunday, appearing to draw comparisons between the two.

“So it's about 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem, and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power, and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people, and they hate it, and they just go bonkers,” Carlson told the huge crowd gathered at the State Farm Stadium in Glendal, Arizona, to celebrate the life of Kirk.

“They hate it, and they become obsessed with making him stop: ‘This guy's got to stop talking. We've got to shut this guy up,'” he continued.

“And I can just sort of picture the scene in a lamp-lit room with a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus, thinking about — ‘What do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? We must make him stop talking.' And there's always one guy with the bright idea, and I can just hear him say, ‘I've got an idea. Why don't we just kill him? That'll shut him up, that'll fix the problem,'” Carlson said, before bursting into laughter.

“It doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way,” he added.

His comments sparked outcry from a number of Jewish groups and Israeli figures, who accused Carlson of evoking medieval “blood libel” conspiracies about Jewish people being responsible for the death of Christ.

Others said his mention of hummus, which was not eaten 2,000 years ago, was a clear attempt to evoke modern Israel.

“Complete with a laugh like a cartoon villain, Tucker Carlson uses Charlie Kirk's funeral to spread an antisemitic blood libel,” former Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy wrote on X.

“Tucker Carlson pushed an antisemitic trope, painting the Pharisees as ‘sitting around eating hummus' plotting Christ's crucifixion — then comparing it to people supposedly silencing Charlie Kirk by killing him, as if Jews killed Kirk the way they killed Christ,” Infowars host Adam King wrote on X.

“Once again, Tucker Carlson finds a way to insinuate that Charlie Kirk's murder had something to do with Jews. No matter what happens, someone, somewhere will find a way to blame it on Jews,” Compact Magazine editor Matthew Schmitz posted.

“Tucker Carlson used the memorial for Charlie Kirk — a passionate friend of Israel & the Jewish people — to spread antisemitic blood libels,” Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the pro-Israel group the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, wrote on X.

“There was a time when Tucker was known for debating. Now he's known for dog whistles, blaming everything on Jews, heaping praise on fake-historian Hitler apologists, apologizing to the Bin Laden terrorist family, denying Hamas is a terrorist group, siding with Islamist terrorists, and pretending Russians enjoy a higher standard of living than Americans,” Max Abrahms, a Republican political scientist, wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Carlson's words were amplified by Palestinian media outlet the Quds News Network.

“Tucker Carlson suggests Israeli involvement in Charlie Kirk's death during TPUSA's memorial for its late founder,” the network wrote in a post sharing a clip of the video.

Far-right influencers in the US, including Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes, have also been among the voices amplifying the theory that Israel was responsible for Kirk's assassination on Sept. 10.

Representatives for Carlson did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

President Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and a number of other senior Republicans spoke on the same stage as Carlson during Sunday's event.

Some prominent Jewish speakers at the memorial included Stephen Miller and Laura Loomer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","In Plain Sight","https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/plain-sight-epstein-trump-maga-conspiracy","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:08:59 GMT","

President Donald Trump owes a great deal of his political fortune to his enthusiasm for conspiracy theories. Before running for president, Trump embraced the nascent “birther” movement, repeatedly taking to Twitter and cable news to allege that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and therefore ineligible to be president of the United States. During the Republican primaries, Trump suggested that Rafael Cruz, the Cuban-born father of Sen. Ted Cruz, had ties to Lee Harvey Oswald and was likely involved with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And, of course, Trump spearheaded the campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, spouting widely discredited claims of systemic vote-stealing by the Democratic Party. This particular conspiracy theory led to a real conspiracy: the seditious violence of January 6, 2021, when MAGA diehards stormed the Capitol to disrupt Congress's formal certification of the election results. 

Since returning to the White House, Trump has not tempered his penchant for crackpot theories. He appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted the baseless theory that childhood vaccines cause autism, to run the Department of Health and Human Services. Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, built the administration's draconian immigration policy on the white supremacist great-replacement theory, which alleges that Democrats are using immigration to change the demographic makeup of the country for their political advantage. In 2020, Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, accused Obama of ordering a “false” intelligence analysis to make it appear as if Russia interfered in the 2016 election. (As a 2020 report from the Senate Intelligence Committee confirmed, Russia did in fact interfere in that election.)

For all of Trump's success manipulating conspiracy theories in his favor, the one he hasn't been able to get a handle on is the Jeffrey Epstein case, the most sprawling and scrutinized plot since the Kennedy assasination—particularly among QAnon fanatics, who believe that Epstein, a convicted sexual predator, was at the center of a global ring of pedophiles enabled by the so-called “deep state.” On the campaign trail, Trump promised to release all the files related to the Justice Department's prosecution of Epstein, who died in a federal prison in 2019 following his arrest for sex trafficking minors. Trump's long and very public friendship with Epstein and rumored inclusion on his list of clients did little to shake QAnon's belief that, if Trump returned to the White House, he would expose the conspiracy once and for all. 

Instead of releasing the Epstein files, Attorney General Pam Bondi handed out binders full of previously published information about the case to conservative influencers, which rankled many prominent Trump supporters, including far-right activist and 9/11-truther Laura Loomer, who called on Bondi to resign. In July, the Justice Department announced it had found no evidence of a client list, seemingly contradicting Bondi's previous claim that the list was “sitting on [her] desk right now to review.” To contain the backlash, the deputy attorney general met with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's coconspirator, supposedly to gather new information. Shortly after that interview, Maxwell, who is currently serving a twenty-year prison sentence, was transferred from a notorious federal prison in Florida to a more comfortable minimum-security facility in Texas. The move outraged victims and further exposed a growing rift among the MAGA faithful. The subsequent release of documents subpoenaed by the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee—which included a lewd illustration allegedly drawn by Trump for Epstein's fiftieth birthday and another well-wisher's joke about Epstein selling a “fully depreciated” woman to Trump for $22,500—made two things clear: the Epstein story isn't going away and the president is deeply involved in it. 

Though it's unlikely we'll ever learn the full details, we know that Epstein leveraged his relationships with powerful men to facilitate his crimes and avoid prosecution. His team of lawyers—Alan Dershowitz; Jay Lefkowitz, a former George W. Bush–administration official; and Kenneth Starr, the former Whitewater special prosecutor—negotiated a plea deal with U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta in 2007, which included a sealed nonprosecution agreement granting immunity to Epstein and “any potential co-conspirators.” And as The New York Times recently reported, JPMorgan processed more than $1 billion in transactions for Epstein and set up accounts for women federal investigators later determined to have been victims of Epstein's sex-trafficking operations. 

All of this damning information is already on the public record. So it is no longer really a conspiracy theory to claim that the crimes of Epstein and Maxwell were abetted and covered up by people who have yet to be held accountable. It often looks as if the more byzantine fantasies of QAnon and other Epstein obsessives were concocted precisely to keep Trump's supporters from having to acknowledge the sordid story staring them in the face all along: that Jeffrey Epstein and their hero, an adjudicated sexual abuser, built a close friendship on their shared sexual interests. As Trump's birthday message to Epstein put it: “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey.”

The journalist Michael Wolff, who interviewed Epstein not long before he died, has suggested the most recent revelations about Trump and Epstein, coupled with Trump's own bungling of the Epstein files, could be the start of a long lame-duck period, with the people around him jockeying to inherit the MAGA mantle from their disgraced leader. That's certainly possible, but no one who remembers the Access Hollywood tape or Trump's two impeachments or his thirty-four felonies would bet on it.

            Hot Stocks 





            After remaining mum on fellow ABC host Jimmy Kimmel's suspension last week, the hosts of “The View” on Monday spoke out against the Trump administration's recent crackdown on free speech.
    


            “Did y'all really think we weren't going to talk about Jimmy Kimmel? Have you watched the show over the last 29 seasons?” co-host Whoopi Goldberg said at the top of the broadcast. “No one silences us,” she said.
    


            Goldberg explained that the long-running daytime talk show hadn't addressed Kimmel's indefinite suspension during Thursday's and Friday's broadcasts because the co-hosts “took a breath to see if Jimmy was going to say anything about it first.”
    


            While the co-hosts did not directly attack ABC or its parent company Disney for benching Kimmel, they did sharply criticize what they described as the Trump administration's attacks on the First Amendment.
    


            Disney removed Kimmel from the air last week after Brendan Carr, the Trump-aligned Federal Communications Commission chairman, threatened to revoke ABC affiliate licenses over Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's suspected killer.
    


            “You can not like a show, and it can go off the air. Someone can say something they shouldn't and get taken off the air,” Goldberg said. “But the government cannot apply pressure to force someone to be silenced.”
    


            Co-host Ana Navarro, who likened Trump's attacks on the press to the actions of dictatorships she lived under in Nicaragua, expressed dismay at “how the government itself is using its weight and power to bully and scare people into silence.” She added: “This is what dictators and authoritarians do; it does not matter the ideology.”
    


            “The First Amendment is the first for a reason, because you need to be able to hold those in power accountable,” said co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump administration official-turned-critic.
    


            Kimmel has yet to publicly address his suspension. Meanwhile, “The View,” which is known for its fiery, no-holds-barred criticism of President Trump, has come under its own fire from the Trump administration.
    


            In late July, FCC chair Carr told Fox News that the long-running talk show was “in the crosshairs of this administration” because of co-host Joy Behar's repeated attacks on the president.
    


            And on Thursday, following Kimmel's suspension, Carr told CNN commentator Scott Jennings that it might be “worthwhile” for his agency to also target “The View.”
    


            The co-hosts of “The View” did not address Carr's threats on Monday. Instead, Goldberg ended the conversation by imploring viewers to stand up for free speech.
    


            “We fight for everybody's right to have freedom of speech because it means my speech is free, it means your speech is free,” Goldberg said.

SEOUL, September 22. /TASS/. North Korea has ""acquired a secret weapon"" as part of its efforts to build up its defense capabilities, the Korean Central News Agency reported, citing the country's leader Kim Jong Un.

""Our state and party are achieving continuous and rapid development in strengthening our defense capabilities,"" Kim Jong Un said. He mentioned the construction of new destroyers as ""the first important step in building a maritime power,"" as well as the ""relentless strengthening of strategic forces"" and improvements to serial weapons.

More than 22,000 people report feeling early-morning quake, which occurred east-south-east of Berkeley

An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.3 rocked the San Francisco Bay Area early on Monday, waking up many people.

The earthquake was just east-south-east of Berkeley, the United States Geological survey said, and more than 22,000 people said they felt it.

Residents were jolted awake just before 3am. The earthquake was strong and long, causing loud noises and objects falling from shelves. Residents could be heard shouting. Many people reported lying awake waiting for aftershocks.

Online, too, residents reported feeling their homes shake. Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) posted on X that trains were running at reduced speeds as it completed safety track inspections. It told commuters to expect delays of up to 20 minutes systemwide.

There were no reports of major damage.

“While 911 received an increase in calls from people who felt shaking, there have been no reports of injuries in San Francisco at this time, the city's department of emergency management posted on X. The department said it has not received any damage reports.

San Francisco's mayor, Dan Lurie, posted online about the quake, saying: “First responders are assessing any impact to our city, and we will give an update later today.”

“Things were shaking in our newsroom,” posted Dave Clark, a news anchor for KTVU-TV. “It caught everyone off guard.”

News stations reported that people as far south as Salinas, about 100 miles (160km) from Berkeley, felt it.

The shaking is a stark reminder of the looming risks of a much larger quake in this earthquake-prone region, and the need for residents to prepare.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

If the assassination of Charlie Kirk was an attempt to silence American conservatives, then his memorial service marked a stunning repudiation of that plan.

On Sunday, a small stretch of Arizona briefly became the centre of the political universe, with Donald Trump and almost every other major figure in the US government flying in to pay tribute to the conservative influencer in Glendale's State Farm Stadium.

Tens of thousands of Kirk's fans waited hours in the desert sun to pay their respects, some taking their spots in the queue the evening before.

Thousands more could not get in, the gargantuan stadium, normally home to American football games or hosting A-list pop stars, quickly filled to its capacity of 63,400.

Kirk was killed by an assassin's bullet 11 days ago, shot in the throat as he addressed students at a college campus in Utah.

But it was on Sunday that he was immortalised as a symbol of the American Right. Emerging from the confusion, shock and terror of the first few days after his death, figures from all over the Maga-sphere came together, united, to honour their friend.

There was a sense of the moment in the air, of strength in unity among everyone from the mourners, fans and security guards, to members of Mr Trump's cabinet.

“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk? You have made him immortal,” Stephen Miller, a long-time aide to Mr Trump, declared from the lectern equipped with bulletproof glass, set up on stage.

“You have immortalised Charlie Kirk, and now millions will carry on his legacy.

“And we will devote the rest of our lives to finishing the causes for which Charlie gave his last measure of devotion,” Mr Miller said.

“You have no idea of the dragon you've awakened.”

Erika Kirk, the widow of the murdered activist, was less fiery, but nonetheless the stadium was silent, taking a collective intake of breath as she pledged to continue her husband's work – and said she forgave his assassin.

“I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it's what Charlie would do,” she said through tears, the cavernous stadium so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

“The answer we know from the Gospel is always and always love, love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us,” Mrs Kirk, a mother of two, continued.

This was not just a memorial service for the 31-year-old conservative influencer: it was an act of defiance.

Kirk was gone, but Turning Point USA, the activist movement he built, which, by the time of his death, had a presence on hundreds of college campuses, would endure.

Mrs Kirk, who wore a white suit and displayed a crucifix around her neck, recalled forcing herself to see the murdered body of her husband.

In spite of the wound caused by the bullet that passed through his neck, she could “see the man that I love”, she said.

“I saw the only single grey hair on the side of his head, which I never told him about,” the 36-year-old continued, before glancing away and murmuring: “Sorry, baby.” As she told the stadium how she saw the “faintest smile” on his lips, the charged atmosphere mellowed.

“Charlie didn't suffer”, she had realised, and the crowd saw it too. Kirk's death was a tragedy, but his legacy would be a blessing.

Several times she would smile as she recalled her husband's habits – the love notes they exchanged – and look into the distance.

At other points, her face would crumple and she dabbed at her eyes, before looking down, steeling herself and pushing on.

When Mrs Kirk reappeared on stage after Donald Trump gave the closing speech, she appeared to be physically exhausted.

The newly appointed head of Turning Point repeatedly embraced Mr Trump, who paid tribute to Kirk as a “giant of his generation”, clinging to the president and burying her head in his shoulder.

Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point, said the turnout from fans and America's most powerful figures showed the impact of Kirk's work and how it had been spurred on by his death.

He told The Telegraph: “Had there not been the Turning Point USA ecosystem, this would be nothing but mourning and a massive gaping hole.

“The opposite has happened … We're seeing millions of Charlie Kirks rising up across all 50 states, and even internationally.”

Vigils for the slain influencer have taken place all over the world, from South Korea to Spain, Australia and London, a fact also pointed out by Mr Trump.

As Mrs Kirk urged forgiveness and quoted the Gospel from the stage, old grievances in the conservative movement were buried – at least for today.

Mr Trump was pictured shaking hands with Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire and, at one time his closest political ally, with whom he fell out spectacularly earlier this year.

At one point during the feud, Mr Musk accused his former boss of being named in government documents relating to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The row over the release of the “Epstein files” later became the biggest crisis to shake the president's grip on his base.

A more recent schism on the Right has opened in the last week or so, as prominent conservative voices warned the Trump administration could seek to exploit Kirk's murder by introducing draconian “hate speech” laws.

Mr Vance said those who celebrated Kirk's killing should lose their jobs, while Mr Rubio and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, issued penalties for foreign nationals and US troops who did the same.

Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night talk show host, was suspended on Wednesday hours after the government threatened to cancel broadcasting licenses because of comments he made about Kirk's killing.

Republicans ranging from former George W Bush adviser Karl Rove to Texas senator Ted Cruz and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson have warned using Kirk's death to target political rivals could chip away at civil liberties and backfire.

That hatchet appeared to be at least temporarily buried on Sunday. Carlson, who made a speech paying tribute to Kirk, concentrated his remarks on the theme of repentance and avoided antagonising Mr Trump, who was watching nearby.

How long that uneasy truce will last is unclear.

Other speakers, including Mr Miller, Mr Vance and Mr Trump took the opportunity to again hammer home the blame for Kirk's killing.

“He was taken from us by those who despise the virtues that actually made our civilisation great to begin with,” Mr Vance told the crowd, adding that he had seen “the very worst of humanity” in the past 11 days.

Intoning scripture, Mr Miller declared: “The light will defeat the dark. We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil.”

“The violence comes largely from the Left,” Mr Trump said.

With one martyr in the last fortnight, the authorities in Glendale were in no mood for another.

Media heading into the arena had their bags searched twice and passed through a metal detector set up at the entrance to the stadium. Confiscated items piled up on tables run by security outside.

On Friday, a man who had made his way into the arena before a security perimeter was set up, armed with a gun and a knife, was arrested.

Joshua Runkles, reportedly a former deputy sheriff in Idaho, claimed he was providing private security and presented outdated law enforcement credentials. Authorities are still attempting to work out what precisely he was doing.

Inside the arena, where sniffer dogs patrolled with their handlers, a bulletproof screen was set up at the lectern where Mr Trump and other senior political paid tribute to Kirk.

“This is the most high-profile event in probably 30 years,” Mr Bowyer said. “[It] has more security than the Super Bowl.”

In many ways, it felt like the Super Bowl too – the State Farm Stadium is the home of the NFL team the Arizona Cardinals, and attendees were not just Kirk's mourners, but his fans too.

Many of the attendees would not have known Kirk personally: but they were devotees of his viral videos, in which he would show up at colleges and challenge students to debates, beating the drum for his muscular brand of conservatism.

Hayden Rehweld was one of the first people in the queue for Charlie Kirk's memorial service, taking his place outside the arena around 6pm the previous evening.

Holding an enormous American flag aloft on a pole, Mr Rehweld – a dual American and Canadian citizen – had travelled from British Columbia all the way to Arizona.

“I'm here to pay my respects and express my condolences to his family. He declared Jesus Christ as lord,” he told The Telegraph, calling Kirk a “very important figure in the common-sense conservative world” whose influence would live on after his death.

“I honour him for that, how outspoken he was with his faith... regardless of what ideas he espoused he had convictions and I shared many of them.”

Mr Vance, who spoke of his “dear friend”, has said the debate over Kirk's legacy will begin after his memorial service.

But on Sunday, at least, one thing was clear: Charlie Kirk the man, may be dead, but Charlie Kirk the stand-bearer of the Right would live forever.

            NASA on Monday introduced the 10 people — selected from a pool of 8,000 applicants — who will join the agency's astronaut corps as it races to return to the moon before attempting an unprecedented crewed mission to Mars.
    


            The group includes six women and four men, whom acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy called “America's best and brightest.”
    


            “And we're going to need America's best and brightest (for) all our exploration plans for the future,” Duffy said. “We are going back to the moon. … And I'll just tell you this, I'll be damned if the Chinese beat NASA or beat America back to the moon.”
    


            The 10 inductees include Ben Bailey, a mechanical engineer and chief warrant officer 3 for the Army from Charlottesville, Virginia; Lauren Edgar, a geologist from Sammamish, Washington; Adam Fuhrmann, an aerospace engineer and Air Force major from Leesburg, Virginia; Cameron Jones, an aerospace engineer and Air Force major from Savanna, Illinois; Yuri Kubo, an electrical and computer engineer and former NASA worker and SpaceX launch director from Columbus, Indiana; Rebecca Lawler, a former lieutenant commander and test pilot in the Navy from Little Elm, Texas; Imelda Muller, a former Navy lieutenant and undersea medical officer from Copake Falls, New York; Erin Overcash, a lieutenant commander and test pilot in the Navy from Goshen, Kentucky; Katherine Spies, a design engineer and former Marine Corps test pilot from San Diego; and Anna Menon, a biomedical engineer and former SpaceX employee from Houston.
    


            This astronaut class marks the first in which there are more women than men, according to NASA.
    


Rock discovery contains ‘clearest sign' yet of ancient life on Mars, NASA says



            The agency also confirmed that Menon is the first person ever to join the NASA astronaut corps who has previously flown to orbit. While working at SpaceX, Menon was selected by tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to join him on Polaris Dawn, an experimental mission that traveled higher in its orbit around Earth than any crewed spacecraft had flown in decades. The mission, conducted last year aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, also included the first spacewalk carried out by the private sector.
    


            Menon will join her husband, Anil Menon, in the astronaut crops. Anil is also a former SpaceX employee, and he was chosen for the NASA astronaut corps during the last round of selections in 2021.
    


            Each class of incoming astronauts receives a special nickname selected by the prior class. The 2021 group — dubbed the “Flies” in part as a nod to how rapidly the class was likely to be assigned to and flown on missions to orbit — will bestow this group's nickname.
    


            “On behalf of all the Flies, we look forward to getting to know your class so we can give you a name befitting your personalities and appropriate for the exciting and dynamic time,” said NASA astronaut Chris Birch.
    


            The 10 new astronauts will spend the next two years in intensive training, during which they will “learn NASA's history and our vision for the future, they will take classes in geology and in water survival and space health,” said Stephen Koerner, the deputy director of NASA's Johnson Space Center.
    


            “They even get to train in our high performance jets,” Koerner added.
    


            Once training is completed, the new class will join the 48 other members of the space agency's astronaut corps and become eligible for flight assignments. And that could be a different experience than those picked during the last selection round in 2021.
    


            At that time, NASA still had a decade of International Space Station operations ahead. But now, the space agency is preparing to wind down activity at the orbiting laboratory by the early 2030s and commission new space stations operated by the private sector.
    


            For two decades, the ISS has been the only in-space destination for NASA astronauts to visit.
    


Two billionaires have very different — and equally wild — visions of a future in space. Is either possible?



            While Norman Knight, director of NASA flight operations, said during Monday's news conference that “many of these candidates sitting here today will have the opportunity to visit” the ISS, he emphasized that space station is supposed to serve as a learning laboratory for more difficult missions deeper into space.
    


            “Every lesson learned aboard station has paved the way of where we're headed: next to the moon — this time to stay — and on to Mars,” he said.
    


            It's not clear what other flight assignments these astronauts may be eligible for. NASA is likely to tap more experienced astronauts for moon missions. The agency has already selected a group of veteran fliers for Artemis II, a test mission that will fly around the moon as soon as next year.
    


            But NASA officials did indicate that they hope the young group of astronauts selected on Monday may be eligible for flights later in the Artemis program to the moon and perhaps even to Mars — where no human has yet traveled.

            More than 400 celebrities are backing Jimmy Kimmel and speaking out against “government threats to our freedom of speech” in an open letter organized by the ACLU.
    


            Jennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Selena Gomez, Billy Crystal, Robert DeNiro, Jane Fonda, Rosie O'Donnell, Jason Bateman, Ben Stiller, Christine Baranski, Martin Short, Debra Messing, Jamie Lee Curtis, Olivia Rodrigo and Natalie Portman are among the hundreds of Hollywood names who have signed the ACLU's letter after Kimmel's late-night show was pulled off the air indefinitely by ABC.
    


            Last week, Kimmel made comments on his late-night show about Charlie Kirk's suspected killer, generating backlash from the right. Then, President Donald Trump's appointee at the FCC, Brendan Carr, publicly threatened Disney/ABC to take action over Kimmel, prompting dozens of local station affiliates to announce they would stop airing Kimmel's show.
    


            Ever since Disney/ABC announced that “Jimmy Kimmel Live” would be “pre-empted indefinitely,” President Trump has reveled in Kimmel being pulled off the air.
    


            “We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech. Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country,” the ACLU letter reads.



            “Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation,” the letter continues. “In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.”
    


            The A-list letter addresses Kimmel being yanked off the air as a bipartisan issue that should concern all Americans.
    


            “We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry,” the letter states. “Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.”
    


            It continues, “Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.”
    


Jimmy Kimmel's cousin Sal hints: ‘There are a couple bombshells still there'



            Many celebrity signatories include artists who are currently in business with Disney properties — however, the letter does not mention Disney or ABC, putting its sole focus on government threats.
    


            The public figures who have signed the letter range from comedians like Chelsea Handler, Maya Rudolph and Ike Barinholtz; to political activists like Gloria Steinem and Jack Schlossberg; to filmmakers like Judd Apatow, Lena Dunham and Lin-Manuel Miranda; to actors including Annette Bening, Nathan Lane, Christine Baranski, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Kerry Washington, Laura Linney, Michael Keaton, Naomi Watts, Parker Posey, Pedro Pascal, Regina King, Tony Goldwyn and Noah Wyle.
    


            Sources told CNN that Kimmel and his legal representative have been meeting with top executives from Disney, though no resolution has been reached regarding the future of Kimmel's show.

The German armed forces would expect to suffer 1,000 wounded soldiers a day in the event of a conflict with Russia, according to the head of the Bundeswehr's medical service. Moscow has repeatedly denied any plans to attack NATO nations, calling such allegations “nonsense.”

“Realistically, we are talking about a figure of around 1,000 wounded troops per day,” Surgeon General Ralf Hoffmann told Reuters on Monday, when asked about the Bundeswehr's potential casualty rate. The military is looking at hospital trains and buses as it considers its potential needs, he added.

The Bundeswehr would also need German hospitals to allocate some 15,000 beds for it as soldiers would be mostly treated in civilian medical facilities after evacuation, according to Hoffmann.

Berlin has repeatedly spoken about the possibility of a direct military confrontation between NATO and Russia since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Germany's chief of defense staff, General Carsten Breuer, had previously stated that the nation must be ready to confront Moscow by 2029.

Earlier this year, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that “Germany is becoming dangerous again” in response to a statement by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius suggesting that the nation's troops were ready to kill Russian soldiers in the event of a confrontation. Peskov has also called Chancellor Friedrich Merz a “fierce apologist for confrontation with Russia.”

Merz had earlier vowed to make the Bundeswehr the “strongest conventional army in Europe.” He also labeled Russian President Vladimir Putin “perhaps the most serious war criminal of our time” and urged Kiev's Western backers to pursue “economic exhaustion” of Russia.

Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Berlin has significantly increased military spending and has become the second-largest supplier of arms to Kiev after the US. Ukraine used German Leopard tanks in its incursion last year into Russia's Kursk Region.

A ransomware attack was behind the airport disruptions that crippled automated check-in systems in some of Europe's busiest hubs over the weekend, media reported on Monday, citing the EU's cybersecurity agency ENISA.

The outages affected dozens of flights and disrupted travel for thousands of passengers in London Heathrow, Berlin, Brussels, and other airports.

”The type of ransomware has been identified. Law enforcement is involved to investigate,” ENISA said in a statement, as quoted by Reuters, without specifying where the attack originated from.

The breach on Friday night targeted check-in and boarding systems provided by US software maker Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of major American defense and aerospace corporation RTX, previously known as Raytheon Technologies.

Reuters quoted Collins Aerospace as saying on Monday that it was working with the affected airports and was in the final stages of completing updates to help restore full functionality. The firm was also reportedly hit by ransom-seeking hackers in 2023.

Ransomware is a type of malicious software that blocks access to a computer system or data, usually by encrypting them, until the victim pays a ransom. No groups have yet claimed responsibility or made any demands.

MOSCOW, September 22. /TASS/. Russia is fully ready to respond to threats with force, President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Russian Security Council. He also noted that Russia is prepared to continue observing the core tenets of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) for one year after it expires. TASS has compiled the key statements made by the president.

The situation in the field of strategic stability ""continues to deteriorate.""

This trend stems from a whole host of negative factors that ""provoke the aggravation of existing strategic risks and the emergence of new ones.""

The West's destructive actions have ""significantly undermined the foundation of constructive relations and practical cooperation between nuclear powers.""

The system of agreements between Russia and the US on nuclear and strategic defensive weapons ""has been almost entirely dismantled.""

The destructive actions of the West are aimed at ""undermining global parity, at gaining, trying to gain, absolute, overwhelming superiority.""

Russia ""prefers and prioritizes political and diplomatic methods of maintaining international peace based on the principles of equal rights, indivisible security, and mutual respect for interests.""

Russia is prepared to respond to any strategic threats ""not with words but with military and technological measures.""

Russia is confident in the ""reliability and effectiveness"" of its deterrent forces.

Russia ""is not interested in further escalating tensions or fueling an arms race.""

The expiration of the New START Treaty in 2026 will mark the end of the last agreement on direct restrictions on missile capabilities: ""A complete rejection of the legacy of this agreement would be, in many respects, a misguided and short-sighted step, which, in our opinion, would also have a negative impact on the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.""

Russia would like to preserve the status quo established by the New START Treaty ""to avoid provoking a further strategic arms race and to ensure an appropriate level of predictability and restraint.""

Russia's continued adherence to the treaty's limits depends on ""if the United States does the same and makes no moves that undermine or violate the existing balance of deterrent capabilities.""

After the treaty's expiration, Russia is ready to continue ""adhering to the core quantitative restrictions"" for one year.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

CAIRO, September 22. /TASS/. Qatar has received Hamas officials at the request of the United States, just as it earlier hosted a delegation from Afghanistan's Taliban movement, US Special Envoy for the Middle East Tom Barrack shared.

Sky News Arabia reported earlier, citing Barrack, that at America's request, Qatar had received Hamas and the Taliban.

Commenting on the situation around the Gaza Strip, the US envoy said he believed US President Donald Trump has a plan on Gaza, wanting to put an end to the strife befalling the embattled region.

However, Barrack doubted a temporary truce between Hamas and Israel will be a success as he said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not care about either borders or red lines as he is ready to go to any lengths to quell perceived threats to Israel.

On September 9, Israel attacked Hamas negotiators in Doha. The radical Palestinian movement said the airstrike had killed six people, including the son of head of Hamas's Gaza office Khalil al-Hayya and a Qatari security officer.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Karoline Leavitt claims media reporting of pressure campaign is ‘gaslighting' and evades question on expected announcement about acetaminophen 

In a wide ranging press conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, answered several questions from reporters. Most notably, she was resolute that Donald Trump wasn't pressuring the justice department to target his political enemies. This, despite posts on social media this weekend where he implored attorney general Pam Bondi to investigate several of his adversaries. It comes after the president took credit for firing the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, Erik Seibert, after he said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute New York attorney general Leticia James for mortgage fraud. “We are not going to tolerate gaslighting from anyone in the media or from anyone on the other side who is trying to say that it's the president who is weaponizing the DoJ,” Leavitt said, repeating the party line that Trump's predecessor was, in fact, the culprit. “Joe Biden used this sacred American institution to go after his political opponent in the middle of an election year.”

Leavitt also sidestepped questions about the president's reported autism announcement today. Trump is expected to deliver remarks citing a link between the use of Tylenol by pregnant women and autism among children. Medical experts have said it's perfectly safe for women to take over-the-counter pain medication while pregnant. “Before you jump to conclusions based on reports that the White House has not even confirmed, I would encourage everyone in this room to go into the four o'clock announcement with some critical thinking skills and with some open ears to actually listen to what the president and his team of outsiders have to say about this,” Leavitt said.

The White House also said that it supports congressional Republicans efforts for a “clean” short-term funding bill, to avoid a government shutdown. For context, funding is set to expire at the end of this month, and lawmakers are on recess this week. Leavitt said that the president wants “a straightforward, responsible solution to keep the government open to 21 November and allow the full year appropriations process to move forward.” She added that Democrats' would ultimately be responsible for a shutdown.

The press secretary also noted that Trump plans to sign the US ownership deal of TikTok, which would allow the social media app to continue operating stateside. Of note, the tech company Oracle – owned by Trump ally Larry Ellison – will independently monitor all US user data on their servers, adding that it will be “stored securely in the United States without access from China”.

And as the president prepares to address the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the White House responded to several countries formally recognizing Palestinian statehood. “Frankly, he believes it's a reward to Hamas,” the press secretary said today. “He believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies. And I think you'll hear him talk about that tomorrow at the UN.”

On Truth Social, Donald Trump said that he wrapped a call a short while ago with the president of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, where he pledged to buy $4bn worth of locomotives and rail equipment from the US.

“We need to support our U.S. Rail Industry, which has been attacked by Fake Environmentalists for years. Congratulations to President Tokayev on his great purchase,” Trump wrote.

Kazakhstan will buy the infrastructure from Wabtec Corporation, the Pennsylvania-based manufacturer, in a deal that will support “thousands of jobs” in the US, according to commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

In a wide ranging press conference, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, answered several questions from reporters.

Donald Trump is set to hold a series of high-stakes meetings at the United Nations this week, beginning with bilateral talks with UN secretary-general António Guterres and leaders from Ukraine, Argentina and the European Union, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at today's briefing.

In a separate multilateral summit, Trump will convene with leaders from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan, Leavitt said.

Of note in today's briefing, Karoline Leavitt said that the president plans to sign the US ownership deal of TikTok, which would allow the social media app to continue operating stateside.

“TikTok will be owned by a majority of American investors and controlled by a board of directors with extensive national security and cybersecurity credentials,” Leavitt said.

She confirmed earlier reports that tech company Oracle – owned by Trump ally Larry Ellison – will independently monitor all US user data on their servers, adding that it will be “stored securely in the United States without access from China”.

Leavitt also said that the TikTok algorithm will be secured, retrained and operated in the United States and “outside ByteDance's control”.

As we noted earlier, several American allies have joined the global chorus formally recognizing a Palestinian state. Today, Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed that Donald Trump disagrees with this decision.

“Frankly, he believes it's a reward to Hamas,” the press secretary said. “He believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies. And I think you'll hear him talk about that tomorrow at the UN.”

The press secretary said that she didn't have any updates on a possible meeting, following a letter that top Congressional Democrats sent to the president to discuss the short-term funding bill that has stalled in the Senate.

A reminder that government funding expires at the end of September, and lawmakers from both chambers are back in their districts on recess.

“This White House wants and what Republicans want, we want a clean funding extension to keep the government open,” Leavitt said. “A straightforward, responsible solution to keep the government open to November 21 and allow the full year appropriations process to move forward.”

GOP lawmakers have labelled Democrats' version of a continuing resolution to avoid a shutdown as “unserious” as it contains a number of health care provisions to offset the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Leavitt, however, shirked any possible blame: “If the government is shut down, it's only going to it will be the fault of the Democrats, and it will only hurt the most vulnerable in our country.”

Karoline Leavitt was resolute today when fielding questions from reporters on the pressure campaign from the president on the Department of Justice to investigate several of his political opponents.

“We are not going to tolerate gaslighting from anyone in the media or from anyone on the other side who is trying to say that it's the president who is weaponizing the DoJ,” Leavitt said. “Joe Biden used this sacred American institution to go after his political opponent in the middle of an election year.”

When pressed further about why Donald Trump is unwilling to accept findings from Erik Siebert, the now fired US attorney of eastern district of Virginia, Leavitt said: “The president has every right to express how he feels about these people who literally campaigned on trying to put him in jail, who literally tried to ruin his life and ruin his businesses. And he wants to see accountability for those who abuse their office and abuse their power.”

Notably, Karoline Leavitt said that she doesn't “want to scoop” the president or health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr ahead of their 4pm announcement today.

There have been multiple reports that Trump plans to deliver remarks citing a link between the use of Tylenol – namely its active ingredient acetaminophen – by pregnant women and autism among children. Medical experts have said it's perfectly safe for women to take over-the-counter pain medication while pregnant.

Leavitt did not confirm the details of today's announcement:

Before you jump to conclusions based on reports that the White House has not even confirmed, I would encourage everyone in this room to go into the four o'clock announcement with some critical thinking skills and with some open ears to actually listen to what the president and his team of outsiders have to say about this.

Following the public memorial for far-right activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk on Sunday, Leavitt characterized Erika Kirk's remarks, where she said that she forgives her husband's killer, as “one of the greatest acts of grace this world has ever seen”.

Notably, Leavitt incorrectly claimed that 96 Democrats voted “against a basic resolution condemning political violence” in Congress, following his murder.

On Friday, the House ultimately passed a resolution that praised Kirk as a “courageous American patriot” who sought to “elevate truth, foster understanding, and strengthen the Republic”.

Ninety-five Democrats voted to pass the measure, but 58 voted to oppose it, with several saying that they condemned his murder, but could not support Kirk's speech. Thirty-eight Democrats voted present and 22 did not vote on the resolution.

In a statement, New York Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that while “condemning the depravity of Kirk's brutal murder is a straightforward matter” Kirk's rhetoric and beliefs “were ignorant and sought to disenfranchise millions of Americans – far from ‘working tirelessly to promote unity' as asserted by the majority in this resolution”.

Karoline Leavitt just started the White House press briefing. She noted that the president will address the United Nations general assembly tomorrow in a “a major speech touting the renewal of American strength around the world his historic accomplishments in just eight months”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russia and Ukraine swapped accusations of deadly drone strikes on civilian areas of their countries Monday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky anticipated “a very intense week” of diplomacy at the UN General Assembly in New York, where the Security Council was expected to discuss the more than three-year war.

Zelensky has tried to give momentum to a U.S.-led peace effort, offering a ceasefire and a summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has taken issue with some of the proposals, however, and an end to the bloodshed appears no closer.

Additionally, international concerns have mounted recently that the fighting could spread beyond Ukraine's borders as European countries rebuked Russia for what they said were provocations. The incidents have included Russian drones landing on Polish soil and Russian fighter aircraft entering Estonian airspace.

Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media that Russia was testing NATO's political and military response and aiming to reduce Western support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources toward the defence of alliance countries.

Calibrating how to respond to Russia was not easy, Rinkevics said Sunday. Russia was doing just enough not to cross a red line, but things could still spiral, he added.

 

The Associated Press

Russia's Defence Ministry denied any Estonian airspace violation by its planes, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday dismissed Estonia and NATO's claims as “void, ungrounded and continuing an unbridled policy of inciting tensions and provoking confrontation.”

Zelensky was due to attend the annual high-level gathering at the UN General Assembly, where he planned to recruit support for efforts to stop Russia's invasion.

“The schedule already includes nearly two dozen meetings with leaders from different countries, from all parts of the world,” Zelensky said on Telegram late Sunday.

Zelensky said he also planned to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose drive for a peace deal after taking office in January has yielded no progress.

“It is vital that this week strengthen the world's resolve for robust action – for without strength, peace will not prevail,” Zelensky said.

He said that over the past week Russia fired more than 1,500 strike drones, 1,280 glide bombs and 50 missiles of various types at Ukraine. More than 132,000 foreign components were found in those weapons from dozens of countries, he said.

Ukraine has campaigned for tighter sanctions on Russia.

Meanwhile, at least seven Russian aircraft bombarded the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing three people and wounding two others, according to regional administration head Ivan Fedorov.

The attack started around 4:20 a.m. and lasted about 40 minutes, Fedorov said. Residential buildings, shopping malls, a parking lot and “critical infrastructure” were targeted, he said.

“None of the sites had anything to do with military infrastructure,” Fedorov said.

The Ukrainian air force said it stopped 132 out of 141 strike and decoy drones launched by Russian forces overnight.

Russia made similar claims. The Moscow-appointed head of Ukraine's Russia-occupied Crimea peninsula, Sergei Aksyonov, said three people were killed and 16 others were wounded late Sunday by Ukrainian drones that struck the popular vacation resort of Foros.

The Russian Defence Ministry said there are no military facilities there.

In Russia's Belgorod border region, three people were killed and another 10 were wounded by Ukrainian drone attacks on Sunday, according to the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov.

The Defence Ministry said 114 Ukrainian drones were downed early Monday over several Russian regions.

Amid recently strained ties, Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar is set to meet with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to avoid foreign-made goods.

Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will meet with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in New York on Monday, according to Indian media reports.

The meeting, which will take place on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly, comes at a time when the two countries are attempting to mend their recently strained relations.

This is the first meeting between these top officials after Washington raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, in response to India's continued imports of Russian oil. The meeting comes just days after US President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 (€85,198) fee for H-1B visa applications, in an effort to tighten immigration policy.

Jaishankar and Rubio last met in Washington in July.

Meanwhile, India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal will be in Washington DC on Monday for talks on a long-pending trade deal.

Last week, a US delegation met Indian officials for trade talks, which New Delhi called ""positive"" and ""forward-looking.""

News magazine IndiaToday reported that Goyal said ahead of the visit that India, however, would not compromise on its agricultural sector, calling farmer welfare a top priority in any trade dialogue.

Trade talks between the US and India have stalled, primarily over agriculture and dairy. The stalemate pits the US' demand for greater market access against India's need to protect its vast farming population, a key voter base for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

On Sunday, Modi urged citizens to shun foreign-made goods and embrace local products, reinforcing his call for self-reliance amid strained trade ties with the US.

""A lot of products we use daily are foreign made, we just don't know ... we will have to get rid of them,"" Modi said in a public address.

His remarks came ahead of his government's slashing of consumption taxes on everyday goods on Monday. The move, which makes a range of key consumer items from soap bars to motorbikes cheaper, is aimed at boosting demand after the steep US tariffs.

The Indian ministers' visits come amid the uncertainty that Trump's latest visa rules have created.

On Friday, the US president increased the fee for the H-1B applications from the current $1,700- ~$4,000 to $100,000 for new visas.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the new fee is aimed at getting companies to hire more US citizens.

The visa program, which provides a path for highly skilled workers to lawfully work in the US for a limited period of three years, has primarily benefited Indian tech workers.

According to US government data, last year India accounted for 71% of approved H-1B visas — by far the largest beneficiary.

India-born industry leaders who started out in the US with an H-1B visa include Sundar Pichai (CEO of Alphabet), Satya Nadella (chairman and CEO of Microsoft), Indra Nooyi (former CEO of PepsiCo), and Aravind Srinivas (co-founder of Perplexity AI).

Trump's move caused the shares of Indian tech giants to fall on Monday.

In a statement on Saturday, New Delhi pointed out that ""skilled talent mobility and exchanges"" have benefited both nations and called on Washington to consider the ""humanitarian consequences"" of the new policy.

The United States is considering imposing sanctions against the entire International Criminal Court (ICC) as soon as this week, it has been reported.

Washington has already placed targeted sanctions on several prosecutors and judges, but naming the court itself in the sanctions list would be a major escalation. It would put the court's day-to-day operations in jeopardy.

Six sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that a decision on such “entity sanctions” was expected soon.

A state department spokesman accused the ICC of asserting what it said was its “purported jurisdiction” over US and Israeli personnel and said that Washington was going to take further steps, although the spokesman did not say exactly what.

Sanctions applied to the court as an entity could affect a number of day-to-day activities, including the court's ability to pay its staff, access to bank accounts and routine office software on its computers.

To mitigate the potential damage, ICC staff received salaries this month in advance for the rest of 2025, three sources said.

However, this is not the first time the court has paid wages in advance as a precaution in case of sanctions.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has called the court “a national security threat that has been an instrument for lawfare” against the US and its ally Israel.

The court was founded in 2002 under a treaty giving it jurisdiction to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes that were either committed by a citizen of a member state or had taken place on a member's territory.

In November, the ICC indicted Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Yoav Gallant, the former Israeli defence minister.

They were formally accused last year of alleged war crimes in Gaza, including the use of “starvation as a method of warfare”, along with the crimes against humanity of “persecution” and “intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population”.

Mr Netanyahu responded furiously by saying the ICC was guilty of an “anti-Semitic act” designed to deter Israel from defending itself “against our enemies who rise up against us to destroy us”.

He accused the court of a “moral bankruptcy” which “violates the natural right of democracies to defend themselves against murderous terrorism”.

The decision to pursue Mr Netanyahu also led the United States to escalate its campaign against the ICC.

During his first term as president, Donald Trump hardened Washington's position, declaring in 2018 that “as far as America is concerned” the court had “no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority”.

After Mr Netanyahu's indictment, Mr Trump launched a ferocious campaign against the court, imposing US sanctions on Karim Khan along with two deputy prosecutors and six ICC judges, although not, so far, on the institution itself.

A coalition of University of California faculty, students, staff, and labor unions is suing the Trump administration.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Outrage flared last week about the University of California's capitulation to this era's resurgent McCarthyism, as news spread that the university has provided the names of at least 160 students, faculty members, and staff at the University of California, Berkeley, to federal officials who – under the guise of investigating “alleged antisemitic incidents” – are scrutinizing people who have expressed opposition to Israel's genocide in Gaza. 

Judith Butler, a UC Berkeley philosophy professor and Jewish critic of the Israeli government, said in a recent interview with Democracy Now!, “There is no good evidence that antisemitism is rampant on campus,” adding, “To take a position against genocide is certainly not an antisemitic thing to do. Most Jews are against genocide, and we were taught to be against genocide, and we were taught, as well, that ‘never again' is a slogan that should apply to all people.” Butler noted that most of those whose names were reported to the administration had not been apprised of the allegations against them. 

A Truthout analysis of a voluntary agreement signed by the University of California and the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights nine months ago reveals that more such disclosures from other schools may be yet to come. In December 2024, after the election of Donald Trump but under the auspices of the outgoing Biden administration, the University of California promised to also hand over names of people who either reported or were the subject of allegations of discrimination at five other University of California campuses – UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UC Davis, and UC Santa Cruz.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

The 12-page agreement says that by September 30, 2025, the University of California will give the Office for Civil Rights a spreadsheet or other file of “responses by the University or the individual University campuses to all complaints and reports alleging discrimination, including harassment and disparate treatment, on the basis of actual or perceived national origin, including shared Jewish, Palestinian, Muslim, and/or Arab ancestry, or association with these national origins/ancestries, during the preceding academic year.” Although the agreement covers alleged discrimination against non-Jewish individuals as well, repression on campuses across the country has focused primarily on allegations of “antisemitism.” 

The agreement requires the spreadsheet to include a broad range of information, including the names and positions of both the people who made the complaint and subjects of the complaints, as well as any potential witnesses. It demands the university disclose information about the nature of the complaints, background on any investigations or measures offered to mitigate the issue, and information on whether the subject of the complaint appealed the decision.

This specific agreement, which was reported on by the Daily Bruin, UCLA's student paper, in 2024, has caused a new round of concern among faculty at the five campuses. When Truthout asked the University of California Office of the President whether the UC system or any of the individual schools listed in the agreement have provided any of the information detailed in the agreement to the federal government, and if not, whether they plan to do so, we received the following response from Charles F. Robinson, University of California, General Counsel and Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs:

The University of California, like many institutions nationwide, is subject to oversight by federal and state agencies and has legal obligations to respond to information requests arising from audits, compliance reviews, and investigations. Last week, UC Berkeley provided notice to a group of students and employees whose information had been included in materials provided to a federal agency during a federal investigation.

Where a legal obligation has been identified, UC has complied with investigative requests consistently over many years and across numerous administrations, reflecting the University's overall commitment to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws. UC will continue to meet its legal obligations while exploring all legal avenues to safeguard the privacy and trust of our community members.



UC San Diego Professor Adam Aron told Truthout: 

It is simply shocking that my local administration, along with the Office of the University of California President, have released names and files of people from our campus to the Trump administration, without even notifying the people whose information was shared. This has all sorts of implications such as putting those people at peril, without their yet knowing it, and also undermining the academic freedom of professors to teach what they want as the new school term is about to start.

Kina Thackray, Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Services at UC San Diego, told Truthout:

The implications are so broad, it's stunning. They include concerns about violations of university policies and constitutional rights in terms of free speech, and knowing what you're accused of, and student rights regarding the sharing of their personal information. It's also concerning for international students because our academic year is just starting and many will be traveling. This type of information is not required for such an investigation.

When then University of California President Michael V. Drake announced the agreement in December, he wrote that the school was “deeply committed to cultivating a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for our students, faculty, staff, patients, and other visitors, free from discrimination and harassment.” Faculty told Truthout they worry about what the agreement could mean for discrimination complaints going forward. 

Thackray added:

Imagine teaching in a classroom: students could allege that you're anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-male depending on the topics you cover in class. It doesn't really stop. Does that mean they can allege a civil rights violation and your name will be given to the government? It has huge implications for what faculty teach and whether they will feel intimidated about what they're teaching. I teach in the medical school where we train students in research and clinical practice. Will faculty get into trouble and get their names put on a list for teaching about women's health or trans health? It's a betrayal of our people, our principles and our policies.



On September 15, the UC Berkeley Faculty Association and the American Association of University Professors wrote a letter to the UC Berkeley Chancellor, charging that the disclosures of the names of the 160 faculty, staff, and students to the federal government had “caused them significant harm, including chilled speech and association and, among non-citizens, heightened fear of detention and deportation.” The letter continues:

The broad request for such personally sensitive information is intended to incite individual and institutional fear and thus chill First Amendment rights. By succumbing to this fear and complying with this overbroad and unlawful request, the University has participated in the chilling of speech and association rights of students, staff, and faculty.

On September 16, the San Diego Faculty Association addressed a letter to the UC San Diego Chancellor, which says:

Release of [personally identifiable information] about individuals associated with discrimination complaints is irrelevant to a legitimate investigation into an institution's management of such complaints and creates substantial risk of harm to those individuals. Such a disclosure is likely to cause UC San Diego faculty, students, and staff significant harm, including the infringement of first amendment rights to free speech and assembly, the violation of faculty rights to academic freedom and, among non-citizens, potential visa termination, detention, and deportation. … We urge your administration to protect the UC San Diego community from government threats and investigations that are wielded as tools to force us into compliance with a political agenda.

The efforts to pressure universities to name names is part of the Trump administration's campaign to cut federal funding from academic institutions and target international students who express solidarity with Palestinians. 

Last month, the administration fined UCLA $1.2 billion and halted federal research funding after the Department of Justice (DOJ) determined that the university violated federal civil rights law. In its July report, the DOJ accused UCLA of “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”

“The broad request for such personally sensitive information is intended to incite individual and institutional fear and thus chill First Amendment rights.”

But students, faculty, and staff at the University of California are not sitting idly by while the Trump administration uses the threat of cutting federal funding as a cudgel to coerce political compliance. On September 16, a group of UC faculty, students, staff, and labor unions filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Trump administration for violation of their academic freedom and free speech rights. They accuse the administration of trying to “commandeer this public university system and to purge from its campuses viewpoints with which the President and his administration” disagree. 

The lawsuit says the Trump administration sent a letter to UCLA on Aug. 8, 2025, that listed several demands for UCLA in exchange for unfreezing the university's federal research funding. Those demands require that UCLA ban demonstrations in certain areas of campus, share disciplinary records of international students with the federal government, eliminate racial preferences in hiring and race-based scholarships, and alter its policies toward transgender students in sports, health care, and public spaces.

“Defendants' threats and coercive conduct have caused a pervasive sense of fear and intimidation among UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees, who have seen the UC already begin to alter its policies and practices seemingly in capitulation to the Trump administration,” the lawsuit says. 

The University of California is not a party to the suit.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Two countries signed a peace deal in Washington. On the ground, little has changed","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/africa/dr-congo-rwanda-peace-deal-trump-fighting-intl-cmd","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 15:04:51 GMT","


            In the heart of Africa, in the mineral-rich eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, new recruits are being trained for battle.
    


            The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump's claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream.
    


            The deal, portrayed as a “wonderful treaty” by Trump, was signed by the foreign ministers of Rwanda and DR Congo in Washington on June 27.
    


            However, it has yet to end the wider bloodshed that began after the 1994 Rwandan genocide and is estimated to have killed 6 million people.
    


            “Our aim is to go to Kinshasa,” says Corneille Nangaa, a former election-chief-turned-rebel-leader, in an interview with CNN inside the rebel-held city of Goma.
    


            Nangaa's rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), of which M23 is a key member, plans to go to Kinshasa, the country's capital, to overthrow his one-time ally President Felix Tshisekedi, whom he considers illegitimate. “We need to liberate our country. We need to take away this corrupted regime, and then we need to build the state,” said Nangaa, who heads AFC-M23's political wing.
    


            M23, which is allegedly backed by Rwanda, took control of eastern DR Congo's two largest cities – Goma and Bukavu – in a lightning offensive at the start of this year. According to DR Congo's government, some 7,000 people have died in fighting in the eastern Congo since January. The ethnic Tutsi-led M23 claims to defend the interest of minority Rwandophone communities there, including the Tutsi.
    


            Crucially, neither the AFC nor M23 is party to the US-brokered peace process.
    


            However, Trump is heralding the US-brokered peace agreement as one of the several conflicts his administration has “settled.” He is expected to host the two country's presidents soon for a ceremonial signing of the deal.
    


            “We settled the Congo with Rwanda, that was going on, and that was a machete war. That was a gruesome war, many people, close to 10 million people killed. We got that,” Trump told reporters at a press conference in the United Kingdom alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Most of the wars “were not thought to be settleable,” he added. Experts say his claims to have “solved seven wars” are debatable.
    


            CNN visited Goma, home to more than 2 million people, in the week the United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) released a fact-finding report on the escalation of hostilities between January and July 2025 in North and South Kivu, the provinces where Goma and Bukavu are located.
    


            The findings “underscore the gravity and widespread nature of violations and abuses committed by all parties to the conflict, including acts that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.”
    


            It said, after capturing territories, “M23 engaged in a campaign of intimidation and violent repression through a pattern of summary executions, torture and other forms of ill-treatment, detention and enforced disappearances against the civilian population, carried out with the stated objective of restoring order, security and stability.”
    


            Eight months on from M23's violent takeover of Goma, the city's Birere market is once again bustling with hundreds of stalls packed with fresh produce.
    


            Women dangle live chickens from their hands, and carry spices piled high in plastic buckets on their heads.
    


            The air is thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and the noise of radios, people's chatter and moto taxis beeping their horns. There is nothing that does not seem available to buy: from tracksuits to handbags to fridge freezers.
    


            But the hectic scenes belie the ever-present threat of violence for civilians living in this contested region.
    


            “Ça va un peu,” or “it's kind of OK,” says one young man selling brightly colored cloth, when asked how life has been since January.
    


            “We have suffered enough already,” another woman selling fish laid out on a small wooden table says. Like many, she declines to talk about life under the control of an armed militia or to give her name.
    


            Announcing the findings of the fact-finding report in Geneva on September 9, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said: “My team confirmed that the M23 committed widespread torture and other mistreatment, including sexual violence, against detainees. Some people were beaten to death or died from injuries, suffocation or from starvation and dehydration. Accounts indicate that some guards were Rwandans.”
    


            The report also detailed a massacre that took place in Rutshuru territory, in North Kivu, allegedly at the hands of M23 and Rwandan soldiers – just weeks after the draft Rwanda-DR Congo peace agreement was signed in Washington.
    


            “In July, M23 members, together with alleged soldiers of the RDF (Rwandan Defense Force) and civilians armed with machetes, massacred hundreds of people – mainly Hutus – in four villages in Rutshuru. This is one of the deadliest incidents recorded since the M23's resurgence in 2022,” Turk told the UN Human Rights Council.
    


            Human Rights Watch also previously documented the mass killings in Rutshuru, near Virunga National Park, a crucial gorilla habitat. The organization said the mass killings appeared to be part of a military campaign against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a mostly Rwandan Hutu armed group that HRW says is formed by participants in Rwanda's 1994 genocide, and other opposing armed groups.
    


            During the genocide, hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu militias. M23 says that peace deals since have not done enough to protect the Tutsi minority in DR Congo; critics say this is a pretext and that the Rwandan-backed rebels are seeking to exploit the region's mineral wealth.
    


            “I reject all those reports because they are propaganda from Kinshasa,” Nangaa told CNN when asked about the allegations of severe human rights abuses and war crimes leveled at M23 in the reports by the UN and HRW. He claimed that the findings were invented to raise donor funding, calling them all lies.
    


            He also denied the group is backed by Rwanda. “We have our own soldiers,” he said. “We don't benefit anything from Rwanda, and we don't need it.”
    


            Rwanda has also repeatedly denied backing M23, though UN experts and much of the international community believe the country supports the rebels. CNN contacted the Rwandan government for comment on the UN's fact-finding report, but has not yet received a response.
    


            The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) “remains a republican army, fully subject to the Constitution, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and applies a policy of zero tolerance for any serious violations in this regard,” DR Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said in response to CNN's questions regarding the UN fact-finding report.
    


            Muyaya said the government considers it “inappropriate” to compare M23 to a national army, describing the rebel group as “a subversive armed group, auxiliary to a neighboring State, whose strategy is based on terror, mass crimes and the illegal exploitation of natural resources.”
    


            One of the many problems facing the civilian population is that money is hard to come by. The government closed banks in eastern Congo in response to M23's takeover of Goma and Bukavu, resulting in residents and businesses struggling to access cash to carry out basic transactions.
    


            The closure of Goma's International Airport – once a busy hub for the region and now in the hands of the rebels – has also hampered deliveries of humanitarian aid.
    


            The World Food Programme (WFP) told CNN that as of mid-2025, 28 million people – nearly a quarter of the population of DR Congo —require urgent food assistance and the escalation of violence following the M23 takeover of Goma and Bukavu has “severely disrupted humanitarian operations.”
    


            “We are staring down a humanitarian catastrophe,” WFP country director Cynthia A. Jones said.
    


            “Without immediate funding and safe access, millions in eastern DRC will be cut off from life-saving assistance. Food is not just aid – it's survival, it's dignity, and it's the foundation of peace.”
    


            The nutritional situation is deteriorating rapidly, the WFP said, with 4.75 million children under five facing or expected to face acute malnutrition, including 1.4 million in severe condition. The spike in malnutrition is being driven – in part – by the mass displacement due to conflict, the WFP said. More than 7.8 million people are now internally displaced in eastern DRC – the highest figure on record, according to UN figures reported in August.



            In North Kivu province, “there is fighting going on every day” between M23 and other armed groups and people are still being displaced, one aid worker in the DR Congo, who did not wish to be named for fear of reprisal, told CNN.
    


            “There's more than a million people who've been displaced by the fighting in Masisi,” a town around 50 miles (80km) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma, they said. “So that is then creating further humanitarian needs.”
    


            CNN met a mother of four young children from Masisi at the border crossing between Goma and Rwanda. She was one of dozens of women and children who stand accused of being family members of FDLR soldiers by the rebels and are being sent as part of a UN refugee process to live in Rwanda. The M23 calls it “repatriation.”
    


            “I'm coming ‘back home' to a place I don't even know because I was born in Congo, but I'm happy to be ‘back home,'” said 25-year-old Muhawenimana Rachel. She did not know where her husband was, she said.
    


            The DR Congo said the return of Rwandan refugees is part of a formal tripartite mechanism between the DRC, Rwanda and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which “enshrines clear principles: the voluntary, safe and dignified return of all refugees to their country of origin.”
    


            It said the “voluntary repatriations” take place under UNHCR's direct supervision in strict compliance with the tripartite mechanism.
    


            Camps for internally displaced people have been dismantled by M23 in the months since the group seized control, with many of those sheltering there forced to go back to what remains of their homes and villages.
    


            “People were forced to go back to their villages. Some of them were able to go back and find their houses, but the majority found that the houses were either destroyed, there were people living in them, and people had taken their land,” the aid worker said.
    


            Compounding the issues already facing the country of almost 110 million people was the dramatic shutdown in July of the US Agency for International Development, a multibillion-dollar agency that fought poverty and hunger around the world. The United States was by far the largest donor to DR Congo, providing more than $6 billion in humanitarian and development assistance over the past decade, the US Embassy in Kinshasa said in January 2025.
    


Accounts of child survivors shed light on surge of rape and sexual violence in conflict-torn DRC



            The US covered 70% of the humanitarian response plan last year for DR Congo, according to the UN. Nearly every organization on the ground has been affected by the funding withdrawal, the aid worker in DR Congo explained.
    


            Earlier this year, an order placed for 100,000 post-rape kits, which include medication for preventing infection from HIV and other STDs, that was set to be delivered to multiple organizations treating sexual violence survivors in eastern DR Congo was canceled. “It's really hard to find them here right now, so that has had a devastating effect,” the aid worker said.
    


            Sexual violence has long plagued DR Congo. In July, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), one humanitarian organization still working with survivors on the ground, said nearly 40,000 women were treated by its teams in North Kivu in 2024 alone.
    


            “Between January and April 2025, more than 7,400 survivors were treated in the Ministry of Public Health facilities supported by MSF in Goma. West of the city, in the town of Saké, more than 2,400 others were treated during the same period,” MSF said in a news release.
    


            While colonial-era border disputes and ethnic tensions have helped to fuel this entrenched conflict, control over DR Congo's mineral riches is also at its core.
    


            The Central African nation, which is roughly the size of Western Europe, is endowed with the world's largest reserves of cobalt – used to produce batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles – and coltan, which is refined into tantalum and has a variety of applications in phones and other devices.
    


            Trump signaled his interests in a US-brokered peace treaty before hosting the signatories in the Oval Office in June, telling reporters that the accord would allow the US to get “a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo.”
    


            However, previous truce agreements have failed to bring lasting peace between M23 and the Congolese armed forces. Parallel peace negotiations are currently ongoing, namely a Qatar-led process, which have yet to bring concrete results.
    


            Nangaa told CNN that Trump has been fooled if he thinks DR Congo's president can offer him minerals in return for peace.
    


            “All the minerals we are talking about, they are mostly in Katanga and also in Kivu. Those minerals belong to the people, so he has to discuss with those people. Tshisekedi doesn't have any mining sites,” Nangaa said, referring to two provinces in eastern DRC – far from the capital Kinsasha, in the west of the country.
    


            M23 this year seized areas where mining sites are concentrated, including the so-called “coltan capital” of Rubaya. But Nangaa denied the suggestion that M23's fight is about minerals, claiming he had not seen any minerals himself.
    


            “The mineral is for you guys, for Chinese, for Americans, for the Europeans who are using that raw materials,” he said. “We are fighting for corns, for cassava, for rice.”
    


            The militias' fight is about “bad governance, political problems and identity problems,” he added.
    


            “The root causes of the conflict, is not discussed in Washington… I'm afraid that even if they sign, nothing is going to happen here, because we are in Goma, we are Congolese. We are not going to go in exile. We are staying. We are home and we are going to stay.”

France and Saudi Arabia hope to use this year's gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly and the increasingly horrific war in the Gaza Strip to inject new urgency into the quest for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Those efforts include a new road map for eventual Palestinian statehood in territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, and moves by several Western countries to join a global majority in recognizing such a state before it has been established.

Britain, Canada and Australia formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, joining nearly 150 countries that have already done so, and France is expected to follow suit at this week's General Assembly.




But the efforts to push a two-state solution face major obstacles, beginning with vehement opposition from the United States and Israel. The U.S. has blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the General Assembly. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has threatened to take unilateral action in response — possibly including the annexation of parts of the West Bank.

That would put the Palestinians' dream of independence even further out of reach.




The creation of a Palestinian state in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza has long been seen internationally as the only way to resolve the conflict, which began more than a century before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack sparked the ongoing war in Gaza.

Proponents say this would allow Israel to exist as a democracy with a Jewish majority. The alternative, they say, is the status quo in which Jewish Israelis have full rights and Palestinians live under varying degrees of Israeli control, something major rights groups say amounts to apartheid. 

“Israel must understand that the one state solution, with the subjugation of the Palestinian people without rights -- that is absolutely intolerable,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said last week. “Without a two-state solution, there will be no peace in the Middle East.”

Peace talks launched in the early 1990s repeatedly faltered amid violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements aimed at preventing a Palestinian state. No substantive negotiations have been held since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009.

Israel annexed east Jerusalem, considers it part of its capital, and has long encouraged the growth of Jewish settlements in and around Palestinian neighborhoods.

The occupied West Bank is home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship and some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in scattered enclaves.

In Gaza, Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, displaced some 90% of the population of 2 million, left much of the territory uninhabitable and pushed some areas into famine. A new offensive threatens to empty and flatten the largest Palestinian city.

Netanyahu's government and most of Israel's political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war. The Trump administration has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, instead calling for the relocation of much of Gaza's population to other countries, a plan Israel has eagerly adopted even as critics say it would amount to ethnic cleansing.

Perhaps hoping this is a darkest-before-dawn moment, France and Saudi Arabia have advanced a phased plan to end the conflict by establishing a demilitarized state governed by the Palestinian Authority with international assistance.

The plan calls for an immediate end to the war in Gaza, the return of all hostages and a complete Israeli withdrawal. Hamas would hand power to a politically independent committee under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority — something it has already agreed to — and lay down its arms, which it has not.

The international community would help the Palestinian Authority rebuild Gaza and govern the territories, possibly with the help of foreign peacekeepers. Regional peace and integration, likely including Saudi normalization of ties with Israel, would follow.

The 193-member world body approved a nonbinding resolution endorsing the so-called “New York Declaration” earlier this month. 

The United States and Israel say the international push for a Palestinian state rewards Hamas and makes it harder to reach a deal to halt the war and return the remaining hostages.

The Gaza ceasefire talks broke down again when Israel carried out a Sept. 9 strike targeting Hamas' negotiators in Qatar, one of the main mediators. The U.S. had walked away from the talks in July, blaming Hamas, and Israel unilaterally ended an earlier ceasefire in March.

Israel also says that creating a Palestinian state would allow Hamas to carry out another Oct. 7-style attack on an even wider scale. Hamas leaders have at times indicated they would accept a state on the 1967 lines, but the group remains formally committed to Israel's destruction.

Netanyahu portrays international recognition of Palestinian statehood as an attack on Israel. During a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, Netanyahu said “it is clear that if unilateral actions are taken against us, it simply invites unilateral actions on our part.”

Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners have long wanted to annex large parts of the West Bank, which would make it virtually impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state.

The U.S. has not taken a public position on the issue, but in an interview with Fox News, Rubio linked “this conversation about annexation” to the issue of statehood recognition.

The United Arab Emirates has called annexation a “red line,” without saying what effect it might have on the 2020 Abraham Accords, in which the country normalized ties with Israel.

The French-Saudi plan sidesteps the most divisive issues in the conflict: final borders, the fate of the settlements, the return of Palestinian refugees from past wars, security arrangements, the status of Jerusalem and recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.

It also relies heavily on the Palestinian Authority, the current leadership of which is despised by many Palestinians who view them as corrupt and autocratic. Israel says they are not fully committed to peace and accuses the Palestinian Authority of incitement despite recent reforms. 

The plan calls for Palestinian elections to be held within a year, but President Mahmoud Abbas has delayed previous votes when it looked like his party would lose, blaming Israeli restrictions. Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006, would be excluded unless it gives up its weapons and recognizes Israel.

All of which means the plan is likely to end up on the mound of past Mideast accords, parameters and road maps, leaving Israel in full control of the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, ruling millions of Palestinians who are denied basic rights.

A gunman opened fire in a New Hampshire country club on Saturday as a wedding was taking place, killing one person and wounding two others, local officials said. Authorities identified the suspect as Hunter Nadeau, age 23, and said he had been arrested and charged with one count of second-degree murder.

NASHUA, N.H. (AP) — Patrons at a restaurant acted quickly and selflessly to stop a gunman who opened fire while a wedding was taking place at a New Hampshire country club, averting a worse tragedy, authorities said Sunday.

One person was killed and two others were wounded by gunfire Saturday night before a suspect was taken into custody in a nearby neighborhood not long after the shooting, authorities said.

The gunfire killed Robert DeCesare Jr., 59, at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, said New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke. They said the suspect was Hunter Nadeau, 23, of Nashua, and that he had been arrested and charged with one count of second-degree murder for knowingly shooting DeCesare.

Nadeau was a former employee of the club, Formella said, adding that Nadeau made a number of statements during the shooting and appeared to be attempting to cause chaos in the moment as opposed to showing a hate-based motivation. Witnesses reported that Nadeau said “Free Palestine” during the confusion.

Some witnesses said someone struck Nadeau with a chair in an attempt to subdue him. Formella cited “selfless acts of courage by the patrons in the restaurant who put aside care for their own safety and worked to intervene and stop the shooter.”

The shooting happened adjacent to a wedding that was taking place at the club. Wedding DJ Michael Homewood credited the chair strike with preventing an even worse shooting.

“He hit him over the head with a chair, and he probably saved a bunch of lives just doing that,” Homewood told WCVB-TV.

Investigators were working to determine a motive, Formella said. Police did not immediately respond to a question about whether Nadeau is represented by an attorney, and attempts to reach family members of Nadeau were not immediately successful. Authorities said there is no known connection between Nadeau and DeCesare. 

Authorities had initially thought there could be two shooters but later said there was only one. 

“Additional charges likely will be brought, including for the additional shooting victims,” Formella and Rourke said in a statement. They said they expect Nadeau to be arraigned at the Ninth Circuit Court in Nashua on Monday.

One of the surviving gunshot victims was an employee and the other was a patron, Formella said. The employee is hospitalized in critical but stable condition while the other victim's status is unknown, Formella said. He said at least four other people at the scene suffered non-gunshot wounds that were not expected to be life threatening.

In addition to the three gunshot victims, others suffered injuries including lacerations, a broken hand and blunt force trauma, Nashua Fire Rescue said Sunday. The agency said it assisted about 100 people from the scene to a nearby firehouse, mostly on foot.

Gov. Kelly Ayotte said in a statement Sunday that the attorney general's office will assist Nashua police with the investigation and that she and her husband were “praying for the victims and their families.”

Nashua is about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northwest of Boston, just across the Massachusetts border. 

Charlene DeCesare, the widow of Robert DeCesare, said in an email that she was “unbelievably traumatized” and was focusing on caring for the couple's children in the aftermath of the shootings.

“Our lives are forever changed in one moment that would be senseless except for the belief that Rob was trying to protect me and my daughter, and maybe others there too. In our hearts, he's a hero,” she said.

Charlene DeCesare said in a subsequent email that she and her daughter were closest to the shooter when he walked into the room and that he appeared to target a restaurant employee. “My husband got caught in the fire trying to protect us,” she said.

She said her husband loved golf, poker and pickleball and was loved by his family and community. She also asked that the public “beware the speculation and utter nonsense that is being posted about what happened and why” and said it was “only making it harder for everyone involved, including the police who are trying to do their job.”

The mother of DeCesare, the man who was killed, had earlier described not being able to find her son after he was shot.

“He went down. My daughter-in-law and granddaughter escaped. ... They saw my son go down and they saw blood,” said Evie O'Rourke of Salem, New Hampshire.

Sophie Flabouris told WCVB-TV that someone hit the suspect over the head with a chair to subdue him. Flabouris said the suspect then fled the scene.

“We had just gathered around the dance floor. We were about to do a Greek smashing of the plates and throwing the dollar bills. The bride had just come up to me and gave me the plates to say, ‘All right, you give this to my husband.' And all of a sudden we heard ‘pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.' Heard five shots,” Flabouris said. “All of a sudden heard ‘Gun!' Chaos, screaming, and then running.”

Emily Ernst said she saw a gunman in all black.

“He had a mask on. We just saw him raise the gun and then we ran,” Ernst said. “I ran through the kitchen for my life.”

Tom Bartelson of Pepperell, Massachusetts, described a chaotic scene that unfolded near his nephew's wedding.

“Getting together for a dance for the bride and groom and then all chaos went off,” he said. “We heard about six shots and everybody ducked for cover and next thing you know, we're rushed into safe spots and things like that.”

In a statement Sunday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the move is part of a process to bring about an end to the conflict in Gaza and help promote a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the establishment of a Palestinian state “will not happen” following formal decisions by three Commonwealth nations to do so on Sunday.

Gaza and West Bank residents react to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement of Palestinian state recognition.

The coordinated initiative from the three Commonwealth nations and longtime allies reflects growing outrage at Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza and the continued expansion of settlements in the West Bank.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the U.K. is formally recognizing a Palestinian state despite vociferous opposition from the U.S. and Israel. In a statement Sunday, Starmer said the move is part of a process to bring about an end to the conflict in Gaza and help promote a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

LONDON (AP) — The U.K., Australia and Canada formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, prompting an angry response from Israel, which ruled out the prospect. 

The coordinated initiative from the three Commonwealth nations and longtime allies reflects growing outrage at Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza and the steps taken by the Israeli government to thwart efforts to create a Palestinian state, including by the continued expansion of settlements in the West Bank.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the U.K. is formally recognizing a Palestinian state despite vociferous opposition from the U.S. and Israel. In a statement Sunday, Starmer said the move is part of a process to bring about an end to the conflict in Gaza and help promote a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced pressure to take a harder line on Israel within his own governing Labour Party over the deteriorating situation in Gaza, said the U.K.'s move is intended “to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis.” He insisted it wasn't a reward for Hamas, which was behind the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 251 others. 

“Today, to revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution, I state clearly as prime minister of this great country that the United Kingdom formally recognizes the state of Palestine,” Starmer said in a video message. “We recognized the state of Israel more than 75 years ago as a homeland for the Jewish people. Today we join over 150 countries who recognize a Palestinian state also.”

The moves by the three countries prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to say that the establishment of a Palestinian state “will not happen” while Hamas urged the international community to isolate Israel. 

Later on Sunday, Portugal said it was recognizing a Palestinian state as well. 




The British announcement was widely anticipated after Starmer said in July that the U.K. would recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza, allowed the United Nations to bring in aid and took other steps toward long-term peace.

More countries are expected to join the list recognizing a Palestinian state at the U.N. General Assembly this week, including France, which, like the U.K., is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the three countries for proffering a “prize” to Hamas.

“It will not happen,” he said. “A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the establishment of a Palestinian state “will not happen” following formal decisions by three Commonwealth nations to do so on Sunday.

Netanyahu, who is set to give a speech to the General Assembly on Friday before heading to see U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House, said he would announce Israel's response after the trip.

Netanyahu has threatened to take unilateral steps, including the possibility of annexing parts of the West Bank, in response to world leaders' recognition of a Palestinian state. Such a move would clear the way for Israel to deepen its control over the territory -- and escalate tensions with the international community.

Hamas hailed the decision, calling it a “rightful outcome of our people's struggle, steadfastness, and sacrifices on the path to liberation and return.” The Islamic militant group, which is sworn to Israel's destruction, called on the world to isolate Israel.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority exercises limited autonomy in towns and cities in the West Bank, said the U.K. announcement is an important step toward achieving a “just and lasting peace in the region based on the two-state solution,” the official Palestinian news agency Wafa said.

The U.K. and France have had a historic role in the politics of the Middle East over the past 100 years, having carved up the region following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I.

As part of that carve-up, the U.K. became the governing power of what was then Palestine. It was also the author of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which backed the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people.”

However, the second part of the declaration has been largely neglected over the decades. It noted “that nothing shall be done, nothing which may prejudice the civil and religious rights” of the Palestinian people. 

“It's significant for France and the U.K. to recognize Palestine because of the legacy of these two countries' involvement in the Middle East,” said Burcu Ozcelik, senior research fellow for Middle East Security at London-based Royal United Services Institute. “But without the United States coming on board with the idea of a Palestine, I think very little will change on the ground.”

Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian head of mission in the U.K., told the BBC that recognition would right a colonial-era wrong. “The issue today is ending the denial of our existence that started 108 years ago, in 1917,” he said. “And I think today, the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected.”

The U.K. has for decades supported an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, but insisted recognition must come as part of a peace plan to achieve a two-state solution.

However, the government has become increasingly worried that such a solution is becoming all but impossible. During the past two years, Israel's assault on Gaza has displaced most of its population, killed more than 65,000 people, and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, including a famine in Gaza City. 

Last week, independent experts commissioned by the U.N.'s Human Rights Council concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, a charge that Israel rejected as “distorted and false.” 

Also vexing for the U.K. is that Israel's government has been aggressively expanding settlements in the West Bank, land that Palestinians want for their future state. Much of the world regards Israel's occupation of the West Bank, which is ostensibly run by the Palestinian Authority, as illegal.

“This move has symbolic and historic weight, makes clear the U.K.'s concerns about the survival of a two-state solution, and is intended to keep that goal relevant and alive,” said Olivia O'Sullivan, Director of the U.K. in the World Programme at the London-based think tank, Chatham House. 

The creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel is seen internationally as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict for the long-term.

Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the House vote that could cause a government shutdown if not passed, putting an estimated 2.3 million federal employees out of work.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., wants to jam Senate Democrats with the GOP's short-term funding extension, but so far they aren't ready to play ball.

Republicans and Democrats in the upper chamber blocked dueling continuing resolutions (CRs) from both parties last week and have now left Washington, D.C., until Sept. 29, effectively giving lawmakers in the upper chamber only two working days before the midnight deadline on Sept. 30.

Both sides are at an impasse. Senate Republicans argue that the ""clean"" extension, which would last until Nov. 21 and lacks any partisan policy riders, is everything Democrats dreamed of when they controlled the upper chamber.

TRUMP-APPROVED PLAN TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SCUTTLED BY SENATE

Senate Democrats led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., however, argue that they want a seat at the negotiating table and are adamant that expiring Obamacare premium subsidies must be dealt with now, rather than at the end of the year.

""They're trying to use what they think is leverage to get a bunch of stuff done,"" Thune said. ""It's never going to happen. I mean, can you imagine anything in that bill that they sent that we voted down today, passing in the Republican House of Representatives? Absolutely not. It's just not serious.""

Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension to the expiring Obamacare subsidies, clawbacks of canceled funding for NPR and PBS, and it would have repealed the healthcare provisions in President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" — policy that would reverse the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts while also getting rid of the $50 billion rural hospital fund.

""They're not being serious,"" Thune said. ""This is just a cold-blooded partisan political attempt to try and score political points with a left-wing base.""

Though he has not taken the option off the table, it's unlikely that Thune would cut this recess short. Instead, he wants to use the impending deadline to back Senate Democrats into a corner. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., played into that strategy, too, when he announced that the House would not return until after the funding deadline.

Thune is ready to bring the same CR passed by House Republicans last week to the floor.

SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCK DEMOCRATS' 'FILTHY' COUNTEROFFER AS SHUTDOWN DEADLINE LOOMS

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., railed against the likelihood that lawmakers wouldn't return to Capitol Hill until the deadline was directly on them.

""The Republicans want to shut down,"" he said. ""A) they refuse to negotiate, and B) they're sending us home for the week before the government shuts down. So you know this, this seems like a planned shutdown. As far as I can tell, there's zero effort, zero effort by Republicans to try to solve this problem.""

Schumer and Democrats have pinned the blame on Trump and argue that his insistence that Thune only needs Republican votes was a sign that Democrats should be cut out of the process. Thune will need Democratic votes to advance through the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate.

The top Senate Democrat hoped Thune and Republicans would ""now see that the only way to avoid a shutdown is negotiate with Democrats.""

""We're saying clearly, let's sit down. Let's figure this out,"" Schumer said. ""But Republicans have now left town with no sign they want to avoid a shutdown in a week. They left town. Donald Trump is the shutdown president and Senate Republicans are following him over the cliff.""

THUNE PANS DEMOCRATS' SHUTDOWN STANCE AS 'BORDERLINE PATHOLOGICAL,' 'LIKE A DISEASE'

Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also sent a letter on Saturday to Trump demanding a meeting, where the pair charged that ""Republicans would bear the responsibility"" of a partial shutdown.

""As a result, it is now your obligation to meet with us directly to reach an agreement to keep the government open and address the Republican healthcare crisis,"" they wrote.

Trump said on Saturday that he would ""love to meet with them, but I don't think it's going to have any impact.""

A day before, he didn't appear optimistic that a shutdown could be averted.

""I think we could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time,"" Trump said.

Thune may have defections within his own ranks to contend with, too. Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted against the GOP's bill. Only Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., crossed the aisle to support it.

Paul's vote against the bill wasn't a surprise. However, Murkowski, who is an appropriator, contended that she wanted a better bill on the floor than the one presented by Republicans and charged that the back-to-back failures of both bills was a ""messaging exercise.""

""I want to project a message of something that can actually get us through this impasse,"" she said. ""And so my message is a short-term CR that also addresses three past appropriations bills that we've already done. We should include those. We should include a short-term fix of the premium tax credits.""

Fox News contributor Karl Rove discusses the crime issue plaguing the country and how cashless bail and the 'soft on crime mentality' impact city residents on 'The Story.'

A New York City felon known as the ""Burberry Bandit"" is back on the streets after being released from jail following a string of alleged bank robberies.

Cornell Neilly, 35, earned the nickname after he was caught on surveillance camera in 2012 wearing a similar pattern associated with the luxury brand, according to the New York Post. 

Neilly was arrested on Sept. 15 after police said he robbed five banks throughout New York City over the course of one month, the outlet reported. In each case, Neilly allegedly passed a note to the bank teller demanding cash, the NYPD confirmed to Fox News Digital.

The accused bank robber's spree allegedly began on Aug. 16, when he strolled into the Chase Bank at 27th Street and Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and handed the teller a note demanding $3,500, the Post reported. The teller reportedly handed him $1,000 before he made his escape. 

Neilly allegedly asked for the same amount of money when he entered the Chase Bank on Park Avenue and East 26th Street on Aug. 25, where he ultimately walked out with $716, the outlet said. 

Just two weeks later, on Sept. 9, Neilly is accused of entering another Chase Bank in Midtown and demanding $4,500 – but reportedly ran off when the teller sounded the alarm.

On Sept. 12, Neilly allegedly demanded $3,500 from the Chase Bank on West Fourth Street in the West Village. The next day, he allegedly made off empty-handed after handing a teller at the Chelsea Chase Bank a note that read, ""This is a robbery. I want all large bills. Now. This is real,"" causing the employee to trigger the bank's silent alarm. 

Neilly has a long rap sheet of over 34 prior arrests for previous bank robberies, the NYPD confirmed to Fox News Digital. However, upon appearing in front of Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Jeffrey Gershuny, he was allowed back on the streets on supervised release, according to the Post. 

The 2019 appointee of then-Mayor Bill de Blasio reportedly rejected the prosecution's request for $50,000 cash bail or $150,000 bond.

""The fact that the bail was declined by this judge is negligent on the judge's part,"" an NYPD officer who asked to remain anonymous told the New York Post. ""It shows a real lack of care for public safety.""

""At what point does he keep getting out and gets desperate and brings a gun to a robbery instead of a note and kills somebody?""

The controversial decision comes just one month after Gershuny was demoted to presiding over misdemeanor cases in criminal court following an incident in which he reportedly pulled out his own gun on the bench while hearing a weapons case, the Post reported.

According to the Post, in an August court hearing, Gershuny asked a police officer to demonstrate how a suspect was concealing a weapon, before reaching for his own gun while presiding over the case. The incident reportedly resulted in Gershuny being moved to hearing night court cases in Manhattan Criminal Court. 

""The court system does not comment on individual bail determinations, whether in Criminal Court or in Superior Court,"" Al Baker, spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration, said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""It is important to note, however, that the vast majority of bail decisions turn on the court's discretionary weighing of a broad range of factors in order to make an individualized assessment of the defendant's risk of flight to avoid prosecution. That assessment involves due consideration of information and arguments presented by the prosecutor and defense counsel, as well as other materials submitted to the court.""

Neilly is charged with five counts of felony robbery and is scheduled to return to court on Oct. 1, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Neilly's attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on the latest in the case against Luigi Mangione, accused of killing a CEO, on 'Special Report.'

Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are again asking a federal judge in New York to block the Justice Department's attempt to seek the death penalty if he is convicted in the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, arguing that the government is pursuing capital punishment for political purposes and that top officials have inappropriately discussed the proceedings outside of court.

Mangione, a 27-year-old former Ivy Leaguer from a wealthy Maryland family, allegedly stalked Thompson to New York City, then shot him in the back on a sidewalk just steps from a hotel where the victim was supposed to meet Wall Street investors for a shareholder conference later that morning.

After a photo of the grinning suspect went viral, police found him in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was arrested five days after the Dec. 4 ambush.

In a 118-page motion filed Saturday, Mangione's lawyers accused the Trump administration of using his case to launch the president's renewed push to expand the use of capital punishment and ""to demonstrate its loathing of the prior administration"" after former President Joe Biden removed 37 out of 40 inmates from the federal death row before leaving office.

""Luigi Mangione is a 27-year-old Italian-American dual citizen whose beautiful, promising life has been derailed,"" six attorneys for Mangione claimed in the motion. ""Born in Maryland into a large, close, loving family, he is now fighting for his life against a government that seeks to execute him.""

They also took issue with how Attorney General Pam Bondi has discussed the case and the Justice Department's push for capital punishment online and in the media.

In particular, they singled out a comment she made on ""Fox News Sunday"" in April: ""I was a capital prosecutor. I tried death penalty cases throughout my career. If there was ever a death case, this is one.""

""This statement alone is enough to prejudice the entirety of this case,"" Mangione's lawyers wrote. ""The Attorney General of the United States is telling the public that based on her personal experience as a capital prosecutor who tried death penalty cases throughout her career that Mangione is guilty and should be executed.""

According to his lawyers, the Justice Department and law enforcement leaders have ""serially violated his constitutional rights."" They claim he was ""overcharged"" with a death penalty-eligible offense and noted that a New York judge recently threw out state-level terror charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

He now faces a top state charge of second-degree murder. Federally, he is accused of stalking, murder through use of a firearm and other gun charges.

They identified ""six ways"" they say his constitutional rights have been violated:

Additionally, the defense accused New York City leaders of overhyping and overcharging the state case, leaking details about a ""manifesto,"" a term they don't want used, and anti-health insurance industry messages written on bullet casings connected to the murder.

The defense is asking for the court to dismiss the federal indictment outright, block the government from seeking the death penalty or strike the Justice Department's notice of intent to seek the death penalty.

Federal prosecutors previously shot back that the defense has no authority over how prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury.

Thompson, 50, was a Minnesota father of two visiting New York City for a publicly announced shareholder conference.

Mangione faces charges in New York, Pennsylvania and federal court in connection with the slaying and the suspected murder weapon, which had 3D-printed parts. He has pleaded not guilty.

Virginia gubernatorial candidate and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss a racist sign directed at her displayed at a local rally. 

Elon Musk amplified a post from Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, weighing in as transgender bathroom policies again take center stage in the state's off-year election.

Musk alleged Spanberger ""tr[ied] to weasel out"" of a question from ABC Washington reporter Nick Minock about whether the former congresswoman supports biological males using women's locker rooms as the Department of Education scrutinizes five major school districts.

""Spanberger obviously does shamefully support boys in girl's sports and is trying to weasel out of the question by blaming the president,"" Musk said, retweeting Spanberger's response to Minock – who encountered her after she visited an early-voting poll.

Minock mentioned the Trump administration is investigating potential Title IX violations in allowing students to use their desired restroom or changing facility, for which Fairfax, Loudoun, Arlington, Alexandria and Prince William County schools under scrutiny.

Spanberger replied that court cases brought on the matter of transgender students' restroom use have already played out, including the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who challenged the local school's bathroom policy in Grim v. Gloucester County School Board, arguing it violated equal protection and Title IX.

In that case, the Richmond-based Fourth Circuit upheld a lower court's judgment against the school district and ruled its biologically-based restroom policy led to discrimination against Grimm.

""In fact, the argument is the assessment is there needs to be much clearer guidance in terms of what is an executive order's binding assessment of Title IX versus what has been a decision of a court,"" Spanberger said.

""But ultimately, the real impact here is, once again, it is the Trump administration taking dollars away from Virginia. Threatening education dollars to our public schools is an attack on Virginia's kids. It's an attack on our economy. It's an attack on Virginians.""

POTENTIAL YOUNGKIN SUCCESSOR FOCUSED ON MESSAGE IN TOUGH RACE TO KEEP SWING STATE RED

Spanberger said her priority is making Virginia schools the best in the country and painted President Donald Trump as an official who is ""coming after Virginia.""

When Minock asked again whether Spanberger specifically supported such policies, she did not respond.

However, in comments to Fox News Digital, a Spanberger spokesperson rebuffed Musk, saying the Democratic nominee is a mother of three Virginia public schoolchildren and a former federal law enforcement officer who investigated child predators.

""Nothing is more important to her than the safety of all of Virginia's kids,"" the spokesperson said.

""Ultimately, Abigail believes that these are decisions between parents and local schools — and she believes that politicians need to stop politicizing Virginia's public schools.""

Fox News Digital also reached out to Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears – the Republican nominee for governor – for comment.

In 2021, the issue of transgender bathroom policy in schools loomed large in the gubernatorial election. Current Gov. Glenn Youngkin was credited with pulling off an upset win against former Gov. Terry McAuliffe by making the overarching issue of ""parental rights"" front-and-center in the campaign.

Many of the individual cases affected schools in heavily-Democratic areas like Loudoun County, where McAuliffe still won, but Youngkin mildly increased expected margins. A case in Loudoun involving a transgender student allegedly assaulting another student also made headlines during the campaign.

At present-day, the issue – as well as Washington, D.C.-metro school systems like those mentioned are again front-and-center.

Earle-Sears has called for requiring students to use the restroom assigned to their biological sex as ""common sense,"" and recently appeared alongside demonstrators outside a Loudoun school board meeting in Ashburn earlier this month.

Appearing at an Arlington school board meeting, where a protester held up a sign telling Earle-Sears – who is Black – she should not share her water fountain if people can't share bathrooms, the Republican said the continuing trend is ""dangerous, insane and has to stop.""

""Here's the truth. There are two sexes: boys and girls.""

Musk's former DOGE counterpart, Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, headlined a rally on Friday to endorse Earle-Sears, lieutenant governor candidate John Reid and Attorney General Jason Miyares.

Reid, who approached and embraced Spanberger at her recent appearance in Henrico, highlighted Musk's comments and said both sides of the aisle ""can and should be polite to each other – but also must clearly highlight the differences between the candidates…""

""Abigail Spanberger is dodging the trans in the girls locker room issues because she's smart enough to know it's a big loser for her,"" Reid said.

""No boys in girls' sports. No boys in girls' locker rooms and vice versa. No medical engagement with minors without parental consultation and consent. No underage surgical or hormonal procedures on anyone,"" Reid said.

""We should do our best to let adults make their own decisions as long as they fully own the costs and consequences.""

Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses studies surrounding the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and Florida ending school vaccine mandates for children.

President Donald Trump is poised to unveil a ""significant"" medical and scientific finding for U.S. children Monday — and said Sunday he believes there may be an ""answer"" to autism now. 

The Trump administration said in April it would kick off a massive research initiative to understand the cause of autism by September. 

""Tomorrow we're going to have one of the biggest announcement(s) … medically, I think, in the history of our country. I think you're going to find it to be amazing,"" Trump said Sunday at the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ""I think we found an answer to autism.""

RFK JR ATTRIBUTES RISE IN AUTISM TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, WHILE CDC POINTS TO IMPROVED DIAGNOSTIC PRACTICES

No additional details were immediately provided, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that the announcement was related to the ""childhood autism epidemic."" 

""This will be a powerful display of how the entire Trump administration is committed to addressing root causes of chronic conditions and diseases, embracing full transparency in government and championing gold standard science,"" Leavitt said.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is expected to announce that it will caution pregnant women against using Tylenol during pregnancy except if they have a fever, the Washington Post reports, as the administration studies if use of the drug might be tied to autism. 

Tylenol maker Kenvue did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. 

However, Kenvue recently said in a statement that acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol, is the safest pain reliever for pregnant women. 

""Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy,"" Kenvue said in a statement Sunday. ""Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a survey in April that found that autism prevalence is on the rise and said the increase ""might be due to differences in availability of services for early detection and evaluation and diagnostic practices.""

Specifically, the survey found that one in 31 8-year-old children were diagnosed with autism in 2022 — up from one in 36 in 2000.

Meanwhile, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pointed to environmental factors as the root cause of autism. 

""This is coming from an environmental toxin, and somebody made a profit by putting that environmental toxin into our air, our water, our medicines, our food,"" Kennedy said in April at an event related to the CDC's report. ""And it's to their benefit to say ‘Oh, to normalize it, to say all this is all normal, it's always been here.' That's not good for our country.""

Heritage Foundation senior fellow Eugene Kontorovitch on how he expects the U.N. General Assembly to behave toward President Donald Trump and key U.S. allies defying the White House by recognizing Palestinian statehood.

As world leaders gather in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, French President Emmanuel Macron is seizing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to stake out global leadership — and, critics argue, to position himself as a counterweight to President Donald Trump.

Renewing his call for recognition of a Palestinian state, Macron has also put forward a proposal for a multinational force to take over from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ""the day after"" the Gaza war, according to The Times of Israel. 

For Macron, the United Nations General Assembly is a stage to project France as an alternative power. ""Macron's policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict reflects his broader ambitions on France's foreign policy, that is, the idea that the country, as a middle European power, can offer an alternative to the U.S.-China competition,"" Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital. ""In this specific case, Macron believes that his push for a Palestinian state will increase French credibility in the Arab world and the so-called ‘Global South.'""

MACRON STRUTS ON WORLD STAGE AS REVOLT OVER FRANCE'S SOARING DEBT PUTS HIS PM ON THE BRINK

""We have to recognize the legitimate right of Palestinian people to have a state,"" Macron said in an interview broadcast Thursday on Israel's Channel 12. ""If you don't give a political perspective, in fact, you just put them in the hands of those who are just proposing a security approach, an aggressive approach."" He went further, denouncing Israel's ground offensive in Gaza City as ""absolutely unacceptable"" and ""a huge mistake.""

The comments infuriated both Israel and the United States, which argue that recognition emboldens extremists and rewards Hamas, the group responsible for the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.

Macron, however, insists recognition is the only way forward, reviving the long-stalled two-state solution. More than 145 countries already recognize Palestine, and European allies, including the U.K., Canada, Australia, Portugal, Malta, Belgium, and Luxembourg, are expected to follow France's lead in the coming days.

Yet analysts warn Macron's track record suggests otherwise. ""If you want to know how UN-sponsored peacekeepers do with terrorist groups in the region, we have a 20-year case study in UNIFIL, which enabled rather than denied Hezbollah the ability to grow into a massive military threat,"" Richard Goldberg, senior advisor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.

""Macron is certainly driven by his beleaguered domestic political situation and the large French Muslim population, but in his own mind he's also been down this road in Lebanon, where France has historic equities. The record is pretty clear: Macron has never delivered on anything; security improvements have only come through U.S. pressure and Israeli military might,"" Goldberg said.

Just days before Macron's push, Trump met with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Jared Kushner to discuss Gaza's future — and is set to hold a meeting tomorrow with Arab leaders on ""the day after,"" sources confirm to Fox News Digital. The overlap has fueled speculation that Macron is maneuvering to outshine Trump and claim the mantle of statesman-in-chief.

Goldberg added bluntly: ""He may perceive himself that way, but I don't think many in Washington spend a lot of time thinking about him.""

Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, called Macron's maneuvering ""a blatant power-grab."" She told Fox News Digital: ""The fact is that would-be Emperor Macron has no clothes. The promise he is waving around of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' ‘promise' to soon hold elections and abandon dictatorship and terror screams ‘scam.'""

""At home, foreign policy topics are not driving the current political troubles, which are primarily focused on France's need to reduce its fiscal deficit,"" Samaan noted. ""I think Macron's initiative on Palestine has more to do with his personal aspirations in terms of legacy. He'll leave office in 2027.""

The proposed Gaza force, modeled on UNIFIL in Lebanon where France has long played a role, would demand French resources and likely face opposition in parliament from both the far left and far right, and without U.S. endorsement, Israeli buy-in, or domestic consensus in France, the initiative could stall before it begins.

The drug boat destroyed by a U.S. air strike announced on Friday by President Donald Trump was carrying about 1,000 kilograms, or about 2,200 pounds, of suspected cocaine, Dominican Republic officials confirmed.

The Dominican National Directorate for Drug Control and the Navy of the Dominican Republic seized 377 packages of cocaine from the “speedboat of narcoterrorists” targeted in the strike, they said in a joint announcement.

The Dominican officials worked with U.S. Southern Command forces to detect the drug speedboat, which intelligence officials suspected was headed for a stop in the Dominican Republic before continuing to the United States, they said in the announcement.

“It is noteworthy that this is the first time in history that the Dominican Republic and the United States have carried out a joint operation against narcoterrorism in the Caribbean region,” the National Directorate for Drug Control said in a post on X Sunday. 

The strike, which occurred about 80 miles south of Isla Beata off the southern edge of the Dominican Republic, was the third announced U.S. strike in a series of defense efforts to ward off drug traffickers. The Trump administration said the first strike on Sept. 2 killed members of the Venezuelan-based Tren De Aragua gang and the second strike also hit a boat of alleged Venezuelan origin.

Trump posted a video of the third U.S. strike on Truth Social on Friday. He said he authorized Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to carry out the attack.

“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage en route to poison Americans. The strike killed 3 male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel, which was in international waters. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike,” Trump said in the Truth Social post.

Dominican officials said after the U.S. military fired the strike, the Dominican navy and the National Directorate for Drug Control conducted a search operation to find the remaining substances. It was during this operation that they located the 377 packages of cocaine, 60 of which were completely destroyed in the strike, the officials said.

In August, the Pentagon deployed thousands of troops and several naval warships off the coast of Latin America to escalate its efforts to fight the influence of drug cartels.

The repeated air strikes have received pushback from Sens.

Americans assume hospitals are in the business of keeping us healthy, not of buying drugs inexpensively and then reselling them with a huge markup. We like to — alas, naively — assume that the Hippocratic oath applies to the whole medical community. 

Unfortunately, an ongoing federal program seems to have pushed many hospitals away from helping patients and toward becoming the nation's biggest drug pushers.

DOJ SUES HEALTH PLAN THAT GOT ALMOST $3.5 BILLION FROM FEDS

The Trump administration has an excellent opportunity to rein in government spending by focusing on hospitals that push this kind of exploitative policy, then pass the cost on to the taxpayer. A big problem is that hospitals push higher-priced care that results in higher federal costs. Some programs are not defined in a way that protects taxpayers from higher costs. Medicaid is a big-ticket item for the taxpayer, and hospitals pushing up the price of drugs takes away from other priorities. 

The program is known as 340B, and it was set up three decades ago to help certain hospitals buy prescription drugs. The program was a carve-out for critical access hospitals, rural care centers, nonprofit organizations, and others “that serve low-income and indigent populations,” according to the American Hospital Association.

Helping this kind of care facility is a great goal. But the exponential growth of the program should raise the ire of taxpayers and those in the federal government who are tasked to rein in costs. The program has grown from $5 billion a year in 2010 to nearly $67 billion in 2023. That number is expected to grow, but it shouldn't. 

As is often the case with big federal programs born from good intentions, there is simply too much fraud in the system. 

Earlier this year, federal lawmakers detailed allegations against the Cleveland Clinic, which has raked in nearly a billion dollars from the program. A hospital in Richmond used the program to make $276 million. Neither example had anything to do with helping patients. They were just money grabs. 

Luckily, the federal government is getting serious about reform. The Department of Health and Human Services wants to move oversight of 340B from the Health Resources and Services Administration to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. CMS is more likely to crack down on possible fraud in the program.

“If I was a hospital or a covered entity that was reliant on the 340B program, and I was told anything was going to change, not just who's regulating it, but that anything was going to change, I would be very concerned,” the president of consultancy 3 Axis Advisors said. “The reason is because 340B has become gasoline in the tank for a lot of these institutions, rightly or wrongly.”

Another step that is in the works is more oversight.

“Under the program, drug manufacturers will be allowed to require safety-net hospitals and clinics to purchase select 340B drugs at full price and then submit claims data to receive manufacturer rebates after dispensation,” law firm Husch Blackwell wrote. “The pilot program is limited to drugs listed on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Selected Drug List and is subject to proposed safeguards and requirements.”

The initial pilot is limited in scope, but it should be a useful guide and will show hospitals that there is a better path forward.

Other steps should also happen quickly. The Senate committee that investigated 340B recommended several. It said any entity getting 340B revenue should show that the money is directly being used to help patients, not to boost the provider's bottom line.

Senators also recommended looking into the types of financial benefits that pharmacies get for overseeing the 340B program. Auditors must make sure that increasing fees do not disadvantage covered entities and patients.

IN FOCUS FORUM: IS RFK JR. MAKING AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN?

Finally, policymakers must draft clear guidelines that ensure that manufacturer discounts actually benefit 340B-eligible patients. This should include changes in law to define which drugs are eligible for the program. Not all drugs should be covered, of course, and limiting which ones are should help reduce fraud.

The bottom line here is that hospitals should use drugs to help people, not to make money from the federal government. Reform is long overdue, but it may finally be on the way.

President Donald Trump is President Donald Trump, and many in the liberal media still can't accept that. That was clear yesterday at the Arizona memorial for Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated this month, allegedly by a hate-filled leftist.

After Kirk's widow, Erika, forgave her husband's killer, Trump, himself the target of two assassination attempts and years of political attacks, said he admired Kirk's ability to forgive, but it's something he could never do. It's just not in his blood.

“He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them,” Trump said of Kirk. Then he added, “I hate my opponents.”

For some at CNN and MSNBC, that was the big takeaway of the hourslong event as they searched for a way to portray it as divisive. “He has never made a pretense of being a leader for all Americans, as most of his predecessors have — even if they didn't follow through,” said a CNN analysis.

On MSNBC, following the memorial, White House correspondent Vaughn Hillyard also highlighted the different views and said, “I think what was stunning about the tension that exists here in 2025 was to listen to Erika Kirk, a big supporter of the president, be followed 15 to 20 minutes later by the president of the United States. Clearly, somebody who she loves, but come out and directly say, ‘I disagree with Charlie Kirk. I disagree with you, Erika,' and say, ‘I hate my opponents.'”

He added, “And I think that says a lot about where we are and the questions about where we go moving forward. The Erika Kirk route or the Donald Trump route.”

Vaughn Hillyard on MSNBC's The Weekend Primetime:

VAUGHN HILLYARD: I think what, honestly, I'll take away from tonight is watching the weight of a woman, a mother, lose her husband. Most people cannot say they've experienced losing a spouse at this young of an age, and I don't know who we are to suggest how somebody should respond in real time. One week after her husband's passing, she went in front of a crowd of 40 to 50,000 people, people watching all over the world. And she delivered remarks in which she forgave the assassin that shot her husband and killed him.

Co-host Elise Jordan: I thought it was just remarkable.

HILLYARD: A remarkable moment because in so many ways, where America stands in 2025 is: How do we respond going forward? And the woman that just lost her husband stood there in front of the world and said, ‘I forgive.' And because her Christian faith teaches her to love your enemy and not hate your enemy, and to love those that persecute you. And I think what was stunning about the tension that exists here in 2025 was to listen to Erika Kirk, a big supporter of the president, be followed 15-20 minutes later by the president of the United States. Clearly, somebody who she loves, but come out and directly say, ‘I disagree with Charlie Kirk. I disagree with you, Erika,' and say, ‘I hate my opponents.' And I think that says a lot about where we are and the questions about where we go moving forward. The Erika Kirk route or the Donald Trump route.

Jorge Bonilla, a news analyst with the Media Research Center's NewsBusters, explained our pick: “In the immediate aftermath of the powerful Charlie Kirk memorial, Trump-deranged MSNBC showed that they couldn't leave well enough alone. What began as a complimentary reaction turned into Trump-deranged brainworms for MSNBC consumption. Erika Kirk's testimony of forgiveness towards her husband's murderer stands as a potent example of Christ-like behavior in a most difficult time. Forgive them for they know not what they do, indeed. But Hillyard couldn't leave well enough alone, and he had to fabricate this oppositional friction where none exists between the Kirks and Trump. It's almost as if they didn't watch the memorial, and its many underlying messages centering around grace.”

Oracle has appointed two new co-CEOs, as part of a succession plan put into motion months ago. 

Business Insider reported in June that Oracle had promoted cloud boss Clay Magouyrk and head of industries Mike Sicilia to the title of ""president"" as part of a succession plan, citing SEC filings and people familiar with the plans.

Safra Catz, CEO since 2014, will become executive vice chair of the company's board of directors, the company announced. Larry Ellison, cofounder and former CEO, will continue as chief technology officer and executive chairman.

The leadership changes come amid an AI-driven growth boom for Oracle. The company's stock price shot up more than 40%, its largest increase within a single day, earlier this month after it said it expects revenue for its cloud business to jump 77% to $18 billion compared to the previous year, and hit $144 billion by 2030.

Magouyrk is a former Amazon software development engineer who joined Oracle as an individual contributor in 2014. He quickly impressed Ellison and Catz with his ability to deliver results quickly, leading to his rapid ascent through the ranks to preside over Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. His leadership style has at times been controversial.

Sicilia is the executive vice president of Oracle Industries and the executive who has been leading Oracle's takeover of Cerner. Oracle's announcement cited Sicilia's work adding AI agents to cloud applications for industries.

Oracle's succession plans have followed a similar format throughout the years. The company has used the two-president structure three times.

The first time, it named now Catz as a president along with a previous executive, Charles Phillips Jr. Oracle replaced Phillips with the late Mark Hurd after Hurd left HP. They each had the president title until both were promoted to co-CEOs in 2014 when Ellison stepped back. Hurd died in 2019, and while Ellison considered possible successors, he opted for Catz to remain the company's sole CEO.

Bernard Arnault, France's richest man and the CEO of luxury giant LVMH, has criticized France's proposed 2% wealth tax.

French economist Gabriel Zucman proposed the tax, which would be imposed on the ultra-rich with net worths of over 100 million euros, or about $117 million. French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu is now under pressure from the Socialist Party to include the wealth tax in France's 2026 budget.

Speaking to British newspaper The Sunday Times, Arnault said, ""This is clearly not a technical or economic debate, but rather a clearly stated desire to destroy the French economy.""

He slammed Zucman, calling him a ""far-left activist"" and saying that he was using some ""pseudo-academic"" expertise to destroy the liberal economy.

As of Monday, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index pegged Arnault's net worth at $169 billion, placing him eighth on the world's richest list. He once occupied the top spot when his net worth surpassed Elon Musk's at the end of 2022.

Zucman responded to Arnault's criticisms in a series of X posts on Sunday.

He said he was surprised by the ""caricatural nature"" of Arnault's attacks on him, and the tycoon's comments ""depart from rationality and are unfounded.""

Zucman denied Arnault's claims that his motives were political in nature. He said he has never been an activist in any movement or a member of any party, and his only work was as a researcher and teacher. According to his faculty profile, he teaches at the Paris School of Economics and UC Berkeley.

""Whatever you may think, the time has come to subject billionaires to a minimum tax rate,"" Zucman wrote on X, calling it an ""instrument of justice, social peace, and budgetary stability.""

Reuters reported that in 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron scrapped France's decadeslong wealth tax, which was imposed on individuals with assets above 1.3 million euros.

Protests broke out in France last week over the French government's proposed budget cuts, with protesters carrying ""tax the rich"" banners in support of Zucman's proposed tax plan.

Zucman and representatives for LVMH did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

For a long time, the US stock market would pay $2 for $1 worth of crypto. If you had a stash of, say, $500 million worth of Bitcoin, you could plop it into a random public company and the market would value the company at $1 billion. Then you could raise more money in at-the-market stock offerings, and use the money to buy more Bitcoin. Each $1 that you spent on Bitcoin would increase your market capitalization by $2, allowing you to raise more money to buy more Bitcoin, etc., in a virtuous cycle that, come on, just had to end badly. If nothing else, this strategy was extremely visible and extremely easy to copy, so everyone did it, driving the premium down.

But, for a while, good trade. One oddity of the trade was that, if you did have $500 million worth of Bitcoin, and someone came to you and said “I'll give you $500 million for your $500 million worth of Bitcoin,” you'd be kind of an idiot to sell. Those Bitcoins were going for $1 billion on the stock market! If you had a big stash of Bitcoin, the proper trade was to start a Bitcoin treasury company, not sell the Bitcoins to someone else who already had a Bitcoin treasury company.

Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayor's race, said Monday that he was canceling an upcoming town hall with an ABC affiliate in protest of the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show under pressure from the Trump administration.

""I am withdrawing not as an indictment of the local affiliate or the hardworking journalists, but rather in response to the corporate leaders who have put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press,"" Mamdani said at a campaign event on Manhattan's Roosevelt Island.

The WABC town hall was set to take place on Thursday, the Democratic nominee's campaign said.

The cancellation is the latest example of backlash over the decision to yank ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" off the air days after the longtime host's comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

ABC said last week that the show is off the air ""indefinitely"" on the heels of Nexstar Media Group saying that its stations affiliated with ABC would not carry Kimmel's show ""for the foreseeable future"" because of his statements tying Kirk's alleged killer to the MAGA movement.

Those announcements came hours after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr suggested his agency could take action against ABC over Kimmel's comments.

ABC's corporate parent Disney remains mum on the question of when — or if — Kimmel's show will return to the air.

""We cannot understand this moment of authoritarianism as solely coming from the White House, when it is also characterized by the cowardice of those in response to it — the cowardice that we have seen typified whether by the parent company of ABC or by so-called leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams looking to the White House for their path to their future ambition,"" Mamdani said.

Cuomo, a former New York governor, and the current New York City Mayor Adams are running as independents against Mamdani.

""We have to understand who suffers in these moments. It's not just a question of Jimmy Kimmel himself, it's also a question of the engineers, the writers, the musicians who are feeling this attack on the very city they call home,"" Mamdani said.

""The message that it sends to each and every American across this country is a message that the First Amendment is no longer a right that can be counted on, but rather that it is the government which will determine what should and should not be discussed, what can and cannot be spoken,"" he said.

A White House spokesperson, commenting on Mamdani's move, in an email to NBC News said, 'It's not surprising that the Little Communist is too scared to defend his absurd policy positions on live TV.""

Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist, not a communist.

Cuomo campaign spokesperson Rich Azzopardi  told NBC,  ""ABC suspending Kimmel was a big mistake, but refusing to talk to local reporters because of the actions of their parent company shouldn't pass anyone's smell test and the press shouldn't continue to give him a pass.""

Meanwhile, a slew of Oscar winners and other Hollywood artists are backing Kimmel in a new letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union.

""Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation,"" said the ACLU's letter, which has more than 400 signatories.

""In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees,"" the letter says.

Stars who signed the letter include Academy Award winners Robert DeNiro, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Frances McDormand.

Danish renewable energy company Orsted will restart work ""as soon as possible"" on a wind farm off the coast of New England, after a federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a stop work order.

""Revolution Wind will resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority,"" Orsted said in a statement Monday.

The judge's decision is a setback for President Donald Trump's effort to shut down the nascent offshore wind industry in the U.S.

The Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered Orsted on Aug. 22 to halt construction on Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The project is fully permited and 80% complete. It would provide power for more than 350,000 homes.

Orsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables filed a lawsuit against Interior that asked the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to lift the stop-work order. They argued that Interior's order to stop construction was aribtrary, capricious, unlawful and ""issued in bad faith.""

Judge Royce Lamberth issued a temporary injunction Monday, saying Orsted had ""demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits"" and would likely suffer irreparable harm if the stop-work order remained in place. 

The Trump administration could appeal. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment. 

Trump has targeted the wind power industry since his first day in office, when he banned new leases for offshore wind farms. But the industry had hoped that fully permitted wind projects, particularly those that are already under construciton, would be allowed to proceed.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said earlier this month that he is ""taking a deep look"" at five offshore wind projects in the U.S. that are under construction. Burgum made clear that Trump wants to shut down the offshore wind industry.

""Under this administration, there is not a future for offshore wind because it is too expensive and not reliable enough,"" Burgum told an audience at the Gastech conference in Milan, Italy, on Sept. 11.

New Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks Monday to the Economic Club of New York to explain his views on the economy and monetary policy.

The appearance comes less than a week after Miran voiced the lone dissent from the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to lower its key overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point. Instead, Miran favored a half-point reduction.

Miran was confirmed last Tuesday, after President Donald Trump nominated him to fill the vacancy created when former Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned in early August. The term expires on Jan. 31, 2026, and Miran is not expected to be reappointed for a full 14-year term.

Prior to coming to the Fed, he served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, a position from which he has taken a leave and will return to after his stint at the central bank.

 Bitcoin slips under $111,500 as $280 million in leverage long positions are liquidated, but key support levels may decide if BTC rebounds or risks a deeper breakdown. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin dipped below $111,500, testing a major daily demand zone.

Spot demand remains strong, keeping the market structure broadly in favor of bulls.

Price levels around $113,000, $107,200, and $100,000 could pique investors' interest.

Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $111,500 during the Asian market session on Monday, clearing out internal liquidity between $115,000 and $114,000 and testing a daily demand zone between $110,700 and $113,200. The dip places BTC at risk of losing support from the 50-day exponential moving average if its daily candle closes under $113,200.

Cointelegraph highlighted the likelihood of this retest last week, projecting a dip under $113,000 before renewed upside. A short-lived bullish reaction to the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on Wednesday lifted BTC to $117,500, but the rally failed to create a bullish break of structure, leading to the current correction.

Despite the downside move, the market structure remains broadly constructive. CryptoQuant data implied investors were buying aggressively into the dip, with the Coinbase Premium Index strongly positive. This indicated that US spot demand was providing a cushion against deeper downside pressure.

On-chain data supports this narrative. Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. noted that spot demand has remained consistent over the past month, with apparent demand totaling 95,800 BTC. Sustained accumulation is keeping price action near the upper band of the recent range, even as futures markets show short-term weakness.

Additionally, close to $280 million in BTC futures positions were liquidated during the correction, flushing out leverage that had built during BTC's climb to $117,500 from $107,000 in September. With an excessive leverage reset, the market may be primed for a healthier continuation if spot demand persists.

With Bitcoin currently trading just under $113,000, three critical price levels stand out from a trend perspective. 

The first is the demand zone between $110,700 and $113,200. A sharp rebound from this area would confirm that the recent drawdown was a leverage flush, clearing excess speculative positions. 

Crypto analyst Dom noted that futures markets witnessed one of the largest long liquidations in recent months, with nearly 80% concentrated on Bybit. Such events often reset market conditions, leaving room for a cleaner move higher. A swift recovery from this zone could propel BTC back above $117,000 in the short term. 

If the recovery is slow, Bitcoin may instead drift toward external liquidity or support around $107,200. BTC has repeatedly moved between higher time frame range highs and lows before resuming broader trends in 2025. More than $3 billion in long positions remained exposed at this level, raising the possibility of a deep liquidity grab before a bullish reversal. 

From a seasonality perspective, September has historically leaned bearish, making this scenario plausible as a short-term shakeout before stronger upside momentum into Q4.

The third and most bearish outcome would be a prolonged breakdown below $107,200, potentially extending toward $100,000. This would mark a structural shift toward bearish market conditions, with consolidation at lower levels signaling exhaustion of the current cycle. 

Supporting this risk, Glassnode highlighted that the short-term holder cost basis sits near $111,400. Sustained trading below this “battle line” between bulls and bears could cement a transition to mid- to long-term bearish structure.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has plunged by over $10,000 since its all-time high in July, leaving traders divided on whether the market has one more significant leg up left.

What Happened: Analytics provider Santiment reported on Monday that Bitcoin's drop to $112,200 from its all-time high of $123,800 has sparked the highest ""buy the dip"" chatter in 25 days.

Historically, however, heavy retail optimism often precedes further downside, raising questions about whether capitulation has occurred.

The retrace, just -8.1% over six weeks, is mild by Bitcoin's standards, as prior cycle corrections typically ran -15% to -20% before panic selling emerged.

Leverage data remains mixed: shorts spiked ahead of the drop but flipped quickly back to longs, muting prospects for a short squeeze rebound.

Social sentiment has grown more fearful, but not yet at extreme capitulation levels that mark cycle bottoms.

On-chain metrics lean bullish.

The latest drop pushed 30-day traders into negative returns for the first time in weeks, historically a favorable setup for accumulation.

Whales have added over 56,000 BTC since late August, and exchange balances continue to decline, pointing to reduced sell pressure.

What's Next: Santiment data added that another sign giving confidence is supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has continued to drop, dating back to four weeks ago.

There are 31,265 less BTC on exchanges now, during this relatively short period of time.

This means less coins are available to sell off on exchanges, which again implies limited further downside pressure.

Data also noted that continued declines in exchange supply suggest limited downside pressure.

Analysts argue a cautious dollar-cost-averaging approach around $112,000, $108,000, $104,000, $100,000, and $96,000 could balance risk if the correction deepens while positioning for a sharp rebound.

 Bitcoin's sharp fall resulted in the biggest long liquidation in a 24-hour period, and the sell-off pulled many altcoins below their immediate support levels. 

Key points:

Bitcoin witnessed the biggest long liquidation of the year, indicating that bulls are losing their grip over the market.

Several altcoins are striving to hold on to their support levels but may face solid selling on rallies.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $111,800 on Monday but has since recovered above the $112,700 level. The nasty fall was due to liquidation of leverage positions. CoinGlass said in a post on X that traders faced $1.62 billion in long liquidations in 24 hours, which was the biggest long liquidation of this year.

Select analysts are not perturbed by the fall as they anticipate BTC to turn around and charge higher in October. Since 2013, BTC has risen 10 out of 12 times in October; the last loss was way back in 2018, according to CoinGlass. BTC could hit a new all-time high in October if history repeats itself.

Another positive for the markets is the policy shift by the US Federal Reserve. Economist Timothy Peterson told Cointelegraph that the markets are underpricing the possibility of rapid rate cuts, and when the surprise effect kicks in, it could “jolt Bitcoin and alts up substantially,” in the next three to nine months.  

Could BTC and altcoins hold on to their respective support levels? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. 

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) hit another new all-time high on Monday, signaling sustained buying by the bulls.

The rally could reach 6,700, where the bears may mount a strong defense. Any dip is likely to find support at the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) (6,550). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA and breaks above 6,700, the next stop could be the 7,000 level.

Sellers will have to tug the price below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) (6,430) to weaken the bullish momentum. If they do that, the index could start a deeper correction to 6,343 and then to 6,200.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded off the 96.37 support on Wednesday, indicating that the bulls are fiercely defending the level.

The recovery is expected to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the index below the 96.37 support. If they can pull it off, the index could extend the downtrend to the 95 level.

Conversely, a break and close above the moving averages suggests that the buyers are trying to form a double bottom at 96.37. The index may recover to 99 and then to 100.50.

BTC's failure to rise above the $117,500 resistance may have attracted selling by short-term investors, which accelerated after the price broke below the moving averages.

The flattish moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the near term. Buyers are expected to defend the support of the range at $107,000 because a break below it may sink the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000.

A break and close above $117,500 on the upside signals that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The Bitcoin price may then ascend to the $124,474 resistance. Buyers will have to pierce the $124,474 level to open the gates for a rally to $141,948.

Ether (ETH) plummeted below the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on Monday, indicating that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

The ETH/USDT pair has reached the $4,060 level, which is likely to attract solid buying from the bulls. Any recovery attempt is expected to face selling at the 20-day EMA ($4,442). If the Ether price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the risk of a break below $4,060 increases. The pair could then decline to $3,745 and later to the pattern target of $3,426.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the resistance line. That suggests a range-bound action between $4,060 and $4,957 for a few days.

XRP (XRP) plunged to the $2.69 support on Monday, signaling that the bears are trying to seize control.

The long tail on the candlestick shows aggressive buying at $2.69. If buyers want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly propel the XRP price above the downtrend line. If they do that, the XRP/USDT pair may ascend to $3.40.

On the contrary, the pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern if the price closes below $2.69. That tilts the advantage in favor of the bears and increases the risk of a drop to $2.20.

BNB (BNB) turned down from the all-time high of $1,083 on Sunday, indicating profit booking by the short-term buyers.

The BNB/USDT pair could pull back to the 20-day EMA ($945) if the support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $991 cracks. 

If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it shows that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend above $1,083. If they manage to do that, the BNB price could surge to $1,187.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the pair continues lower and breaks below the 61.8% retracement level of $934. The pair may then collapse to the 50-day SMA ($872).

Solana (SOL) pulled back below the 20-day EMA ($227) and reached near the uptrend line, which is a crucial support to watch out for.

If the price rebounds off the uptrend line and rises above the 20-day EMA, it indicates solid buying on dips. The bulls will then strive to drive the SOL/USDT pair to the stiff overhead resistance at $260. 

Contrarily, a break below the uptrend line suggests that the buying pressure is reducing. The Solana price may then drop to $185 and eventually to $155. That brings the large $110 to $260 range into play.

Related: Is XRP price going to crash after falling below $3 again?

Dogecoin (DOGE) tumbled below the 20-day EMA ($0.25) on Monday, indicating that the bulls have given up.

There is support at the 50-day SMA (0.23), but the level is likely to be broken. The DOGE/USDT pair may then slump to the solid support at $0.21. That suggests the Dogecoin price could remain inside the large $0.14 to $0.29 range for some more time.

The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the $0.29 resistance to gain the upper hand. The pair may then start a new uptrend toward $0.35 and, after that, to $0.44.

Cardano's (ADA) symmetrical triangle pattern resolved to the downside on Monday, indicating an advantage to the bears.

The bulls will try to push the Cardano price back into the triangle, but may face strong selling at the breakdown level. If the ADA/USDT pair turns down sharply from the moving averages and breaks below $0.78, it signals the start of a deeper correction to $0.68.

The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the moving averages. That shows solid buying at lower levels. The pair may start a new uptrend to $1.02 if buyers thrust the price above the resistance line.

HYPE plunged below the 20-day EMA ($52.11) on Sunday, signaling that the bulls are rushing to the exit.

The HYPE/USDT pair reached the uptrend line, which attracted solid buying by the bulls as seen from the long tail on the day's candlestick. Buyers will have to kick the price above the 20-day EMA to signal that the correction may be over.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the uptrend line, it suggests that the bulls are losing their grip. The bears will then try to pull the Hyperliquid price to $40. Such a move indicates that the pair may have topped out in the short term.

On September 17, New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris issued new guidance on the use of blockchain analytics tools for covered banking institutions contemplating or already conducting virtual currency-related activities. The guidance notes that blockchain analytics tools can enhance compliance programs to mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies and prevent illegal activities. Specifically, NYDFS suggests that New York banking organizations, as well as all branches and agencies of NYDFS-licensed foreign banking organizations (collectively, “Covered Institutions”), consider the utility of blockchain analytics tools to:

 

 

The guidance notes that the above list of examples is not exhaustive and suggests that Covered Institutions consider leveraging blockchain analytics tools to enhance compliance programs and risk frameworks in a manner tailored to the institution's particular risk appetite and business model. The guidance further emphasizes that Covered Institutions must re-assess risk-management frameworks regularly in light of changing business models, new customer types, and new market entrants.

The announcement builds upon previously released NYDFS industry guidance, including the regulator's April 2022 Guidance on Use of Blockchain Analytics issued to all licensed virtual currency business entities and chartered limited purpose trust companies authorized to engage in virtual currency business activities in New York. NYDFS subsequently published its “VCRA Guidance,” which stated the regulator's expectation that all Covered Institutions seek prior approval before engaging in new or significantly different virtual currency- related activity. While the VCRA Guidance is still in effect, each of the federal banking regulators rescinded their similar guidance this year.

What's going on here?

US markets opened in the red this week, weighed down by early losses in tech stocks and cryptocurrencies, while Pfizer grabbed attention with plans to buy Metsera for $4.9 billion.

What does this mean?

Premarket trading painted a cautious picture, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and Invesco QQQ Trust each slipping 0.3% – a sign that market jitters are back, especially for tech-heavy indices. Futures for the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all pointed lower as investors weighed fresh concerns over potential US immigration rule changes, which could make it harder for tech firms to hire top talent. The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index nudged up for August but still dragged below zero, signaling the economy isn't firing on all cylinders. All eyes remain on upcoming Federal Reserve speeches for hints on monetary policy. Meanwhile, bitcoin dropped 2.4%, adding to pressure on crypto and related ETFs. In healthcare, it was a split bag, but Pfizer's all-cash $4.9 billion Metsera buyout sparked a 60% jump in Metsera's shares and nudged Pfizer up by 1.8%.

Why should I care?

For markets: Tech and crypto cast a long shadow.

Market confidence is looking shaky, as volatility in tech and crypto is making investors think twice. The immigration changes on the table could tighten the flow of skilled talent into the tech world, weighing on growth prospects – and that's showing up in early ETF losses. With the Fed staying coy and economic data still subdued, investors are treading carefully. Not surprisingly, defensive plays like gold and silver are enjoying renewed attention as folks hunt for something a bit steadier.

The bigger picture: A changing landscape for major industries.

Market turbulence has sector rotation back in the spotlight. Tech and crypto are dealing with regulatory headwinds, while healthcare and energy offer some bright spots – Pfizer's move on Metsera and fresh European energy projects are two examples. Financials and industrials remain a mixed bag as cross-border deals and rising costs test their resilience. With so many macro trends in motion, businesses and investors alike will need to stay nimble as the road ahead unfolds.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes Sells HYPE to Fund Ferrari Purchase, Stands by 126x Forecast","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/22/bitmex-co-founder-arthur-hayes-dumps-hype-for-a-ferrari-then-tells-followers-not-to-worry","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:30:02 GMT","

Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder who now runs crypto venture fund Maelstrom, sold his personal stash of Hyperliquid's HYPE tokens just weeks after predicting the asset could rally 126-fold.

Blockchain analytics service Lookonchain reported on Sunday that Hayes unloaded 96,628 HYPE — worth about $5.1 million — booking a profit of roughly $823,000, or 19%, in a month.

Not long after, Hayes confirmed the move with his trademark irreverence, posting on X: “Need to pay my deposit on the new Rari 849 Testarossa.” The comment fueled backlash from traders who accused him of pumping HYPE in August before quickly exiting.

Hayes pushed back on Monday, insisting the sale was tied to concerns laid out by his firm. “This is why we dumped $HYPE today. But don't worry 126x is still possible 2028 is a long way off,” he wrote.

Earlier today, Maelstrom published a lengthy X post outlining what it called HYPE's “first true test.” 

Starting Nov. 29, 237.8 million HYPE will begin vesting linearly over two years — unlocking nearly $500 million of tokens per month. At current prices of around $50, that represents $11.9 billion of supply entering circulation.

The post estimated Hyperliquid's buyback program could only absorb about 17% of that flow, leaving a potential $410 million monthly overhang. “Has the market priced in the sheer scale of these unlocks?” Maelstrom asked.

Maelstrom framed the looming supply shock as natural for a fast-growing protocol but warned that large vested allocations may tempt early developers and insiders to sell. The firm also noted that even large decentralized autonomous treasury (DAT) deals, such as Sonnet's $583 million HYPE raise, won't offset the scale of the unlocks.

The remarks contrasted sharply with Hayes's Aug. 27 blog post, where he called Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance” and argued HYPE could climb 126x by 2028. That thesis relied on bold assumptions: a $10 trillion stablecoin market, Hyperliquid capturing a Binance-level trading share, and fee structures holding steady.

Despite selling his tokens, Hayes reiterated that long-term view on Monday, describing the upcoming unlock as a hurdle, not a death blow. In his words, “2028 is a long way off.”

Hyperliquid has surged to become a dominant player in decentralized perpetual futures, and its HYPE token remains central to governance, staking and fee distribution. Whether the market can digest nearly $12 billion in new supply may determine if Hayes's forecast proves prescient — or overly ambitious.

AgriFORCE Growing Systems (AGRI) is rebranding as AVAX One and launching a $550 million capital raise to become the first Nasdaq-listed company focused on acquiring avalanche AVAX$31.93, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain, the company said in a press release Monday.

Anthony Scaramucci, founder of investment firm Skybridge Capital, and a long-term advocate of digital assets, is joining as the head of the firm's advisory board.

Shares of AgriFORCE were trading 132% higher following the announcement. AVAX was lower by 3% over the past 24 hours.

The company said it aims to accumulate more than $700 million worth of AVAX, giving public investors a professionally managed vehicle to gain exposure to the network, which secures $6.2 billion in staked assets and has been used by firms like JPMorgan and Apollo for tokenization initiatives.

Hivemind Capital founder Matt Zhang, who will chair the board, said AVAX One's plan is to build the “Berkshire Hathaway of the onchain financial economy,” combining disciplined token accumulation with fintech acquisitions to drive growth. 

SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci, who joins the company's advisory board alongside Coinbase institutional head Brett Tejpaul, said tokenization is “the single biggest theme for the next decade of finance” and that AVAX One offers a public-market on-ramp to participate in that shift.

The raise includes a $300 million PIPE, pending shareholder approval, and up to $250 million in additional equity-linked offerings, with participation from investors including ParaFi, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Kraken and Cypher Capital.

Big Brain Holdings, FalconX, Republic Digital, Borderless Capital, Summer Capital, GSR Ventures, Fintech Collective, Bastion Trading, CMCC Global Titan Fund, Hypersphere, Fifth Lane Capital, and HashKey Capital also participated in the raise.

AVAX One will also continue to operate AgriFORCE's existing energy infrastructure business through its TerraHash Digital division.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Arthur Hayes says he sold all his HYPE... to buy a Ferrari","https://cointelegraph.com/news/arthur-hayes-sold-all-hype-ferrari-testarossa","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 04:13:47 GMT","

 BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sold his entire HYPE stash, netting over $800,000 in profit. The move comes just weeks after his wildly bullish 126x prediction. 

BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has sold off his entire Hyperliquid (HYPE) stash  — seemingly, for a Ferrari —  just a month after he tipped the token to surge around 126x over the next three years.

“Need to pay my deposit on the new Rari 849 Testarossa,” Hayes wrote on Sept. 21. 

The post came after an X post from blockchain data platforms such as Lookonchain on Sept. 21 that said Hayes banked around $823,000 of profit on his 96,628 HYPE — netting him a 19.2% gain, according to data from HypurrScan. 

HYPE is the native token that powers the Hyperliquid decentralized derivatives exchange. HYPE was $49.48 at the time of writing, down around 8.1% over the past 24 hours, but is up a staggering 660% since it launched in late November at $6.51.

The DEX has also seen a significant uptick in trading volume last month, going from around $560 million at the start of August to an all-time high of $3.4 billion on Aug. 24, according to data from DefiLlama.  During the WebX 2025 conference in Tokyo, Hayes forecast HYPE's price to surge 126x over the next three years. 

The BitMEX co-founder argued that continued fiat debasement would drive stablecoin market expansion and push HyperLiquid's annualized fees to as high as $255 billion, up from its annualized revenue of $1.2 billion at the time. 

As it stands, Hayes hasn't yet indicated if he will dive back into HYPE. 

Looking at some of Hayes' other recent predictions that may or may not require a pinch of salt, the 40-year-old suggested last week that the crypto markets will soon enter “up only” mode as the US Treasury hit its goal of filling the General Account with $850 billion on Friday.

“With this liquidity drain complete, up only can resume,” Hayes wrote. 

Hayes also sees the price of Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $250,000 by the end of 2025, and has a history of making bold market predictions. 

Speaking with Cointelegraph Magazine in June, Hayes said he is unfazed when he gets his Bitcoin predictions wrong. “I don't know why people are hesitant to do it; it doesn't really matter at the end of the day,” he said. 

Meanwhile, some members of crypto X emphasized the importance of paying attention to what popular figures do onchain, not what they comment on in public.

Does Tylenol Use during Pregnancy Cause Autism? What the Research Shows

Trump and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. plan to tie Tylenol use during pregnancy and folate deficiencies to rising autism rates—but the evidence is thin

The Trump administration today plans to link rising rates of autism spectrum disorder to the use of Tylenol (a brand name of acetaminophen) during pregnancy, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. President Donald Trump previewed the announcement on Sunday, saying at a memorial for the late Charlie Kirk, “I think we found an answer to autism.” A press conference will take place this afternoon.

This story will be updated throughout the day.

There is no simple answer to what causes autism, more than 50 years of scientific research has shown. It is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that arises from a constellation of genetic factors and environmental influences.

What's more, the evidence linking the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to eventual autism diagnoses in children is weak. “The evidence [from a handful of studies] was really mixed, and the effects were really small,” said David Mandell, a professor of psychiatry studying autism at the University of Pennsylvania, in an interview with Scientific American earlier this month.

Acetaminophen is one of the few pain relievers deemed safe to take during pregnancy, in consultation with doctors, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). “Despite recent unfounded claims, there's no clear evidence linking prudent use to issues with fetal development. ACOG's guidance remains the same. When pain relief is needed during pregnancy, acetaminophen should be used in moderation, and after consulting your doctor,” wrote the professional body in a statement on September 5.

Here's what we know about Tylenol and the causes of autism.

The majority of autism cases can be linked to genetic causes. But that DNA blueprint doesn't determine everything: as a fertilized human egg turns into an embryo and then into a fetus, environmental factors can influence how those genetic instructions are carried out.

Some nongenetic factors have been repeatedly linked to an elevated risk of developing autism spectrum disorder. The most well-established one is parental age: the older a person's parents are at the time of that individual's conception, the more likely it is that that person will be diagnosed with autism. (But even this effect might tie back to genetics because, as people age, they accumulate more genetic mutations that they might pass on to their offspring.)

Other nongenetic factors, such as premature birth or birth by cesarean section, maternal diabetes and exposure to air pollution or certain antiseizure drugs in utero have been shown to increase a person's risk of autism in some studies. But these results can't establish that these factors caused the increased risk of autism, only that they sometimes occur together. That's because it is usually impossible, impractical or unethical to run randomized trials on pregnant populations.

READ MORE: Autism Has No Single Cause. Here's How We Know

A handful of studies from the U.S. and Europe have found modest increases in autism risk among the offspring of people who took acetaminophen while pregnant. The largest recent study, however, found no effect. The 2024 analysis looked at nearly 2.5 million people born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019. The researchers found a very small increase in the prevalence of autism among the progeny of people who took acetaminophen while they were pregnant compared with the offspring of those who didn't—the risk was 0.09 percentage points higher. This elevated risk disappeared when researchers just looked at sibling-pair cases in which a person took acetaminophen during one pregnancy and not the other, however. This suggests that what initially looked like an elevated risk of autism from acetaminophen during pregnancy may have been a result of other risk factors.

The most obvious factor that could be influencing these results is the reason people take Tylenol during pregnancy in the first place. The drug is used to relieve pain and to reduce fever. “In none of these studies do I see where [the researchers] were able to separate out the effects of prenatal infection from the acetaminophen use,” Mandell says.

This means that the fever or underlying infections Tylenol was used to treat could be part of what drove the increased risk of autism that was shown in some studies. If a pregnant person is hospitalized with an infection, the likelihood that their child will develop autism increases by approximately 30 percent, a study of more than two million people found.

“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers,” a spokesperson of Kenvue, Tylenol's manufacturer, said in a statement sent to Scientific American. 

The Trump administration reportedly also plans to link autism to low levels of folate, or vitamin B9, during pregnancy.

“We know that folate deficiency during pregnancy results in neural tube defects or increases risk for neural tube defects,” says Mandell, referring to the structure in an embryo that eventually develops into the brain and spinal cord. “There's some thought that it could also result in learning disability, developmental delay—including autism.” This idea has led many doctors and parents of people with autism to try treating the condition with B vitamins, including leucovorin, also known as folinic acid.

“Whether folate deficiency affects fetal development is a very different question than ‘Can increasing folate postnatally reduce autism symptoms?'” Mandell says. A few small, randomized controlled trials of folinic acid as a treatment for autism spectrum disorder have been conducted, and they have shown small effects.

“Should we run a large-scale randomized trial of folinic acid and autism? Absolutely. And the reason we should do it is because the science needs to catch up with practice here [because] it's already being prescribed,” Mandell continues.

Autism rates have been rising, something that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., frequently refers to as an “epidemic.” The causes of this rise are relatively well known, however. As our understanding of autism has improved, the diagnostic criteria have broadened, and a major change occurred in 2013 when autism and several other conditions were combined into one continuous spectrum disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Improved screening is alerting clinicians to more cases in children, and adults whose autism was missed when they were younger are seeking diagnoses. Additionally, improved understanding of autism has allowed for better diagnoses of people who, in prior decades, may have received other diagnoses such as “intellectual disability.”

In April Kennedy said that his Department of Health and Human Services would find the cause of autism by September. But science often does not happen on such short timelines, experts say. The administration's decision to highlight acetaminophen and folate does not come from new evidence but rather from previously published results that are mixed and point to the need for more research.

“The idea that [the administration] would highlight two things that have such small, controversial and weak evidence is really concerning,” Mandell says—“especially when we know so much about the genetics of autism, and we know so much about other environmental factors that increase the risk for autism.”

“A press statement that talks about a potential association will cause lots of fear,” said Debra Houry, former chief medical officer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a press call this morning hosted by the group Defend America Action. Houry participated alongside other former CDC leaders who had resigned this month. “If there is not the science to back it up, we will see practice changes, worried moms, all sorts of things, and that's not appropriate. You have to be grounded in gold standard science,” she said.

Looks like limestone's on the menu for some unknown creepy crawly.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

For most organisms on Earth, rocks are objects, not food. But for one oddball microbe, desert limestone seems to have been on the menu. Whether or not this mysterious form of life still exists or went extinct eons ago is, however, yet unknown.

Recently, geologist Cees Passchier from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz came across what looked like tiny burrows in marble and limestone in the deserts of Namibia, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. Erosion had exposed the fossil burrows, and while nothing was crawling in there anymore, Passchier and his research team investigated further and found biological material inside.

“A biotic origin of the observed structures supposes the presence of liquid water, without which biological growth would be impossible,” the team said in a study recently published in the Geomicrobiology Journal. “The investigated areas are currently arid, but experience occasional rain showers and regular dense coastal fog, while wet periods occurred in the past.”

So, what type of microogranisms could have made the burrows? Bacteria, fungi and lichens have shown that they can survive extreme conditions, and some of them are endolithic, meaning they live inside rocks. Passchier wanted to see if the organisms that created the burrows could possibly belong to any of these groups. Fungi can bore through rocks and leave behind tubes, and some types of cyanobacteria also thrive off limestone or marble.

It is unlikely that the mystery organisms were cyanobacteria—they need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they don't bore nearly as deep into rock as the burrows that the team found. Fungi secrete digestive agents that were not present in the rock, and they also create a complex network of hyphae, or filaments, known as a mycelium. Mycelial networks tend to have order to them. The burrows were parallel and evenly spaced, which would be unusual for fungi, and there were no other patterns observed. So, they probably aren't the culprits, either.

Because the burrows were found to be too wide to have only been made by one organism at a time, and they showed growth rings, its was more likely that they were formed by colonies of microbes. Calcium carbonate dust found in the tunnels is also a common excretion from microbes that live in these types of rocks. However, no fossilized organisms have yet been found—just evidence of their existence.

These setbacks, however, did not rule out the idea of life. On the contrary—while weathering or abiotic chemical processes can create structures mistaken for signs of life, a thorough microscopic examination showed this was not the case. The chemical composition of rock samples from inside the burrows showed that whatever made them had to have been alive.

“As no known chemical or physical weathering mechanism can explain this phenomenon with the microstructural and geochemical observations presented here, and the micro-burrows form inside the host rock,” Passchier and his colleagues said in the same study, “we suggest that they are of biological origin.”

Whatever microbes carved out the tunnels have been long dead, though there are questions around whether the mystery species still exists. Maybe it's still creeping around somewhere, digging new tunnel systems for us to one day uncover.

Before you ask, yes, there are a bunch of Star Wars sets on sale.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

There's no shortage of Lego deals during one of Amazon's big savings events, and October's Big Deal Days is no different. The e-tailer just officially announced dates for the upcoming Big Deal Days, which is its second iteration of Prime Day, and the two-day event will run from October 7 through October 8. We're already seeing price cuts across a few categories, though, and we assume this is no coincidence. Amazon likes to get started early, and we can hardly blame them. 

As the resident Lego aficionado, I've already come across a few noteworthy deals before the big event. And in case you were wondering—yes, there are plenty of Star Wars sets to be had... and for cheap. 

We rounded up some of our favorite early deals to get ahead of the curve. Of course, it would be wise to bookmark this page going forward—we expect a lot of action this time around. Be prepared for more great sets to go on sale, and I'll update this page as they continue to pop up.

Darth Vader is the ultimate Star Wars villain you love to love. He's iconic, and it's impossible to talk about Lego Star Wars without including the Sith Lord himself. Fortunately, this scarily accurate bust of him is already on sale for 20 percent off ahead of the big event.

Not all Disney remakes are created equal. Some newer live-action iterations have been universally panned, but the recent Lilo & Stitch remake was not one of them. It's created a renewed affinity for the character, and now is the time to save nearly 30 percent on one of the best Disney sets on Amazon. Outside of Star Wars, of course (I'm biased). 

You didn't think we'd have just one Star Wars set on this list, did you? We'll switch over to the good guys here, with this R2-D2 set. Featuring a 360-degree rotating head, an attachable periscope, and a detachable third leg for mobility, this droid replica feels as close to a real-life R2-D2 as humanly possible. Well, at least one made out of plastic bricks. 

Recreate the magic with this 165‑piece set for ages 7 and up. It includes Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, plus Hedwig the owl and Scabbers the rat, along with wands and a suitcase. The car features opening doors and a removable roof for easy access, and there's storage space in the boot for accessories.

You can't buy an R2-D2 set without also buying its inseparable (and objectively more annoying) droid counterpart. Another 25th anniversary centerpiece to add to your collection, this C-3PO figure scales perfectly with his little buddy and comes with a Lego C-3PO minifigure and commemorative plaque. It also features a solid  1,138 pieces, making it a more advanced yet not too challenging set.

The Millennium Falcon is probably the most iconic spaceship ever, and you can grab it for under $75. This is a significant departure from the older, albeit much larger Lego set that was released a few years ago and retailed for well over $400. Arguably one of the best Star Wars Lego sets to ever exist, this replica also comes with a Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary Brick for display to show off your fanhood. 

This set is a 598‑piece skyline‑builder that blends design, architecture, and display. It includes iconic landmarks such as the Flatiron Building, Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, One World Trade Center, and the Statue of Liberty—all built on a sleek 4×32 base topped with a “New York City” nameplate. For ages 12 and older, it offers enough challenge to engage adults, while its visual appeal and compact footprint make it a striking piece for a bedroom shelf or an office desk.

The Lego Classic Creative Brick Box is a vibrant 790‑piece building set packed with 33 different colors, specially designed pieces like doors, windows, tires and rims, plus two green baseplates. 

Ideal for kids aged 4 and older, it's a perfect starter kit or addition to any Lego collection—great for home or classroom play. The sturdy plastic storage box keeps all the bricks organized and makes cleanup easy.

While some people are not huge fans of the newer Disney Star Wars stuff, The Clone Wars remains one of the most popular pieces of Star Wars IP ever. This miniature version of Ahsoka's legendary Jedi Ineptor comes with some key minifigures, including Ahsoka Tano herself, Anakin Skywalker, and an R7-A7 Lego droid figure. It's a pretty solid replica, too, and features insane functionality like an opening cockpit for the figures, a custom space for R7-A7, fully adjustable wings, dual spring-loaded shooters, and additional lightsaber storage.

We can't not feature a car set at Popular Mechanics, right? If you've always wanted a Mercedes—but can't afford a real one (honestly, same)—this is a solid, err, miniature alternative.  This toy also features two Lego mini-figures, “drivers,” in addition to a pair of highly detailed collectible cars. Once this set is fully built, it makes for a great display piece for your room or office space.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Why alcohol blocks the liver from healing, even after you quit","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250921090859.htm","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 08:38:15 GMT","

Excessive alcohol consumption can disrupt the liver's unique regenerative abilities by trapping cells in limbo between their functional and regenerative states, even after a patient stops drinking, researchers at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and collaborators at Duke University and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago describe in a new study.

This in-between state is a result of inflammation disrupting how RNA is spliced during the protein-making process, the researchers found, providing scientists with new treatment pathways to explore for the deadly disease. The researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Communications.

The liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate itself after damage or partial removal. However, it loses that ability in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease -- the leading cause of liver-related mortality worldwide, resulting in roughly 3 million deaths annually.

""We knew that the liver stops functioning and stops regenerating in patients with alcohol-related hepatitis and cirrhosis, even when a patient has discontinued consuming alcohol, but we didn't know why,"" said U. of I. biochemistry professor Auinash Kalsotra, who co-led the study with Duke University School of Medicine professor Anna Mae Diehl. ""The only real life-saving treatment option once a patient reaches the liver failure stage in those diseases is transplantation. But if we understood why these livers were failing, maybe we could intervene.""

Both the Kalsotra and Diehl labs havestudied the molecular and cellular underpinnings of liver regeneration. Over the last five years, they found that in order to regenerate, liver cells reprogram their gene expression to revert to fetal-like progenitor cells, multiply and then reverse the process back to become mature functioning cells again. Armed with this knowledge, the group turned to the question of how those mechanisms were disrupted in alcohol-associated liver disease.

The researchers compared samples of healthy livers and samples of livers with alcohol-associated hepatitis or cirrhosis obtained from Johns Hopkins University Hospital through an initiative supported by the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.

The first thing the researchers noticed in diseased livers was that, although damaged cells had begun the process of reverting to the regenerative state, they did not complete the process and instead remained in transitional limbo.

""They are neither functional adult cells nor proliferative progenitor cells. Since they are not functioning, more pressure builds on the remaining cells. So they try to regenerate, and they're all ending up in this unproductive quasi-progenitor state, and that's what is causing liver failure,"" said U. of I. graduate students Ullas Chembazhi and Sushant Bangru, the co-first authors of the study.

To figure out why the cells were getting stuck in this state, the team investigated which proteins were being made by the liver cells and, in turn, the RNA molecules carrying the instructions for those proteins from the DNA to the cell's protein-building machinery.

While most studies focus only on the total amounts of RNA or protein in a cell, Kalsotra's team used deep RNA sequencing technology and computational analyses to zoom in on the splicing of RNA fragments, a key step in stitching together different parts of genetic instructions to make proteins.

""In comparing the samples, we saw RNA was getting misspliced broadly in alcohol-related liver disease, across thousands of genes, and it was affecting major functions of proteins,"" said Kalsotra, who also is affiliated with the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois.

The researchers found a possible driver of the RNA missplicing: Alcohol-damaged liver cells had a deficiency of the protein ESRP2, which binds to RNA to splice it properly.

""Proteins function at a very specific place in the cell, and that is directed by sequences within the protein that take the protein to that particular spot. We found that, in many cases, the sequence that dictates where the protein localizes within a cell was misspliced. That's why it was important that we did the multiple analyses we did,"" said Kalsotra, also a member of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago. ""There was the same amount of RNA and protein, but the protein was not at the right place to function. Due to missplicing, key proteins that are required for productive liver regeneration were getting stuck in the cytoplasm, when they needed to be in the nucleus.""

To verify that ESRP2 deficiency was a likely culprit, the researchers studied mice without the gene that produces ESRP2. They displayed similar liver damage and regeneration failure to that seen in patients with advanced alcohol-related hepatitis.

But why was ESRP2 missing from liver cells from patients with alcohol-related hepatitis? Upon investigation, the researchers found that liver support cells and immune cells, drawn to the liver tissue damaged by alcohol processing, released high amounts of inflammatory and growth factors. Those factors suppress ESRP2 production and activity.

To verify this finding, the researchers treated liver cell cultures with a molecule that inhibits the receptor for one of the inflammation-promoting factors. ESRP2 levels recovered and splicing activity was corrected, pointing to the pathway as a possible treatment target.

""I'm hopeful these findings will become a launching pad for future clinical studies. We can use these misspliced RNAs as diagnostic markers or develop treatments that can curb the inflammation. And if we can correct the splicing defects, then maybe we can improve recovery and restore damaged livers,"" Kalsotra said.

The research team also included U. of I. biochemistry graduate students Diptatanu Das and Subhashis Natua; U. of I. undergraduate students Katelyn Toohill, Ishita Purwar, and Anuprova Bhowmik; Brandon Peiffer and Zhaoli Sun from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Aurelia Leona and Yogesh Goyal from Northwestern University and Rajesh Dutta from Duke University School of Medicine.

Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center have discovered how a hormone interacts with a receptor on the surface of immune cells to shield cancer cells from the body's natural defenses. The findings, published in Nature Immunology, could lead to new immunotherapy approaches for treating cancer as well as potential treatments for inflammatory disorders and neurologic diseases.

""Myeloid cells are among the first group of immune cells recruited to tumors, but very quickly these tumor-fighting cells turn into tumor-supporting cells. Our study suggests that receptors on these myeloid cells get stimulated by this hormone and end up suppressing the immune system,"" said Cheng Cheng ""Alec"" Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Physiology and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center at UT Southwestern. Dr. Zhang co-led the study with first author Xing Yang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Zhang Lab.

Current immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, are effective for only about 20%-30% of cancer patients, Dr. Zhang said, suggesting that there are multiple ways that cancers evade attack from the immune system.

Several years ago, researchers in the Zhang Lab studying cancer-fighting immune cells called myeloid cells identified an inhibitory receptor called LILRB4. Stimulating this receptor blocked the myeloid cells' ability to attack tumors.

Dr. Zhang, Dr. Yang, and their colleagues then did a genome-wide screen of all proteins that might interact with LILRB4. A promising hit was a hormone called SCG2. Although researchers have suggested that SCG2 plays a role in immune response, its function and receptor were unknown. Laboratory experiments confirmed that SCG2 binds to LILRB4, kicking off a signaling cascade that turned off the cancer-fighting abilities of myeloid cells and inhibited their ability to recruit cancer-fighting T cells to tumors.

In mice genetically altered to express the human form of LILRB4, injected cancer cells that produced SCG2 grew rapidly as tumors. Treating these mice with an antibody that blocks LILRB4 significantly slowed cancer growth, as did artificially ridding the animals' bodies of SCG2.

Together, these experiments suggest that interactions between LILRB4 and SCG2 allow cancer to grow unchecked by myeloid cells, T cells, and potentially other immune cell types. Dr. Zhang suggested that disrupting this interaction could someday offer a new immunotherapy option to treat cancer. Conversely, because this interaction neutralizes myeloid cells' immune activity, delivering extra SCG2 could be a promising treatment for autoimmune or inflammatory disorders spurred by myeloid cells. Dr. Zhang and his colleagues plan to investigate both ideas in future studies.

Gestational diabetes can have long-term effects on women's health. Credit: Yui Mok/PA Images via Alamy

Last week, a study involving more than nine million pregnancies reported that children whose mothers had gestational diabetes during pregnancy had a higher chance of developing attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism than did children whose mothers didn't have the condition.

The study, presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, is under review at a peer-reviewed journal. It is not the first to link gestational diabetes to neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but it is one of the largest. Researchers pooled results from 48 studies across 20 countries, finding that children born to people with gestational diabetes had lower IQ scores, a 36% higher risk of ADHD and a 56% higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. Estimates suggest the prevalence of autism in the general population is one in 127 people1 and between 3-10%2 of children and teenagers have ADHD.

The latest results mirror those of another meta-analysis3 published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal in June, which included 56 million mother–child pairs and found that all types of diabetes in pregnancy, including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, increase the risk of the baby developing ADHD and autism. But none of these studies have been able to show that diabetes during pregnancy causes these conditions. “There's no doubt that there is a signal here, but certainly further research is required,” says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.

Long a topic of research, the causes of autism have been thrust into the spotlight by the administration of US President Donald Trump. On Sunday, while speaking at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump said: “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that?” The Washington Post reports that Trump's administration is poised to announce a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol, during pregnancy. Medical guidelines say acetominophen is safe to use during pregnancy.

Overall, genetics has the strongest influence on the risk of developing ADHD and autism. Environmental factors, such as folic-acid deficiency, air pollution and gestational diabetes, have a small-to-moderate effect on the risk of these conditions, says Ling-Jun Li, a clinician–scientist at the National University of Singapore and a co-author on the latest gestational diabetes study.

Polyakov agrees: “In practice, both genetic predisposition and environmental factors likely interact.”

Studies over the past two decades5 have shown that gestational diabetes has long-term effects on women's health, such as increasing their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease.

Li and her colleagues decided to review the evidence for effects of the condition on neurocognitive development in children.

Earlier this week I was on an email thread with someone trying to schedule a video call. “@Howie can arrange time for a 45min chat,” they wrote.

After a few emails, Howie helped confirm a time. “Any materials or agenda items you would like me to add to the meeting description?” Howie asked.

This seemed like a typical back-and-forth email-based coordination. Except Howie isn't a real person.

Howie is a new AI-powered assistant that lives in your email inbox and wants to establish itself as the go-to AI secretary for anyone who schedules a lot of meetings.

The Seattle startup that developed the tool just raised $6 million in seed funding after racking up more than 1,000 paying customers. 

The round was led by True Ventures, with participation from a roster of well-known investors including Jason Calacanis; Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity; Jordi Hays of TBPN; Rahul Vohra of Superhuman; and others.

Howie's software acts like a virtual executive assistant for busy professionals who spend much of their time on external calls. Users can simply cc Howie on an email thread, and the system will coordinate times, add events to calendars, follow up if needed, and even audit schedules to flag conflicts.

Customers include startup founders juggling fundraising and sales, venture capitalists managing deal flow, journalists scheduling interviews, and consultants and recruiters.

Since its private beta, Howie has been scheduling more than 5,000 meetings each week for its paying customers. The company says it has grown monthly recurring revenue and usage by an average of 50% month-over-month in 2025. 

Howie enters a crowded market with numerous AI assistant startups trying to automate back-office tasks. Perplexity just launched a similar email assistant for Outlook or Gmail. Xembly, another Seattle startup, raised $15 million for its AI executive assistant product but shut down last year.

Howie pitches its differentiator as a mix of customization and accuracy. Customers define preferences in an open-ended document — such as “if it's a pitch call, set it to 25 minutes and use Zoom” — that lets Howie adapt to individual workflows.

Behind the scenes, the system runs tasks through multiple fine-tuned language models, escalating uncertain cases to human reviewers. That hybrid approach is designed to deliver reliability on par with a human executive assistant.

Howie charges $25/month for its standard offering and $95/month for a premium version that allows users to rename Howie, among other features.

CEO Austin Petersmith and co-founder Dave Newman first worked together at Assembly in 2013, and even prototyped an AI assistant in 2015 — ultimately deciding the market wasn't ready. They believe now is the right time. “Now it's not too early, so here we are,” Petersmith told GeekWire. 

Howie is based in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. Its nine-person team includes five former founders, including two Y Combinator alums.

Petersmith previously founded Capiche, which was acquired by Vendr. 

Other investors in Howie include Sophia Amoruso of Trust Fund; Turner Novak of Banana Capital; Gaby Goldberg of Rostra; Lindel Eakman of Foundry Group; Sheel Mohnot; Resolute Ventures; PJC; and Roo Capital. Seattle tech vet Diego Oppenheimer is also an investor — “I could not live without Howie at this point,” he tells GeekWire.

Nvidia announced Monday it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a deal to build out massive data centers for training and running AI models. The companies say they signed a letter of intent to deploy 10 gigawatts — enough to power millions of homes — worth of Nvidia systems to power OpenAI's next generation of AI infrastructure. 

The deal may help OpenAI as it reduces its reliance on Microsoft, its largest investor and supplier of cloud computing resources. In January, Microsoft announced changes to its partnership with OpenAI, allowing the ChatGPT-maker to build additional AI infrastructure with other partners. Since then, OpenAI has teamed up with various partners on AI data center projects, such as Stargate. Nvidia says the deal will complement existing partnerships OpenAI has, including agreements with Microsoft, Oracle, and SoftBank.

OpenAI says it will work with Nvidia as a “preferred strategic compute and networking partner” for its AI factory growth. It's unclear whether Nvidia's investment will be paid out in chips, cloud credits, cash, or otherwise.

It takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product – and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there's a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade – with much of that money coming from AI companies themselves. Along the way, they're placing immense strain on power grids, and pushing the industry's building capacity to its limit.

Below, we've laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We'll keep it updated as the boom continues, and the numbers climb even higher.

Microsoft's $1 billion investment in OpenAI

This is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: in 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI – and as the demands of model-training became more intense, more of Microsoft's investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion – a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.

The partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft's cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn't meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.

OpenAI's arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it's become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company's hardware to make it better-suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Loveable and Windsurf as “primary computing partners,” although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company's GPUs.

The rise of Oracle

On June 30th 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner, more than the company's cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of the OpenAI's string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company's stock went shooting up.

A few months later, it happened again. On September 10th, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle's stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers – and a financial force to be reckoned with.

Building tomorrow's hyperscale data centers

For companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated – although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure through the end of 2028. In just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company's growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. 

That kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk's xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county's largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.

The Stargate moonshot

Just two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named “Stargate” after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history. Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, ​​”I think this will be the most important project of this era.” 

In broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman's business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.

As the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.

Yet much of the safety critical code we rely on for critical infrastructure (nuclear reactors, aircraft, drones, etc) is not tested in-situ. It is tested via simulation, but thete's minimal testing in the operating environment which can be quite complex. Instead the code follows carefully chosen design patterns, including data structures and algorithms, to ensure that the code is hazard-free, fault-tolerant and capable of graceful degradation.So, testing has its place, but testing is really no better than simulation. And in simulation, the outputs are only as good as the inputs. It cannot guarantee code safety and is not a substitute for good software design (read: structures and algorithms).Having said that, fuzzing is a hreat way to find bugs in your code, and highly recommended for any software that exposes an API.

Of course, ""testing,"" is in the eye of the beholder.Some folks are completely into TDD, and insist that you need to have 100% code coverage tests, before writing one line of application code, and some folks think that 100% code coverage unit tests, means that the system is fully tested.I've learned that it's a bit more nuanced than this[0].[0] https://littlegreenviper.com/testing-harness-vs-unit/

If you focus on testing over data structures, you might end up testing something that you didn't need to test because you used the wrong data structures.IMHO too often people dont consider big O because it works fine with their 10 row test case.... And then it grinds to a halt when given a real problem

The article is saying that it's more important to write tests than it is to learn how to write data structures.  It specifically says you should learn which data structures you should use, but don't focus on knowing how to implement all them.It calls out, specifically, that you should know that `sort` exists but you really don't need to know how to implement quicksort vs selection sort.

You don't have to go super deep on all the sort algorithms, sure. That's like saying that learning testing implies writing a mocking library

The main benefit of being familiar with how data structures and algorithms work is that you become familiar with their runtime characteristics and thus can know when to reach for them in a real problem.The author is correct here.  You'll almost never need to implement a B-Tree.  What's important is knowing that B-Trees have log n insertion times with good memory locality making them faster than simple binary trees.  Knowing how the B-Tree works could help you in tuning it correctly, but otherwise just knowing the  insertion/lookup efficiencies is enough.

The boil down the tests I like to see.  Structure them with ""Given/when/then"" statements.  You don't need a framework for this, just make method calls with whatever unit test framework you are using.  Keep the methods small, don't do a whole lot of ""then""s, split that into multiple tests.  Structure your code so that you aren't testing too deep.  Ideally, you don't need to stand up your entire environment to run a test.  But do write some of those tests, they are important for catching issues that can hide between unit tests.[1] https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/

I've not ran into a case where I can apply a bloom filter.  I keep looking because it always seems like it'd be useful.  The problem I have is bloom filter has practically reverse characteristics from what I want.  It gives false positives and true negatives.  I most often want true positives and false negatives.

NASA aims to return astronauts to the Moon by mid-2027—a feat that would fulfill a decade of preparation. The agency may have to extend that timeline even further, however, as slow progress on SpaceX's lunar lander threatens to delay the Artemis 3 mission.

During a public meeting on Friday, members of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel warned that the Human Landing System (HLS) version of Starship could be “years late,” SpaceNews reports. The panel reached that conclusion following a visit last month to SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas.

“The HLS schedule is significantly challenged and, in our estimation, could be years late for a 2027 Artemis 3 Moon landing,” said panelist Paul Hill, former director of Mission Operations at NASA.

Putting American boots back on the Moon is a top priority for NASA. With a new space race underway, global powers including the U.S., China, and Russia are vying for a first-mover advantage.

Whoever reaches the lunar surface first will be able to set certain ground rules about who can do what and where. This would not only reinforce that country's influence on the Moon and in space but also give it strategic leverage as military operations increasingly depend on space-based assets.

“This is a pivotal moment for our nation's space program,” said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during a hearing on legislative priorities for NASA earlier this month. He went on to emphasize that space has become a “strategic frontier with direct consequences for national security, economic growth, and technological leadership.”

In 2021, NASA contracted Elon Musk's SpaceX to build a version of Starship capable of landing astronauts on the Moon. At that time, the agency aimed to accomplish a landing by 2024, but that target date has been pushed back in recent years.

Development of Starship HLS has slowed significantly as SpaceX has struggled with repeated explosive failures this year. While Starship's most recent test flight on August 26 was a success, unmet technical milestones have piled up.

One major issue is demonstrating the cryogenic propellant transfer needed to refuel Starship in low-Earth orbit before the rocket heads to the Moon, Hill said during the Friday meeting. Developmental delays for Starship 3—the first iteration capable of in-orbit fuel transfers—have slowed progress toward this goal.

Hill also pointed to potentially competing priorities for SpaceX between Starlink and Starship HLS, SpacePolicyOnline.com reports. Starship 3 will be integral in launching the third generation of Starlink satellites while simultaneously creating the on-orbit fuel depots and lunar lander for Artemis 3.

“The next six months of Starship launches will be telling about the likelihood of HLS flying crew in 2027 or by the end of the decade,” Hill said.

Despite these concerns, the panelists emphasized that SpaceX is still the only launch provider for the job. “There is no competitor, whether government or industry, that has this full combination of factors that yield this high a manufacturing and flight tempo, with their direct effects on reliability increases and cost reduction,” Hill said.

The downside to relying on SpaceX, however, is clear: Without a launch-ready Starship HLS by 2027, Artemis 3 won't get off the ground on time.

Back in 2023, NASA selected Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin to provide a second lunar lander, dubbed Blue Ghost, to be used during the Artemis 5 mission later this decade. The contract is worth $3.4 billion and includes a development team consisting of Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Draper, Astrobotic, and Honeybee Robotics.

10 out of 34 provinces are affected, so far, with repercussions feared by the business and educational sectors.

Afghanistan's fiber networks are being disconnected by the governing Taliban. The reason for the ban on fast internet connectivity is to “prevent immorality,” according to a Taliban spokesman, as quoted by Sky News. As many as 10 out of 34 provinces in the country have already been affected, according to sources.

⚠️ Update: Metrics show further declines to internet connectivity in #Afghanistan with parts of the country now falling offline; the Taliban measure curtails liberties recently gained by the public and women in particular to participate in society despite restrictions on movement pic.twitter.com/thaxpc90UZSeptember 17, 2025

The order to enforce the internet ban seems to have been passed last week. Internet Observatory organization NetBlocks was quick to observe drastic declines in internet connectivity in several parts of Afghanistan. If you expand the above Tweet, you can see internet connectivity in Helmand, Kandahar, Kunduz, and Balkh drop off a cliff starting from around September 15.

Some sources report that mobile networks are still operational in the provinces where the fiber services have been cut. However, this wireless alternative is slow and expensive.

While the shuttering of fiber networks seems to have started in the north of the country, local media reports indicate that the fiber ban will be rolled out nationwide.

The Taliban spokesman quoted in the intro indicated that “an alternative will be built within the country for necessities.” This may suggest a network with pared-back bandwidth, possibly to allow easy communications, without the fast fiber-enabled transmission of high-quality streaming video, and so on. Alternatively, a plan to implement a tightly controlled domestic-only internet system, as used by the likes of North Korea, might be under consideration.

Some Afghans have protested the “complete ban” on fiber internet that is in the midst of being implemented. Sky News quotes business owners who are very concerned about the effects of the internet restrictions. Of course, banks, online traders, and media organizations could all face dire effects. Other groups are worried about the potential impacts on girls seeking educational resources after being restricted from schools.

“The Taliban measure curtails liberties recently gained by the public and women in particular to participate in society despite restrictions on movement,” observes NetBlocks.

Just don't expect DDR6 any time soon.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


When the DDR5 specification was introduced in 2020, one of the things that impressed us was the headroom left for further development of the technology, both in terms of performance and in terms of per-device capacity. You can revisit our 2020 thoughts on DDR5 for a quick refresher.

Five years later, DDR5 has still not achieved everything that was specified in the original JEDEC document. In 2024, the organization further enhanced performance capabilities and even added an anti-rowhammer feature to the spec. But what do these changes in headroom and extensions mean for enthusiasts?

Before we proceed with the evolution of DDR5, let's debunk a rumor about DDR6 arriving in the next couple of years, because it is not.

The earliest time that you can expect DDR6 to arrive on consumer platforms is late 2029, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. It remains to be seen when DDR6 arrives on data center platforms, but typically, this segment adopts new-generation memory technologies later than their consumer counterparts. Of course, there are bandwidth-hungry AI applications, but they will likely be fine with the bandwidth-boosting MRDIMM tech for a while. So, with that said, DDR5 is here to stay, albeit coming in different forms than we're used to today.

Just like logic chips, to improve the performance, power, and area (PPA) of new DRAM device, memory makers need to utilize new process technologies. Virtually all major steps in performance, capacity, and costs of DRAM are driven by new process nodes. For example, Samsung's 14nm (D1α) DRAM technology, featuring up to five EUV layers, enabled the company to build the world's first 24 Gb DDR5-7200 memory device in late 2021, ahead of the industry.

 




The leading memory makers — Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix — have developed multiple generations of 10nm-class fabrication processes, starting from 17nm – 19nm in the mid-2010s and all the way to ~12nm today. Now, Micron and SK hynix have introduced (1, 2) their 6th Generation 10nm-class process technologies — the so-called 1γ (1-gamma) or 1c nodes, and have even begun shipping actual products based on this node.

By contrast, Samsung seems to be a little behind with its 1γ/1c process, which will have an impact on its actual product roadmap. However, keep in mind that Samsung's D1β (5th Gen 10nm-class) has a feature size of 12.5nm, which is smaller than its closest competitors. Micron's G5 10nm node sports a 13nm feature size, whereas SK hynix's 5th Gen 10nm-class node offers a feature size of 12.65nm, according to TechInsights.

The 1γ/1c process technology is an important node for all DRAM makers, as it's primed for use in the creation of high-capacity, high-performance DDR5 DRAM, as well as HBM4, GDDR7, and LPDDR5X memory devices.

However, the next-generation 1δ/1d production node will likely be even more important, as it will be the last 10nm-class node that will rely on the 6F2 cell design, which has been used for over a decade.

It's anticipated that the new 4F2 cell structure for sub-10nm nodes will replace 6F2. The 1δ/1d process technologies are also expected to be introduced in the second half of 2026, though their ramp times remain to be seen. But, this is anticipated to be a real DRAM breakthrough, which will come to market toward the end of the decade, alongside the sub-10nm manufacturing processes.

The first sub-10nm production nodes are expected to arrive in late 2027 – 2028 at the earliest, with Samsung potentially leaping ahead of its rivals, according to TechInsights.

In 2024, JEDEC released an updated version of its JESC79-JC5 specification, which defines DDR5 technology, and it officially extends DDR5 support to 8800 MT/s, as well as adding features like improved I/O training through Self-Refresh Exit Clock Sync.

 




This update reflects consensus among major memory and controller developers that DDR5-8800 is technically and economically feasible. The spec also defines the timings of CL62 for premium chips and CL78 for lower-grade ones, maintaining an absolute latency around 14ns despite higher CAS latency.

Traditionally, JEDEC specifications are extremely conservative, so Micron envisions that its DDR5 DRAMs made using its 1γ/1c fabrication process will hit data transfer rates of up to 9200 MT/s. SK hynix is also prepping 9200 MT/s memory devices with capacities up to 32 Gb, thus bringing together performance and capacity. However, speed bins beyond 9200 MT/s are not officially listed by anyone, to our knowledge.

Such DDR5-9200 32 Gb ICs are projected to hit the market relatively soon, then leading makers of enthusiast-grade memory modules will extract additional performance from such devices. You should expect high-performance 32 GB modules from the usual suspects — think Corsair, G.Skill, and V-Color — to hit 9600 MT/s on higher-end motherboards.

 




Intel is working hard to improve memory performance on its platforms, so industry insiders expect DDR5-10,000 modules to arrive with Intel's Arrow Lake-S Refresh CPUs later this year or early next year, with DDR5-10700 to follow later on.

It's expected that some of these ultra-high-performance DDR5 modules will be CUDIMMs, equipped with a clock driver (CKD). The CKD regenerates the clock signal, which drives the actual memory chips, ensuring signal integrity and thus achieving stability and reliability at high data transfer rates.

For now, CUDIMMs are only officially supported by Intel platforms. However, AMD is expected to introduce CUDIMM and then CSODIMM (SODIMM with a CKD) support sometime in 2026, likely beginning with Granite Ridge Refresh with speeds up to 10,000 MT/s, and then extending to next-generation CPUs based on the Zen 6 microarchitecture (e.g., Medusa Point) with speeds up to 10,700 MT/s or higher. Keep in mind that the information is strictly unofficial at this point.

However, even before the CUDIMM support arrives, AMD plans to offer an enhancement that will enable high data transfer rates and low latencies on its consumer platforms, according to sources familiar with the topic. For now, the company is considering targets in the range of DDR5-6400 at CL26, which will reduce absolute latency to 8ns —a feat unprecedented even for enthusiast-grade DDR5.

As we noted earlier in this article, new production technologies enable DRAM makers not only to boost performance or lower power consumption of their chips, but also to increase the capacity of their memory ICs. This is expected to continue toward even 64 Gb DDR5 ICs.

 




The DDR5 specification and 1α/1a process technologies enabled DRAM producers to build 24 Gb DDR5 devices, enabling 24 GB, 48 GB, and 96 GB memory modules for client and server applications. With 1β/1b and 1γ/1c production nodes, we're looking at 32 Gb DDR5 ICs, which let memory module makers build unbuffered DIMMs and CUDIMMs with 64 GB, 128 GB (Micron is currently offering DDR5-8000 RDIMMs, for example), or even 256 GB capacities.

Currently, there are no confirmed plans for 48Gb or 64Gb DDR5 ICs with a definitive launch window, which suggests that they are still in the early planning stages. However, according to TechInsights, memory makers are seeking to achieve 48 Gb ICs, based on 1δ/1d process technologies sometime in 2027 – 2028.

As for 64 Gb DDR5 devices — the apex of DDR5 development — they will likely be reserved primarily for high-capacity data center-grade applications arriving from 2030 and onwards. Such ICs will likely be made using sub-10nm production nodes — think 0x (1st Gen) or even 0y (2nd Gen) and will therefore adopt 4F2 cell structures.

Speaking of data center applications, we cannot avoid mentioning multiplexed rank dual inline memory modules (MRDIMMs), which have been developed to overcome the bandwidth limitations of traditional RDIMMs. MRDIMMs run two DDR memory ranks in multiplexed mode, using a multiplexing registered clock driver (MRCD) chip for simultaneous rank access and 10 multiplexing data buffer (MDB) chips for data multiplexing. This setup enables supporting CPUs to communicate with MRDIMMs at an 8800 MT/s data transfer rate, while the memory chips operate at half speed to reduce latency and power use.

 




Intel's Xeon 6 platform is the first processor to support MRDIMMs, and the CPUs can work with the 1st-generation MRDIMMs at a data transfer rate of 8800 MT/s. However, not all Xeon 6-based servers use MRDIMMs, which is to be expected from a new technology.

The industry is now working on 2nd Generation MRDIMMs with capacities of 256 GB and above, as well as speeds of 12,800 MT/s. Such modules will be supported by AMD's EPYC 'Venice' and presumably 'Verano' CPUs in 2026 and 2027, respectively, as well as Intel's Xeon 'Diamond Rapids' and 'Coral Rapids' processors due in the second half of this decade. Each 2nd Gen MRDIMM will support a bandwidth of 102.4 GB/s, so a CPU with 16 memory channels will feature a peak bandwidth of 1.6 TB/s.

We have no indications whether there will be a 3rd Generation MRDIMM, but don't be too surprised if there is. Just keep in mind that DDR5 has a lot of headroom, with up to 8800 MT/s for memory devices, and therefore up to 17,600 MT/s in multiplexed mode — all within the latest specification.

DDR5 memory continues to evolve with higher data transfer rates and higher capacities thanks to advanced process nodes like 1γ/1c and upcoming 1δ/1d, pushing DRAM ICs all the way to 9200 MT/s and enabling enthusiast-class memory modules with DDR5-10,000 or even DDR5-10,700 speed bins with appropriate CPUs.

As DDR6 is unlikely to arrive before 2029 – 2030, DDR5 will remain dominant, with ultra-fast CUDIMMs for client PCs and high-bandwidth MRDIMMs supporting next-gen platforms from AMD and Intel. With MRDIMMs, in particular, next-generation data center bandwidth is already reaching 8800 MT/s, with 2nd Gen versions targeting 12,800 MT/s in the second half of the decade.

Prescriptions for what researchers deemed “essentially placebo,” are given frequently by general practitioners (GPs) in Israel and 20 European countries to a small percentage of patients, according to data from a survey study. Studies in the US have also tracked the use of placebo treatments. 

“This suggests that essentially placebo prescriptions were common at a population level, which poses risks for the patient-GP relationship and creates medical risks for patients,” wrote the authors, led by Fabian Wolters, MSc, with Unit Health, Medical, and Neuropsychology at Leiden University in Leiden, the Netherlands. Findings were published online in JAMA Network Open.

The survey study included 952 respondents across the 21 countries. The median prescription rate for placebo treatments was once every 2 weeks or in 0.7% of all consultations; 84% indicated they had prescribed an essentially placebo treatment at least once.

The researchers defined essentially placebo treatments to participants as “when, in your estimation, any positive treatment effect on the patient's symptoms is not caused by the pharmacological or biological components of the treatment.”

That definition is a key strength of the research, Michael Bernstein, PhD, director of the Medical Expectations Lab in the Department of Radiology at Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, told Medscape Medical News.

Defining “placebo” has been tricky in past research, he said. The authors wrote that previous studies have drawn a line between “pure” placebos (those with no active ingredients, such as a sugar pill) and “impure” placebos (they have an active ingredient, but it will not help resolve current concerns), such as an antibiotic for a viral infection.

He also praised the gathering of results from 21 countries because previous studies “have been done in one country, which makes comparisons more difficult because methodology differs from one country to the next,” he said.

Bernstein said that having worked in this area, he is not surprised by the frequency of placebo prescribing but said patients might be.

He pointed to some previous papers, among them a 2008 paper in the BMJ that found about half of the 679 surveyed internists and rheumatologists in the US reported prescribing placebo treatments regularly (46%-58%, depending on how the question was phrased).

The American Medical Association (AMA) in its code of medical ethics has guidance on prescribing placebo and said physicians may use placebos for diagnosis or treatment only if they: enlist the patient's cooperation, obtain the patient's general consent to administer placebo, and avoid giving a placebo merely to mollify a difficult patient.

“I would say by that standard, my reading of this is that what's being done probably violates this AMA code of ethics in a great many cases,” Bernstein said. “I think there's a clear understanding and expectation that an inactive placebo is not ethical. Even an active placebo would not be ethical aside from a very narrow set of circumstances, and I think physicians very rarely meet that very narrow set of circumstances.”

Bernstein said it's hard to determine the prevalence of prescribing placebo in the US with small numbers of studies across a number of specialties and the definition of frequent placebo prescribing “far from clear.”

He added that there are many cases in which placebo is effective, which complicates the equation. He noted physicians have multiple responsibilities to their patients. One is to give patients treatments to improve their health and that could include placebo. Another duty we accept, he said, “at least in the US, is that physicians also have a duty to be transparent to their patients. There's a tension between these two duties.” 

In an accompanying editorial,Pekka Louhiala, DMedSci, PhD, with the Faculty of Social Sciences at Tampere University in Tampere, Finland, said a limitation of Wolters' study is the relatively low number of participants per country and different response rates between countries.

She said future research should focus not on the precise prevalence of prescribing essentially placebo treatments because these findings are clear that the practice occurs regularly. Instead, she wrote, future research should focus on the reasons the decisions are made and the outcomes of the decisions.

“Such research could offer valuable insights into how physicians conceptualize medicine — as both a science and a practice,” she wrote. “The potential impact of these prescriptions on the physician-patient relationship and on trust in healthcare more broadly should also be examined.”

Wolters and Louhiala reported no relevant conflicts of interest. This study was supported by a Netherlands Organisation Scientific Research — Vici grant. Bernstein reported being a co-author of the book “The Nocebo Effect: When Words Make You Sick.”

Melatonin use had inconsistent results in improving sleep and relieving itching among children with atopic dermatitis (AD), a caregiver survey found. 

“Melatonin is widely used in children with AD, with high rates of self-directed initiation, considerable variability in dosing, and mixed caregiver perceptions of effectiveness,” the authors wrote. “Further research — including RCTs [randomized controlled trials] and longitudinal studies — is needed to clarify melatonin's effect on sleep disturbance and to better define its potential role in the management of children with AD,” they added.

The study was led by Sarah Lee of Harvard Medical School, Boston, and was published online on September 9 in Pediatric Dermatology.

The single-center design and reliance on caregiver reports limited the generalizability of the findings. Sleep outcomes were not objectively measured, and reasons for discontinuation were not captured. Selection bias may also have influenced results.

This study received no specific funding. Three authors reported serving as consultants, investigators, and advisory board members for Global Parents for Eczema Research, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Emerald Innovations, Triveni Bio, and the National Eczema Association. The remaining authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

In a phase 3 trial of 246 patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene overexpression, tamibarotene plus azacitidine did not significantly improve complete remission rates compared to placebo plus azacitidine. The complete remission rates were 23.81% vs 18.75% (P = .2084), though higher transfusion independence was achieved in the combination arm.

“The success of the SELECT-MDS-1 trial was as an efficiently accrued international phase 3 trial that was biomarker driven, the first of its kind in MDS. Although the doublet combination tested in SELECT-MDS-1 with tamibarotene failed to meet the primary endpoint, it is noteworthy in a trial conducted at so many sites, to demonstrate an azacitidine monotherapy CR [complete remission] rate similar to that of modern azacitidine control arms,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Amy DeZern, MD, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. It was published online in Blood Advances.

According to the authors, the lack of central pathology review and overall survival analysis data limited the understanding of clinical benefits. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events was more than twice as high in the tamibarotene arm than in the control arm, potentially limiting the ability of patients to achieve complete remission and proceed to transplant. Additionally, investigators may have developed bias in treatment assignment due to observable side effects like hypertriglyceridemia or skin changes, possibly leading to early discontinuation before response could be achieved.

This study was supported by Syros Pharmaceuticals Inc. Amy DeZern, MD, disclosed having relationships with AbbVie, Agios, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Kura, Geron, Servier, Keros, and Shattuck Labs. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

In a collaboration between Turun yliopisto and the University of Turku, researchers led by Birgitta Paranko and Lauri Nummenmaa explored the immediate effects of bullying on the brain. 

As reported in their JNeurosci paper, the researchers measured neural and attentional responses while tweens (aged 11 to 14) and adults watched first-person videos of either people being bullied or more positive social interactions. For participants of all ages, bullying triggered distressful alarm states, activating social and emotional brain networks as well as autonomic threat response systems. Measuring eye-tracking responses and pupil sizes in a separate group of adults during video viewing supported these findings, showing stronger emotional and attentional responses to bullying than other social interactions. The researchers also discovered that these neural responses and alarm states were linked to viewers having previous real-life experiences being victims of bullying. 

In sum, says Nummenmaa, ""We mapped distress pathways in the brain that may be promptly engaged when someone gets bullied, and showed that the continuous alarm state is hazardous for both mental and somatic health due to the increased autonomic activation.""

Mass General Brigham study also finds link to violent behaviors such as carrying a weapon, highlighting the vicious cycle between lack of sleep and violence.

New research led by Mass General Brigham researchers reveals an association between insufficient sleep and the witnessing of neighborhood violence by adolescents. Based on nationwide survey data from more than 40,000 teenagers, the study also showed that individuals who slept less than the recommended 8-10 hours per night were more likely to engage in violent behaviors, such as carrying weapons or fighting. Results are published in SLEEP.

This is one of the first studies to connect community violence with how much teenagers actually sleep. It's a reminder that sleep isn't just an individual health habit, it's also shaped by the safety and stability of the communities our kids live in.""

Cornelia Griggs, MD, first author, pediatric surgeon and critical care specialist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Surgery

To identify links between violence and sleep, the researchers analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national Youth Risk Behavior Survey for 2019, 2021 and 2023. In the survey, respondents were asked questions, including how many hours of sleep they get on an average school night, whether they have ever witnessed violence in their neighborhood, and whether they have carried weapons or been in a physical fight in the past 30 days.

Altogether, the researchers analyzed surveys from 44,161 young adults aged 14-19 years old. More than three-quarters of respondents (77%) reported getting insufficient sleep on an average school night (defined as less than eight hours for older children and adolescents), and 10% reported getting four hours of sleep or less.

Individuals who reported getting insufficient sleep were more likely to report having witnessed someone getting physically attacked, beaten, stabbed, or shot in their neighborhood, and this association became stronger with each additional hour of sleep lost. For individuals who slept four hours or less, the odds of having been exposed to violence increased nearly threefold.

Getting insufficient sleep was also strongly linked to higher odds of violent behaviors such as carrying a weapon, getting into physical fights, being threatened or injured at school, and skipping school due to feeling unsafe. Similarly, each of these associations was strongest for individuals who reported the least amount of sleep (four hours or less).

""This study sheds light on how insufficient sleep can contribute to cycles of violence,"" said senior author Rebecca Robbins, PhD, a sleep researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders. ""Future efforts should include advocacy around noise reduction and reducing nighttime violence, which could promote healthier sleep habits in communities that are disproportionately impacted by violence.""

Surprisingly, the 1.6% of respondents who reported getting more than the recommended amount of sleep - defined as 10 hours or more - also had increased odds of both having witnessed violence and of engaging in violent behaviors.

""One possible explanation for this association is that adolescents with longer sleep duration may be experiencing underlying conditions such as depression, anxiety, or sleep disorders,"" said Robbins. ""More sleep isn't always better.""

The researchers plan to conduct further research to understand how gun violence impacts sleep in young people and how insufficient sleep is linked to violent behavior. They're also working with communities to promote healthy sleep and to support people impacted by gun violence.

You have come to the ESPN Africa edition, for other ESPN editions, click above.

Steve Nicol criticises Mikel Arteta for an overly conservative approach in Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Manchester City. (1:52)

The South African Football Association says it is unconcerned by FIFA's decision to open disciplinary proceedings against them for fielding suspended midfielder Teboho Mokoena in a FIFA World Cup qualifier against Lesotho.

FIFA confirmed this week it had opened a case after South Africa used Mokoena in their 2-0 win over Lesotho in March, despite the midfielder having accumulated two yellow cards earlier in the qualifiers, which should have triggered an automatic one-match suspension.

""We've received communication from FIFA about the investigation that they have launched in terms of the Lesotho match that Teboho Mokoena was fielded,"" SAFA chief executive Lydia Monyepao confirmed to reporters on Thursday in South Africa.

""We are preparing our response to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee because that is what ultimately is required from us as an association.""

According to the FIFA Disciplinary Code: ""If a team fields a player who is not eligible to participate (due to suspension, registration issues, nationality, etc.), the match is automatically forfeited. The default result is a 3-0 loss, unless the actual result was even more disadvantageous to the offending team.""

The Nigerian Football Federation have welcomed the decision, which gives the Super Eagles a slim hope of qualifying. They sit in third place in Group C, with 11 points, while Bafana lead the group on 17.

""It is nothing less than is expected,"" said NFF Director of Communications Ademola Olajire.

""They have started a process that should have started maybe a little earlier and we now await the outcome.

""But for us, our focus remains on making sure that the Super Eagles can win their remaining two games and see what happens after that.""

Monyepao, who played for SA's women's national team Banyana Banyana, said SAFA would focus on making the consequences of that investigation moot but winning their remaining qualifying fixtures.

She added: ""We are not really worried about that. I think our focus right now is to ensure that Bafana Bafana gets maximum points come October because whatever happens, whether there is docking of points or whatever you're saying out there, if we get six points come October, nothing else is going to matter.""

If South Africa are sanctioned, it would dramatically alter Group C in African qualifying. Bafana Bafana currently top the group with 17 points, three ahead of Benin and six clear of Nigeria and Rwanda.

Docking three points and three goals would leave Bafana level with Benin on 14. Crucially, the West Africans would go top of the group with a superior goals difference of +4, as Bafana would drop from +8 to +2, with two matches to play next month.

The possibility of sanctions has hung over the group for months after FIFA delayed action, fueling speculation in South Africa that the governing body might let the matter slide. Bafana coach Hugo Broos even said at one point he thought they had gotten away with it.

""We did something bad, we did something we shouldn't do, but there was no complaint,"" Broos told reporters in the pre-match press conference before the last round of matches.

Opponents were less forgiving. Benin coach Gernot Rohr, whose team is chasing South Africa at the top of the standings, criticized FIFA's silence.

""It is not normal that we don't know the situation about the points on the log table before our games,"" Rohr told reporters in the pre-match press conference ahead of their last game in September.

""Normally, South Africa should lose three points and they should go to Lesotho. But nobody knows why they did not take this decision. FIFA should now very quickly give the decision.""

Rohr was speaking from experience. In 2018, when he was Nigeria coach, the Super Eagles were docked the points and goals for using Shehu Abdullahi against Algeria while suspended. Ultimately, the lapse did not cost Nigeria qualification, as the Super Eagles had amassed more than enough points.

Cape Verde also suffered a similar fate when they lost out of the 2014 playoffs for fielding an ineligible player against Tunisia, handing their spot to the North Africans, that they had beaten in a huge upset win.

This time, although SAFA have admitted their error, they are banking on results on the field to render any punishment irrelevant, just like Nigeria in 2018.

""It is all about Bafana Bafana getting to USA, Mexico and Canada in 2026,"" Monyepao said.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Emilio Nava built on his career-best year Sunday at the ATP Challenger Tour event in Villa Maria, Argentina, where the American captured his fourth title of 2025. Nava and Borna Coric are now tied atop the Challenger season leaderboard with four titles each.


Returning to action for the first time since the US Open, Nava dropped just one set en route to the title and ousted home hope Alex Barrena 6-3, 6-3 in the final.

“I had a pretty good week,” said the bilingual Nava in Spanish. “My team and I did a good job. I like [the Argentine crowd] because it adds a little more tension [when facing an Argentine] and it makes everything a little more fun when the crowd is at 100 per cent. I loved it.”


Nava, who is coached by Argentine Diego Cristin, has earned all six of his Challenger trophies on clay. Earlier this season, he went on a 19-match winning streak on the surface, a run during which he won three titles (Asuncion, Concepcion and Sarasota) and finished runner-up in Tallahassee. 


The 23-year-old made his Top 100 debut last Monday and is currently No. 90 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

George Russell and Kimi Antonelli finished second and fourth in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, marking Mercedes best combined result since the Canadian Grand Prix.

George Russell admitted he was ""looking forward to a bit of rest"" having battled through illness and ""bringing his A-game"" en route to an impressive second place at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Mercedes driver Russell missed media day on Thursday, and was excused from his media duties and the driver briefing on Friday and Saturday in order to best aid his recovery across the weekend in Baku.

Despite feeling under the weather, he was able to deliver a strong performance to take Mercedes' first podium since the Hungarian weekend having overhauled the likes of Carlos Sainz, Liam Lawson and team mate Kimi Antonelli – all of whom had started ahead of the Briton on the grid.

“I was pretty glad when I saw the chequered flag, to be honest,” said Russell. “Fortunately, I felt much better today than I felt on Friday and Saturday, so I'm looking forward to a bit of rest now.

“I'm just happy with the results. For us as a team, trying to beat Ferrari in the Constructors', this was a good step towards that.”

An extraordinary Qualifying session featuring a record-breaking six red flags saw Sainz seal an unexpected second place, a position he maintained throughout the first half of the race before Russell extended his first stint and completed an overcut pass on the Spaniard.

“It was a really strong race,” Russell added, reflecting on his day. “Mainly just staying out of trouble. I don't think we did anything spectacular; it's just a lot of people made a lot of mistakes this weekend, between Qualifying and the race.

“In normal circumstances, we'd expect to finish ahead of Carlos, but he drove an amazing race, and I had to try and bring my A-game to finish ahead of him.”

Antonelli also enjoyed his strongest showing since the Canadian Grand Prix, and registered points in back-to-back races for the first time since Saudi Arabia and Miami.

“It was a much better race compared to Monza,” he said. “It's a bit disappointing still, because I was really hoping for the podium and I was so close. I tried to get close to Carlos and eventually almost got into DRS, but then with the dirty air, I started to struggle a little bit.

“But still, a decent result, especially for the team. We gained a lot of points on Ferrari, so that is definitely a positive, and now we move forward.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Despite both Ferraris finishing inside the points at Baku, drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton viewed it as a disappointing weekend.

Charles Leclerc insists that Ferrari have ""got to react"" after a disappointing Azerbaijan Grand Prix despite a double points finish for the Scuderia.

The Monegasque driver could only finish ninth in Sunday's 51-lap race on the streets of Baku, with team mate Lewis Hamilton one place further ahead after both drivers started down the field.

Hamilton had failed to reach Q3 and started P12, while Leclerc crashed in Q3 and started P10 at a venue where he had previously taken four pole positions on the bounce.

""We've got to react. It's not been a strong weekend at all,"" said Leclerc when asked how he and the team move forward.

""It's always easy to blame the car and I think overall the car this weekend hasn't been the strongest and it's been a difficult weekend. We have some explanations, first is probably the approach that I've had on the set-up, which hasn't been the right one. Second, I think our car is struggling whenever it's cool and it's been quite cold since yesterday and that made us struggle.

""But I think the main reason, and I am the first one responsible of that, is the mistake in Qualifying. When you start P10, it's very difficult to change the situation.

""You kind of hope to beat the strategy of all the other fast drivers but I kind of ended up the other side and I was stuck behind Liam [Lawson] the whole race. He did a really good job of defending and had good straight line speed so he could keep me behind, and I couldn't really use my pace, so it was a boring race.""

Ferrari entered the weekend after another strong showing on Friday, Hamilton having set the pace in Free Practice 2 from Leclerc and happy with the direction the team had taken.

The seven-time World Champion was content with his progress in a race where overtaking was difficult, but agreed with his team mate's assessment that better Qualifying performance was needed.

""Got a good start and progressed to P8 was positive,"" he said.

""I think our ultimate pace was not great in the race and I think I lost a lot of ground in the first stint, particularly on the hard tyre compared to the guys on the mediums. But I came back towards the end but I think overall the pace was not really great and Qualifying clearly is key.

""I think it just shows that Qualifying is everything, we didn't operate perfectly yesterday so we've got some work to do but we'll take it internally and try to improve.""

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Who did the best in Baku and who struggled in the Land of Fire? Lawrence Barretto reveals all...

There was drama galore in Baku through both Qualifying and the race, with Max Verstappen guiding his Red Bull through it all to take a super pole and victory. But while his Red Bull team celebrated, many of his rivals headed for the airport wondering what might have been. Lawrence Barretto selects his winners and losers from the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Red Bull did not have the fastest car in Baku, but Max Verstappen still found a way to stick it on pole for the sixth time in 2025 (six poles is the most of any driver this year) and first time in Baku.

Once he held the lead from Carlos Sainz into Turn 1, having started on the less grippy hard compound tyres, he settled into a lead that never looked under threat.

He has now led more laps this season than championship rival Lando Norris, while victory was his second on the bounce and third successive top-three finish (having previously not been on the podium since Canada).

The reigning four-time World Champion slashed his deficit to championship leader Oscar Piastri from 94 points to 69. That's still a chunky disadvantage, but if this form continues when we return to high-downforce tracks, he could run himself back into contention for the crown.

Piastri has looked bulletproof in his pursuit of a first world title this year, but the Australian hit the skids in a big way in Baku.

Last year's race winner uncharacteristically crashed in Qualifying, causing damage so significant McLaren had to change his chassis.

Race day was worse still, the 24-year-old first dropping to the back of the field following anti-stall kicking in after he jumped the start and then crashing at Turn 5 when he misjudged the lack of grip.

A tough race to swallow, but blips happen and his brilliance until this point means he still heads to Singapore with a comfortable 25-point advantage in the standings.

Carlos Sainz has been fast all year, but he's failed to convert that pace into a decent points haul for several reasons, including unreliability, misfortune and his own errors.

But in Baku, he delivered with a superb front row Qualifying spot with P2, in what was only his second Q3 appearance in the last 10 Grands Prix.

It was Williams' first front row since George Russell in Belgium 2021 and the first time Sainz has ever outqualified a team mate in Azerbaijan.

His performance on Sunday was vintage Sainz, managing his tyres and pace supremely throughout to take Williams' first podium in a full-length race since Lance Stroll at the same track back in 2017.

A haul of points near doubled his tally for the year (he scored 15 to add to his collection of 16) to vault him six places up the championship to 12th and strengthen Williams' grip on P5 in the standings.

While Sainz sparkled, his Williams team mate Alex Albon had a rare off weekend.

In Qualifying, he clipped the inside wall at the apex of Turn 1, breaking the front suspension and forcing him out of Q1 for the third time this season.

The Thai racer made up ground in the race, albeit slowly, but an erroneous move on Franco Colapinto tipped the Alpine into a spin and earned Albon a 10-second time penalty.

That dropped him from 11th on the road to 13th in the classification for only his second non-score in the last six races.

This was without doubt Liam Lawson's best weekend in Formula 1 – and it came at the perfect time as he battles to convince Red Bull to retain him for next season.

The New Zealander delivered under pressure to take the best grid slot of his career with third.

He then produced a composed drive on race day to take a career-best fifth, ending a run of two races without a point.

The healthy score also helped Racing Bulls push up into sixth in the Teams' Championship at the expense of Aston Martin.

The weekend offered so much promise for Ferrari after a very strong Friday that saw Lewis Hamilton lead a 1-2 in Free Practice 2, and tell the media afterwards that he was finally getting comfortable and confident on the brakes with his new team.

However, he failed to make it into Q3 – not helped in part by team mate Charles Leclerc crashing to bring out the yellow flags and force him to abort his first lap on the second run – and could only recover to eighth from 12th.

Leclerc's run of four straight poles in Baku came to an end courtesy of his Qualifying crash – with the Monegasque at a loss to explain why he wasn't anywhere near as comfortable on a track where he's been mighty all of his career.

His race wasn't anything to write home about – with boss Fred Vasseur confirming he had an engine issue that cost him at least a couple of tenths a lap – as he crossed the line ninth, with Ferrari dropping behind Mercedes into third in the Teams' Championship.

Considering George Russell had a respiratory virus that was so uncomfortable he didn't attend the track on Thursday's media day and was excused by doctors from attending his media duties on Friday and Saturday so he could rest, second on Sunday afternoon was a remarkable effort.

The Briton gave himself a shot at the podium with fifth on the grid, and while he lost a place to Yuki Tsunoda at the start, he recovered that and more as supreme pace and great strategy opened the door for an overcut on Sainz that gave him second.

It was his seventh podium finish of the season, third podium in four years in Baku and Mercedes' best finish in Azerbaijan since 2019 as they moved up to P2 in the Teams' standings.

McLaren arrived in Baku in great shape to defend their Teams' Championship crown with seven Grands Prix remaining – but they suffered one of their most uncompetitive weekends of the year.

They managed a best Qualifying position of seventh through Norris, with Piastri in ninth after his Q3 shunt. After Piastri then crashed on Lap 1, their hopes rested on Norris – but he didn't have the pace to move forward and finished where he started.

That was McLaren's lowest points haul since the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix, and means the papaya team must now wait until at least Singapore to clinch the championship.

Kimi Antonelli arrived in Baku with the word ""underwhelming"" ringing in his ear following Mercedes boss Toto Wolff's assessment of his performance last time out in Italy.

The Italian could have crumbled under the pressure – but instead responded in the way the Silver Arrows hoped he would with an assured performance from the first lap of practice to P4 at the flag.

Antonelli outqualified his team mate Russell in Grand Prix Qualifying for only the second time this season, and took his biggest haul of points since a podium in Canada back in June.

Haas were looking quick after Friday, with Ollie Bearman's good form in Baku continuing with an eye-catching fifth in second practice.

But an error in Qualifying saw Bearman hit the wall and left him starting the race in 15th. His team mate Esteban Ocon had it even tougher as he started last after getting disqualified from P18 for a rear wing infringement.

Neither car could make progress in the race, meaning a second race without points as Williams and Racing Bulls stretched away in fifth and sixth respectively in the Teams' standings.

The pressure on Yuki Tsunoda's shoulders has been growing steadily in recent weeks, with the Red Bull driver's future at the team uncertain, especially in light of strong performances from Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar.

But he finally got a clean weekend together in Baku. On Saturday, he secured his first top-six grid slot in what would be his 15th Grand Prix start for Red Bull.

Fine work in Friday practice cured some of the problems he's suffered generating race pace – and he proved that on Sunday by securing the first top-eight finish for the second Red Bull driver since Austin 2024.

It was Tsunoda's best finish of the season, and gives him something to work with heading to Singapore.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

McLaren boss Andrea Stella has given his take on what proved to be a tough weekend for both Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Andrea Stella is confident that Oscar Piastri will “come back stronger” following his Lap 1 crash out of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a weekend in which the other McLaren car of Lando Norris was again hit by a pit stop issue en route to a final result of P7.

After a tough Qualifying for the papaya squad on Saturday – in which Piastri hit the wall in Q3 while Norris failed to reach higher than P7 on the grid – the team also faced a difficult day as soon as the lights went out in Baku on Sunday.

Piastri's troubles continued as the Australian made a jump start before his car went into anti-stall, dropping him to the back of the field as well as earning him a five-second time penalty. But the championship leader's race soon came to an end when he locked up into Turn 5 and hit the barriers, making him the only driver to retire from the Grand Prix.

Reflecting on the events of the weekend after the race, McLaren Team Principal Stella suggested that Piastri's record across past categories shows his ability to bounce back and learn quickly from his mistakes.

“These errors that we've seen on Oscar's side, they are definitely uncharacteristic,” Stella explained. “Oscar has been the most solid driver in the 2025 campaign so far, and from what I could see, even with multi champion drivers, sometimes you have a weekend in which it's all about learning.

“And I think Oscar concentrated some learning opportunities in this weekend, despite his will. The start, I think it's just for an excess of eagerness. I'm sure we have seen this now, and we won't see this anymore.

“And in terms of the lock-up, similar to yesterday, he just misjudged the level of grip available. Perhaps this was compounded with a slow start, with a false start. We don't know yet.

“But I think one of the strongest features of Oscar is how rapidly he learns, how rapidly he improves, and now he can come back stronger. That's why he's been so successful in every category, and I think that's exactly what will happen in his Formula 1 career, and we will see it in the remainder of the season.”

On the other side of the garage, Norris struggled to overtake the cars ahead from his P7 starting slot and also found himself in traffic after a slow pit stop – his second in as many races.

While this meant that the Briton was unable to capitalise as greatly on Piastri's retirement in terms of the championship – with the gap only slightly reduced to 25 points – he insisted that the race was “not a missed opportunity”. From Stella's side, the team boss felt that the MCL39 did not have enough pace for Norris to gain any further positions.

“I think on Lando's side, we were hoping to have a car that was in condition to overtake, in fairness, but the reality today is that the car wasn't fast enough to stay close to the car ahead out of last corner to then be able to overtake down the straight,” said Stella.

“This means that Lando spent the entire race in traffic, despite feeling that the car had more to offer. Overall I think I've said yesterday that these kind of circuits don't seem to suit our car very well in terms of its strengths, but at the same time, definitely there was more available in the car that yesterday in Qualifying and today in the race we did not exploit.”

Reflecting further on Norris' performance, Stella added: “I think Lando today had a strong race. He raced to the limit of the potential that was available in the car. I think no other driver in Lando's car could have scored more.

“If anything, the responsibility to try and extract more performance today or more points may lie more on the team's side, because with a fast, or the fastest, pit stop we could have given Lando the opportunity for us to attack Liam Lawson. But from a driving point of view, we are completely, completely happy that Lando has delivered to the limit of what was available today in the car.”

As such, Stella admits that pit stops will be one of the squad's areas for improvement going forward as the potential impact of mistakes heightens entering into the final seven Grands Prix of the campaign, with the team boss stating that Baku winner Max Verstappen is “in the contention for the Drivers' Championship”.

“We need to keep working, because there's some important performance that is available through pit stops, and we have seen that the racing, if anything, is getting tighter and tighter,” Stella conceded. “So what is the impact of a pit stop now? It gets more and more important.

“So definitely, for the remainder of the season, and also thinking about next year's car, there's work to do.”

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Max Verstappen made it back-to-back victories for Red Bull with a commanding display at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

A couple of weeks on from his first Grand Prix win as Red Bull's team boss, Laurent Mekies celebrated another thanks to the “untouchable” Max Verstappen's controlled drive to the top step of the podium in Azerbaijan.

After an eight-round run without a triumph – not including Verstappen's Sprint success in Belgium – Red Bull returned to winning ways at the Italian Grand Prix with an emphatic display from the four-time World Champion.

Many in the paddock were curious to see if Red Bull could carry that form over to the streets of Baku and, on a particularly dramatic weekend, Verstappen stayed clear of trouble to make it back-to-back pole positions and race wins.

With McLaren experiencing a difficult event thanks to Oscar Piastri crashing out of Qualifying and the race and Lando Norris only finishing seventh, Verstappen has now closed to within 69 points of the championship lead.

Speaking on F1 TV's post-race show, Mekies said of Verstappen's performance: “That was really such an impressive demonstration he has done again, two weeks after Monza.

“Coming here, the super-difficult conditions in Qualifying, not knowing very much what to expect today in terms of race pace… Nobody had done any long runs on the medium or on the hard [tyres].

“He just took it step by step, he just pulled away tenth after tenth, and he seemed untouchable. Obviously it made everything quite a bit more easy.”

Mekies added that Verstappen's brace of victories, mixed with Tsunoda's solid P6 finish on Sunday, appear to show that the team have made some breakthroughs with their RB21 challenger – in what has been an up-and-down season so far.

“It's also a very good sign for the car,” he commented, following on from recent updates and a shift in engineering approach. “Yuki was also fast, a few tenths away from Max, and bringing home some good points – his best race, I think, for us.

“We know this track is still very specific… it's not Monza, but it's still low-downforce, it's still the very low-speed corners. But [it] confirms in these sort of situations we have unlocked something.

“We are equally conscious that we go into the rest of the season with very different tracks, but it will be a good test for all of us as a team.”

With that in mind, Mekies is keen to see what unfolds at the upcoming Singapore Grand Prix – a race Red Bull last won with Sergio Perez in 2022 and before that with Sebastian Vettel back in 2013.

“We take it step by step,” he said. “We concentrate on ourselves, we try to look at what is limiting us, how to unlock it... that's what the guys have been so good to do both [at the factory] in Milton Keynes and here at the race track.

“It worked here, it worked at Monza. The equation in Singapore will be completely different. We know it's back to the very, very high downforce, and tracks we have been struggling [at] a little bit more, higher temperatures. So, we'll see.

“We focus on trying to improve step by step the car. Even if the regulations are completely different next year, developing our understanding of what is limiting us has value, and hence we are taking it as seriously as we can.”

While Verstappen has boosted his outside title chances, Red Bull remain in the hunt for second in the Teams' Championship – their tally of 272 points comparing to Ferrari's 286 and Mercedes' 290.

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Radio Rewind: 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix

Relive a drama-filled start to the Azerbaijan Grand Prix that could have significant championship ramifications.

Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix got off to a dramatic start, with Max Verstappen holding the lead but Oscar Piastri tumbling down the order and crashing out.

While polesitter Verstappen entered Turn 1 just ahead of Carlos Sainz and Liam Lawson, Piastri hit trouble off the line and dropped all the way to the back of the field.

The championship leader then locked up and slid helplessly into the outside wall at Turn 5, ending his race there and then – and potentially having huge ramifications on the 2025 title battle.

As the leading pack fed through the opening corners, Piastri's team mate, Lando Norris, dropped a position to eighth, with no other major dramas to report.

Hit go on the videos above to watch all the action from the start of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

""This ballot update brings our process in line with standard voting best practices … and further ensures the process is fair and equitable for all entries,"" says awards chief Ruby Marchand.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



When Grammy voters open their digital ballots beginning on Friday Oct. 3, they'll notice a big difference from years past – all entries will be listed in randomized, rather than alphabetical, order for the first time. That won't make all that much difference in categories with modest numbers of entries, but it will make it significantly harder to find what you're looking for in categories with large number of entries.


	And, while the academy doesn't come right out and say it, that's the point. The academy is trying to force (or at least strongly encourage) voters to read through the entire list of entries, so they're reminded of entries that they may have forgotten about, rather than just revert to a handful of favorite artists every year.


	“This ballot update brings our process in line with standard voting best practices … and further ensures the process is fair and equitable for all entries,” Ruby Marchand, chief awards and global industry officer for the Recording Academy, said in an exclusive statement to Billboard. “As with any change, there will be an adjustment period in the first year but, our staff will be on hand to assist voters with any questions.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	All categories that appear on the first-round ballot will be listed in a randomized order. However, voters will be able to download a PDF of all entries listed in alphabetical order. And voters will still have access to locate their selections via a search tool within the voting platform.


	The academy's awards team has worked with their technical partners to craft uniquely personalized, randomized ballots. No two voter ballots will be identical (in terms of the order that entries are listed in). 


	This change was brought forward and supported by academy trustees, all of whom are members of the Recording Academy.


	The change will make it harder to find entries in categories with large numbers of entries. Last year, 14 categories had 300 or more entries, topped by three of the highest-profile categories — song of the year (978 entries), record of the year (780) and album of the year (707). In the past, albums and songs were listed alphabetically by artist's last names, so if you were looking for something from, say, Sabrina Carpenter or Kendrick Lamar, you could go right to it. Songs were listed alphabetically by song title, so again you could go right to, say “Espresso” or “Not Like Us.” Now, they're in jumbled order. Voters will have to hunt through hundreds of entries to find what they want.


	The Recording Academy has begun to put the word out so that voting members won't be shocked when they go to vote – first-round voting runs from Oct. 3 through Oct. 15. The academy notes that members can return to their ballot multiple times, if need be, before they finally submit, at which no further changes can be made. Each voter's ballot will remain the same, no matter how many times that voter revisits their ballot as they listen, assess, and make their final vote selections.


	“The key is to approach the process with preparation and patience,” Marchand said in a Q&A posted on Grammy.com. “Start early, set a reasonable pace, and plan for multiple visits to the ballot. This year, the ballot will appear in randomized order (not alphabetical), so giving yourself time to navigate and review thoroughly is especially important. Don't wait until the last day – or worse, the last hour – to submit, as technical issues can derail your vote. Use Academy resources ahead of time, and once the ballot opens, take time to explore the diversity of entries along with tools within the ballot to assist in your voting.”


	All voting members may join a half-hour ballot overview webinar on Sept. 29 at 2 p.m. ET for guidance and tips. Marchand will be joined by Harvey Mason jr., Recording Academy CEO; Michael Almanza, senior director, awards; and Nick DiFruscia, senior director, awards


	The webinar, dubbed “Your Ballot at a Glance,” promises to shed light on these topics: “how to navigate your voter portal, changes to the ballot, including the new randomized ballot order, the importance of having a voting strategy, features/tools within the ballot to assist with your voting and critical resources to help you during 68th Grammy voting.”


	The number of categories in which voters can vote remains unchanged. Voters can vote in up to 10 categories across no more than three different genre fields plus all categories in the “general field” (which consists of album, record and song of the year, best new artist, and producer and songwriter of the year, non-classical).

The trailblazing executive, who is leaving her post as chair/CEO of Epic after 11 years at the company, penned a heartfelt goodbye to her record label ""family.""


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



In the wake of today's (Sept. 22) announcement of Sylvia Rhone‘s departure as chairwoman/CEO of Epic Records at the end of this month, Billboard has obtained two letters that Rhone wrote to her Sony and Epic families. 


	Rhone exits Epic after 11 years, coming on board as president of the company in 2014 before being elevated to chair/CEO in 2019. Her trailblazing career has seen her become the first Black executive and first woman to chair a major record company, having been appointed to oversee Elektra Entertainment Group in 1994. 


	Over the course of her five-decade career, the pioneering executive has been honored with such accolades as the City of Hope's Spirit of Life Award, the Black Music Collective's Recording Academy Global Impact Award, the Black Music Action Coalition's BMAC Clarence Avant Trailblazer Award and the Vanguard Award at the inaugural Black Women in Music dinner last year. In 2023, she was named Billboard's Women in Music executive of the year, where she was feted as “a force, an alchemist, a savant of creative artistry and an inspiration to all women for the glass ceilings you have conquered.”

	Read both of Rhone's notes in full below.


TO MY EPIC FAMILY,


As I step away from this role that has defined so much of my journey, I am filled with pride in the extraordinary tapestry we've created together. From Future to Travis Scott to 21 Savage, Meghan Trainor, Tyla, Madison Beer, Giveon, Zara Larsson, Mariah the Scientist, Absolutely, ScarLip, BIA, UMI, Real Boston Richie, Eddie Benjamin, the late, great Ozzy Osbourne and more.


At this pivotal time in music history, your voices have not just survived; they have soared. Your creativity doesn't just fill rooms and bottom lines — it fills the spaces between heartbeats, just when the world needs reminding that the soul of music still exists.


Together, we've scored the soundtrack to countless lives. We've given voice to the voiceless and rhythm to the restless. Your contributions haven't just shaped our catalog — they've shaped culture itself. Every late night in the studio, every “what if we tried this,” every moment you pushed past the comfortable into the extraordinary — these are the building blocks of our legacy.


Thank you for trusting me with your brilliance. Thank you for making every day feel like the first-time music was invented. Your voices make a difference. Your creativity makes a difference.


You make a difference.


The stage is yours now. Make it sing.


Sylvia ❤️


TO MY SONY FAMILY,


It's been an extraordinary journey: eleven years since my promotion to President of Epic Records and six years since my appointment as Chairwoman and CEO. This role at Epic represents the third time in my career that I've been the first woman and first Black person to serve as CEO of a major record label owned by a Fortune 500 company.


And today, I am moving on from this historic role at Epic and I'm very excited about the future.


I've always been surrounded by excellent teams, but our current one at Epic is extraordinary. Spanning multiple generations, our team understands music's history, finds meaning in complex data, and anticipates emerging trends. From Travis Scott, Future and 21 Savage, to Meghan Trainor, Tyla and Madison Beer, Zara Larsson to Giveon and Mariah The Scientist, Q-Tip to Andre 3000 and the late, great Ozzy Osbourne…Epic artists thrive through bespoke campaigns that honor their unique voices and goals. While helping artists maintain authentic fan connections, our team guides them through partnerships in video, fashion, gaming, and content innovation. We're proud of leading Sony Music's 2020 “Your Voice, Your Power, Your Vote” campaign and fostering a workplace culture that reflects our values: 62% women and 57% people of color. From day one, we set out to build something special at Epic — and we have.


This moment of my transition invites reflection on a journey that has been wide-ranging in its scope and impact.


Following my graduation from The Wharton School, I started as a secretary at Buddha Records and after working my way up through radio promotions, I was privileged to be appointed SVP of Black Music at Atlantic Records.  Those times feel like yesterday, working with Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, En Vogue, LeVert, Brandy, Adina Howard, Troop, DAS EFX, Snow, MC Lyte, Kwamé, Miki Howard, Gerald Albright, The System and Ice Cube's Lynch Mob and Yo-Yo.  Through our Ruthless Records deal, we also released The D.O.C., JJ Fad, Michel'le, and Easy-E.


In July 1994, I was appointed Chairwoman of Elektra Records, where we orchestrated a cultural renaissance that still resonates today. There, we became guardians of musical diversity, nurturing the power of AC/DC and Metallica alongside the genius of Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes. From Pantera's intensity to Phish's improvisational spirit, from Tracy Chapman's truths and Anita Baker's soul to Tamia's powerful vocals — each artist flourished on their own frequency. Third Eye Blind, Yolanda Adams, Silk, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Gerald LeVert, Keith Sweat, Natalie Merchant, The Cure, Björk, Staind, Better Than Ezra, The Afghan Whigs, and Jason Mraz all found their home in our musical family, creating moments that transcended mere entertainment.


Then came my chapter at Motown, where the label's iconic history and its future converged under my leadership as Chairwoman and CEO. It was an honor to record Stevie Wonder's last full-length studio album while simultaneously collaborating with artists like Nelly, Erykah Badu, Kid Cudi, and Akon. We also extended hip-hop's global reach by distributing Cash Money Records' roster — elevating Baby, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Drake.


I am blessed to have worked with some of the most brilliant and influential artists in the history of recorded music. And I've discovered this: when we channel our strength and creativity in service of a vision, and collaborate with artists who do the same, we create music that reflects our world, questions our assumptions, and uplifts our spirits. This is a kind of magic, a deeply human connection. Right now, when music's DNA is being reimagined, when artists face existential challenges, and when all of us are building the future in real time, there is little that is more profound.


Looking back on my Epic era fills me with great pride. To my team of creative champions, you now hold the reins, and I know your best work lies ahead. I'm grateful for Zeke Lewis, Rick Sackheim, Sandra Aflorei, Tyler Pittman, John Shoup, Dave Bell, Lisa Kasha, Shannon Mingal, Margeaux Watson, Justin Duran, Chelsea Donnarumma, Brooke Marcimo, Mez Tara, Gina Harrell, Melissa Victor, Traci Adams, Scott Dimig, Dontay Thompson, Jennifer Goicoechea, Patrick Afeku, John Kirkpatrick, Michael Petullo, Max Sholl, Hector Rosario and the countless other executives who made Epic Records home.


I thank my daughter Quinn for her unconditional love and my late parents Marie and Bob Rhone for their heroic support. And I am forever grateful for my prior teammates from over the years. Not only did we work great music, but we also created an amazing network of advocacy and goodwill! Thanks to Rob Stringer for his trust and camaraderie and to Doug Morris for empowering me to shatter the glass ceiling.


I have worked in our industry since vinyl ruled, and women were rarely if ever in line for C-level or even vice-presidential roles. I am proud of my achievements, and of my commitment to those who take inspiration from them. The many individual honors I've received — from Billboard, Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women, Essence, Variety, Ms. Magazine's Woman of the Year, and the recent honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music — serve as grace notes on my years of dedication. But they pale beside what we've all built together. They pale beside the glory of our musical culture.


Onward and upward,


Sylvia

Howard Stern weighed in on Jimmy Kimmel's suspension from his ABC late-night show following a threat from Donald Trump‘s FCC chairman Brendan Carr.


	“I don't know what their plan is, but it looks like they might be firing [him],” Stern, referring to ABC and Kimmel, said on his SiriusXM show Monday. “And then I read sometimes that they're not gonna fire him. I don't know. I have spoken to Jimmy. I didn't ask him these questions, I just asked him how he was doing personally.”


	Stern added, “I just know when the government begins to interfere, when the government says, I'm not pleased with you, so we're gonna orchestrate a way to silence you. It's the wrong direction for our country. And I should know. I've been involved in something like this and now ABC is put in the same position and it's unfortunate that ABC even has to be in this position. They shouldn't have to be in this position. I feel for them too, in this. But that someone's gotta step up and be f*cking saying, ‘Hey, enough, we're not gonna bow.'”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Stern also said that he canceled his Disney+ subscription.


	“Now it might sound stupid, but the thing I did this morning, I'm canceling my Disney+. I'm trying to say with the pocketbook that I do not support what they're doing with Jimmy.”


	Stern is the latest comedian/talk figure to come to Kimmel's defense. ABC has not said what it plans to do, other than that Kimmel's show would be taken off the air “indefinitely.” A week ago, the late-night host had said during his monologue, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.”

	











	That generated a furor on the right, with Carr chiming in Wednesday on Benny Johnson's podcast. Carr said, “We can do this the easy way, or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”


	Hours later, station group Nexstar said it was pulling the show from its ABC affiliates “for the foreseeable future.” Soon after, ABC announced the suspension.


	Stern's platform, SiriusXM, falls outside the FCC's oversight. But when he was on broadcast radio, he had a long history of battles, and fines, for running afoul of the agency's indecency rules.

Howard is irrelevant as late night talk shows

I believe Donald Trump is wrong for doing this to Jimmy Kimmel and I believe they need to put Kimball back on the air and Trump needs to stay out of it

What evidence do you have that Trump had anything to do with this? Sinclair filed the FCC complaint and both they and Nexstar told ABC they were pulling Kimmels show, that by the way, nobody even watches.

He said on Airforce One on his way home from England. I know he said “Smart people don't like me” but you are really proving his point.Just google it!!

I wonder how Iger will write about this if he writes another book?

The President Of The United States said last night that he HATES half our country. Why is that not a bigger story???

Don't worry, it's not even half.

If ABC threatened their affiliates with Monday Night Football if they pulled Kimmel this wouldn't be an issue.

Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York, said he's pulling out of a planned WABC-TV town hall this week due to its parent company's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live following a Trump administration threat.


	Mamdani's campaign confirmed he would not participate in a town hall that was to be aired on WABC-TV on Thursday.


	“I am withdrawing not as an indictment of the local affiliate or the hard-working journalists there, but rather in response to the corporate leaders who have put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press,” Mamdani said at a press conference at New York's Four Freedoms Park on Monday.

	











	“It is not the government's job to bully talk show hosts off of the air. It is not the government's job to tell us what we can and cannot talk about,” he said.




			Watch on Deadline		







	A WABC spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.


ABC pulled Kimmel on Wednesday, hours after FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened the network and its stations over comments that the late-night host made earlier in the week.


	The network's decision has triggered a backlash and a renewed focus on free speech rights, as well as corporate capitulation in the face of Trump administration threats. ABC parent The Walt Disney Co. has transactions seeking approval of the administration. Before ABC announced that it was pulling the show, Nexstar said that it was taking Kimmel's show off its ABC affiliates. Nexstar is seeking FCC approval for a merger with Tegna, something that won't be possible unless the agency repeals or revises a media ownership rule that limit the number of stations any one company can hold.

This is a mistake. In times like these, Mamdani needs to be speaking up and getting the word and his campaign out there, not opting to silence himself.

Hiding from any questions more like!

Always be concerned about a politician who would rather hide than answer questions.

This seems really stupid – the media is a tool

ALL of that happened during Constitution Week.  The Constitution was signed and ratified September 17, 1787.  The document containing all our unalienable rights was dumped on the anniversary of its signing.

If you say so.

	Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Ben Affleck, Ben Stiller and Lin-Manuel Miranda are among the more than 400 artists to sign on to an ACLU letter calling out “government threats to our freedom of speech” in the aftermath of ABC‘s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel.


	“Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country,” the open letter states.


	“Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.”

	











	The letter does not name Donald Trump or his FCC chair, Brendan Carr, but they are cited in a website introduction. The letter notes, “We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.”

	“Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country,” the letter states. “We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.”

	











	Others signing the letter include Robert DeNiro, Selena Gomez, Kerry Washington, Jason Bateman, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ariana DeBose, Jane Fonda, Jim Parsons, Joaquin Phoenix, Frances McDormand, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Regina King, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jean Smart, Noah Wyle, Diego Luna, Natalie Portman, Olivia Rodrigo, Martin Short and Ramy Youssef.

Kimmel was going to get canned anyway, they just did it earlier than expected. Where was this furor when Bidens admin treated Facebook lol

Do you REALLY not know the difference between conduct violations and squashing 1st amendment rights?

Having a late night show isn't a 1st amendment right, genius.

“If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.”

Apply it to Kimmel for sure. But if this is ‘the moment', then go back apply to the people who were canned but you stayed silent on.

Give a few names so people can actually reply.

Reece, where you at?

Embarrassing.

Agreed what the FCC and Trump are trying to do is embarrassing.

The best sports films aren't actually about the sport at hand. 

Sure, tennis fanatics probably can get a lot out of the technical tricks and technical expertise on display in Luca Guadagnino's recent “Challengers,” but the movie more broadly uses the tennis court as a stage to tell an epic tale of love versus career, of passion versus safety, of a murky love triangle in which all three sides care deeply for one another. The final match of the film is exhilarating, but that's because of what's been happening off the court just as much as what's happening on it.

So it goes with all sports films, which — at their worst — can be conventional and formulaic crowdpleasers (typically about an underdog conquering all odds), and at best are explorations of the personal victories and failures of the athletes at their center. 

Movies like “Rocky” or “Raging Bull” gain much of their pathos from following the central boxers outside the ring, exploring the very human factors that motivate their drive to fight. Other films like “A League of Their Own” or “White Men Can't Jump” use pastimes to examine feminist and racial topics to thoughtful and interesting effect. Yes, everyone loves an underdog story — but the best sports films aren't just that.

Baseball has traditionally been the most successful sport when it comes to inspiring great filmmaking:  beloved movies tackling the game include “Field of Dreams,” “The Bad News Bears,” and “The Natural.” But any sport can be dramatized well on film, as long as a director has the proper vision for it. We've seen great hockey movies, great soccer movies, great football movies, and even now have a great tennis movie in the form of “Challengers.” It's only a matter of time before some brave filmmaker brings to life the first pickleball movie.

While the recent “Him” will decidedly not join the ranks of great sports narratives, its release has made us think about the best movies to use sports as an avenue to explore triumph, defeat, and passion. 

Of note: This list will includes fiction films, leaving out some documentary masterpieces like “Hoop Dreams,” “OJ: Made in America,” and “Minding the Gap.” Read on for IndieWire's picks for the 10 best sports films of all time.

The most iconic sports underdog story of all time, “Rocky” launched a franchise so ridiculous (remember when he single-handedly beat communism in “Rocky IV”?) that it's easy to forget how raw, gritty, and brilliant the original 1976 film is. A lot of its power rides on Sylvester Stallone's breakthrough performance, one that's lived-in and realistic, giving much texture and authenticity to this portrait of a down-on-his-luck working-class Philly fighter who gets one shot to prove himself. 

The movie practically defined the formula that so many other sports films that came in its wake would follow, but John G. Avildsen's boxing flick is far more clear-eyed and realistic about its protagonists' lot in life even as it offers up the most stirring training montage committed to film. Spoiler alert: Rocky loses at the end to the smarmy but likable Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), and the film understands that it's his personal journey that matters far more than the ultimate prize.

A brilliant sports comedy powered by a terrifically unlikable performance from the legendary Paul Newman, “Slap Shot” is one of the great entries into dirtbag sports cinema. Following a tiny minor league hockey team in a dying Rust Belt town as they stir up publicity with violent games to gain popularity, it's an atypically cynical entry in the genre, focusing on how flash and gimmicks can be just as important to the sport as actual talent. Newman as the scheming coach is as great as he's ever been in film, and he's surrounded by a committed cast ably portraying the immature, boorish men fighting to keep the team alive. In a genre that thrives on clean narratives, of good guys and bad guys, “Slap Shot” is the rare sports movie that offers something more complicated.

Famously, Martin Scorsese initially didn't want to make “Raging Bull,” thinking himself ill-equipped to the material. Eventually, he relented and turned in not just possibly the greatest sports movie ever but one of his greatest works. A biopic of the boxing champ Jake LaMotta that's as interested in his personal battles as his professional fights, “Raging Bull” tells in stark black-and-white LaMotta's rise-and-fall in the sport and in his domestic life, where his inner rage and demons costs him his friends and loved ones. Decidedly unsentimental about the sport it follows, it's the anti-“Rocky” in a way, and it's anchored by a phenomenal Robert De Niro performance that lays out LaMotta's flaws and failures in raw, honest terms that make him hard to root for but endlessly compelling to watch.  

Before “Challengers” lit the tennis world on fire with its depiction of a love triangle playing out on the court, “Bull Durham” gave the baseball pitch a similarly sexy treatment. Ron Shelton's romantic comedy, drawn from his own experiences playing in the minor leagues of baseball, follows Kevin Costner's veteran catcher Crash, Tim Robbins' rookie pitcher Nuke, and Susan Sarandon's groupie Annie as they get caught in a love triangle that effects the two players on the pitch. While the cynical Crash attempts to mentor Nuke for a possible career in the major leagues, he finds himself drawn to his girlfriend Annie, resulting in one of sports movies' most potent love stories. Hot, steamy, and very adult in its treatment of both the sport and relationships, “Bull Durham” is the kind of comedy that's all too rare in movie theaters these days.

Nowadays, the central bromance of “White Men Can't Jump” — in which racial tensions can be defused by a shared love of basketball — feels perhaps a wee bit optimistic. But Ron Shelton's classic comedy of two street hustlers (Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes) conning people on the LA streets who expect the white Billy to suck at the sport is a classic for a reason, a funny, witty, and sharp story of friendship that oozes love for the game. Harrelson and Snipes both trained under NBA player Bob Lanier, and the results are evident in the well-choreographed pickup games that punctuate the film. This is also a film lifted up by its incredible leads, with Harrelson, Snipes, and Rosie Perez turning in terrific performances that practically define movie star energy. 

It's ironic that “A League of Their Own” is best known for Tom Hanks' grouchy “There's no crying in baseball,” because Penny Marshall's classic is in many ways a happy tearjerker, a fun and sweet portrait of women finding themselves through America's pastime. Following (fictional) women in the short-lived All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, a World War II league established while the majority of men were drafted, the film boasts a ridiculously talented cast — lead by Geena Davis and also featuring Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell, and even Madonna — as the funny, distinct women of the Rockford Peaches. Through their experiences on the Peaches, these women taste some independence, discover new things about themselves, and build bonds that transform them. It's a classic crowdpleaser for a reason, and as a bonus, the (sadly short-lived) TV version is actually pretty great too.

One of the best romance films of the 21st century, Gina Prince-Bythewood's “Love & Basketball” is one of those great love stories that's about two people united by a common passion for their careers. In this case, what unites childhood friends Monica (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy (Omar Epps) from an early age and keeps them tethered to each other through the years is their mutual love for basketball, which is only matched by their feelings for each other. Prince-Bythewood's film is smart about the difficulties women face pursuing sports, but it's also at its core a movie where its protagonist can have her cake and eat it too, getting the career and winning her man with a one-on-one basketball game for his heart. No audience member would have it any other way.

Conventional in its broad plot beats but totally winning in practice, “Bend It Like Beckham” is a smart coming-of-age film that's anchored by a phenomenal lead performance from Parminder Nagra in the lead role. Playing the daughter of a strict Indian family who joins a semi-pro football team with the objective of one day making it to the big leagues, Nagra is effervescent, funny, and deeply rootable, with an energy that makes even those who don't like football cheering for her to win it all. Filmmaker Gurinder Chadha's script is deft at balancing the film's sports cheer with a thoughtful look at Indian culture that gives it much needed specificity. As a bonus: for many queer sports fans, “Bend It Like Beckham” is about the closest to a major movie with real representation, featuring enough barely veiled subtext between Nagra's Jess and Keira Knightley's Jules that the film has become a certified LGBT classic.

The defining moment of “Challengers” is its very last shot, in which Zendaya's Tashi Duncan — witnessing an exhilarating (and incredibly unrealistic, but who cares) tie-breaking bout between her husband Art (Mike Faist) and former flame Patrick (Josh O'Connor) — leaps out of her seat in pure adrenaline and screams “come on!” with all the energy in her body. Over the course of two hours and two timelines, “Challengers” tracks how these three people intersect professionally and romantically from their teenage years to adult lives, untangling a messy love triangle in which all three points have an undeniable charge of chemistry. But in the end, and especially for the emotionally distant and mercurial Tashi, tennis is the fourth point in this love triangle, and their love for the sport is essential to what unites them. Director Luca Guadagnino clearly loves the sport too, staging the matches with such energy and precision — including shots from the perspective of the ball itself — that it ranks among the best any sport has ever looked or felt on screen.

Not every sports film needs to be about superstar athletes. “Eephus” by Carson Lund is a sad, funny, and strangely poetic little gem about two amateur baseball teams over the course of one very long match. The game itself is almost entirely pointless — it's the last one before the field gets demolished to build a new field, effectively killing the league the teams belong to — but the men show up and stick around to play just for the sake of the game. Observational and sharp, the film uses brief fractures of scenes to reveal these men's lives off the pitch, as well as their frustrations and desires. It's a modest but compelling work, one that captures a passion for baseball that hundreds of more conventional narratives have failed to do.

							By 

	Emily Zemler



John Oliver offered an impassioned defense of Jimmy Kimmel last night on Last Week Tonight. The host spoke out about the importance of free speech and not succumbing to “bullies,” at one point directing his monologue at Disney head Bob Iger. 


	Oliver kicked off his monologue by discussing the death of right wing activist Charlie Kirk. “A person getting shot is tragic and a person getting shot for their ideas is horrifying,” he said. “That is true no matter what those ideas are, and I also recognize that for many, especially those who are the targets of some of Kirk's ideas, it has been hard to stay quiet as they see flags lowered to half staff, and claims that he debated things the right way. But setting all of that aside, it does seem like some are now willing to weaponize Kirk's death to do things they've been wanting to do for years, whether it's going after liberal groups, trans people, or their remaining critics in the media, and under some shamelessly flimsy pretext, all of which brings us back to Jimmy Kimmel.”

	











Jimmy Kimmel Live was taken off the air last week after Kimmel remarked on air, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” Station owners Nexstar and Sinclair responded by saying they would not be airing the late-night show. ABC owner Disney then suspended Kimmel indefinitely. 

	











	“While you may have seen headlines saying he got in trouble for remarks about Charlie Kirk himself, or even remarks about his death, that's not strictly accurate,” Oliver explained. “The comments that got him in trouble weren't about Kirk. In fact, Kimmel's first comments after his murder were a post reading, ‘Can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents, and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.'”

	He continued, “What got Kimmel in trouble was a passing reference on Monday night. Now at the time there were still rumors flying around regarding the killer's motivations, including that he was on the far right, something that Kimmel alluded to like this.” He then played a clip from Monday's Kimmel of the moment in question. 


	“Yeah, that was it,” Oliver said. “Weirdly, I was actually a guest on his show that night and I didn't even register that comment and that's only partly because I wasn't really paying attention. And I'm not alone in that. After Kimmel's suspension, many struggle to pick the offensive line out of his monologue, as YouTube is filled with comments under the video like, ‘I'm still waiting for the offensive part.' And, ‘What did he say that got him fired? I'm rewatching the last week of episodes and haven't heard it yet.”


	He added, “The point is, Kimmel didn't denigrate Charlie Kirk or make light of his killing. The worst thing you could say is that he appears to have been wrong about the shooter's ideology, which, OK. But he was also pointing out that many on the right seem desperate to weaponize Kirk's death, an argument that's aged pretty well, given, you know, everything that's happened to Kimmel since. Because that one line set off a firestorm in some corners of conservative media.”


	Oliver explained how Nextstar wants to keep Donald Trump happy because it is currently in the process of acquiring competitor Tegna and needs FCC head Brandon Carr to help. “Nexstar badly needs FCC approval, so it is hardly surprising that when Carr specifically said companies should pull Kimmel off the air or face consequences, it quickly complies,” Oliver said. “Basically, Brendon Carr said jump, and Nexstar took his dick out of their mouth for just long enough to say how high exactly.”

	The hosted noted that it was obvious Carr forced Kimmel off air. “Look, the sequence of events here could not be clearer because it was all done in plain view,” Oliver said. “Carr leaned on broadcasters to take down Kimmel. They did that, sometimes even directly citing Carr while doing so, and then Carr celebrated with a fun gif. That sure seems like a pretty clear case of the government pressuring companies to censor speech.”

	











	Oliver said the moment feels like a “turning point.” “Not because comedians are important, but because we are not,” he said. “If the government can force a network to pull a late night show off the air and do so in plain view, it can do a fuck of a lot worse.”


	He continued, “It should be clear to everyone that the First Amendment is absolutely critical in this country. That is something even Brendan Carr knows, given that he once tweeted, ‘Free speech is the counterweight. It is the check on government control. That is why censorship is the authoritarian's dream.' And I'm guessing that Trump is currently enjoying that dream so much he could break his bed sheets in half.”


	Oliver pushed for Disney, including Iger, to stand by Kimmel and offered ways fans could support his fellow host. He concluded his monologue by addressing Iger directly.

	“Hi there, Bob, we haven't met, but you probably know me as America's third favorite Zazu,” Oliver said. “Congratulations on recasting that role, by the way, it was a fun thing to learn about after the fact. Anyway, one day, the history of the time we're living through is going to be written, and when it is, I'm not sure it's those in this administration who are even gonna come off the worst, Now don't get me wrong, they're going to come off terribly. But history's also gonna remember the cowards who definitely knew better, but still let things happen, whether it was for money, convenience or just comfort. And I know, this is something of a tough sell, and it can be a bit of anathema to risk averse business leaders, but I will say this: If we've learned nothing else from this administration's second term so far, and I don't think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn't make him go away, it just makes him come back hungrier each time. They are never going to stop.”


	He wrapped up by asserting, “At some point, you're going to have to draw a line, so I'd argue why not draw it right here. And when they come to you with stupid, ridiculous demands, picking fights that you know you could win in court, Instead of rolling over, why not stand up and use four key words that they don't tend to teach you in business school. Not ‘OK, you're the boss.' Not ‘whatever you say goes.' But instead, the only phrase that can genuinely make a weak bully go away, and that is, ‘Fuck you, make me.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Nearly 80% of Russians believe in aliens poll","https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/278593303/nearly-80-of-russians-believe-in-aliens-poll","Mon, 22 Sep 2025 11:17:00 GMT","

Older generations tend to be more amenable to the idea of extraterrestrial life, while younger people are more skeptical, the survey shows

A new survey has found that nearly eight in ten Russians (79%) believe in the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth and many are open to the idea that aliens may already be among us. The poll was conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTSIOM).

Older respondents were more likely to accept the idea that such beings may already be present on Earth, while younger people expressed greater skepticism. A belief in extraterrestrial life was also slightly more common among men at 83%, versus 76% of women.

Nearly half of those surveyed (46%) believe alien visitors may be secretly observing Earth while concealing their presence from humanity.

When asked how they would feel if it were confirmed that humans are not alone in the universe, 77% said they would be ""curious."" Others reported feeling ""anxiety"" (30%) or ""hope"" (15%).

As for what aliens might do if they arrived on Earth, the majority of respondents said they would likely merely observe rather than invade: 61% think they would simply watch humans, 19% believe they would try to establish friendly relations, and 10% fear they might attempt to seize control of the planet.

Respondents were also asked which books they would recommend to alien guests to help them understand humanity. The most common answer was 'War and Peace' by Leo Tolstoy (15%), followed by the Bible or the Gospels (9%). 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky and '1984' by George Orwell were each chosen by 4%.

The survey included 1,606 Russians aged 18 and older. It was conducted online using a representative sample of participants selected by the research center. The margin of error does not exceed 2.5%, meaning the results are considered accurate within that range 95% of the time, according to VTSIOM.

Priscilla Presley has a message for all of those out there who suggest Elvis Presley is still alive.

She wishes it was true.

The ex-wife of the King of Rock and Roll, in a recent interview with PEOPLE, made it clear about Elvis' whereabouts.

“There's been so much that's untruthful out there,” Priscilla said. “Things like Elvis is still alive and hidden somewhere.

“I wish he was still alive.”

Elvis Presley died on Aug. 16, 1977, in Memphis. 

The toxicology report found the opiates Dilaudid, Percodan, Demerol, codeine and Quaaludes in his system. 

Priscilla Presley, 80, first met Elvis when she was 14 in 1959. At the time, she was living in Germany with her mother and stepfather. Elvis, who was 10 years her senior, was serving in the army.

“I met him at such a young age I didn't have time to think about life yet,” Priscilla Presley said. “Even when dating him, I'd think, ‘What am I going to do? I don't want to be a nurse. I don't want to be a teacher. I don't want to be a secretary. What can do?' Other things happened, and I love every moment.”

In 1967, Elvis Presley, 32, and Priscilla Presley, 21, were married. Nine months later, they welcomed their daughter Lisa Marie.

Oops, something went wrong

Nearly all crypto assets are seeing red on Monday, with the total market capitalization for all crypto assets falling below $4 trillion since Sunday evening.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 3%. The second-largest cryptocurrency, ether (ETH-USD), fell 6%. Solana's (SOL-USD) token is down 7%. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and World Liberty Financial (WLF) are each down 10%.

Over Sunday night, a total of $1.7 billion in trading positions in the crypto derivatives market were liquidated, according to data provider Coinglass.

Of those positions, 94% came from bullish trades with the single largest whip out — valued at $12.7 million — occurring on crypto exchange OKX.

Traders taking bullish bets on ether have seen over $500 million in liquidations while those gambling on bitcoin have seen $280 million taken out, according to Coinglass.

Crypto assets sold off last week following the Federal Reserve's well-telegraphed signal that it would lower its short-term policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point.

Companies holding bitcoin and other digital assets — so-called crypto treasury companies — have faced pressure in recent weeks after seeing wild stock surges earlier this year.

There are now more than 180 public companies that have added bitcoin to their balance sheets to date, according to data provider BitcoinTreasuries.net. Many have launched over the past year in order to replicate the outsized stock performance of Michael Saylor's bitcoin giant Strategy (MSTR).

Strategy's stock (MSTR) is down 1.3%. The company piled into a bet on bitcoin starting in 2020, using a combination of debt and equity to fund massive purchases of the cryptocurrency that turned the business intelligence software firm into a bitcoin juggernaut. Despite lagging recently, the stock has seen a surge of 2,200% since it first started buying bitcoin.

Of those firms, some 94 are considered imitators of Strategy based on their size, business model, and how they fund their bitcoin purchases, according to Vetle Lunde, head of research for Oslo, Norway-based crypto market research firm K33.

Roughly 25% have market capitalizations that have sagged below the value of their bitcoin holdings, according to K33 Research.

The dynamic prompted the first merger within the bitcoin treasury space.

On Monday, the stock of health tech firm turned bitcoin treasury company Semler Scientific (SMLR) rose 27% following the announcement that it had reached an agreement to be acquired by a larger bitcoin treasury company, the Vivek Ramaswamy-backed Strive Inc. (ASST) through an all-stock merger.

But it's not just bitcoin either.

Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company that recently appointed well-known Wall Street strategist Tom Lee as executive chairman, holds 2.15 million in ether. Its stock fell 7% as of Monday morning.

The crypto world has notched a string of regulatory wins this year, thanks in large part to the embrace of digital assets by the Trump administration.

That's also led to a number of US-listed crypto IPOs so far this year, including for stablecoin company Circle (CRCL), blockchain lender Figure (FIGR), and crypto exchanges Bullish (BLSH) and Gemini (GEMI).

Circle's stock fell 5% on Monday. Figure fell 4%. Bullish and Gemini are down 7% and 4%, respectively.

Between the initial removal of access, then giving it back after explaining it was a mistake; the people involved started a conversation about governance to clarify/fix things.https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/61The conversation terminated because the majority of those people then had their access revoked again.When weighing the facts here; which group or claimant has the most evidence for their claims?
The technical folks with lots of commits over many years, or the treasurer of an organisation who says the impetus for this was a ""funding deadline"" so all access had to be seized?

I think this person has good cause for being very upset at the lack of communication and the sudden removal of them from the organization. They were a maintainer of RubyGems for a decade.

Sounds like they made some really big changes and put zero effort into communicating to people who've spent 10+ years working on the project.

This makes a lot of sense, and it puts the 'drastic' action in understandable light.It also contrasts with the 'On September 9th, with no warning or communication, a RubyGems maintainer unilaterally...' from the Goodbye RubyGems letter. Perhaps that person did not have communications or insight?Going forward I think we could judge the good faith, if it's uncertain, by if we do see people reinstated. Cutting off access (for urgency with a deadline) followed by reinstatement (because they contribute) would match this post. No doubt there will be hurt feelings on all sides, which is understandable, but I hope as humans everyone can get through it.

I am skeptical that the model where people carry out defined tasks in exchange for getting paid can properly discharge the obligations of trustworthiness and disinterest that are necessary for the proper functioning of software supply chains. I'm thinking that probably people whose motivation is primarily personal gain will seek out ways to exploit their users' trust for additional personal gain, for example by bundling adware and other malware into their software the way Microsoft does with Windows, or only releasing security updates to paying customers.Open-source licensing provides some protection against this problem, because it guarantees you the legal right to switch to a non-malicious fork; but the whole reason we're talking about open-source supply chain security in the first place is that your vulnerability to your chosen upstream is still far from nonzero.

This is basically like fixing technical debt. It's painful and it's political but sometimes you have to do the right thing for the community as opposed to trying to assuage individuals' egos.

reply

It sounds like they sold something to their donors they couldn't really guarantee – supply chain safety – and they decided to alienate their contributors to try to appease them.Only time will tell if this was really damaging to the ruby community or just a temporary hurdle

Eventually they brought rails in many commercial companies and these companies succeeded to the point they could pay people to maintain rails.

Seems pretty clear after reading this. If 1-2 companies pulling funding is enough for them to force you to to what they want, its hard to stay independent.

reply

If the request for additional access controls/access cleanup came from one of the Ruby Central funders, could we not know who that was and what exactly their ask consisted of? I am interested in knowing their side of the story, and what the motivation was. (But in general, cutting off long-time maintainers' access seems like a bad choice - as presumably they have long since proven their good will toward the ruby community as shepherds of these projects.)

Something like:""Hey all, RC here: with the very real threat of supply-chain attacks looming around us, one of the critical financial backers of our nonprofit org gave us a deadline around tightening access to the Github Account for rubygems/bundler.  We tried and failed to arrive at a consensus with the open-source volunteers and maintainers for the best path forward and were forced to make a decision between losing the funding and taking decisive (if ham-fisted) action to keep Ruby Central financially healthy. We think RC's continued work is important enough that we stand by our decision, upsetting though it might be, but want to work out a better one ASAP. We are genuinely sorry for any fear/disruption this has caused.""Something simple that just owns the fact that they screwed up and tried to handle it as best they could. Doing this proactively as soon as they made the changes and broadcasting it would have been even better, but even posting this in reply to the controversy would have done more imo...

My general take on this:1) Nerds are often not the best at communicating.2) People on the Internet can be very cruel towards people they don't know.We could all do better, especially with #2. The Internet used to be cool as hell. Now, by and large, it sucks.
