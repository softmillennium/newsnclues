                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Best race start onboards The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku. After one of the most epic Qualifying sessions in living memory, it's a highly mixed-up starting order for the 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Perhaps the only unsurprising thing was the man who came through it all to grab pole in the dying moments, reigning World Champion Max Verstappen. The Red Bull driver's final flyer deprived Williams' Carlos Sainz of P1 glory and the Spaniard thus lines up second. Behind those F1 veterans are two of the youngest men in the field, Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli. On row three are the sister Mercedes and Red Bull cars of George Russell and Yuki Tsunoda, while you have to go down to P7 to find the first of the McLarens, that of Lando Norris, who's just ahead of Isack Hadjar in the second Racing Bulls machine. The Frenchman originally qualified in 18th place, but was subsequently disqualified after his Haas car failed a post-session inspection due to a rear wing technical infringement. The 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix starts at 1500 local time. Be sure to join our live coverage from 1400 here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Max Verstappen was never headed on Sunday in Baku to claim his fourth win of the 2025 campaign. Max Verstappen admits his lights-to-flag victory in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was "fantastic" having comfortably controlled Sunday's race to take back-to-back Formula 1 wins. "I think this weekend has been incredible for us," said Verstappen after his fourth win of the 2025 campaign. "Of course, last [F1] weekend was already great, but for us to win here again is just fantastic. We had clean air all of the time and then you could look after your tyres and it was pretty straightforward. It was very windy today, so the car was always moving around a lot, but of course, I'm incredibly happy with this performance.” “It's difficult to say at the moment, but for sure, the last two race weekends have been amazing for us," said Verstappen on mounting a title challenge. It was a strong day for Red Bull, with Yuki Tsunoda claiming his best result for the team in sixth having applied late pressure to Racing Bulls driver Liam Lawson in the closing stages. "Happy with it, especially the pace I showed today is a lot different to other race weekends," said Tsunoda. Some bits I can improve for sure and sharpen up more quality but was a good race."</p>
