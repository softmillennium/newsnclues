                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle has appointed two new co-CEOs, as part of a succession plan put into motion months ago. Business Insider reported in June that Oracle had promoted cloud boss Clay Magouyrk and head of industries Mike Sicilia to the title of "president" as part of a succession plan, citing SEC filings and people familiar with the plans. The leadership changes come amid an AI-driven growth boom for Oracle. The company's stock price shot up more than 40%, its largest increase within a single day, earlier this month after it said it expects revenue for its cloud business to jump 77% to $18 billion compared to the previous year, and hit $144 billion by 2030. Magouyrk is a former Amazon software development engineer who joined Oracle as an individual contributor in 2014. His leadership style has at times been controversial. Sicilia is the executive vice president of Oracle Industries and the executive who has been leading Oracle's takeover of Cerner. Oracle's announcement cited Sicilia's work adding AI agents to cloud applications for industries. Oracle's succession plans have followed a similar format throughout the years. The first time, it named now Catz as a president along with a previous executive, Charles Phillips Jr. Oracle replaced Phillips with the late Mark Hurd after Hurd left HP. They each had the president title until both were promoted to co-CEOs in 2014 when Ellison stepped back. Hurd died in 2019, and while Ellison considered possible successors, he opted for Catz to remain the company's sole CEO.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Danish renewable energy company Orsted will restart work "as soon as possible" on a wind farm off the coast of New England, after a federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a stop work order. The Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered Orsted on Aug. 22 to halt construction on Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The project is fully permited and 80% complete. It would provide power for more than 350,000 homes. Orsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables filed a lawsuit against Interior that asked the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to lift the stop-work order. They argued that Interior's order to stop construction was aribtrary, capricious, unlawful and "issued in bad faith." Judge Royce Lamberth issued a temporary injunction Monday, saying Orsted had "demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits" and would likely suffer irreparable harm if the stop-work order remained in place. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Trump has targeted the wind power industry since his first day in office, when he banned new leases for offshore wind farms. But the industry had hoped that fully permitted wind projects, particularly those that are already under construciton, would be allowed to proceed. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said earlier this month that he is "taking a deep look" at five offshore wind projects in the U.S. that are under construction. Burgum made clear that Trump wants to shut down the offshore wind industry. "Under this administration, there is not a future for offshore wind because it is too expensive and not reliable enough," Burgum told an audience at the Gastech conference in Milan, Italy, on Sept. 11.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayor's race, on Monday said he was dropping out of an upcoming WABC-TV town hall because of the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show by ABC under pressure from the Trump administration. "I am withdrawing from an ABC town hall that was scheduled to take place this Thursday," Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, said at an event on Roosevelt Island, according to a transcript released by his campaign. "I am withdrawing not as an indictment of the local affiliate or the hardworking journalists, but rather in response to the corporate leaders who have put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press," Mamdani said. He blasted WABC's owner, ABC, whose corporate parent Disney remains mum on the question of when — or if — Kimmel's show will return after it was yanked under pressure from the Federal Communications Commission because of comments he made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ABC said last week that the "Jimmy Kimmel Live!' "We cannot understand this moment of authoritarianism as solely coming from the White House, when it is also characterized by the cowardice of those in response to it — the cowardice that we have seen typified whether by the parent company of ABC or by so-called leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams looking to the White House for their path to their future ambition," Mamdani said. Cuomo, a former New York governor, and the current New York City Mayor Adams are running as independents against Mamdani. Meanwhile, a slew of Oscar winners and other Hollywood artists are backing Kimmel in a new letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union. "Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation," said the ACLU's letter, which has more than 400 signatories. "In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees," the letter says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayor's race, said Monday that he was canceling an upcoming town hall with an ABC affiliate in protest of the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show under pressure from the Trump administration. "I am withdrawing not as an indictment of the local affiliate or the hardworking journalists, but rather in response to the corporate leaders who have put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press," Mamdani said at a campaign event on Manhattan's Roosevelt Island. ABC said last week that the show is off the air "indefinitely" on the heels of Nexstar Media Group saying that its stations affiliated with ABC would not carry Kimmel's show "for the foreseeable future" because of his statements tying Kirk's alleged killer to the MAGA movement. Those announcements came hours after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr suggested his agency could take action against ABC over Kimmel's comments. ABC's corporate parent Disney remains mum on the question of when — or if — Kimmel's show will return to the air. "We cannot understand this moment of authoritarianism as solely coming from the White House, when it is also characterized by the cowardice of those in response to it — the cowardice that we have seen typified whether by the parent company of ABC or by so-called leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams looking to the White House for their path to their future ambition," Mamdani said. Cuomo, a former New York governor, and the current New York City Mayor Adams are running as independents against Mamdani. "We have to understand who suffers in these moments. "The message that it sends to each and every American across this country is a message that the First Amendment is no longer a right that can be counted on, but rather that it is the government which will determine what should and should not be discussed, what can and cannot be spoken," he said. A White House spokesperson, commenting on Mamdani's move, in an email to NBC News said, 'It's not surprising that the Little Communist is too scared to defend his absurd policy positions on live TV." Cuomo campaign spokesperson Rich Azzopardi  told NBC,  "ABC suspending Kimmel was a big mistake, but refusing to talk to local reporters because of the actions of their parent company shouldn't pass anyone's smell test and the press shouldn't continue to give him a pass." Meanwhile, a slew of Oscar winners and other Hollywood artists are backing Kimmel in a new letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as the artificial intelligence lab sets out to build hundreds of billions of dollars in data centers based around the chipmaker's AI processors, the companies said on Monday. OpenAI plans to build and deploy Nvidia systems that require 10 gigawatts of power, the companies said on Monday. A gigawatt is a measure of power that is increasingly being used to describe the biggest clusters of AI chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview in San Jose, California, that the 10 gigawatts is equal to between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units (GPUs), which is what the company will ship in total this year and "twice as much as last year." "This is a giant project," Huang said, in the interview alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, the company's president. Nvidia stock rose almost 4% during on Monday, instantly adding roughly $170 billion in value to the company's market cap, which now sits close to $4.5 trillion. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs started picking up when OpenAI first released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI still relies GPUs to develop its software and deploy it to users. "Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia," Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, told CNBC after the announcement. "I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen." It further signals the magnitude of Nvidia technology that OpenAI will need to develop next-generation AI that can do more than its current models. The company said it had 700 million active weekly users. Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips, but faces increased competition from Advanced Micro Devices and cloud providers which are developing their own chips and systems to tie them together. In August, Huang told investors on an earnings call that building one gigawatt of data center capacity costs between $50 billion and $60 billion, of which about $35 billion of that is for Nvidia chips and systems. Microsoft was one of OpenAI's early investors, and has a strategic partnership to integrate OpenAI models into its cloud service, Azure, and Microsoft Office. Other OpenAI investors include SoftBank and Thrive Capital. Altman referred to Nvidia and Microsoft as "passive" investors and two of the company's "most critical partners" in the CNBC interview. Huang said Nvidia's investment is "additive to everything that's been announced and contracted." He indicated to CNBC that it's in addition to anything the company has told Wall Street about its financial expectations. While this investment dwarfs Nvidia's prior commitments, the chipmaker has been opening its wallet of late to put funds in many companies in and around the industry. Last week, Nvidia said it's taken a $5 billion stake in Intel and announced that the two companies will collaborate on AI processors. Nvidia also said it invested close to $700 million in U.K. data center startup Nscale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[The stream is slated to start at Noon ET. Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above.] New Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks Monday to the Economic Club of New York to explain his views on the economy and monetary policy. The appearance comes less than a week after Miran voiced the lone dissent from the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to lower its key overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point. Instead, Miran favored a half-point reduction. Miran was confirmed last Tuesday, after President Donald Trump nominated him to fill the vacancy created when former Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned in early August. The term expires on Jan. 31, 2026, and Miran is not expected to be reappointed for a full 14-year term. Prior to coming to the Fed, he served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, a position from which he has taken a leave and will return to after his stint at the central bank.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A preliminary deal to keep TikTok alive in the United States will not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a "golden share" in the social media company, a senior White House official said Monday. The official confirmed that the deal will base the popular video app's U.S. operations in the states as part of a new joint venture with a board of directors that will have a majority of American members. None of those board members will be selected by the government, the official said during a call with reporters. Tech giant Oracle will oversee its security operations, the official said. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order later this week backing the proposed deal, and once again extending the deadline when TikTok could face a U.S. ban, the White House said. When asked to clarify that the deal is finalized, an official expressed confidence that China has approved it and that it will not get hung up on any regulatory hurdles. Since Trump took office in January, the United States government has secured a golden share in U.S. Steel and taken an equity stake in Intel. A golden share effectively gives Trump veto power over key business decisions at the company. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, faces an ultimatum under a federal law requiring it to either divest the platform's American business or be shut down in the U.S. That law passed with bipartisan support from members of Congress who expressed national security concerns about the app and its potent content algorithm. Trump, who says he likes TikTok, has repeatedly extended the divest-or-ban deadline. Last week, he signed an executive order delaying it until Dec. 16. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eric Jackson, a hedge fund manager who partly contributed to the trading explosion in Opendoor, unveiled his new pick Monday — Better Home & Finance Holding Co. Jackson said his firm holds a position in Better Home but didn't disclose its size. At one point Monday, Better Home leapt 176% to an intraday high of $94.06 after Jackson touted the stock on X. The New York-based mortgage lender soared more than 36% last week. Better Home's market capitalization was a little more than $500 million as of Friday's close, according to FactSet data. The EMJ Capital president and founder called Better Home "the Shopify of mortgages" and said the company is rebuilding a $15 trillion industry from scratch using artificial intelligence. Shopify is a Canadian e-commerce platform. Jackson noted that newly public blockchain lender Figure Technology Solutions has a much higher multiple that Better Home. "$FIGR just IPO'ed & trades at 19× 2026 sales. BETR trades at just 1× — but is growing faster than FIGR," he said. "I believe BETR is a potential 350-bagger in 2 years. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Munderloh, a part-time ride-hailing driver of 10 years and lifelong San Francisco resident. It has been edited for length and clarity. I'm from San Francisco and have been driving for Uber and Lyft for 10 years. I also organize a group called Rideshare Drivers United in the Bay Area. I don't want to give these companies money, and I don't support their business model. I'm always happy to talk with other rideshare drivers — it's part of what I do as a union organizer. I had some safety concerns, but I also think having the added element of a human driver makes travel better and more efficient. After my experience, I'd give Waymo and Tesla's robotaxi four out of five stars. The rides felt fine, but I think there's always room for improvement. The pros are what I thought they might be: You don't have to deal with a person — at least in a Waymo. Every person that I get a ride from — they're from Eritrea, they're from Bangalore, they're from some place I just never really thought about, and I get to be near this person, talk to them, and find out what they think of the city that I grew up in. I appreciated that the Waymo pulled up with its hazard lights on. I think that's the right thing to do. The Waymo, however, stopped about a block away from where we were. The Waymo also has good eyes. I see the appeal of having time to yourself in a car and being able to put on whatever music you want. But I didn't like the part where I was sitting next to an empty driver's seat. Maybe that's why I got the uncanny valley feeling — you can't quite place it, but something's not quite right. But after a while, the novelty of not having a person there wore off quickly. Maybe I'm jaded because I've seen them around the city for a long time, but I wouldn't pay more for one of those. I considered buying the car before I ended up with a Chevy Bolt, which kind of has similar styling inside as a Tesla in some ways. It felt safe under the conditions we were in. The Waymo felt a little more conservative, while the Tesla's acceleration was just a little bit quicker. I might use entertainment options like Netflix or YouTube if it were a long drive or if I were particularly internet-addicted. However, most of these things you'd do on your phone anyway. It's interesting that a person is sitting in the car with you. However, I do appreciate that there's a driver there at least because if something went wrong, there would be somebody to take over in a way a Waymo can't. It seems kind of pointless on one hand, but on the other hand, the point is to get to a destination safely, and sometimes, you need a human for that. I would've gotten to the destinations quicker and safer with a more efficient route. Waymo and Tesla did as good a job as they could, given the technology the cars are equipped with — cameras, lidars, or maps. The robotaxis also don't have personality. The experience was a little sterile. There's the loss of human connection, which is something I would hate to lose. It does not end well if we just continue not to think about other people and not know about other people's very different experiences from our own. However, most of what I think about robotaxis is about its economic impacts — and that doesn't stop at the fact that it's putting a driver out of work or driving their wages down. That driver who just lost their job? They used to spend in the local economy. I would like people to evaluate what that would mean for San Francisco, that suddenly, many people not only lose their jobs but are not spending money back into the economy. For the most part, the reason people think that robotaxis are inevitable is because we haven't really fought to create any control over whether we're going to have autonomous vehicles on our roads in any organized way. As a matter of what's happening on our roads that we pay for through our taxes, this should be something that's worked out somewhat democratically in a way that it hasn't been. I don't want to remove these things from the roads entirely — unless that's what the people want.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On an episode of his talk show "Last Week Tonight," aired late on Sunday, the British American comedian said Kimmel was "by no means the first casualty in Trump's attacks on free speech." "A mine that at this point now seems more dead canary than coal." Oliver devoted the majority of his 40-minute-long episode to talking about Kimmel's suspension. Oliver joined the ranks of comedy talk-show hosts who have weighed in on Kimmel's suspension. On Thursday night, four of late night's best-known voices — Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart — criticized Disney's move and defended Kimmel. Stewart gave a sarcastic monologue on the suspension. Meyers said it was a "big moment for our democracy." Colbert called it a "blatant assault on the freedom of speech." And Fallon said he hoped Kimmel would get his show back. Oliver's segment on Kimmel was longer and more critical than those of the American talk show hosts. He ended the segment on Kimmel by urging media companies to stand up against "stupid, ridiculous demands."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French economist Gabriel Zucman proposed the tax, which would be imposed on the ultra-rich with net worths of over 100 million euros, or about $117 million. Speaking to British newspaper The Sunday Times, Arnault said, "This is clearly not a technical or economic debate, but rather a clearly stated desire to destroy the French economy." Zucman responded to Arnault's criticisms in a series of X posts on Sunday. He said he was surprised by the "caricatural nature" of Arnault's attacks on him, and the tycoon's comments "depart from rationality and are unfounded." Zucman denied Arnault's claims that his motives were political in nature. He said he has never been an activist in any movement or a member of any party, and his only work was as a researcher and teacher. According to his faculty profile, he teaches at the Paris School of Economics and UC Berkeley. "Whatever you may think, the time has come to subject billionaires to a minimum tax rate," Zucman wrote on X, calling it an "instrument of justice, social peace, and budgetary stability." Reuters reported that in 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron scrapped France's decadeslong wealth tax, which was imposed on individuals with assets above 1.3 million euros. Protests broke out in France last week over the French government's proposed budget cuts, with protesters carrying "tax the rich" banners in support of Zucman's proposed tax plan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yann Schuermans, the CEO of Baskit, who is based in Jakarta, Indonesia. His words have been edited for length and clarity. By 30, my career looked ideal on paper, but I couldn't ignore the pull to create something of my own. When I was studying international management at the University of Manchester, I spent a year abroad in Hong Kong. That experience opened my eyes to Asia's pace and possibilities, and I knew I wanted to be part of it. With my Belgian-Brazilian background and a family history in brewing, stepping into the world's largest beer company felt both ambitious and familiar. I threw myself into the work. By my mid-20s, I was chief of staff to the region's CEO, then general manager for Hong Kong and Macau, and later strategy director and head of M&A for the region. On the outside, it looked like everything was falling into place. But inside, I felt married to a single corporate identity. I kept coming back to the same question: What would it look like to start something of my own, without the safety net? The next year, I co-founded Baskit with my wife, Yoonjung Yi. Our goal was to digitize Southeast Asia's fragmented supply chains and help small and medium-sized brands reach the market with better distribution, support, and credit. We nearly lost our visas, couldn't pay ourselves, and survived on $100,000 in savings from family and personal funds. Through mentors and local networks, we raised $5.5 million. Entrepreneurship tested me, but I drew on lessons from corporate life. At AB InBev, I often faced unpredictable situations while traveling to more than 100 countries. Improvisation became second nature, and that mindset turned into my survival kit at Baskit. Ideas rarely show up fully formed. Baskit today looks very different from what I imagined on day one. The key has been composure, resilience, and adaptability when things go sideways. Fast forward, we've grown to more than 50 people, and we've had a few profitable quarters under our belt. Our early scrappiness built muscles we still rely on. At AB InBev, my schedule was structured and supported. As a founder, each day is chaos and filled with a mix of sales pitches, fundraising calls, product pivots, and customer complaints. We had to sit in traffic with distributors; watch goods move through small shops; and see late payments or stalled deliveries firsthand. Building trust meant hours with wholesalers just to earn another meeting. Infrastructure gaps, language barriers, and constant pivots made every day complicated. But Jakarta was where the lessons — and opportunities — were. The past two and a half years have been the steepest learning curve of my life. We share the roller coaster — celebrating wins together, pushing through low points side by side. But our lives, careers, and future plans are all tied to one venture, which can compound the stress, especially as we think about starting a family. During the toughest fundraising days, we leaned on each other's resolve. We'd met at AB InBev, where she worked as HR Manager, so blending work and life always came naturally. With our third co-founder, Abhishek Pansari, covering strategy, we've learned to complement one another without overlap. If I've learned anything, it's that you don't wait for the "right" time to leap. Cover your basics, then take the jump. Get in touch with the editor: akarplus@businessinsider.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Laura Zaccaria, a Singapore-based HR professional and new mom who taught herself to build an AI-assisted web app while on six months of maternity leave. It's been edited for length and clarity. I've never studied anything related to coding. My husband started to dabble with vibe coding. He replicated my not-for-profit yoga organization website and sent me the link. He was like, "See what you can do now in a couple of hours?" He was going to sign up for a class called Code with AI in June. Becoming a mother was a very life-altering experience — suddenly, my baby became the center of my world. I didn't even have a personal laptop to install the software needed, so I bought one for this class. It's a capsule of time before going back to work, and in a career, you rarely get that. As a new mom, I started to think about my baby's weaning — he's starting to eat solid food. I thought, How are we going to plan all the meals when I go back to work? On weekends, my husband would take the baby away for a couple of hours or just play with him so I could keep working on it. It kept my brain active in a different way. When I went on leave, I unplugged from corporate life and was fully focused on caring for a small human. That uses such a different part of your brain. Picking up new skills gave me confidence that I can continue to evolve. Being a mom is not my sole identity. If I got stuck, I'd just ask Cursor, and it would tell me, "Here's what you can do, here's where to look." I faced a technical hurdle with sign-ups and confirmation emails. Eventually I had to find another platform to handle verification emails and password resets, then integrate it as another layer on top. It sounds basic, but before building this I never thought twice about how that logic actually works. Sometimes, you get stuck in a loop. Generative AI can be like a young, over-enthusiastic intern. Then I'd have to break it down again. That was probably the main skill I picked up, which I now use not just for building an app but for any other generative AI tool. What this made me realize is how far the technology has come. People in tech already know this — I have friends at places like Workday, Salesforce, Google, and Meta, and they're under a lot of pressure from their employers to pick up these skills because they have to deploy these solutions. It made me want to stay up to speed, because I'm sure that what I learned now will be semi-obsolete in just a couple of months. Before, if someone said AI is coming for your job, I might have panicked. And with my baby, I know the tools he grows up with will be completely different from what I had, or what my parents had. It emphasized that we need to keep up so that we can understand the world he'll grow up in. When I was younger and mobile phones came out, my parents were shocked: What is a smartphone? I want to understand what my son is using, how he's learning, and the world he'll grow up in. Do you have a story to share about vibe-coding?</p>
