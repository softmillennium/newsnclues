                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to ABC on Tuesday night after nearly a week off the air, but millions of viewers still won't see him. Sinclair, which owns or controls 39 ABC affiliate stations, said it will not air Jimmy Kimmel's show after Disney announced on Monday that it would return Tuesday night. "Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. ABC, which is owned by Disney, said last week that it pulled Jimmy Kimmel off the air "indefinitely" over his comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk and Trump's subsequent response. The decision came after FCC chair Brendan Carr publicly condemned Kimmel's comments and warned that broadcast licenses could be reviewed and that broadcasters are required to operate "in the public interest." After Kimmel's suspension, Sinclair released a list of demands in order to broadcast the comedian's late-night show again, including an apology and a donation to Kirk's family or his organization. On Monday, over 400 Hollywood entertainers, including at least four Disney Legends, signed a letter in support of Kimmel. Disney, which owns ABC, said on Monday that some of Kimmel's remarks about Kirk's killer were "ill-timed" and "insensitive." Nextstar, Sinclair, and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India wants to become a global chip major, but the odds are steep: competition is fierce, and India is a late entrant in the race to make the most advanced chips. For India, it offered an opportunity: the country wants to reduce dependence on imports, secure chips for strategic sectors, and capture a bigger share of the global electronics market shifting away from China. India is one of the world's largest consumers of electronics, but it has no local chip industry and plays a minimal role in the global supply chain. New Delhi's "Semiconductor Mission" aims to change that. India also has a pool of engineering talent that is already employed by global chip design companies. Yet progress so far has been uneven, and neither the investments nor talent pool is enough to make India's chip ambitions a reality, say experts. These include talent, tax, trade, technology policies, labor rates and laws and customs policies — all areas where India has work to do. Until now, chipmakers had no local demand for their product as there are hardly any electronic component manufacturing companies, such as phone camera companies, in India. But the new policy offers financial support to companies producing active and passive electronic components, creating a potential domestic buyer-supplier base that chip manufacturers can plug into. In 2022, the country also pivoted from its strategy of providing superior incentives to fabrication units making chips of 28nm or less. These chips can be used in new technologies like advanced AI and quantum computing by packing more transistors into the same space. "The Indian government has doled out generous incentives to attract semiconductor manufacturers to India," said Ezell, but he stressed that "those sorts of investments aren't sustainable forever." The biggest chip project in India currently is the 910-billion-rupee ($11 billion) semiconductor fabrication plant being built in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat by Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. The unit will make chips for power management integrated circuits, display drivers, microcontrollers and high-performance computing logic, Tata Electronics said, which can be used in AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries. These compound semiconductors can be used in missiles, defence equipment, electric vehicles, consumer appliances and solar power inverters, according to a government press release. "The coming 3-4 years is pivotal for advancing India's semiconductor goals," said Sujay Shetty, managing director of semiconductor at PwC India. Establishing operational silicon fabrication facilities and overcoming technical and infrastructural hurdles that extend beyond incentives will be a key milestone, according to Shetty. Fabrication sites need to meet stringent requirements, such as being in areas free from floods and vibrations, with reliable road connectivity — which can present ongoing logistical considerations for some regions. India also needs specialty chemical suppliers that meet "ultra-high purity standards essential for advanced semiconductor manufacturing," Shetty added. Beyond chip fabrication plants, many medium-sized companies in India have shown interest in setting up chip testing and packaging units. Several Indian groups are also entering the segment, attracted by its higher margins and lower capital intensity compared to fabs. "Outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) represents a significant opportunity for India, though clarifying market access and demand channels will be important for sustained growth," says Shetty. Success in this area will see India enter the global chip industry, but New Delhi is still a long way from locally developing and manufacturing the cutting-edge of chip technology: 2nm semiconductors. These 2nm chips offer better performance and power efficiency due to their smaller transistor size. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation will start mass-producing cutting-edge 2nm chips later this year, according to an FT report. Last week, Indian minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who was in Bengaluru to inaugurate a new office of semiconductor design firm ARM, said the British company will design the "most advanced chips used in AI servers, drones, mobile phone chips of 2 nm" from the south Indian city. But experts say the role of local talent is likely to be limited to non-core design testing and validation, as the core intellectual property for chip designs is often held in locations like the U.S. or Singapore, where established IP regimes support such activities. "India has sufficient talent in design space, because unlike semiconductor manufacturing and testing that has come up in the last 2 years, design has been there since 1990s," said Jayanth BR, a recruiter with over 15 years of experience in hiring for global semiconductor companies in India. He said global companies usually outsource "block-level" design validation work to India. Of course, improving enforcement mechanisms will go a long way in protecting IP rights," says Sajai Singh, a partner at Mumbai-based JSA Advocates & Solicitors. "Our competition is with countries like the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan, which not only have strong IP laws, but also a more established ecosystem for chip design."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move: Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue fell over 7% on Monday, extending the company's year-to-date loss to 21%, before rebounding by more than 4% in after-hours trading. This chart reflects the plunge during daytime trading hours only and does not represent the rebound in extended trading. Why: Reports on Monday indicated that White House officials were planning to link autism to Tylenol use during pregnancy. The over-the-counter pain drug, also known as acetaminophen, is manufactured by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Kenvue. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been focused on determining the causes of autism, framing it as a critical public health issue. An additional report from the administration will focus on the use of Tylenol for pregnant women and is expected to be released this month. This isn't the first time that risks posed by Tylenol use during pregnancy have been raised. In 2021, a study published by the medical journal Nature Reviews Endocrinology presented evidence that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen unless medically prescribed. What it means: Kenvue has said it strongly disagrees with claims that Tylenol is linked to autism, stating it believes science has shown there's no causal link to acetaminophen use. Kennedy has said that vaccines can be linked to autism, though many medical experts reject the claim. Update: Monday, September 22 — This story was updated to include information about the White House's official announcement and how Kenvue was trading after hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump will meet with the two top Democrats in Congress sometime this week as the federal government heads toward a possible shutdown, a person familiar with the meeting told CNBC. Trump's meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both New Yorkers, would come just days before a Sept. 30 deadline for Congress to pass a funding resolution that would keep the government open. Prospects for such a deal, as of now, look dim as Democrats hold firm on demands that any resolution  include an extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits. Those credits, which are used to lower the cost of health insurance plans purchased on Obamacare marketplaces, are currently set to expire at the end of 2025. "I hope and pray that Trump will sit down with us and negotiate a bipartisan bill," Schumer said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." Please check back for updates. Got a confidential news tip?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A California district attorney on Monday said that there is "circumstantial evidence" indicating that a former lobbyist accused of shooting at ABC's affiliate station in Sacramento was "politically motivated," and possibly spurred by the network's recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. The evidence includes a book critical of President Donald Trump and a note expressing animus toward three of Trump's top law-enforcement officials, Sacramento DA Thien Ho told NBC News on Monday. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez Santana, faces both state and federal charges for Friday afternoon's shooting at KXTV ABC10. "He chose a very particular target, and with the notes that he left behind and the target in place and the recent dismissal of the Jimmy Kimmel show, I think there's circumstantial evidence there to show that this was a politically motivated crime by this individual," Ho told NBC. "He drove up to the scene, got out on foot, fired at the building, at the ABC news station, got back in his vehicle, and left the scene, where we later arrested him at his residence." The attack, captured on surveillance video, occurred two days after the Disney subsidiary ABC suspended Kimmel after comments he made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Police found three holes in a window of the lobby of the ABC affiliate that were consistent with damage from bullets, according to a federal criminal complaint. Hernandez Santana was arrested Friday night by Sacramento police. A day earlier, protestors had gathered outside the station to protest Kimmel's suspension. Investigators found a handgun at Hernandez Santana's home, along with "a note in his calendar that said something to the extent of this is the next scary thing to do," Ho told NBC. Investigators also "conducted another search and found some disturbing handwritten notes next to an anti-Trump book" and "a note that was written by the defendant" about "hiding Epstein and ignoring red flags." A note found at Santana's car said, "For hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags. Do not support Patel, Bongino, & AG Pam Bondi. from above," according to a complaint filed against the former lobbyist in Sacramento federal court. Federal law enforcement files about Epstein have been withheld by the Justice Department despite Attorney General Pam Bondi's prior promise to release them to the public. Hernandez Sanatana is charged with multiple felonies. He is due to appear on Monday afternoon in federal court. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House on Monday denied reports that border czar Tom Homan allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash last year from undercover FBI agents during an alleged bribery sting operation. "Mr. Homan never took the $50,000 that you're referring to, so you should get your facts straight," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing when asked about the reports that emerged over the weekend. She also accused the FBI of trying to "entrap one of the president's top allies." Leavitt's comments follow reports by MSNBC and The New York Times that Homan accepted the cash after stating that he would help the undercover agents secure government contracts should then-candidate Donald Trump win a second term as president. The FBI and Justice Department were reportedly waiting to see if Homan would carry through on his pledge when he received a top administration role, according to MSNBC, which first reported on the operation. But the investigation was put on hold once Trump took office and ultimately closed a few weeks ago after FBI Director Kash Patel looked into the matter. Justice Department officials were reportedly unsure whether prosecutors could convince a jury that Homan took the money in exchange for carrying out specific actions, according to the Times. Homan allegedly accepted the cash on Sept. 20, 2024, at a meeting spot in Texas, MSNBC reported, citing a summary of the case and sources. The White House, Justice Department and FBI swiftly derided the reports as politically motivated. Leavitt doubled down on Monday: "The White House and the president stand by Tom Homan 100%, because he did absolutely nothing wrong," she said. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump on Friday announced that he would raise the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000, leaving companies scrambling. Employers now must have documentation of the payment prior to filing an H-1B petition on behalf of a worker. Applicants will have their petitions restricted for 12 months until the payment is made, according to the White House. Huang and Altman responded to the changes in an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt, where the two executives announced that Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as the artificial intelligence lab sets out to build hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of data centers based around the chipmaker's AI processors. And so I think immigration is really important to our company and is really important to our nation's future, and I'm glad to see President Trump making the moves he's making." OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also expressed a positive outlook on Trump's changes. "We need to get the smartest people in the country, and streamlining that process and also sort of outlining financial incentives seems good to me," Altman said. The new $100,000 fee would be a seismic shift for U.S. technology and finance sectors, which rely on the H-1B program for highly skilled immigrants, particularly from India and China. Those two countries accounted for 71% and 11.7% of visa holders last year, respectively. Those who already have H-1B visas and are located outside the U.S. will not be required to pay the fee in order to re-enter. Many employers use H-1B workers to fill the gaps in these highly technical roles that are not found within the American labor supply. -- CNBC tech reporter Annie Palmer contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle has appointed two new co-CEOs, as part of a succession plan put into motion months ago. Business Insider reported in June that Oracle had promoted cloud boss Clay Magouyrk and head of industries Mike Sicilia to the title of "president" as part of a succession plan, citing SEC filings and people familiar with the plans. The leadership changes come amid an AI-driven growth boom for Oracle. The company's stock price shot up more than 40%, its largest increase within a single day, earlier this month after it said it expects revenue for its cloud business to jump 77% to $18 billion compared to the previous year, and hit $144 billion by 2030. Magouyrk is a former Amazon software development engineer who joined Oracle as an individual contributor in 2014. His leadership style has at times been controversial. Sicilia is the executive vice president of Oracle Industries and the executive who has been leading Oracle's takeover of Cerner. Oracle's announcement cited Sicilia's work adding AI agents to cloud applications for industries. Oracle's succession plans have followed a similar format throughout the years. The first time, it named now Catz as a president along with a previous executive, Charles Phillips Jr. Oracle replaced Phillips with the late Mark Hurd after Hurd left HP. They each had the president title until both were promoted to co-CEOs in 2014 when Ellison stepped back. Hurd died in 2019, and while Ellison considered possible successors, he opted for Catz to remain the company's sole CEO.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Danish renewable energy company Orsted will restart work "as soon as possible" on a wind farm off the coast of New England, after a federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a stop work order. The Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered Orsted on Aug. 22 to halt construction on Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The project is fully permited and 80% complete. It would provide power for more than 350,000 homes. Orsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables filed a lawsuit against Interior that asked the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to lift the stop-work order. They argued that Interior's order to stop construction was aribtrary, capricious, unlawful and "issued in bad faith." Judge Royce Lamberth issued a temporary injunction Monday, saying Orsted had "demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits" and would likely suffer irreparable harm if the stop-work order remained in place. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Trump has targeted the wind power industry since his first day in office, when he banned new leases for offshore wind farms. But the industry had hoped that fully permitted wind projects, particularly those that are already under construciton, would be allowed to proceed. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said earlier this month that he is "taking a deep look" at five offshore wind projects in the U.S. that are under construction. Burgum made clear that Trump wants to shut down the offshore wind industry. "Under this administration, there is not a future for offshore wind because it is too expensive and not reliable enough," Burgum told an audience at the Gastech conference in Milan, Italy, on Sept. 11.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the New York City mayor's race, said Monday that he was canceling an upcoming town hall with an ABC affiliate in protest of the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show under pressure from the Trump administration. "I am withdrawing not as an indictment of the local affiliate or the hardworking journalists, but rather in response to the corporate leaders who have put their bottom line ahead of their responsibility in upholding the freedom of the press," Mamdani said at a campaign event on Manhattan's Roosevelt Island. ABC said last week that the show is off the air "indefinitely" on the heels of Nexstar Media Group saying that its stations affiliated with ABC would not carry Kimmel's show "for the foreseeable future" because of his statements tying Kirk's alleged killer to the MAGA movement. Those announcements came hours after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr suggested his agency could take action against ABC over Kimmel's comments. ABC's corporate parent Disney remains mum on the question of when — or if — Kimmel's show will return to the air. "We cannot understand this moment of authoritarianism as solely coming from the White House, when it is also characterized by the cowardice of those in response to it — the cowardice that we have seen typified whether by the parent company of ABC or by so-called leaders like Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams looking to the White House for their path to their future ambition," Mamdani said. Cuomo, a former New York governor, and the current New York City Mayor Adams are running as independents against Mamdani. "We have to understand who suffers in these moments. "The message that it sends to each and every American across this country is a message that the First Amendment is no longer a right that can be counted on, but rather that it is the government which will determine what should and should not be discussed, what can and cannot be spoken," he said. A White House spokesperson, commenting on Mamdani's move, in an email to NBC News said, 'It's not surprising that the Little Communist is too scared to defend his absurd policy positions on live TV." Cuomo campaign spokesperson Rich Azzopardi  told NBC,  "ABC suspending Kimmel was a big mistake, but refusing to talk to local reporters because of the actions of their parent company shouldn't pass anyone's smell test and the press shouldn't continue to give him a pass." Meanwhile, a slew of Oscar winners and other Hollywood artists are backing Kimmel in a new letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union. "Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation," said the ACLU's letter, which has more than 400 signatories. "In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees," the letter says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michelob Ultra has overtaken Constellation Brands' Modelo Especial as the best-selling beer in the United States. Michelob Ultra claimed the top spot as the best-selling beer in retail channels in the 52 weeks ended Sept. 14, parent company Anheuser-Busch announced Monday, citing data from Circana. For brewer AB InBev, Michelob Ultra's triumph reverses the company's struggles from two years ago. Modelo Especial unseated Bud Light in the wake of conservative backlash over the flagship beer's partnership with transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Modelo's declining popularity comes as Constellation faces key challenges to its business, including tariffs on aluminum and Mexican imports and weaker demand from Hispanic consumers. Historically, Hispanic beer drinkers have accounted for roughly half of Constellation's customer base, although growing demand from non-Hispanic consumers helped fuel Modelo's rise. Executives have said that President Donald Trump's immigration policies and related job losses have weighed on Hispanic consumers' spending. Earlier this month, Constellation cut its forecast for the fiscal year, citing a "challenging" economy. The company expects net beer sales will fall 2% to 4% due to lower volumes and additional tariff impacts. It previously anticipated sales would range from flat to up 3%. So far this year, AB InBev's stock has climbed more than 16%, while shares of Constellation have tumbled 39%. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move: Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue fell 8% on Monday, extending the company's year-to-date loss to 21%. Why: Reports on Monday indicate that White House officials are planning to link autism to Tylenol use during pregnancy. The over-the-counter pain drug is manufactured by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a subsidiary of Kenvue. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has been focused on determining the causes of autism, framing it as a critical public health issue. This isn't the first time that risks posed by Tylenol use during pregnancy have been raised. In 2021, a study published by the medical journal Nature Reviews Endocrinology presented evidence that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen unless medically prescribed. What it means: Kenvue has said it strongly disagrees with claims that Tylenol is linked to autism, stating it believes science has shown there's no causal link to acetaminophen use. Vaccine makers in particular have been under pressure amid changes to vaccine guidance proposed by the government. Kennedy has said that vaccines can be linked to autism, though many medical experts reject the claim. Pfizer and Merck & Co. are among the companies that have struggled since Kennedy assumed control of the HHS.</p>

Why: AgriFORCE announced plans for a dramatic shift in its business on Monday. The agritech company had already ventured into bitcoin mining in 2020, but now it's diving even further into crypto with plans to start buying digital tokens issued on the Avalanche. AgriForce plans to raise $550 million, with investors so far including hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci and blockchain-focused investment firm Hivemind Capital. The native crypto token of the decentralized Avalanche blockchain network, AVAX, has been on a hot streak recently, up 30% in a month. In its statement on its new strategy, AgriFORCE said that it plans to own $700 million worth of AVAX tokens and also aims to tokenize other assets that can be traded on the Avalanche blockchain. Numerous other small-cap companies have opted to switch their focus to digital assets, often sparking huge gains in their stock price overnight. Last week, shares of sports holding company Brera Holdings announced that it would pivot to operate as a Solana treasury, sending shares up 450% in two days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason Munderloh, a part-time ride-hailing driver of 10 years and lifelong San Francisco resident. It has been edited for length and clarity. I'm from San Francisco and have been driving for Uber and Lyft for 10 years. I also organize a group called Rideshare Drivers United in the Bay Area. I don't want to give these companies money, and I don't support their business model. I'm always happy to talk with other rideshare drivers — it's part of what I do as a union organizer. I had some safety concerns, but I also think having the added element of a human driver makes travel better and more efficient. After my experience, I'd give Waymo and Tesla's robotaxi four out of five stars. The rides felt fine, but I think there's always room for improvement. The pros are what I thought they might be: You don't have to deal with a person — at least in a Waymo. Every person that I get a ride from — they're from Eritrea, they're from Bangalore, they're from some place I just never really thought about, and I get to be near this person, talk to them, and find out what they think of the city that I grew up in. I appreciated that the Waymo pulled up with its hazard lights on. I think that's the right thing to do. The Waymo, however, stopped about a block away from where we were. The Waymo also has good eyes. I see the appeal of having time to yourself in a car and being able to put on whatever music you want. But I didn't like the part where I was sitting next to an empty driver's seat. Maybe that's why I got the uncanny valley feeling — you can't quite place it, but something's not quite right. But after a while, the novelty of not having a person there wore off quickly. Maybe I'm jaded because I've seen them around the city for a long time, but I wouldn't pay more for one of those. I considered buying the car before I ended up with a Chevy Bolt, which kind of has similar styling inside as a Tesla in some ways. It felt safe under the conditions we were in. The Waymo felt a little more conservative, while the Tesla's acceleration was just a little bit quicker. I might use entertainment options like Netflix or YouTube if it were a long drive or if I were particularly internet-addicted. However, most of these things you'd do on your phone anyway. It's interesting that a person is sitting in the car with you. However, I do appreciate that there's a driver there at least because if something went wrong, there would be somebody to take over in a way a Waymo can't. It seems kind of pointless on one hand, but on the other hand, the point is to get to a destination safely, and sometimes, you need a human for that. I would've gotten to the destinations quicker and safer with a more efficient route. Waymo and Tesla did as good a job as they could, given the technology the cars are equipped with — cameras, lidars, or maps. The robotaxis also don't have personality. The experience was a little sterile. There's the loss of human connection, which is something I would hate to lose. It does not end well if we just continue not to think about other people and not know about other people's very different experiences from our own. However, most of what I think about robotaxis is about its economic impacts — and that doesn't stop at the fact that it's putting a driver out of work or driving their wages down. That driver who just lost their job? They used to spend in the local economy. I would like people to evaluate what that would mean for San Francisco, that suddenly, many people not only lose their jobs but are not spending money back into the economy. For the most part, the reason people think that robotaxis are inevitable is because we haven't really fought to create any control over whether we're going to have autonomous vehicles on our roads in any organized way. As a matter of what's happening on our roads that we pay for through our taxes, this should be something that's worked out somewhat democratically in a way that it hasn't been. I don't want to remove these things from the roads entirely — unless that's what the people want.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On an episode of his talk show "Last Week Tonight," aired late on Sunday, the British American comedian said Kimmel was "by no means the first casualty in Trump's attacks on free speech." "A mine that at this point now seems more dead canary than coal." Oliver devoted the majority of his 40-minute-long episode to talking about Kimmel's suspension. Oliver joined the ranks of comedy talk-show hosts who have weighed in on Kimmel's suspension. On Thursday night, four of late night's best-known voices — Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart — criticized Disney's move and defended Kimmel. Stewart gave a sarcastic monologue on the suspension. Meyers said it was a "big moment for our democracy." Colbert called it a "blatant assault on the freedom of speech." And Fallon said he hoped Kimmel would get his show back. Oliver's segment on Kimmel was longer and more critical than those of the American talk show hosts. He ended the segment on Kimmel by urging media companies to stand up against "stupid, ridiculous demands."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French economist Gabriel Zucman proposed the tax, which would be imposed on the ultra-rich with net worths of over 100 million euros, or about $117 million. Speaking to British newspaper The Sunday Times, Arnault said, "This is clearly not a technical or economic debate, but rather a clearly stated desire to destroy the French economy." Zucman responded to Arnault's criticisms in a series of X posts on Sunday. He said he was surprised by the "caricatural nature" of Arnault's attacks on him, and the tycoon's comments "depart from rationality and are unfounded." Zucman denied Arnault's claims that his motives were political in nature. He said he has never been an activist in any movement or a member of any party, and his only work was as a researcher and teacher. According to his faculty profile, he teaches at the Paris School of Economics and UC Berkeley. "Whatever you may think, the time has come to subject billionaires to a minimum tax rate," Zucman wrote on X, calling it an "instrument of justice, social peace, and budgetary stability." Reuters reported that in 2017, French President Emmanuel Macron scrapped France's decadeslong wealth tax, which was imposed on individuals with assets above 1.3 million euros. Protests broke out in France last week over the French government's proposed budget cuts, with protesters carrying "tax the rich" banners in support of Zucman's proposed tax plan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yann Schuermans, the CEO of Baskit, who is based in Jakarta, Indonesia. His words have been edited for length and clarity. By 30, my career looked ideal on paper, but I couldn't ignore the pull to create something of my own. When I was studying international management at the University of Manchester, I spent a year abroad in Hong Kong. That experience opened my eyes to Asia's pace and possibilities, and I knew I wanted to be part of it. With my Belgian-Brazilian background and a family history in brewing, stepping into the world's largest beer company felt both ambitious and familiar. I threw myself into the work. By my mid-20s, I was chief of staff to the region's CEO, then general manager for Hong Kong and Macau, and later strategy director and head of M&A for the region. On the outside, it looked like everything was falling into place. But inside, I felt married to a single corporate identity. I kept coming back to the same question: What would it look like to start something of my own, without the safety net? The next year, I co-founded Baskit with my wife, Yoonjung Yi. Our goal was to digitize Southeast Asia's fragmented supply chains and help small and medium-sized brands reach the market with better distribution, support, and credit. We nearly lost our visas, couldn't pay ourselves, and survived on $100,000 in savings from family and personal funds. Through mentors and local networks, we raised $5.5 million. Entrepreneurship tested me, but I drew on lessons from corporate life. At AB InBev, I often faced unpredictable situations while traveling to more than 100 countries. Improvisation became second nature, and that mindset turned into my survival kit at Baskit. Ideas rarely show up fully formed. Baskit today looks very different from what I imagined on day one. The key has been composure, resilience, and adaptability when things go sideways. Fast forward, we've grown to more than 50 people, and we've had a few profitable quarters under our belt. Our early scrappiness built muscles we still rely on. At AB InBev, my schedule was structured and supported. As a founder, each day is chaos and filled with a mix of sales pitches, fundraising calls, product pivots, and customer complaints. We had to sit in traffic with distributors; watch goods move through small shops; and see late payments or stalled deliveries firsthand. Building trust meant hours with wholesalers just to earn another meeting. Infrastructure gaps, language barriers, and constant pivots made every day complicated. But Jakarta was where the lessons — and opportunities — were. The past two and a half years have been the steepest learning curve of my life. We share the roller coaster — celebrating wins together, pushing through low points side by side. But our lives, careers, and future plans are all tied to one venture, which can compound the stress, especially as we think about starting a family. During the toughest fundraising days, we leaned on each other's resolve. We'd met at AB InBev, where she worked as HR Manager, so blending work and life always came naturally. With our third co-founder, Abhishek Pansari, covering strategy, we've learned to complement one another without overlap. If I've learned anything, it's that you don't wait for the "right" time to leap. Cover your basics, then take the jump. Get in touch with the editor: akarplus@businessinsider.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Laura Zaccaria, a Singapore-based HR professional and new mom who taught herself to build an AI-assisted web app while on six months of maternity leave. It's been edited for length and clarity. I've never studied anything related to coding. My husband started to dabble with vibe coding. He replicated my not-for-profit yoga organization website and sent me the link. He was like, "See what you can do now in a couple of hours?" He was going to sign up for a class called Code with AI in June. Becoming a mother was a very life-altering experience — suddenly, my baby became the center of my world. I didn't even have a personal laptop to install the software needed, so I bought one for this class. It's a capsule of time before going back to work, and in a career, you rarely get that. As a new mom, I started to think about my baby's weaning — he's starting to eat solid food. I thought, How are we going to plan all the meals when I go back to work? On weekends, my husband would take the baby away for a couple of hours or just play with him so I could keep working on it. It kept my brain active in a different way. When I went on leave, I unplugged from corporate life and was fully focused on caring for a small human. That uses such a different part of your brain. Picking up new skills gave me confidence that I can continue to evolve. Being a mom is not my sole identity. If I got stuck, I'd just ask Cursor, and it would tell me, "Here's what you can do, here's where to look." I faced a technical hurdle with sign-ups and confirmation emails. Eventually I had to find another platform to handle verification emails and password resets, then integrate it as another layer on top. It sounds basic, but before building this I never thought twice about how that logic actually works. Sometimes, you get stuck in a loop. Generative AI can be like a young, over-enthusiastic intern. Then I'd have to break it down again. That was probably the main skill I picked up, which I now use not just for building an app but for any other generative AI tool. What this made me realize is how far the technology has come. People in tech already know this — I have friends at places like Workday, Salesforce, Google, and Meta, and they're under a lot of pressure from their employers to pick up these skills because they have to deploy these solutions. It made me want to stay up to speed, because I'm sure that what I learned now will be semi-obsolete in just a couple of months. Before, if someone said AI is coming for your job, I might have panicked. And with my baby, I know the tools he grows up with will be completely different from what I had, or what my parents had. It emphasized that we need to keep up so that we can understand the world he'll grow up in. When I was younger and mobile phones came out, my parents were shocked: What is a smartphone? I want to understand what my son is using, how he's learning, and the world he'll grow up in. Do you have a story to share about vibe-coding?</p>
