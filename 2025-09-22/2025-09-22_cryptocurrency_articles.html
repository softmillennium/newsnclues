                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark (CLSK) has secured a new $100 million credit facility with Coinbase Prime, giving it access to fresh capital without selling its bitcoin holdings or raising equity. "Our 'Infrastructure First' strategy has been proven historically and will further enhance shareholder value as we expand into more diversified compute opportunities." The new raise comes after recent leadership changes hinted at the miner going beyond just mining bitcoin and diversifying into other revenue opportunities. The focus on HPC isn't surprising, as more and more bitcoin miners are pivoting into hosting machines that cater to HPC and artificial intelligence computing, which requires a tremendous amount of energy, in their data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Automated compliance solutions harness these benefits to ensure that regulatory requirements are met in real time. This allows businesses to operate confidently in an increasingly complicated regulatory environment. For startups in the crypto game, tools like ACE offer a lot of benefits. They simplify processes and cut costs, letting startups focus on innovation instead of getting tangled in red tape. For example, Know-Your-Issuer (KYI) tools help verify token issuers efficiently, while automated reporting makes operational challenges easier to manage. This boosts compliance and positions startups for growth in a competitive market. But let's not sugarcoat it—navigating compliance is still tough for many startups, especially when it comes to crypto payroll systems. Global payroll compliance is a nightmare, and the differing regulations across jurisdictions can be overwhelming. Many startups struggle with limited resources, making it hard to implement good compliance technologies. Often, they find themselves flirting with non-compliance, which can lead to hefty fines and a tarnished reputation. Automated compliance tools will grow more sophisticated, and they'll play a key role in helping businesses keep up with the evolving landscape. However, regulators need to consider the consequences of creating overly complex compliance requirements that could stifle innovation. In summary, automated compliance solutions like ACE are set to shake up the crypto world. They offer real-time compliance capabilities and lessen operational burdens, enabling startups to succeed even in a tough regulatory environment. But it's essential for businesses and regulators to collaborate on a framework that supports innovation while keeping the financial system intact. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, embracing compliance will be vital for unlocking its full potential and ensuring sustainable growth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strive Inc., the asset manager turned Bitcoin treasury company led by former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, has agreed to acquire Semler Scientific — a move that positions the combined entity as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. The combined company will now control more than 10,900 BTC, making it the 12th-largest public Bitcoin holder — ahead of Hut 8 Mining, Block Inc. and Galaxy Digital, according to industry data. Ramaswamy first outlined Strive's Bitcoin treasury strategy in May, coinciding with the company's plans to go public via a reverse merger. Semler Scientific, a health-tech firm that adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in 2024, has steadily built up its holdings through multiple purchases. Related: Semler Scientific plans Bitcoin holdings of 105,000 BTC by 2027 The Strive–Semler Scientific merger comes amid the rise of digital asset treasury companies, which have accumulated billions of dollars in Bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, other cryptocurrencies such as Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL). According to Standard Chartered, the deal may also underscore a broader trend: compressed market net asset values (mNAVs), which can increase financial risks and make expansion more difficult. For crypto treasurers, mNAV represents the ratio of a company's enterprise value to its digital asset holdings. When this ratio falls below 1, expanding reserves becomes more difficult and riskier, particularly if funded through debt. Standard Chartered recently noted that industry consolidation is likely under these conditions, with larger, more liquid players positioned to weather volatility and raise capital for acquisitions. If mNAVs remain depressed, the bank said, stronger companies could move to acquire weaker rivals. HashKey Capital CEO Deng Chao recently cautioned that only crypto treasury companies with a long-term strategy will “survive any market,” emphasizing the importance of building lasting value rather than chasing short-term gains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has plunged by over $10,000 since its all-time high in July, leaving traders divided on whether the market has one more significant leg up left. Historically, however, heavy retail optimism often precedes further downside, raising questions about whether capitulation has occurred. The retrace, just -8.1% over six weeks, is mild by Bitcoin's standards, as prior cycle corrections typically ran -15% to -20% before panic selling emerged. Leverage data remains mixed: shorts spiked ahead of the drop but flipped quickly back to longs, muting prospects for a short squeeze rebound. Social sentiment has grown more fearful, but not yet at extreme capitulation levels that mark cycle bottoms.

Ben McKenzie has played cops, caped-city detectives and, yes, that guy from The O.C. But in his new feature documentary Everyone Is Lying to You for Money, he's the writer, director, and producer steering a globe-trotting, skeptical — and surprisingly funny — investigation into the hype cycles and human costs of cryptocurrency. “Like so many great adventures, slow moving midlife crisis was partially responsible,” he jokes of how the pandemic nudged him from idle curiosity to full-blown obsession. A friend urged him to buy Bitcoin; McKenzie, armed with an economics degree he hadn't used “in 20 years in showbiz,” resisted the FOMO and started reading the fine print. He found the SEC's “seven red flags for fraud”— and says crypto “checked off five, arguably six of the seven.” “I was like, ‘OK, I'm on to something. Related Stories How female filmmakers could make history in the 2026 Best Director Oscar race ‘One Battle After Another': Will the Paul Thomas Anderson film campaign as a drama or comedy? McKenzie first channeled that curiosity into journalism and the book project Easy Money with coauthor Jacob Silverman. But once he and Silverman were in the field, cameras started rolling. Serendipity struck on day one in Austin, Texas, where McKenzie “almost physically ran into” Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky on the South by Southwest floor. The encounter set a tone — equal parts absurd and ominous — that the film sustains: “He was just completely a used car salesman, totally full of it. If you hear “crypto doc” and picture a dry explainer, McKenzie's version aims for the opposite. “Humor really was always the North Star,” he says. … Almost every woman has a story about men telling them about Bitcoin.” To keep audiences engaged, he leans into his own persona — “making fun of my O.C. The film's 101 elements are woven through on-the-ground reporting from New York to London, Miami to Washington, D.C., with two pivotal stops: El Salvador and Austin. … El Salvador was always very important to me in the story because it shows the real world consequences for this insanity with this community that's been displaced.” The government's promise that Bitcoin could revolutionize remittances ran aground on basic functionality and hard economics. “The system just didn't work at all… It was a whole pitch that [President Nayib Bukele] had that he was going to create this tech utopia fantasy. But that's just not the reality in El Salvador.” In Austin, McKenzie plays into the “gullible actor” archetype to test for predatory pitches and presses executives about business models that sound too good to be true. Celsius becomes a central case study: the company promising “magical” 15-20 percent returns if customers handed over their money. ‘Well, that's proprietary, we can't tell you,'” he recalls. In the film (and in our interview), McKenzie is careful about intent — “I'll never be able to know” if they started with a fraudulent idea — but blunt on outcomes: “I think it was always intended to be. … Alex Mashinsky is now doing 12 years in prison for fraud. Compared with Bernie Madoff, “it affected far more people,” he argues, citing polls that tens of millions of Americans bought some crypto — often “a few hundred dollars” they could ill afford to lose. The pain has been “wider, but shallower… with some huge exceptions” of victims who lost life savings. Now, with mainstream political tailwinds and looser guardrails, he worries about contagion: if a future crash is “more tied to our actual regulated system… it could be a part of a thing that takes down the whole system that causes a 2008 crash.” He points to the 2020–22 banking failures as a preview: “Three banks that failed, they were all tied to crypto. After tracing crypto's rise and collapse through companies like Celsius, McKenzie also sits down with one of the most infamous figures in the space, Sam Bankman-Fried. (Watch Gold Derby's exclusive clip from that interview below.) McKenzie's transformation from skeptic to public advocate culminated in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Nerves hit beforehand, but years on sets paid dividends once the hearing began. He drafted an opening statement, gamed out questions, and found the room's formality familiar. “When crypto says that it can create a trustless money by just using computer code to replace people, that's a lie. Trust is a human thing.” The warning extends beyond crypto. “There's an awful lot of the crypto hype that's now transferred into AI. Morena Baccarin, McKenzie's wife, “completely steal two scenes,” voicing the skeptical partner so many viewers recognize at home. “She was not thrilled about the cameras in the house,” he says, but she's proud — and audiences, especially women, have relished seeing their eye-rolls mirrored on screen: “It's a lot of, ‘I knew it. '” There's also a brief, buzzy appearance from Gerard Butler. “Yeah, I think so … he had gotten in early through a friend,” McKenzie says, before launching into the follow-up he now asks reflexively: “You actually have the money?” More often than not, the profits live on paper — “‘Well, no, no, it's in an account'” — somewhere far away. The aim wasn't to make a 90-minute dunk on crypto but to hold two truths at once: that the spectacle is entertaining, and that the stakes are real for people who got hurt. “Tell an entertaining story, but also drop down and talk to the real victims of this fraud and bond with them.” Everyone Is Lying to You for Money premiered at the SXSW London Film Festival on June 6. Distribution plans are still being finalized, but McKenzie says he hopes audiences nationwide will have the chance to see it soon. If someone is thinking about buying tomorrow, he wants them to ask basic questions — and demand plain answers — before handing over a dollar. He's seen too many pitch-decks held together by vibes and the word “innovation.” “Often what happens when people try to convince you, they've created some new form of something that's way better than the previous thing, but they can't quite explain it. … Often that is fraud.” If Everyone Is Lying to You for Money leaves audiences laughing and looking twice at the story they're being sold, McKenzie will consider it a success.

On September 17, New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris issued new guidance on the use of blockchain analytics tools for covered banking institutions contemplating or already conducting virtual currency-related activities. The guidance notes that blockchain analytics tools can enhance compliance programs to mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies and prevent illegal activities. Specifically, NYDFS suggests that New York banking organizations, as well as all branches and agencies of NYDFS-licensed foreign banking organizations (collectively, “Covered Institutions”), consider the utility of blockchain analytics tools to:

 

 

The guidance notes that the above list of examples is not exhaustive and suggests that Covered Institutions consider leveraging blockchain analytics tools to enhance compliance programs and risk frameworks in a manner tailored to the institution's particular risk appetite and business model. The guidance further emphasizes that Covered Institutions must re-assess risk-management frameworks regularly in light of changing business models, new customer types, and new market entrants.

The announcement builds upon previously released NYDFS industry guidance, including the regulator's April 2022 Guidance on Use of Blockchain Analytics issued to all licensed virtual currency business entities and chartered limited purpose trust companies authorized to engage in virtual currency business activities in New York. NYDFS subsequently published its “VCRA Guidance,” which stated the regulator's expectation that all Covered Institutions seek prior approval before engaging in new or significantly different virtual currency- related activity. While the VCRA Guidance is still in effect, each of the federal banking regulators rescinded their similar guidance this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner BitMine Immersion bought more Ethereum last week, bringing its total holdings to 2.42 million ETH after its biggest buy so far in September. BitMine holds the largest Ethereum treasury of any publicly traded firm, and the second-largest overall crypto treasury behind Bitcoin giant Strategy's $72 billion BTC stockpile. In total, the company has $11.4 billion on its balance sheet. BMNR remains up more than 3% over the last month, per data from Yahoo Finance. The company also announced Monday that it had entered a deal to sell $365.2 million worth of shares to an unnamed institutional investor, with the sale set to be completed on or around Tuesday. BitMine has been issuing debt and looking for ways to raise money so it can buy ETH since May. Lee is the brains behind BitMine's ETH stacking strategy. Lee has long been bullish on Bitcoin, but in June said that Ethereum was making a comeback and could be the "next Bitcoin" as institutional investors express interest in the digital coin and its network. Tom Lee's Ethereum Treasury BitMine Boosts ETH Holdings to Nearly $10 Billion Ethereum was recently trading at nearly $4,180 per coin, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko, after dropping nearly 7% over a 24-hour period. The network is used by developers to build decentralized applications and launch tokens. Lee believes that the rising profile of stablecoins, which are heavily used on Ethereum, show how useful the network can be.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Observed annually on Oct. 1, International Coffee Day was established by the ICO member states — representing the majority of the world's leading coffee-producing countries — and first celebrated in 2015. Since its inception, the holiday has aimed to highlight the contributions of the world's coffee farmers and producers who bring coffee to life for consumers worldwide, while providing messaging for events, promotions and other marketing initiatives. Announcing the 2025 effort, ICO Executive Director Vanúsia Nogueira said the organization is calling for “practical collaboration that delivers real benefits along the whole chain.” The group has created a communications toolkit and multilingual resources to support the 2025 campaign. The ICO — which remains a leading advocate for coffee farmers, producers and sector-wide collaboration — oversees the International Coffee Agreement, which was last revised in 2022. For decades, the agreement involved a quota system for the world's coffee production, designed to stabilize global coffee prices. Although the international quota agreement was terminated in 1989, resulting in the current free-market period characterized by price volatility, the ICO continues to provide sector-wide data while promoting the long-term sustainability of the global coffee sector, including through International Coffee Day. “Coffee is a product of many hands and many hearts,” Nogueira said of this year's campaign. “When farmers, cooperatives, researchers, roasters, traders, baristas and consumers work together, we create opportunities for income, resilience and environmental stewardship.” Related PostsICO Flagship Development Report: Policy Makers Should Support CircularityICO Unveils Global Database of 400+ Coffee Sustainability ProjectsICO and UNIDO Outline an Unprecedented Global Coffee Fund</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This dramatic downturn is not an isolated event but a direct consequence of the broader cryptocurrency market crash, which has wiped out billions in value and severely curtailed speculative enthusiasm across the digital asset landscape. As the dust settles from successive crypto calamities, the future of digital collectibles hangs precariously, prompting a crucial re-evaluation of their inherent value and long-term utility. However, this bullish sentiment proved unsustainable, and the subsequent crypto market crash delivered a devastating blow. Major marketplaces like OpenSea, once the bustling hub of NFT transactions, witnessed a nearly 98% drop in trading volume from May to late August 2022, with daily transaction records dwindling from billions to mere millions. The cascading effect of these events continued into 2023 and 2024, with overall NFT trading volume in 2023 less than half of what it was in 2022, illustrating a sustained and severe contraction. Floor prices, the lowest price point for an NFT within a given collection, suffered equally dramatic depreciation. Even so-called "blue-chip" projects, once considered relatively stable, saw their values evaporate. Between June 10th and June 13th, 2022, collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, Doodles, and Cool Cats experienced floor price declines ranging from 18% to 33%. Solana-based NFTs were particularly hard hit after the FTX collapse, with their aggregate floor value dropping by a staggering 68%, partly due to FTX's prior advocacy for the Solana blockchain. Investor sentiment, once characterized by "fear of missing out" (FOMO), has largely shifted to "fear," with a significant erosion of public confidence and a growing skepticism towards the entire NFT industry. The NFT Winter has proven to be a harsh arbiter, separating projects and platforms built on speculative fervor from those grounded in utility, community, and genuine innovation. While the downturn has brought widespread losses, it has also compelled a necessary evolution, revealing surprising resilience in some corners of the ecosystem. Many "blue-chip" collections, once symbols of digital status, have seen their floor prices and sales volumes dramatically shrink. For instance, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), a flagship project of Yuga Labs, experienced a 61% decline in sales volume in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, with celebrity endorsers reportedly removing their Apes as profile pictures. Numerous smaller, less established projects, often referred to as "jpeg flips," have become entirely "worthless," with over 1,600 projects on Ethereum deemed defunct by early 2023. NFT marketplaces that failed to innovate or adapt also suffered. While OpenSea (NYSE: OPEN), once dominant, saw its market share severely eroded, others like GameStop (NYSE: GME), DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG), Immutable, and Kraken (NYSE: KRKN) notably exited the NFT market, unable to sustain operations amidst the reduced activity and interest. Artists who relied heavily on secondary market royalties also faced significant challenges as many platforms shifted to royalty-optional models, further cutting into their potential earnings. Milady Maker also saw a significant price surge and maintained a solid floor, while The Captainz by Memeland and Doodles (which saw sales rise to $32 million in Q1 2025, partly due to a collaboration with McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)) showcased the power of strong communities and strategic partnerships. Even OpenSea has shown signs of a comeback in early 2025, regaining market share through platform developments and teasing an official token. Traditional companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) proved that utility-driven NFT programs can still thrive, successfully selling out 2,000 digital tokens in minutes. Luxury brands like Nike (NYSE: NKE), Adidas (XETRA: ADDYY), and Gucci (PPRUY) continue to integrate NFTs into their strategies for enhanced consumer engagement and loyalty, viewing them as long-term brand extensions rather than speculative assets. Furthermore, the focus has shifted towards Web3 gaming, with projects like Axie Infinity (AXS-USD) and The Sandbox (SAND-USD) becoming key catalysts for potential market revitalization. Artists who have built strong direct-to-fan communities or focused on innovative, utility-rich digital art, such as Tyler Hobbs and Emily Yang (pplpleasr), have also managed to weather the storm, demonstrating the enduring value of genuine artistic talent and engaged patronage. This pressure is accelerating innovation in areas like Web3 gaming, where NFTs serve as in-game assets providing true ownership, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which uses NFTs to represent fractional ownership of physical properties, art, or commodities. Governments and financial bodies worldwide are now actively debating how to classify NFTs—as securities, commodities, or unique digital assets—a decision that will have profound implications for future market structure, investor protection, and compliance requirements. Historically, this period mirrors other speculative bubbles, such as the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, where many overvalued companies collapsed, but resilient and fundamentally sound technologies eventually emerged to redefine industries. In the short term, expect continued market consolidation, with less viable projects fading into obscurity and stronger, utility-focused initiatives gaining traction. The emphasis will remain on real-world applications and tangible benefits, moving beyond profile pictures to encompass areas like digital identity, verifiable credentials, and loyalty programs. Marketplaces will continue to compete fiercely on features, fees, and multi-chain support, with platforms like Magic Eden demonstrating the agility needed to capture new market segments (e.g., Bitcoin Ordinals). Strategic pivots will be crucial for survival, with many projects shifting from a pure collectibles model to incorporating their NFTs into gaming, metaverse experiences, or even traditional brand activations. We will likely see more institutional adoption, but with a cautious and compliance-focused approach, as major corporations seek to leverage NFTs for verifiable ownership and enhanced customer engagement. Emerging market opportunities will coalesce around interoperable NFTs, which can seamlessly transition across different platforms and metaverses, as well as the tokenization of illiquid assets, unlocking new forms of investment and ownership. Potential scenarios include a gradual recovery driven by technological advancements and clearer regulatory frameworks, leading to a more stable and less volatile market where value is derived from utility rather than speculation. The key takeaway from this period of contraction is that the underlying technology of NFTs—digital scarcity and verifiable ownership on a blockchain—retains its power, but its application must transcend fleeting trends. Moving forward, the NFT ecosystem will likely be characterized by greater maturity and a focus on long-term sustainability. The speculative froth has largely been removed, paving the way for projects that offer genuine utility, foster strong communities, and demonstrate clear use cases. Investors should watch for regulatory clarity, as clear guidelines will provide much-needed stability and legitimacy to the market. Furthermore, attention should be paid to projects that are effectively integrating NFTs into Web3 gaming, real-world asset tokenization, and established brand strategies, as these are likely to drive the next wave of adoption and value creation. The NFT Winter, therefore, is not an end, but a necessary crucible from which a more resilient, useful, and integrated digital collectibles market is beginning to emerge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum and Solana lead altcoin surge, attracting significant capital as digital assets respond to Fed's policy shift. Last week, the Federal Reserve's decision to trim interest rates set off a new wave of investment into digital asset funds, with CoinShares tracking $1.9 billion of fresh inflows. The policy shift, a 25 basis-point cut announced after the September FOMC meeting, gave investors a clearer signal that risk assets could benefit from easier financial conditions. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, noted that market traders initially hesitated as they interpreted the so-called “hawkish cut” as a mixed message. “Inflows resumed later in the week, with $746 million entering on Thursday and Friday as markets began to digest the implications for digital assets.” He noted that the momentum carried total assets under management in crypto investment products to $40.4 billion, the highest level recorded this year. Considering this, he said 2025 could rival or surpass last year's $48.6 billion tally if the current pace continues. Bitcoin remained the biggest draw, capturing $977 million in inflows last week. As a result, BTC-focused funds have now seen inflows of nearly $4 billion this month, while their year-to-date flows stood at $24.7 billion. The funds manage more than $183 billion worth of assets in their various portfolios. On the other hand, the appetite for short-Bitcoin products has continued to drop, with the funds losing $3.5 million last week and sliding to a multi-year low of $83 million under management. The Short Bitcoin fund situation can be linked to investors' reluctance to bet against Bitcoin because they believe the loose monetary policy tilts the balance back toward risk-on trades. Meanwhile, investors' interest in altcoin products was pronounced last week, as this class of digital assets drew around $1 billion inflow. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto asset by market cap, led inflows for these altcoins, drawing $772 million in fresh capital. This inflow pushed its year-to-date total to $12.6 billion and sent assets under management in Ethereum products to a record $40.3 billion. Both assets have now cleared the $1.5 billion mark in 2025 inflows. Cardano, Sui, Litecoin, and Chainlink drew around $6 million together, reflecting a broad, if lighter, spread of investor interest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market kicked off the week with one of its sharpest downturns of 2025, erasing more than $151 billion in market value within a single day. Altcoins such as XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) tumbled between 7–12%, erasing recent gains and signaling an abrupt end to the latest altcoins rally. The cascade began with BTC dipping below $113,000, triggering margin calls and automated sell-offs. Within just 30 minutes, liquidations had surged past $1 billion, underscoring the fragility of highly leveraged trading environments. The sell-off also brought a sharp reversal in market sentiment. The Altcoin Season Index, which peaked at 100 points just days ago, has now dropped to 64, suggesting traders are shifting back toward Bitcoin. Historically, altcoin seasons last only a few weeks before liquidity rotates back into Bitcoin. Analysts warn that the latest liquidation cascade may have ended this cycle earlier than expected. Smaller tokens, including ASTER, WLFI, and PUMP, which recently saw speculative surges, were among the hardest hit, with more than $263 million in altcoins longs liquidated. Overleveraged traders were washed out, creating stronger support levels for long-term holders. Institutional demand remains intact, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recording steady inflows last week, suggesting that large investors continue to buy the dip. On-chain data also shows 420,000 ETH leaving exchanges, pointing toward accumulation despite short-term volatility. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto neo-bank Shield announced on Monday that it has raised a $5 million seed round led by Giant Ventures. It allows exporters and importers to conduct cross-border transactions in U.S. cryptocurrencies, while also providing compliance screenings, such as addressing sanctions and money-laundering threats. So he teamed up with his brother Isaiah and his college best friend, Luis Carchi, to address how stablecoins could be used in international payments, as that was a pain point the trio faced when they last tried to build a trade business. “Today, trade businesses in regions like Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia often wait days or weeks for international wires, pay high fees, and in many cases, can't access U.S. dollars at all,” Udotong continued. That's where Shield comes in, which Udotong said hopes to let international businesses amplify their reach — and profit — by expanding access to customers in different markets. Crypto has had a roaring comeback this past year, minting new unicorns and nabbing hundreds of millions of dollars, after a reputationally hard past few years. Shield met its lead investors, Giant Ventures, through a fellow founder. Others in the round include Chris Dixon's a16z's crypto startup accelerator, Factor Capital, alongside Coinbase and Bank of America as strategic angel investors. The fresh capital will be used to secure more banking partnerships, as the company already has two main banking partners, though it declined to disclose exact names. It will also look to continue building out its compliance product. “If we succeed, more businesses in underserved regions will survive and grow, creating jobs and wealth for their communities instead of being left behind,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$BNB is one of the strongest large-cap altcoins in 2025, climbing from $500 to the magic $1,000 mark in just a few months. In times like these, when a token is rallying hard, online sentiment often turns overwhelmingly bullish, with both retail and institutional analysts churning out one aspirational price target after another. But to keep sanity intact and offer you an objective analysis of the situation, we asked Grok where $BNB could realistically head in the coming months. Grok first pointed to $BNB's weekly chart, where its current rally is coming from the breakout of a pattern channel that had been in place since June 2024. This gave us the next possible target of $1.35K, which is around 30% above current levels. While this is still very bullish, it's not the most intriguing part of Grok's analysis. When we fed Grok the monthly $BNB chart, things became even more enthusiastic. On the top side, it was capped by a strong resistance level of $630 to $650, which it broke out of very recently. So $BNB is all set to double in the coming months. With that in mind, we asked Grok about the best low-cap coins to buy right now. Snorter Token ($SNORT) shines as the best crypto to buy now, offering a game-changing solution to the long-standing issue of institutional dominance in meme coin trading. Right now, most of the liquidity in new meme coins is swept away by large institutional traders with access to sophisticated algorithms and bots, leaving little for retail participants. It uses MEV-resistant layers to protect you from honeypots, rug pulls, and sophisticated sandwich attacks. According to our $SNORT price prediction, the token could hit $0.94 by the end of 2025, representing a massive 800% return on current prices. The $SNORT presale is currently live, with over $4M already raised. Visit $SNORT's official website to learn more about how this trading bot combines top-notch security with ease of use. Much like Snorter, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) also aims to solve a critical real-world issue: content platforms charging heavy fees from creators while offering virtually no next-gen assistance in return. SUBBD plans to transform the way users interact with their favorite creators and consume content. These tools will save creators a ton of time, enabling them to engage more directly and organically with their fans to build real connections. Content viewers, on the other hand, can use the $SUBBD token to access exclusive content, request personalized creations from their favorite artists, and even send them tips. Unlike other presale platforms that offer dynamic staking returns, SUBBD offers a flat 20% reward for the first year, giving investors steady passive income assurance. Additionally, staking unlocks special perks such as behind-the-scenes content and exclusive creator livestreams. SUBBD Token is currently in its presale stage, having already raised over $1.17M from early investors. Check out our detailed guide on how to buy $SUBBD. Visit SUBBD Token's official website to learn more about how it's narrowing the gap between creators and their fans. CZ's Dog ($BROCCOLI) is a hyper-popular meme coin on the BNB Chain, based on the pet dog (named Broccoli) of Binance's ex-CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao. Then, as soon as he posted a picture of his dog, the meme coin community was quick to pounce on the opportunity and mint $BROCCOLI tokens. It's worth noting that several $BROCCOLI tokens flooded the market, with some rallying over 1,000% within a week. CZ's Dog is one of the few BROCCOLI tokens that remain relevant today. Being on the BNB Chain, traders also benefit from lower transaction costs. This could be one reason why, despite being a meme coin, CZ's Dog consistently clocks an average daily trading volume of around $18M. We suggest keeping a close watch on $BROCCOLI as it approaches this major resistance. Buy your $BROCCOLI through MEXC or other leading exchanges.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired an additional 850 BTC for approximately $99.7 million at an average price of $117,344 per bitcoin between Sept. 15 and Sept. 21, according to an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Strategy now holds a total of 639,835 BTC — worth around $72 billion — bought at an average price of $73,971 per bitcoin for a total cost of around $47.3 billion, including fees and expenses, according to the company's co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor. The latest acquisitions were made using proceeds from at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, and perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF. STRD is non‑convertible with a 10% non‑cumulative dividend and the highest risk‑reward profile. STRK is convertible with an 8% non‑cumulative dividend, allowing equity upside. STRF is non‑convertible with a 10% cumulative dividend, making it the most conservative. STRC is a variable‑rate, cumulative preferred stock offering monthly dividends, with adjustable rates designed to keep it near par. Saylor once again hinted at the likelihood of another bitcoin acquisition filing ahead of time, sharing an update on Strategy's bitcoin acquisition tracker on Sunday, stating, "The orange dots go up and to the right." Following its Q2 financial results, Strategy committed not to issue common equity if its market cap to net asset value (mNAV) ratio is below 2.5, except for specific purposes such as paying interest on debt obligations and funding preferred equity dividends. However, the firm later reneged on that guidance, clarifying that it will still issue MSTR below 2.5 mNAV if it deems the issuance to be advantageous to provide greater flexibility in executing its capital markets strategy. The pace of Strategy's bitcoin buys has generally been slowing in recent weeks as it switched focus from its common stock ATM program to its perpetual preferred stocks for funding bitcoin acquisitions. Strategy was recently snubbed for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, which instead will add AppLovin, Robinhood, and EMCOR Group on Monday. TD Cowen analysts said the decision, which met all the criteria for inclusion, represented "bias against bitcoin," comparing the exclusion to prior snubs of Facebook and Tesla, although they were eventually added. Analysts at JPMorgan argued the rejection was a "blow to all crypto treasuries," warning that other index providers may also reconsider their inclusion of Strategy and similar crypto treasury firms. Saylor joined other crypto execs and lawmakers at a roundtable hosted by Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Nick Begich in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, aiming to advance strategic bitcoin reserve legislation that, if passed, could see the U.S. purchasing 1 million BTC. Earlier on Monday, Metaplanet returned to the top five after announcing it had bought a further 5,419 BTC for approximately $632.5 million — the company's largest acquisition to date. While the number of bitcoin treasury companies continues to rise, the value of many of the cohort's shares is down significantly from their summer peaks, with Strategy itself down 24%, for example. Although its mNAV has been contracting over the past couple of months, Strategy's $98 billion market cap continues to trade at a premium to its bitcoin net asset value, with some investors concerned about the firm's premium valuation and its numerous bitcoin acquisition programs. However, certain analysts argue that with Strategy's relatively low debt levels and no payments due until 2028, the firm's leverage remains manageable. MSTR closed down 1.3% on Friday at $344.75, according to The Block's Strategy price page, in a week that saw bitcoin fall 2.1%. MSTR is currently down 2.3% in pre-market trading on Monday, per TradingView, and has gained 14.9% year-to-date compared to bitcoin's 20.5%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Balaji Srinivasan, an American entrepreneur and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, has pointed out that developed countries such as the U.S. have shifted their focus from traditional economies to an internet-first economy driven by technology and digital platforms. His remarks came after he shared an X post stating that it is time to say goodbye to the legacy economy and start embracing the Internet economy. The S&P 500 is a major stock market index that tracks the 500 largest companies listed on U.S. exchanges by market value. Srinivasan pointed out the 2008 financial crisis, stating that all transactions and communications have begun taking place online since its occurrence. Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, continue to dominate as the leading tech giants driving this transformation. Commenting on Srinivasan's remarks, analysts noted that the former Coinbase executive helped popularize the idea of Network States. From his perspective, these online communities could eventually evolve to rival or replace traditional nation-states. According to their analysis, the financial system that is currently operating and government agencies usually take their time to adopt new technologies, slowing down innovation. This has sparked hope for more innovation in the economy. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint statement signalling a shift towards 24/7 capital markets. This change aims to connect the traditional financial system with the crypto sector, which carries out daily operations. According to the regulators, a trading environment that is available 24/7 for various types of assets is essential to establish on-chain finance. They also pointed out that it is important to set up clear regulations for event contracts and perpetual futures, which enable investors to speculate on the future of an asset's price without an expiration date. They further explained that some types of assets may adopt this change more perfectly than others; hence, there will be one solution for every product. Apart from this, the U.S. government has collaborated with oracle providers Pyth Network and Chainlink to share economic data on the blockchain to improve clarity and accountability regarding budgeting for the public.
