                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has plunged by over $10,000 since its all-time high in July, leaving traders divided on whether the market has one more significant leg up left. Historically, however, heavy retail optimism often precedes further downside, raising questions about whether capitulation has occurred. The retrace, just -8.1% over six weeks, is mild by Bitcoin's standards, as prior cycle corrections typically ran -15% to -20% before panic selling emerged. Leverage data remains mixed: shorts spiked ahead of the drop but flipped quickly back to longs, muting prospects for a short squeeze rebound. Social sentiment has grown more fearful, but not yet at extreme capitulation levels that mark cycle bottoms.

This means less coins are available to sell off on exchanges, which again implies limited further downside pressure. Data also noted that continued declines in exchange supply suggest limited downside pressure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin slips under $111,500 as $280 million in leverage long positions are liquidated, but key support levels may decide if BTC rebounds or risks a deeper breakdown. Bitcoin dipped below $111,500, testing a major daily demand zone. Spot demand remains strong, keeping the market structure broadly in favor of bulls. Cointelegraph highlighted the likelihood of this retest last week, projecting a dip under $113,000 before renewed upside. This indicated that US spot demand was providing a cushion against deeper downside pressure. Additionally, close to $280 million in BTC futures positions were liquidated during the correction, flushing out leverage that had built during BTC's climb to $117,500 from $107,000 in September. With an excessive leverage reset, the market may be primed for a healthier continuation if spot demand persists. Related: Bitcoin shows signs of ‘cycle exhaustion' as BTC price tumbles to $112K With Bitcoin currently trading just under $113,000, three critical price levels stand out from a trend perspective. Crypto analyst Dom noted that futures markets witnessed one of the largest long liquidations in recent months, with nearly 80% concentrated on Bybit. Such events often reset market conditions, leaving room for a cleaner move higher. A swift recovery from this zone could propel BTC back above $117,000 in the short term. If the recovery is slow, Bitcoin may instead drift toward external liquidity or support around $107,200. BTC has repeatedly moved between higher time frame range highs and lows before resuming broader trends in 2025. More than $3 billion in long positions remained exposed at this level, raising the possibility of a deep liquidity grab before a bullish reversal. From a seasonality perspective, September has historically leaned bearish, making this scenario plausible as a short-term shakeout before stronger upside momentum into Q4. The third and most bearish outcome would be a prolonged breakdown below $107,200, potentially extending toward $100,000. This would mark a structural shift toward bearish market conditions, with consolidation at lower levels signaling exhaustion of the current cycle. Supporting this risk, Glassnode highlighted that the short-term holder cost basis sits near $111,400.

On September 17, New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris issued new guidance on the use of blockchain analytics tools for covered banking institutions contemplating or already conducting virtual currency-related activities. The guidance notes that blockchain analytics tools can enhance compliance programs to mitigate risks associated with emerging technologies and prevent illegal activities. Specifically, NYDFS suggests that New York banking organizations, as well as all branches and agencies of NYDFS-licensed foreign banking organizations (collectively, “Covered Institutions”), consider the utility of blockchain analytics tools to:

 

 

The guidance notes that the above list of examples is not exhaustive and suggests that Covered Institutions consider leveraging blockchain analytics tools to enhance compliance programs and risk frameworks in a manner tailored to the institution's particular risk appetite and business model. The guidance further emphasizes that Covered Institutions must re-assess risk-management frameworks regularly in light of changing business models, new customer types, and new market entrants.

The announcement builds upon previously released NYDFS industry guidance, including the regulator's April 2022 Guidance on Use of Blockchain Analytics issued to all licensed virtual currency business entities and chartered limited purpose trust companies authorized to engage in virtual currency business activities in New York. NYDFS subsequently published its “VCRA Guidance,” which stated the regulator's expectation that all Covered Institutions seek prior approval before engaging in new or significantly different virtual currency- related activity. While the VCRA Guidance is still in effect, each of the federal banking regulators rescinded their similar guidance this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Observed annually on Oct. 1, International Coffee Day was established by the ICO member states — representing the majority of the world's leading coffee-producing countries — and first celebrated in 2015. Since its inception, the holiday has aimed to highlight the contributions of the world's coffee farmers and producers who bring coffee to life for consumers worldwide, while providing messaging for events, promotions and other marketing initiatives. Announcing the 2025 effort, ICO Executive Director Vanúsia Nogueira said the organization is calling for “practical collaboration that delivers real benefits along the whole chain.” The group has created a communications toolkit and multilingual resources to support the 2025 campaign. The ICO — which remains a leading advocate for coffee farmers, producers and sector-wide collaboration — oversees the International Coffee Agreement, which was last revised in 2022. For decades, the agreement involved a quota system for the world's coffee production, designed to stabilize global coffee prices. Although the international quota agreement was terminated in 1989, resulting in the current free-market period characterized by price volatility, the ICO continues to provide sector-wide data while promoting the long-term sustainability of the global coffee sector, including through International Coffee Day. “Coffee is a product of many hands and many hearts,” Nogueira said of this year's campaign. “When farmers, cooperatives, researchers, roasters, traders, baristas and consumers work together, we create opportunities for income, resilience and environmental stewardship.” Related PostsICO Flagship Development Report: Policy Makers Should Support CircularityICO Unveils Global Database of 400+ Coffee Sustainability ProjectsICO and UNIDO Outline an Unprecedented Global Coffee Fund</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This dramatic downturn is not an isolated event but a direct consequence of the broader cryptocurrency market crash, which has wiped out billions in value and severely curtailed speculative enthusiasm across the digital asset landscape. As the dust settles from successive crypto calamities, the future of digital collectibles hangs precariously, prompting a crucial re-evaluation of their inherent value and long-term utility. However, this bullish sentiment proved unsustainable, and the subsequent crypto market crash delivered a devastating blow. Major marketplaces like OpenSea, once the bustling hub of NFT transactions, witnessed a nearly 98% drop in trading volume from May to late August 2022, with daily transaction records dwindling from billions to mere millions. The cascading effect of these events continued into 2023 and 2024, with overall NFT trading volume in 2023 less than half of what it was in 2022, illustrating a sustained and severe contraction. Floor prices, the lowest price point for an NFT within a given collection, suffered equally dramatic depreciation. Even so-called "blue-chip" projects, once considered relatively stable, saw their values evaporate. Between June 10th and June 13th, 2022, collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, Doodles, and Cool Cats experienced floor price declines ranging from 18% to 33%. Solana-based NFTs were particularly hard hit after the FTX collapse, with their aggregate floor value dropping by a staggering 68%, partly due to FTX's prior advocacy for the Solana blockchain. Investor sentiment, once characterized by "fear of missing out" (FOMO), has largely shifted to "fear," with a significant erosion of public confidence and a growing skepticism towards the entire NFT industry. The NFT Winter has proven to be a harsh arbiter, separating projects and platforms built on speculative fervor from those grounded in utility, community, and genuine innovation. Many "blue-chip" collections, once symbols of digital status, have seen their floor prices and sales volumes dramatically shrink. For instance, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), a flagship project of Yuga Labs, experienced a 61% decline in sales volume in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, with celebrity endorsers reportedly removing their Apes as profile pictures. Numerous smaller, less established projects, often referred to as "jpeg flips," have become entirely "worthless," with over 1,600 projects on Ethereum deemed defunct by early 2023. NFT marketplaces that failed to innovate or adapt also suffered. While OpenSea (NYSE: OPEN), once dominant, saw its market share severely eroded, others like GameStop (NYSE: GME), DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG), Immutable, and Kraken (NYSE: KRKN) notably exited the NFT market, unable to sustain operations amidst the reduced activity and interest. Artists who relied heavily on secondary market royalties also faced significant challenges as many platforms shifted to royalty-optional models, further cutting into their potential earnings. Milady Maker also saw a significant price surge and maintained a solid floor, while The Captainz by Memeland and Doodles (which saw sales rise to $32 million in Q1 2025, partly due to a collaboration with McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)) showcased the power of strong communities and strategic partnerships. Even OpenSea has shown signs of a comeback in early 2025, regaining market share through platform developments and teasing an official token. Traditional companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) proved that utility-driven NFT programs can still thrive, successfully selling out 2,000 digital tokens in minutes. Luxury brands like Nike (NYSE: NKE), Adidas (XETRA: ADDYY), and Gucci (PPRUY) continue to integrate NFTs into their strategies for enhanced consumer engagement and loyalty, viewing them as long-term brand extensions rather than speculative assets. Furthermore, the focus has shifted towards Web3 gaming, with projects like Axie Infinity (AXS-USD) and The Sandbox (SAND-USD) becoming key catalysts for potential market revitalization. Artists who have built strong direct-to-fan communities or focused on innovative, utility-rich digital art, such as Tyler Hobbs and Emily Yang (pplpleasr), have also managed to weather the storm, demonstrating the enduring value of genuine artistic talent and engaged patronage. The NFT Winter is more than just a market correction; it represents a fundamental re-evaluation and maturation of the entire digital collectibles industry. This pressure is accelerating innovation in areas like Web3 gaming, where NFTs serve as in-game assets providing true ownership, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which uses NFTs to represent fractional ownership of physical properties, art, or commodities. Governments and financial bodies worldwide are now actively debating how to classify NFTs—as securities, commodities, or unique digital assets—a decision that will have profound implications for future market structure, investor protection, and compliance requirements. Historically, this period mirrors other speculative bubbles, such as the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, where many overvalued companies collapsed, but resilient and fundamentally sound technologies eventually emerged to redefine industries. In the short term, expect continued market consolidation, with less viable projects fading into obscurity and stronger, utility-focused initiatives gaining traction. The emphasis will remain on real-world applications and tangible benefits, moving beyond profile pictures to encompass areas like digital identity, verifiable credentials, and loyalty programs. Marketplaces will continue to compete fiercely on features, fees, and multi-chain support, with platforms like Magic Eden demonstrating the agility needed to capture new market segments (e.g., Bitcoin Ordinals). Strategic pivots will be crucial for survival, with many projects shifting from a pure collectibles model to incorporating their NFTs into gaming, metaverse experiences, or even traditional brand activations. We will likely see more institutional adoption, but with a cautious and compliance-focused approach, as major corporations seek to leverage NFTs for verifiable ownership and enhanced customer engagement. Emerging market opportunities will coalesce around interoperable NFTs, which can seamlessly transition across different platforms and metaverses, as well as the tokenization of illiquid assets, unlocking new forms of investment and ownership. Potential scenarios include a gradual recovery driven by technological advancements and clearer regulatory frameworks, leading to a more stable and less volatile market where value is derived from utility rather than speculation. The key takeaway from this period of contraction is that the underlying technology of NFTs—digital scarcity and verifiable ownership on a blockchain—retains its power, but its application must transcend fleeting trends. Moving forward, the NFT ecosystem will likely be characterized by greater maturity and a focus on long-term sustainability. The speculative froth has largely been removed, paving the way for projects that offer genuine utility, foster strong communities, and demonstrate clear use cases. Investors should watch for regulatory clarity, as clear guidelines will provide much-needed stability and legitimacy to the market. Furthermore, attention should be paid to projects that are effectively integrating NFTs into Web3 gaming, real-world asset tokenization, and established brand strategies, as these are likely to drive the next wave of adoption and value creation. The NFT Winter, therefore, is not an end, but a necessary crucible from which a more resilient, useful, and integrated digital collectibles market is beginning to emerge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of leading Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) are down about 1.4% amid news the firm spent $100 million to acquire 850 Bitcoin last week at an average price of $117,344. Trading at $339.80, MSTR is now down around 5.2% in the last month, underperforming BTC itself, which is only down around 1.6% in that time. To make its latest purchase, the firm used around $19 million in proceeds from its STRF preferred stock offering, and more than $80 million in net proceeds from its existing $21 billion MSTR common stock offering. While shares have slumped on the latest Bitcoin buy, analysts at TD Cowen still see the stock as a buy. As such, TD Cowen maintains a price target of $620—an 83.4% jump from its current trading price. Bitcoin Miner AgriFORCE's Stock Jumps 200% on $550 Million Avalanche Treasury Move Strategy, which began buying Bitcoin in 2020, now maintains a Bitcoin treasury of 635,893 BTC valued around $72.25 billion at the time of writing—more than 10 times the size of the next largest treasury held by Bitcoin miner MARA. The firm operates five distinct at-the-market (ATM) offerings to help it raise funds, using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin for its treasury. Based on data from its Monday press release, Strategy still has around $16 billion available for issuance in its $21 billion common stock offering, and more than $30 billion available for issuance across its four separate preferred stock offerings—STRF, STRK, STRC, and STRD. Each stock offering was unveiled earlier this year to provide Bitcoin exposure to investors of varying risk profiles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder who now runs crypto venture fund Maelstrom, sold his personal stash of Hyperliquid's HYPE tokens just weeks after predicting the asset could rally 126-fold. Blockchain analytics service Lookonchain reported on Sunday that Hayes unloaded 96,628 HYPE — worth about $5.1 million — booking a profit of roughly $823,000, or 19%, in a month. Not long after, Hayes confirmed the move with his trademark irreverence, posting on X: “Need to pay my deposit on the new Rari 849 Testarossa.” The comment fueled backlash from traders who accused him of pumping HYPE in August before quickly exiting. Hayes pushed back on Monday, insisting the sale was tied to concerns laid out by his firm. Earlier today, Maelstrom published a lengthy X post outlining what it called HYPE's “first true test.” The post estimated Hyperliquid's buyback program could only absorb about 17% of that flow, leaving a potential $410 million monthly overhang. Maelstrom framed the looming supply shock as natural for a fast-growing protocol but warned that large vested allocations may tempt early developers and insiders to sell. The remarks contrasted sharply with Hayes's Aug. 27 blog post, where he called Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance” and argued HYPE could climb 126x by 2028. Despite selling his tokens, Hayes reiterated that long-term view on Monday, describing the upcoming unlock as a hurdle, not a death blow. Hyperliquid has surged to become a dominant player in decentralized perpetual futures, and its HYPE token remains central to governance, staking and fee distribution. Whether the market can digest nearly $12 billion in new supply may determine if Hayes's forecast proves prescient — or overly ambitious.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market kicked off the week with one of its sharpest downturns of 2025, erasing more than $151 billion in market value within a single day. Altcoins such as XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) tumbled between 7–12%, erasing recent gains and signaling an abrupt end to the latest altcoins rally. The cascade began with BTC dipping below $113,000, triggering margin calls and automated sell-offs. Within just 30 minutes, liquidations had surged past $1 billion, underscoring the fragility of highly leveraged trading environments. The sell-off also brought a sharp reversal in market sentiment. The Altcoin Season Index, which peaked at 100 points just days ago, has now dropped to 64, suggesting traders are shifting back toward Bitcoin. Historically, altcoin seasons last only a few weeks before liquidity rotates back into Bitcoin. Analysts warn that the latest liquidation cascade may have ended this cycle earlier than expected. Smaller tokens, including ASTER, WLFI, and PUMP, which recently saw speculative surges, were among the hardest hit, with more than $263 million in altcoins longs liquidated. Overleveraged traders were washed out, creating stronger support levels for long-term holders. Institutional demand remains intact, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recording steady inflows last week, suggesting that large investors continue to buy the dip. On-chain data also shows 420,000 ETH leaving exchanges, pointing toward accumulation despite short-term volatility. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$BNB is one of the strongest large-cap altcoins in 2025, climbing from $500 to the magic $1,000 mark in just a few months. In times like these, when a token is rallying hard, online sentiment often turns overwhelmingly bullish, with both retail and institutional analysts churning out one aspirational price target after another. But to keep sanity intact and offer you an objective analysis of the situation, we asked Grok where $BNB could realistically head in the coming months. Grok first pointed to $BNB's weekly chart, where its current rally is coming from the breakout of a pattern channel that had been in place since June 2024. This gave us the next possible target of $1.35K, which is around 30% above current levels. While this is still very bullish, it's not the most intriguing part of Grok's analysis. When we fed Grok the monthly $BNB chart, things became even more enthusiastic. On the top side, it was capped by a strong resistance level of $630 to $650, which it broke out of very recently. So $BNB is all set to double in the coming months. With that in mind, we asked Grok about the best low-cap coins to buy right now. Snorter Token ($SNORT) shines as the best crypto to buy now, offering a game-changing solution to the long-standing issue of institutional dominance in meme coin trading. Right now, most of the liquidity in new meme coins is swept away by large institutional traders with access to sophisticated algorithms and bots, leaving little for retail participants. It uses MEV-resistant layers to protect you from honeypots, rug pulls, and sophisticated sandwich attacks. According to our $SNORT price prediction, the token could hit $0.94 by the end of 2025, representing a massive 800% return on current prices. The $SNORT presale is currently live, with over $4M already raised. Visit $SNORT's official website to learn more about how this trading bot combines top-notch security with ease of use. Much like Snorter, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) also aims to solve a critical real-world issue: content platforms charging heavy fees from creators while offering virtually no next-gen assistance in return. SUBBD plans to transform the way users interact with their favorite creators and consume content. These tools will save creators a ton of time, enabling them to engage more directly and organically with their fans to build real connections. Content viewers, on the other hand, can use the $SUBBD token to access exclusive content, request personalized creations from their favorite artists, and even send them tips. Unlike other presale platforms that offer dynamic staking returns, SUBBD offers a flat 20% reward for the first year, giving investors steady passive income assurance. Additionally, staking unlocks special perks such as behind-the-scenes content and exclusive creator livestreams. SUBBD Token is currently in its presale stage, having already raised over $1.17M from early investors. Check out our detailed guide on how to buy $SUBBD. Visit SUBBD Token's official website to learn more about how it's narrowing the gap between creators and their fans. CZ's Dog ($BROCCOLI) is a hyper-popular meme coin on the BNB Chain, based on the pet dog (named Broccoli) of Binance's ex-CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ' Zhao. Then, as soon as he posted a picture of his dog, the meme coin community was quick to pounce on the opportunity and mint $BROCCOLI tokens. It's worth noting that several $BROCCOLI tokens flooded the market, with some rallying over 1,000% within a week. CZ's Dog is one of the few BROCCOLI tokens that remain relevant today. Being on the BNB Chain, traders also benefit from lower transaction costs. This could be one reason why, despite being a meme coin, CZ's Dog consistently clocks an average daily trading volume of around $18M. We suggest keeping a close watch on $BROCCOLI as it approaches this major resistance. Buy your $BROCCOLI through MEXC or other leading exchanges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) acquired an additional 850 BTC for approximately $99.7 million at an average price of $117,344 per bitcoin between Sept. 15 and Sept. 21, according to an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Strategy now holds a total of 639,835 BTC — worth around $72 billion — bought at an average price of $73,971 per bitcoin for a total cost of around $47.3 billion, including fees and expenses, according to the company's co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor. The latest acquisitions were made using proceeds from at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, and perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF. STRD is non‑convertible with a 10% non‑cumulative dividend and the highest risk‑reward profile. STRK is convertible with an 8% non‑cumulative dividend, allowing equity upside. STRF is non‑convertible with a 10% cumulative dividend, making it the most conservative. STRC is a variable‑rate, cumulative preferred stock offering monthly dividends, with adjustable rates designed to keep it near par. Saylor once again hinted at the likelihood of another bitcoin acquisition filing ahead of time, sharing an update on Strategy's bitcoin acquisition tracker on Sunday, stating, "The orange dots go up and to the right." Following its Q2 financial results, Strategy committed not to issue common equity if its market cap to net asset value (mNAV) ratio is below 2.5, except for specific purposes such as paying interest on debt obligations and funding preferred equity dividends. However, the firm later reneged on that guidance, clarifying that it will still issue MSTR below 2.5 mNAV if it deems the issuance to be advantageous to provide greater flexibility in executing its capital markets strategy. The pace of Strategy's bitcoin buys has generally been slowing in recent weeks as it switched focus from its common stock ATM program to its perpetual preferred stocks for funding bitcoin acquisitions. Strategy was recently snubbed for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, which instead will add AppLovin, Robinhood, and EMCOR Group on Monday. TD Cowen analysts said the decision, which met all the criteria for inclusion, represented "bias against bitcoin," comparing the exclusion to prior snubs of Facebook and Tesla, although they were eventually added. Analysts at JPMorgan argued the rejection was a "blow to all crypto treasuries," warning that other index providers may also reconsider their inclusion of Strategy and similar crypto treasury firms. Saylor joined other crypto execs and lawmakers at a roundtable hosted by Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Nick Begich in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, aiming to advance strategic bitcoin reserve legislation that, if passed, could see the U.S. purchasing 1 million BTC. Earlier on Monday, Metaplanet returned to the top five after announcing it had bought a further 5,419 BTC for approximately $632.5 million — the company's largest acquisition to date. While the number of bitcoin treasury companies continues to rise, the value of many of the cohort's shares is down significantly from their summer peaks, with Strategy itself down 24%, for example. Although its mNAV has been contracting over the past couple of months, Strategy's $98 billion market cap continues to trade at a premium to its bitcoin net asset value, with some investors concerned about the firm's premium valuation and its numerous bitcoin acquisition programs. However, certain analysts argue that with Strategy's relatively low debt levels and no payments due until 2028, the firm's leverage remains manageable. MSTR closed down 1.3% on Friday at $344.75, according to The Block's Strategy price page, in a week that saw bitcoin fall 2.1%. MSTR is currently down 2.3% in pre-market trading on Monday, per TradingView, and has gained 14.9% year-to-date compared to bitcoin's 20.5%.

By generating true, unpredictable entropy at gigabit speeds, QeM's QRNG ensures the strongest cryptographic keys possible, resistant to both classical and quantum attacks. The wallet is further strengthened with post-quantum encryption protocols, offering unprecedented protection for digital assets in real-time transaction environments. "This milestone confirms our vision of building the most secure blockchain wallets in the industry," said James Stephens, CEO of Krown Technologies Inc. "Together with QeM, we are delivering a solution that brings unmatched protection to both retail and institutional users at a time when cyberattacks and quantum threats are converging. With Qastle now completed, we are in the final stages of our commercialization planning and will soon be sharing details of our market rollout." The Urgent Need for Quantum-Safe Blockchain SecurityToday's blockchain networks and digital wallets rely heavily on public key cryptography (RSA, ECC) to secure transactions and private keys. While effective against classical threats, these algorithms are vulnerable to the exponential computing power of quantum computers. Emerging quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm could, once deployed at scale, break widely used cryptographic schemes-potentially exposing billions of dollars' worth of digital assets to theft or manipulation. Analysts warn that "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks are already being prepared, in which malicious actors capture encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it once quantum computers become powerful enough. With revenues for hot wallets alone expected to grow from USD 1.5 billion in 2024 to over USD 5 billion by 2033, the opportunity for secure, quantum-safe solutions is immense. The Qastle Quantum-Safe Hot Wallet developed by Krown and QeM is well-positioned to capture this growth, delivering unmatched levels of trust, convenience, and future-proof security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Balaji Srinivasan, an American entrepreneur and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, has pointed out that developed countries such as the U.S. have shifted their focus from traditional economies to an internet-first economy driven by technology and digital platforms. His remarks came after he shared an X post stating that it is time to say goodbye to the legacy economy and start embracing the Internet economy. The S&P 500 is a major stock market index that tracks the 500 largest companies listed on U.S. exchanges by market value. Srinivasan pointed out the 2008 financial crisis, stating that all transactions and communications have begun taking place online since its occurrence. Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, continue to dominate as the leading tech giants driving this transformation. Commenting on Srinivasan's remarks, analysts noted that the former Coinbase executive helped popularize the idea of Network States. From his perspective, these online communities could eventually evolve to rival or replace traditional nation-states. According to their analysis, the financial system that is currently operating and government agencies usually take their time to adopt new technologies, slowing down innovation. This has sparked hope for more innovation in the economy. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint statement signalling a shift towards 24/7 capital markets. This change aims to connect the traditional financial system with the crypto sector, which carries out daily operations. According to the regulators, a trading environment that is available 24/7 for various types of assets is essential to establish on-chain finance. They also pointed out that it is important to set up clear regulations for event contracts and perpetual futures, which enable investors to speculate on the future of an asset's price without an expiration date. They further explained that some types of assets may adopt this change more perfectly than others; hence, there will be one solution for every product. Apart from this, the U.S. government has collaborated with oracle providers Pyth Network and Chainlink to share economic data on the blockchain to improve clarity and accountability regarding budgeting for the public.
