                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven years after unveiling Mirror at TechCrunch Disrupt 2018, Brynn Putnam is returning to the stage where it all began. The serial entrepreneur who turned a fitness concept into a $500 million acquisition by Lululemon will debut her latest venture at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 at San Francisco's Moscone West in October. Putnam's path from that breakthrough Disrupt moment to today is a story of very smart timing. Mirror, the connected fitness device that brought boutique workout classes into homes, launched just as the pandemic created unprecedented demand for home fitness solutions. Her new company, still operating in stealth mode, is developing consumer gaming hardware designed to bring people face-to-face rather than isolate them behind individual devices. The new venture represents a shift in priorities for Putnam. Drawing inspiration from Nintendo's philosophy of using “withered technology with lateral thinking” — mature, affordable components combined with innovative experiences — Putnam is following the playbook that made Mirror successful. Rather than pushing technological boundaries, though, she's focusing on creating compelling user experiences with proven hardware. The gaming space represents a natural next step for Putnam, who built her reputation on understanding how tech can motivate behavior change. Lerer Hippeau, the venture firm that led Mirror's $3 million seed round, has already participated in a highly competitive funding round for Putnam's new company, signaling strong investor confidence in her ability to identify and capitalize on consumer trends. The timing also aligns with a broader resurgence in consumer hardware investing. After years of focus on enterprise software and AI infrastructure, investors are showing renewed interest in consumer-facing hardware that can leverage AI and mature component ecosystems to create new categories of devices. Putnam's appearance at Disrupt 2025 comes as TechCrunch celebrates its 20th anniversary, and attendees can be assured we're bringing together the biggest names in tech to share insights on the future of innovation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's also the first class to include someone who has already gone into orbit on a commercial spacecraft, and who set a spaceflight record to boot. NASA's Class of 2025 was introduced today at a ceremony conducted at Johnson Space Center in Houston, with members of Congress and other VIPs in attendance. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy noted that more than 8,000 people applied for this year's spots. “One of these 10 could actually be one of the first Americans to put their boots on the Mars surface, which is very, very cool.” Edgar, 40, said she was honored to be part of the class. After receiving her bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College and her Ph.D. in geology from Caltech, Edgar went on to work at the U.S. Geological Survey and at NASA. Her career highlights include leading USGS' TARGET training program, supporting NASA's Mars Science Laboratory and Mars Exploration Rover missions, and serving as the deputy principal investigator on the Artemis 3 Geology Team. “Through these experiences, I've had a chance to see the amazing team that makes this all possible,” she said. “I just want to say I am so excited to be officially part of the NASA family, and can't wait to be serving in this role along with all of my new classmates here.” “I grew up doing gymnastics, and I've always loved the outdoors, so it kind of evolved from ‘climb a mountain, do a handstand at the top.' Pretty much everywhere that I've gone, except on this stage today.” Ben Bailey, 38, chief warrant officer 3, U.S. Army, was born and raised in Charlottesville, Va. Adam Fuhrmann, 35, major, U.S. Air Force, is from Leesburg, Va., and has accumulated more than 2,100 flight hours in 27 aircraft, including the F-16 and F-35. Cameron Jones, 35, major, U.S. Air Force, is a native of Savanna, Ill. She is a former Navy P-3 pilot and experimental test pilot with more than 2,800 flight hours in more than 45 aircraft. She was a test pilot for United Airlines at the time of her selection. Anna Menon, 39, was born in Houston and has worked in Johnson Space Center's Mission Control Center, supporting medical hardware and software aboard the International Space Station. In 2024, Menon went into orbit as a mission specialist and medical officer on the privately supported Polaris Dawn research mission. That SpaceX Dragon flight featured a new altitude record for female spacefliers (870.35 miles, or 1,400.7 kilometers) and the first commercial spacewalk. She formerly was a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy and served as an undersea medical officer. Her experience includes providing medical support during Navy operational diving training at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. Erin Overcash, 34, lieutenant commander, U.S. Navy, is from Goshen, Ky. A U.S. She has logged more than 1,300 flight hours in 20 aircraft, including 249 carrier-arrested landings. She is a former Marine Corps AH-1 attack helicopter pilot and experimental test pilot, with more than 2,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. NASA has now recruited 370 astronaut candidates since selecting the original Mercury Seven in 1959. This year's candidates will go through years of training in preparation for future assignments that could well include trips to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The Artemis 2 mission, due for launch next year, calls for sending a crew of four astronauts around the moon and back. A number of observers have questioned that timeline, and some have wondered whether the next astronauts to land on the moon will be Chinese rather than American. Today, Duffy insisted that NASA will get there first. “Now, some are challenging our leadership in space — say, like the Chinese. And I'll just tell you this: I'll be damned if the Chinese beat NASA, or beat America, back to the moon. And we are going to win the second space race back to the moon, with all of you participating in that great effort.” Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

MediaTek is negotiating production of certain chips in the U.S. with TSMC in a bid to meet customer requirements for locally manufactured components. While chips made by TSMC in the U.S. are more expensive than those fabbed in Taiwan, U.S. production may enable MediaTek to address certain customers and/or avoid potential tariffs. Word of MediaTek's intentions comes from the company's Corporate Vice President JC Hsu, reports Nikkei. The plans target two specific categories: automotive parts and chips tied to more regulated or strategically sensitive applications. The move is said to comply with demands from American clients who favor domestic production for logistical and policy-related reasons. Hsu stressed that the deal has not been formally inked yet. Unfortunately, the high-ranking executive of MediaTek never revealed when the company plans to produce chips at TSMC's Fab in Arizona or which process technology it intends to use. Apparently, there are over a dozen companies interested in making chips on TSMC's N2 fabrication process, so it might be crucial for a big company like MediaTek to secure a portion of TSMC's N2-capable capacity that is set to be located in the USA. However, whether MediaTek can produce automotive-grade chips at TSMC's Arizona fab (Fab 21) depends on multiple factors — the most critical of which is whether TSMC Fab 21 is compliant with the automotive quality management standard IATF 16949, or at least capable of supporting customers that are. While MediaTek itself does not necessarily need to be IATF 16949 certified, it must ensure that all entities in its supply chain — including process technology, foundry, OSAT, and others — meet the necessary automotive quality and traceability requirements. However, we do not know whether Fab 21 supports such flows. That said, unless TSMC Arizona eventually adopts or mirrors the automotive-grade flows of the foundry's Taiwan fabs, it is unlikely that MediaTek could produce fully automotive-qualified silicon there for anything other than non-safety-critical infotainment or connectivity chips. For advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), powertrain, or battery management chips that require ISO 26262 and ASIL certifications, MediaTek would either need to wait for TSMC Arizona to offer certified flows or continue to rely on TSMC's mature automotive fabs in Taiwan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everyone seems to recognize the fact that artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing and emerging technology that has the potential for immense harm if operated without safeguards, but basically no one (except for the European Union, sort of) can agree on how to regulate it. So, instead of trying to set up a clear and narrow path for how we will allow AI to operate, experts in the field have opted for a new approach: how about we just figure out what extreme examples we all think are bad and just agree to that? The proposal has amassed more than 200 signatures thus far from industry experts, political leaders, and Nobel Prize winners. The former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, and the former President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, are on board, as are several Nobel winners. The call doesn't include specific policy prescriptions or recommendations, though it does call out a couple of examples of what could be a red line. Prohibiting the launch of nuclear weapons or use in mass surveillance efforts would be a potential red line for AI uses, the group says, while prohibiting the creation of AI that cannot be terminated by human override would be a possible red line for AI behavior. But they're very clear: don't set these in stone, they're just examples, you can make your own rules. The only thing the group offers concretely is that any global agreement should be built on three pillars: “a clear list of prohibitions; robust, auditable verification mechanisms; and the appointment of an independent body established by the Parties to oversee implementation.” The call recommends that countries host some summits and working groups to figure this all out, but there are surely many competing motives at play in those conversations. The United States, for instance, has already committed to not allowing AI to control nuclear weapons (an agreement made under the Biden administration, so lord knows if that is still in play). But recent reports indicated that parts of the Trump administration's intelligence community have already gotten annoyed by the fact that some AI companies won't let them use their tools for domestic surveillance efforts. So would America get on board for such a proposal? Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Perhaps the only thing worse than having a boss who thinks your job can be replaced by artificial intelligence is having a boss who thinks he can do your job for you with AI and wants to show you his work. Unfortunately, depending on your role at the company, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski is guilty of both. Futurism recently highlighted the CEO's unfortunate insistence on vibe coding prototype features with AI and then making his actual, professional engineers review his work and try to implement it. Siemiatkowski recently appeared on the podcast Sourcery, where he revealed his new hobby of cosplaying as an engineer, using AI tools to write code and then bringing those ideas to the desks of the people he pays to do that job. On the episode, the CEO admits he's never coded before, but he started using the AI-powered code editor Cursor to craft prototypes for new features, which he said takes him about 20 minutes to whip up before he takes them to his engineering team. “Rather than disturbing my poor engineers and product people with what is half good ideas and half bad ideas, now I test it myself. To Siemiatkowski's credit, he has at least a smidgen of self-awareness about the situation. He joked that he occasionally falls for the AI's sycophancy that tells him all of his ideas are great, and he admitted that playing with code in Cursor has made him think about projects in a new way and forces him to articulate his ideas more clearly when communicating with his team. But does that prevent his engineers from letting out a deep sigh when they see Siemiatkowski coming, ready to make them look at a feature he doesn't actually understand but claims works? The CEO's vibe coding habit certainly doesn't suggest he's learned much from his first attempt to go all-in on AI. Last year, Siemiatkowski cut his workforce nearly in half, dropping from a headcount of 3,800 to 2,000, by shifting to AI alternatives, including replacing large chunks of his customer support team with AI agents—only to hire back humans after finding out that what they do wasn't quite as replaceable as he thought. There might be a similar effect from his interest in code, seeing as the vibe-coding epidemic has been creating opportunities for humans even as others are replaced. NBC and 404 Media both recently ran stories about the new economy of workers and freelancers brought on to correct the messes made by AI-generated code. A survey by cloud computing company Fastly found that 95% of surveyed developers spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with some saying it takes more time to fix errors than they save by initially generating the code with AI tools. Research firm METR also recently reported finding that using AI tools actually makes developers slower to complete tasks. But the CEO feels smarter, and isn't that what really matters?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It then details broader trends in the Seattle region — decreased retail spending in tech-heavy districts; restaurant closures; a cooling housing market; commercial real estate vacancies; and service businesses such as moving companies seeing slowdowns. The story also highlighted weakness in payroll and sales tax revenue, contributing to Seattle's projected $146 million budget deficit. And after years of growth, they are cutting jobs or curbing hiring. Here's more from Wall Street Journal reporter Sebastian Herrera, via LinkedIn: Of course, broader economic factors play a role in any local economy. Perhaps it signals a need to diversify Seattle's economy beyond tech — an idea echoed by Seattle mayoral front-runner Katie Wilson in a recent interview with GeekWire. Layoffs are also hitting the region's startup ecosystem — Rec Room, Glowforge, and LevelTen Energy have all cut staff in recent months, as noted by GeekWire's layoff tracker. But perhaps all the layoffs and hiring pullbacks could lead to opportunity for entrepreneurship in Seattle. The WSJ story ended with two examples of former tech workers who were laid off and launched their own endeavors. Tech community leaders at a recent GeekWire party noted the hiring opportunities for startups amid layoffs at larger companies — a stronger talent pool, with less competition from tech giants. In our story last month — Can Seattle own the AI era? — investors and founders shared optimism for the city startup ecosystem, in part due to the density of engineering talent that's crucial to building AI-native companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eni, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, just agreed to buy $1 billion in electricity from a power plant being built by Commonwealth Fusion Systems. “This is showing in concrete terms that people that use large amounts of energy, that know the energy market—they want fusion power, and they're willing to contract for it and to pay for it,” said Bob Mumgaard, cofounder and CEO of Commonwealth, on a press call about the deal. The agreement will see Eni purchase electricity from Commonwealth's first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. The news comes a few weeks after Commonwealth announced a $863 million funding round, bringing its total funding raised to date to nearly $3 billion. The fusion company also announced earlier this year that Google would be its first commercial power customer for the Virginia plant. Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is widely considered one of the leading companies in fusion power. One open question is what, exactly, Eni plans to do with this electricity. When asked about it on the press call, Fiorillo referenced wind and solar plants that Eni owns and said the plan “is not different from what we do in other areas in the US and the world.” (Eni sells electricity from power plants that it owns, including renewable and fossil-fuel plants.) Commonwealth is building tokamak fusion reactors that use superconducting magnets to hold plasma in place. That plasma is where fusion reactions happen, forcing hydrogen atoms together to release large amounts of energy. The company's first demonstration reactor, which it calls Sparc, is over 65% complete, and the team is testing components and assembling them. The plan is for the reactor, which is located outside Boston, to make plasma within two years and then demonstrate that it can generate more energy than is required to run it. That facility should begin construction in 2027 or 2028 and generate electricity for the grid in the early 2030s, Mumgaard says. Despite the billions of dollars Commonwealth has already raised, the company still needs more money to build its Arc power plant—that will be a multibillion-dollar project, Mumgaard said on a press call in August about the company's latest fundraising round. “These agreements are a really good way to create the right environment for building up more investment,” says Paul Wilson, chair of the department of nuclear engineering and engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Even though commercial fusion energy is still years away at a minimum, investors and big tech companies have pumped money into the industry and signed agreements to buy power from plants once they're operational. Helion, another leading fusion startup, has plans to produce electricity from its first reactor in 2028 (an aggressive timeline that has some experts expressing skepticism). That facility will have a full generating capacity of 50 megawatts, and in 2023 Microsoft signed an agreement to purchase energy from the facility in order to help power its data centers. As billions of dollars pour into the fusion industry, there are still many milestones ahead. To date, only the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has demonstrated that a fusion reactor can generate more energy than the amount put into the reaction. “What I'm not seeing is a peer-reviewed scientific article that makes me feel like, boy, we really turned the corner with the physics.” “Fusion is moving from the lab to be a proper industry,” says Sehila Gonzalez de Vicente, global director of fusion energy at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force. “This is very good for the whole sector to be perceived as a real source of energy.” A recent test shows that Quidnet's technology can store energy in pressurized water underground for months at a time. Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation. Forecasts aren't looking quite as rosy for the green fuel, though China is still a bright spot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta's massive new data center in Richland Parish. When it's done, the 4-million-square-foot facility will require more than 2 gigawatts of energy to run. They voiced concerns about rising energy bills and water shortages. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Documents viewed by WIRED show that state authorities agreed to grant Meta tax breaks and incentives without the company explicitly guaranteeing any full-time jobs for local workers. Critics also claim the deal doesn't include stipulations like a cap on how much Entergy could charge utility customers for the construction of the gas plants and transmission lines in Meta's data center build-out—a concern as massive AI data centers can cause utility bills to spike. “We wanted the commissioners to attach conditions and reasonable safeguards, such as a cost cap, but they instead came to this extremely disappointing and baffling decision,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposed the Entergy application. During the approval vote, Entergy and Louisiana's economic development officials repeatedly pointed to the projections shared by Meta, which suggest that the project would bring a $10 billion investment and upwards of 300 to 500 well-paying jobs. “There has never been a better time to lift our residents out of poverty. There has never been a better time to give people in our region better jobs,” said Rob Cleveland, the CEO of Grow NELA, an economic development firm representing northwest Louisiana who testified in support of Entergy's gas plants, at the hearing. But the public had little time to scrutinize Louisiana's economic development promises. They also heard little from Meta, which was not legally required to take part in the hearings on Entergy's new gas plants, despite the fact that the gas plants and a new $550 million transmission line connecting energy to the data center and upgrades to a local substation (also approved on August 20) are being built entirely for the company—the latter entirely paid for by Louisiana taxpayers. Repeated attempts to force Meta to produce documents that critics claim they have not received were unsuccessful, including a July subpoena attempt. One of Meta's tax incentive agreements with the state, which was signed last fall and viewed by WIRED, does not stipulate that Meta subsidiary Laidley, which is running the data center project, will focus on local hiring, although it does require that all jobs be fulfilled on site. (Separately, Entergy said Meta submitted a letter to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April saying that it will make “a concerted effort” to hire locally, but this assurance is not binding.) Meta would need to hire these 500 “full-time” jobs by 2035 if it wants to receive the highest level of tax breaks, an 80 percent reduction on the full amount. It does require the jobs to provide health insurance and says the pay for all jobs should average out at $82,000 a year. When reached for comment, Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for the state's economic development authority, said that the agency still expects Meta to create 500 full-time, permanent jobs, per previous announcements. “Meta is expected to create 500 direct new jobs at the facility, which in economic development terms means permanent, full-time jobs,” Litten says. In an email to WIRED, Entergy only referred to an impact report from Grow NELA but answered no other direct questions. “We continually asked for analysis with how they came up with this number of jobs, and Entergy has no idea about how many people will be hired,” says Susan Stevens Miller, an attorney representing the Union of Concerned Scientists and Alliance for Affordable Energy, which opposed the application. An earlier, six-page term sheet laying out hiring incentives was published by Power magazine in November, but it did not include further details about whether jobs could be part-time or any other details in the 93-page agreement viewed by WIRED. Advocates with the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Union of Concerned Scientists contacted by WIRED said they had never seen the full agreement until it was sent to them by WIRED. But the tax exemption agreement secured between Meta and Louisiana officials did not secure any guarantee of local hiring. Litten, with Louisiana Economic Development, told WIRED that separate state tax breaks that all companies in the state are eligible for do require local hiring. They include the Quality Jobs Rebate, which provides a 6 percent rebate on payroll expenses, a program set to replace it called High Impact Jobs program. Most data centers hire specialists from out of state for the technical jobs, according to Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst who studies data center tax breaks at the nonprofit Good Jobs First. She says data centers employ a mix of low-skill and high-skill technical workers to manage servers in addition to security guards and maintenance roles. She says that while construction is happening, data centers often hire specialist electricians who travel from state to state to set up servers. For this reason, she says, Meta is not the only tech company hesitant to guarantee local hiring when negotiating data center contracts. In response to questions from WIRED, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said, “We make a concerted effort to source labor locally and provide substantial contributions directly to the community.” Clayton said that for part-time construction roles, its contractors were “working on hiring local talent” and that they would host information fairs early next year. For permanent data center jobs, Clayton said Meta would be hiring “technical operators, electricians, air-conditioning and heating specialists, logistics staff, security, and more.” The state's agreement with Meta makes clear that as public land, the property Meta is leasing is exempt from traditional taxes. It creates a menu of options for what the company would potentially owe in “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT), a common agreement that lets local governments offer tax breaks with provisions attached. At this level, Meta would have to pay 40 percent of the assessed property tax. Louisiana's agreements ask for more than some other states' tax subsidies. According to Good Jobs First, nearly half of state tax subsidies for data centers don't require any new jobs to be created. Louisiana had already amended a tax rebate to create an exemption for data centers in 2024 to entice Meta; in its latest iteration, it says data centers can receive a full sales tax exemption for equipment purchases in the state as long as they hire 50 full-time jobs and invest at least $200 million by July 1, 2029. A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement. Good Jobs First says that at least 10 states have subsidies for data centers that are worth more than $100 million each, and “have suffered estimated losses of $100 million each in tax revenue for data centers,” according to its data. Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion. The Franklin Farms site in Holly Ridge, the area of Richland Parish where Meta's data center is being built, was purchased by Louisiana specifically for economic development projects. When asked if Meta plans to purchase the property, Clayton said, “We'll keep you updated on our future plans for this site.” Meta's presence has already caused land values to jump. But there's also a concern that Meta could delay or abandon the data center project. “My general fear is that too many data centers are being built,” Miller says. She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer. “Essentially, the state will be stuck with this warehouse full of computers,” Miller says.
