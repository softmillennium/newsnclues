The story also highlighted weakness in payroll and sales tax revenue, contributing to Seattle's projected $146 million budget deficit. And after years of growth, they are cutting jobs or curbing hiring. Here's more from Wall Street Journal reporter Sebastian Herrera, via LinkedIn: Of course, broader economic factors play a role in any local economy. Perhaps it signals a need to diversify Seattle's economy beyond tech — an idea echoed by Seattle mayoral front-runner Katie Wilson in a recent interview with GeekWire. Layoffs are also hitting the region's startup ecosystem — Rec Room, Glowforge, and LevelTen Energy have all cut staff in recent months, as noted by GeekWire's layoff tracker. But perhaps all the layoffs and hiring pullbacks could lead to opportunity for entrepreneurship in Seattle. The WSJ story ended with two examples of former tech workers who were laid off and launched their own endeavors. Tech community leaders at a recent GeekWire party noted the hiring opportunities for startups amid layoffs at larger companies — a stronger talent pool, with less competition from tech giants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The agency may have to extend that timeline even further, however, as slow progress on SpaceX's lunar lander threatens to delay the Artemis 3 mission. During a public meeting on Friday, members of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel warned that the Human Landing System (HLS) version of Starship could be “years late,” SpaceNews reports. The panel reached that conclusion following a visit last month to SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas. “The HLS schedule is significantly challenged and, in our estimation, could be years late for a 2027 Artemis 3 Moon landing,” said panelist Paul Hill, former director of Mission Operations at NASA. Putting American boots back on the Moon is a top priority for NASA. Whoever reaches the lunar surface first will be able to set certain ground rules about who can do what and where. This would not only reinforce that country's influence on the Moon and in space but also give it strategic leverage as military operations increasingly depend on space-based assets. “This is a pivotal moment for our nation's space program,” said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during a hearing on legislative priorities for NASA earlier this month. He went on to emphasize that space has become a “strategic frontier with direct consequences for national security, economic growth, and technological leadership.” At that time, the agency aimed to accomplish a landing by 2024, but that target date has been pushed back in recent years. While Starship's most recent test flight on August 26 was a success, unmet technical milestones have piled up. Developmental delays for Starship 3—the first iteration capable of in-orbit fuel transfers—have slowed progress toward this goal. Hill also pointed to potentially competing priorities for SpaceX between Starlink and Starship HLS, SpacePolicyOnline.com reports. Starship 3 will be integral in launching the third generation of Starlink satellites while simultaneously creating the on-orbit fuel depots and lunar lander for Artemis 3. “There is no competitor, whether government or industry, that has this full combination of factors that yield this high a manufacturing and flight tempo, with their direct effects on reliability increases and cost reduction,” Hill said. The downside to relying on SpaceX, however, is clear: Without a launch-ready Starship HLS by 2027, Artemis 3 won't get off the ground on time. Back in 2023, NASA selected Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin to provide a second lunar lander, dubbed Blue Ghost, to be used during the Artemis 5 mission later this decade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After 5-and-a-half years as T-Mobile's CEO, Mike Sievert will step down from the role on Nov. 1 — succeeded by current Chief Operating Officer Srini Gopalan, who will look to continue building on the resurgence sparked by John Legere more than a decade ago. Gopalan, 54, joined T-Mobile as COO in 2023 after five years on the board. He also held senior roles at Vodafone, Bharti Airtel, and Capital One. When Legere took over in 2012, the company was a distant No. It used its “Un-carrier” strategy and a hard-won merger with Sprint to disrupt the market with lower prices, network gains, and customer perks. He credited earlier leadership teams for achieving so much even as they were “playing with one hand tied behind their back,” as he put it. Appearing with Gopalan on CNBC after the announcement Monday morning, Sievert was asked about the timing of his decision to step down, given that he still has many years left in his own career. In that vein, he said T-Mobile just experienced its “biggest iPhone weekend” ever, with sales and customer switching from the new iPhone launch both up double digits from last year. For years, he said, T-Mobile's disruptive strategy was constrained because it hadn't “always had the best network.” Now, he argued, the company can combine network leadership with “digital skills that are way superior to anyone else.” Your company's success depends on finding and keeping great talent—whether it's an all-star engineer or a world-class salesperson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With EUV locked out by sanctions, China is leaning on DUV multi-patterning and fledgling domestic scanners. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. When Dutch officials revoked ASML's license to export Twinscan NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems to China under U.S. pressure, it closed the door to the only machines capable of producing sub-7nm chips at scale. That single policy decision has defined what some analysts are calling the semiconductor cold war, where SMIC and its peers cannot buy the equipment needed for modern AI accelerators, and every shipment of advanced tools is now scrutinized as if it were a weapons transfer. What the blockade hasn't done is stop China's fabs. Instead, it has forced an awkward reliance on older deep ultraviolet (DUV) machines (via TrendForce) and sparked a parallel race to design local replacements. EUV machines are some of the most complex industrial systems in existence. Successive rounds of sanctions since 2022 have blocked not just EUV exports, but also the most advanced immersion DUV systems, including ASML's Twinscan NXT:1970i and NXT:1980i. The Netherlands and Japan joined those restrictions, and even service contracts for ASML machines installed in China are being scrutinized. The policy has pushed chip procurement into murky territory. Grey-market Nvidia GPUs continue to flood in through Hong Kong and Singapore despite being explicitly banned, with seizures measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Intel's disastrous 10nm rollout proved how costly and yield-sensitive that approach can be, but it remains the only path available to Chinese fabs. SMIC's Kirin 9000-class parts, built for Huawei, already demonstrate the limits of this strategy. It's widely believed that they were fabricated with DUV and heavy use of multiple patterning. The chips work, but at lower volume and efficiency than anything coming out of Taiwan or South Korea. For now, Chinese fabs are leaning on their existing ASML DUV fleets. Those sales are a reminder of just how dependent Beijing still is on imported tools. Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment announced in 2023 that it had built a 28nm immersion scanner, the SSA800-10W. A fully domestic DUV scanner, even if mired in yield problems, would insulate Chinese foundries from future Western policy decisions. Let's not forget that China has previously made it clear that strategic self-sufficiency matters more than perfect parity with TSMC or Samsung. Nobody expects China's DUV tools to rival ASML's. Even with low yields, however, a 7nm-class domestic chip is better than none at all. Huawei has already rebuilt much of its smartphone supply chain around local vendors, and state mandates now require Chinese firms to source 50% of their chips domestically. Meanwhile, ASML's chief executive has said China is ten to fifteen years behind. Each ban entrenches the incentive to localize, and each domestic stepper tested at SMIC or Huawei's labs makes the next round of controls less decisive. EUV has been locked down, but in the process, DUV has become the backbone of a new, homegrown ecosystem. For Washington, the risk is that every workaround makes China a little less dependent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It sounds like Bluesky is getting serious about giving some users the boot, with the company saying it will be doing more to “enforce our moderation policies to better cultivate a space for healthy conversations.” This is part of a broader update to the social media company's community guidelines, after Bluesky asked users in August to provide feedback on an earlier draft of these changes. In a new blog post, the company said it received comments from more than 14,000 community members, and that it “especially heard from community members who shared concerns about how the guidelines could impact creative expression and traditionally marginalized voices.” In addition, the company will be “making product changes that clarify when content is likely to violate our community guidelines” — so perhaps users will also see more warnings before they post content that might run afoul of the guidelines. Writer Roxane Gay described Bluesky's decision — along with DC Comics' cancellation of Felker-Martin's “Red Hood” comic book — as “unacceptable,” “ridiculous,” and an “absolute shame.” Felker-Martin responded succinctly to Bluesky's post announcing the new guidelines, writing, “thanks this sucks.” In addition to criticism from its more left-leaning users, Bluesky also faces ongoing complaints that it has become a liberal echo chamber. (And there definitely seem to be users who can't take a joke.) The company's post mentions other upcoming product changes, including a “zen mode” that would set new defaults for users who want a calmer social media experience, as well as “prompts for how to engage in more constructive conversations.” (Gaming marketplaces, including Steam and Itch.io, recently faced backlash after seeming to crack down on games with edgy or even illegal adult content.) One user, for example, complained that Bluesky should “worry less about whether or not a cartoon has rights and more about whether real life trans and Palestinian people do.” Another said this language “has literally always been there because it's boilerplate social media stuff” and suggested that users were confused because of “bluesky's dogs–t comms.” Google isn't kidding around about cost cutting, even slashing its FT subscription Apple's iOS 26 with the new Liquid Glass design is now available to everyone</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international team of engineers is a winner of the 2025 Gizmodo Science Fair for creating an atmospheric water harvesting device that could improve access to potable water in the most remote, arid regions of the world. Can we pull water out of thin air, even in the driest places on Earth? Engineers led by Xuanhe Zhao, a professor of mechanical engineering and civil and environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), created an atmospheric water harvesting “window” (AWHW) that produces clean drinking water in extremely resource-limited conditions. It's compact, completely self-sustainable, and only requires one input: sunlight. “I invent soft materials to solve hard problems for the world,” Zhao told Gizmodo. This material is made from a hydrophilic polymer network and enriched with hygroscopic salts that readily absorb water from the air. It looks a bit like black bubble wrap, with small domed structures that swell when saturated, then shrink back down as they dry out. That swelling-shrinking transformation, inspired by origami, maximizes the material's efficiency, Zhao said. They initially attempted to build a pyramid-shaped chamber, but this resulted in a large footprint for the device and sacrificed efficiency. So, Zhao asked his team, what would the simplest possible design look like? The engineers ultimately sandwiched the hydrogel between two glass sheets coated with a cooling layer to create a black, window-sized vertical panel. When this panel is placed outside overnight, the hydrogel soaks up water vapor as temperatures drop and humidity rises. “This window-like design turns out to be very effective,” Zhao said. The team tested their atmospheric water harvesting window (AWHW) for one week in Death Valley—the driest region of North America. It worked across humidity levels ranging from 21 to 88% and produced water at rates of up to two-thirds of a cup (160 milliliters) per day. What's more, this water was ready to drink immediately. “We were so surprised by this,” “Will” Chang Liu, co-first author of the Death Valley study and former MIT postdoc, told Gizmodo. “It works pretty well at such low relative humidity.” This test also showed that the team's vertical configuration is central to its efficiency, allowing the hydrogel panel to harvest water from both sides, Liu added. “We are truly proud and excited about this work—and about the potential to help people most in need of safe drinking water,” Zhao said. More than 2 billion people around the world lack access to clean drinking water, according to data from the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund. Experts expect that figure to rise as population growth, economic development, poor resource management, and climate change drain Earth's fresh water supply. Developing a way to provide safe, manageable drinking water for people living in resource-limited regimes “is a grand challenge for the world,” Zhao said. Most people experiencing water scarcity lack access to terrestrial resources such as rivers, aquifers, and lakes, but there is a vast reserve of fresh water that's present everywhere on Earth: the atmosphere. Many people living in rural, water-stressed areas also lack reliable electricity and the resources necessary for technical equipment maintenance, Zhao explained. This makes it especially well-suited for enhancing off-grid water security, she said. This isn't the only team working to develop an atmospheric water harvesting device. Though other designs have proven effective, the AWHW improves on them in several key ways. Designs made from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as some of the most efficient so far. These ultra-porous materials absorb water quickly and are effective in humidity levels as low as 14%, but they're not very cost-effective, Liu said. What's more, MOFs don't swell or stretch when absorbing water, limiting their vapor-carrying capacity. Many designs—including MIT's—use hydrogels enriched with salts to enhance their water-absorbing abilities. This often leads to salt leakage that contaminates harvested water. This liquid compound naturally stabilizes salt to prevent it from crystallizing and leaking into the water. For added protection, his hydrogel contains a microstructure that lacks nanoscale pores, further preventing salt leakage. As such, salt levels in water produced by the AWHW are significantly lower than those of other hydrogel-based designs. Now an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the National University of Singapore, Liu also hopes to test the AWHW in Singapore's humid, tropical climate. The MIT team, led by Xuanhe Zhao, also consisted of “Will” Chang Liu, Xiao-Yun Yan, Shucong Li, and Bolei Deng. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eni, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, just agreed to buy $1 billion in electricity from a power plant being built by Commonwealth Fusion Systems. “This is showing in concrete terms that people that use large amounts of energy, that know the energy market—they want fusion power, and they're willing to contract for it and to pay for it,” said Bob Mumgaard, cofounder and CEO of Commonwealth, on a press call about the deal. The agreement will see Eni purchase electricity from Commonwealth's first commercial fusion power plant, in Virginia. The news comes a few weeks after Commonwealth announced a $863 million funding round, bringing its total funding raised to date to nearly $3 billion. The fusion company also announced earlier this year that Google would be its first commercial power customer for the Virginia plant. Commonwealth, a spinout from MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is widely considered one of the leading companies in fusion power. One open question is what, exactly, Eni plans to do with this electricity. When asked about it on the press call, Fiorillo referenced wind and solar plants that Eni owns and said the plan “is not different from what we do in other areas in the US and the world.” (Eni sells electricity from power plants that it owns, including renewable and fossil-fuel plants.) Commonwealth is building tokamak fusion reactors that use superconducting magnets to hold plasma in place. That plasma is where fusion reactions happen, forcing hydrogen atoms together to release large amounts of energy. The company's first demonstration reactor, which it calls Sparc, is over 65% complete, and the team is testing components and assembling them. The plan is for the reactor, which is located outside Boston, to make plasma within two years and then demonstrate that it can generate more energy than is required to run it. That facility should begin construction in 2027 or 2028 and generate electricity for the grid in the early 2030s, Mumgaard says. Despite the billions of dollars Commonwealth has already raised, the company still needs more money to build its Arc power plant—that will be a multibillion-dollar project, Mumgaard said on a press call in August about the company's latest fundraising round. “These agreements are a really good way to create the right environment for building up more investment,” says Paul Wilson, chair of the department of nuclear engineering and engineering physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Even though commercial fusion energy is still years away at a minimum, investors and big tech companies have pumped money into the industry and signed agreements to buy power from plants once they're operational. Helion, another leading fusion startup, has plans to produce electricity from its first reactor in 2028 (an aggressive timeline that has some experts expressing skepticism). That facility will have a full generating capacity of 50 megawatts, and in 2023 Microsoft signed an agreement to purchase energy from the facility in order to help power its data centers. As billions of dollars pour into the fusion industry, there are still many milestones ahead. To date, only the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has demonstrated that a fusion reactor can generate more energy than the amount put into the reaction. “What I'm not seeing is a peer-reviewed scientific article that makes me feel like, boy, we really turned the corner with the physics.” “Fusion is moving from the lab to be a proper industry,” says Sehila Gonzalez de Vicente, global director of fusion energy at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force. “This is very good for the whole sector to be perceived as a real source of energy.” A recent test shows that Quidnet's technology can store energy in pressurized water underground for months at a time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta's massive new data center in Richland Parish. When it's done, the 4-million-square-foot facility will require more than 2 gigawatts of energy to run. They voiced concerns about rising energy bills and water shortages. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Documents viewed by WIRED show that state authorities agreed to grant Meta tax breaks and incentives without the company explicitly guaranteeing any full-time jobs for local workers. Critics also claim the deal doesn't include stipulations like a cap on how much Entergy could charge utility customers for the construction of the gas plants and transmission lines in Meta's data center build-out—a concern as massive AI data centers can cause utility bills to spike. “We wanted the commissioners to attach conditions and reasonable safeguards, such as a cost cap, but they instead came to this extremely disappointing and baffling decision,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposed the Entergy application. During the approval vote, Entergy and Louisiana's economic development officials repeatedly pointed to the projections shared by Meta, which suggest that the project would bring a $10 billion investment and upwards of 300 to 500 well-paying jobs. “There has never been a better time to lift our residents out of poverty. There has never been a better time to give people in our region better jobs,” said Rob Cleveland, the CEO of Grow NELA, an economic development firm representing northwest Louisiana who testified in support of Entergy's gas plants, at the hearing. But the public had little time to scrutinize Louisiana's economic development promises. They also heard little from Meta, which was not legally required to take part in the hearings on Entergy's new gas plants, despite the fact that the gas plants and a new $550 million transmission line connecting energy to the data center and upgrades to a local substation (also approved on August 20) are being built entirely for the company—the latter entirely paid for by Louisiana taxpayers. Repeated attempts to force Meta to produce documents that critics claim they have not received were unsuccessful, including a July subpoena attempt. One of Meta's tax incentive agreements with the state, which was signed last fall and viewed by WIRED, does not stipulate that Meta subsidiary Laidley, which is running the data center project, will focus on local hiring, although it does require that all jobs be fulfilled on site. (Separately, Entergy said Meta submitted a letter to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April saying that it will make “a concerted effort” to hire locally, but this assurance is not binding.) Meta would need to hire these 500 “full-time” jobs by 2035 if it wants to receive the highest level of tax breaks, an 80 percent reduction on the full amount. It does require the jobs to provide health insurance and says the pay for all jobs should average out at $82,000 a year. When reached for comment, Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for the state's economic development authority, said that the agency still expects Meta to create 500 full-time, permanent jobs, per previous announcements. “Meta is expected to create 500 direct new jobs at the facility, which in economic development terms means permanent, full-time jobs,” Litten says. In an email to WIRED, Entergy only referred to an impact report from Grow NELA but answered no other direct questions. “We continually asked for analysis with how they came up with this number of jobs, and Entergy has no idea about how many people will be hired,” says Susan Stevens Miller, an attorney representing the Union of Concerned Scientists and Alliance for Affordable Energy, which opposed the application. An earlier, six-page term sheet laying out hiring incentives was published by Power magazine in November, but it did not include further details about whether jobs could be part-time or any other details in the 93-page agreement viewed by WIRED. Advocates with the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Union of Concerned Scientists contacted by WIRED said they had never seen the full agreement until it was sent to them by WIRED. But the tax exemption agreement secured between Meta and Louisiana officials did not secure any guarantee of local hiring. Litten, with Louisiana Economic Development, told WIRED that separate state tax breaks that all companies in the state are eligible for do require local hiring. They include the Quality Jobs Rebate, which provides a 6 percent rebate on payroll expenses, a program set to replace it called High Impact Jobs program. Most data centers hire specialists from out of state for the technical jobs, according to Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst who studies data center tax breaks at the nonprofit Good Jobs First. She says data centers employ a mix of low-skill and high-skill technical workers to manage servers in addition to security guards and maintenance roles. She says that while construction is happening, data centers often hire specialist electricians who travel from state to state to set up servers. For this reason, she says, Meta is not the only tech company hesitant to guarantee local hiring when negotiating data center contracts. In response to questions from WIRED, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said, “We make a concerted effort to source labor locally and provide substantial contributions directly to the community.” Clayton said that for part-time construction roles, its contractors were “working on hiring local talent” and that they would host information fairs early next year. For permanent data center jobs, Clayton said Meta would be hiring “technical operators, electricians, air-conditioning and heating specialists, logistics staff, security, and more.” The state's agreement with Meta makes clear that as public land, the property Meta is leasing is exempt from traditional taxes. It creates a menu of options for what the company would potentially owe in “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT), a common agreement that lets local governments offer tax breaks with provisions attached. At this level, Meta would have to pay 40 percent of the assessed property tax. Louisiana's agreements ask for more than some other states' tax subsidies. According to Good Jobs First, nearly half of state tax subsidies for data centers don't require any new jobs to be created. Louisiana had already amended a tax rebate to create an exemption for data centers in 2024 to entice Meta; in its latest iteration, it says data centers can receive a full sales tax exemption for equipment purchases in the state as long as they hire 50 full-time jobs and invest at least $200 million by July 1, 2029. A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement. Good Jobs First says that at least 10 states have subsidies for data centers that are worth more than $100 million each, and “have suffered estimated losses of $100 million each in tax revenue for data centers,” according to its data. Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion. The Franklin Farms site in Holly Ridge, the area of Richland Parish where Meta's data center is being built, was purchased by Louisiana specifically for economic development projects. When asked if Meta plans to purchase the property, Clayton said, “We'll keep you updated on our future plans for this site.” Meta's presence has already caused land values to jump. But there's also a concern that Meta could delay or abandon the data center project. “My general fear is that too many data centers are being built,” Miller says. She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer. “Essentially, the state will be stuck with this warehouse full of computers,” Miller says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Our focus is really on what we can do to pull the doctor out of the visit,” says Akido's CTO. To your surprise, they schedule you in for the next day. At the appointment, you aren't rushed through describing your health concerns; instead, you have a full half hour to share your symptoms and worries and the exhaustive details of your health history with someone who listens attentively and asks thoughtful follow-up questions. You leave with a diagnosis, a treatment plan, and the sense that, for once, you've been able to discuss your health with the care that it merits. Once cautious, OpenAI, Grok, and others will now dive into giving unverified medical advice with virtually no disclaimers. You might not have spoken to a doctor, or other licensed medical practitioner, at all. This is the new reality for patients at a small number of clinics in Southern California that are run by the medical startup Akido Labs. These patients—some of whom are on Medicaid—can access specialist appointments on short notice, a privilege typically only afforded to the wealthy few who patronize concierge clinics. The key difference is that Akido patients spend relatively little time, or even no time at all, with their doctors. A doctor then approves, or corrects, the AI system's recommendations. “Our focus is really on what we can do to pull the doctor out of the visit,” says Jared Goodner, Akido's CTO. There's a big gap in expertise between doctors and AI-enhanced medical assistants, says Emma Pierson, a computer scientist at UC Berkeley. Computer vision tools identify cancers during preventive scans, automated research systems allow doctors to quickly sort through the medical literature, and LLM-powered medical scribes can take appointment notes on a clinician's behalf. But these systems are designed to support doctors as they go about their typical medical routines. What distinguishes ScopeAI, Goodner says, is its ability to independently complete the cognitive tasks that constitute a medical visit, from eliciting a patient's medical history to coming up with a list of potential diagnoses to identifying the most likely diagnosis and proposing appropriate next steps. For the most part, these LLMs are fine-tuned versions of Meta's open-access Llama models, though Goodner says that the system also makes use of Anthropic's Claude models. For the doctors who will review its outputs later, ScopeAI produces a concise note that includes a summary of the patient's visit, the most likely diagnosis, two or three alternative diagnoses, and recommended next steps, such as referrals or prescriptions. It also lists a justification for each diagnosis and recommendation. ScopeAI is currently being used in cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care clinics and by Akido's street medicine team, which serves the Los Angeles homeless population. That team—which is led by Steven Hochman, a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine—meets patients out in the community to help them access medical care, including treatment for substance use disorders. Previously, in order to prescribe a drug to treat an opioid addiction, Hochman would have to meet the patient in person; now, caseworkers armed with ScopeAI can interview patients on their own, and Hochman can approve or reject the system's recommendations later. “It allows me to be in 10 places at once,” he says. This arrangement is only possible because homeless patients typically get their health insurance from Medicaid, the public insurance system for low-income Americans. While Medicaid allows doctors to approve ScopeAI prescriptions and treatment plans asynchronously, both for street medicine and clinic visits, many other insurance providers require that doctors speak directly with patients before approving those recommendations. “You worry about that exacerbating health disparities,” she says. He also notes that being seen quickly by an AI-enhanced medical assistant may be better than dealing with long wait times and limited provider availability, which is the status quo for Medicaid patients. And all Akido patients can opt for traditional doctor's appointments, if they are willing to wait for them, he says. Part of the challenge of deploying a tool like ScopeAI is navigating a regulatory and insurance landscape that wasn't designed for AI systems that can independently direct medical appointments. Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard Law School, says that any AI system that effectively acts as a “doctor in a box” would likely need to be approved by the FDA and could run afoul of medical licensure laws, which dictate that only doctors and other licensed professionals can practice medicine. The California Medical Practice Act says that AI can't replace a doctor's responsibility to diagnose and treat a patient, but doctors are allowed to use AI in their work, and they don't need to see patients in-person or in real-time before diagnosing them. But Samant is confident that Akido is in compliance, as ScopeAI was intentionally designed to fall short of being a “doctor in a box.” Because the system requires a human doctor to review and approve of all of its diagnostic and treatment recommendations, he says, it doesn't require FDA approval. But Zeke Emanuel, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who served in the Obama and Biden administrations, worries that this comfort could be obscuring from patients the extent to which an algorithm is influencing their care. “That certainly isn't really what was traditionally meant by the human touch in medicine,” she says. DeAndre Siringoringo, a medical assistant who works at Akido's cardiology office in Rancho Cucamonga, says that while he tells the patients he works with that an AI system will be listening to the appointment in order to gather information for their doctor, he doesn't inform them about the specifics of how ScopeAI works, including the fact that it makes diagnostic recommendations to doctors. But it's been widely documented that doctors using AI systems tend to go along with the system's recommendations more often than they should, a phenomenon known as automation bias. At this point, it's impossible to know whether automation bias is affecting doctors' decisions at Akido clinics, though Pierson says it's a risk—especially when doctors aren't physically present for appointments. “We designed ScopeAI specifically to reduce bias by proactively countering blind spots that can influence medical decisions, which historically lean heavily on physician intuition and personal experience,” she says. “We also train physicians explicitly on how to use ScopeAI thoughtfully, so they retain accountability and avoid over-reliance.” Akido evaluates ScopeAI's performance by testing it on historical data and monitoring how often doctors correct its recommendations; those corrections are also used to further train the underlying models. Before deploying ScopeAI in a given specialty, Akido ensures that when tested on historical data sets, the system includes the correct diagnosis in its top three recommendations at least 92% of the time. But Akido hasn't undertaken more rigorous testing, such as studies that compare ScopeAI appointments with traditional in-person or telehealth appointments, in order to determine whether the system improves—or at least maintains—patient outcomes. “Making medical care cheaper and more accessible is a laudable goal,” Pierson says.
