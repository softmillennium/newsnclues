Outrage flared last week about the University of California's capitulation to this era's resurgent McCarthyism, as news spread that the university has provided the names of at least 160 students, faculty members, and staff at the University of California, Berkeley, to federal officials who – under the guise of investigating “alleged antisemitic incidents” – are scrutinizing people who have expressed opposition to Israel's genocide in Gaza. Judith Butler, a UC Berkeley philosophy professor and Jewish critic of the Israeli government, said in a recent interview with Democracy Now!, “There is no good evidence that antisemitism is rampant on campus,” adding, “To take a position against genocide is certainly not an antisemitic thing to do. Most Jews are against genocide, and we were taught to be against genocide, and we were taught, as well, that ‘never again' is a slogan that should apply to all people.” Butler noted that most of those whose names were reported to the administration had not been apprised of the allegations against them. A Truthout analysis of a voluntary agreement signed by the University of California and the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights nine months ago reveals that more such disclosures from other schools may be yet to come. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. This specific agreement, which was reported on by the Daily Bruin, UCLA's student paper, in 2024, has caused a new round of concern among faculty at the five campuses. The University of California, like many institutions nationwide, is subject to oversight by federal and state agencies and has legal obligations to respond to information requests arising from audits, compliance reviews, and investigations. Where a legal obligation has been identified, UC has complied with investigative requests consistently over many years and across numerous administrations, reflecting the University's overall commitment to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws. UC will continue to meet its legal obligations while exploring all legal avenues to safeguard the privacy and trust of our community members. This has all sorts of implications such as putting those people at peril, without their yet knowing it, and also undermining the academic freedom of professors to teach what they want as the new school term is about to start. Kina Thackray, Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Services at UC San Diego, told Truthout: It's also concerning for international students because our academic year is just starting and many will be traveling. This type of information is not required for such an investigation. When then University of California President Michael V. Drake announced the agreement in December, he wrote that the school was “deeply committed to cultivating a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for our students, faculty, staff, patients, and other visitors, free from discrimination and harassment.” Faculty told Truthout they worry about what the agreement could mean for discrimination complaints going forward. Imagine teaching in a classroom: students could allege that you're anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-male depending on the topics you cover in class. Does that mean they can allege a civil rights violation and your name will be given to the government? Will faculty get into trouble and get their names put on a list for teaching about women's health or trans health? The broad request for such personally sensitive information is intended to incite individual and institutional fear and thus chill First Amendment rights. Release of [personally identifiable information] about individuals associated with discrimination complaints is irrelevant to a legitimate investigation into an institution's management of such complaints and creates substantial risk of harm to those individuals. … We urge your administration to protect the UC San Diego community from government threats and investigations that are wielded as tools to force us into compliance with a political agenda. In its July report, the DOJ accused UCLA of “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.” “The broad request for such personally sensitive information is intended to incite individual and institutional fear and thus chill First Amendment rights.” On September 16, a group of UC faculty, students, staff, and labor unions filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Trump administration for violation of their academic freedom and free speech rights. They accuse the administration of trying to “commandeer this public university system and to purge from its campuses viewpoints with which the President and his administration” disagree. Those demands require that UCLA ban demonstrations in certain areas of campus, share disciplinary records of international students with the federal government, eliminate racial preferences in hiring and race-based scholarships, and alter its policies toward transgender students in sports, health care, and public spaces. “Defendants' threats and coercive conduct have caused a pervasive sense of fear and intimidation among UC faculty, students, academic employees, and staff employees, who have seen the UC already begin to alter its policies and practices seemingly in capitulation to the Trump administration,” the lawsuit says.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA on Monday introduced the 10 people — selected from a pool of 8,000 applicants — who will join the agency's astronaut corps as it races to return to the moon before attempting an unprecedented crewed mission to Mars. “And we're going to need America's best and brightest (for) all our exploration plans for the future,” Duffy said. … And I'll just tell you this, I'll be damned if the Chinese beat NASA or beat America back to the moon.” The 10 inductees include Ben Bailey, a mechanical engineer and chief warrant officer 3 for the Army from Charlottesville, Virginia; Lauren Edgar, a geologist from Sammamish, Washington; Adam Fuhrmann, an aerospace engineer and Air Force major from Leesburg, Virginia; Cameron Jones, an aerospace engineer and Air Force major from Savanna, Illinois; Yuri Kubo, an electrical and computer engineer and former NASA worker and SpaceX launch director from Columbus, Indiana; Rebecca Lawler, a former lieutenant commander and test pilot in the Navy from Little Elm, Texas; Imelda Muller, a former Navy lieutenant and undersea medical officer from Copake Falls, New York; Erin Overcash, a lieutenant commander and test pilot in the Navy from Goshen, Kentucky; Katherine Spies, a design engineer and former Marine Corps test pilot from San Diego; and Anna Menon, a biomedical engineer and former SpaceX employee from Houston. This astronaut class marks the first in which there are more women than men, according to NASA. Rock discovery contains ‘clearest sign' yet of ancient life on Mars, NASA says While working at SpaceX, Menon was selected by tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to join him on Polaris Dawn, an experimental mission that traveled higher in its orbit around Earth than any crewed spacecraft had flown in decades. Anil is also a former SpaceX employee, and he was chosen for the NASA astronaut corps during the last round of selections in 2021. “On behalf of all the Flies, we look forward to getting to know your class so we can give you a name befitting your personalities and appropriate for the exciting and dynamic time,” said NASA astronaut Chris Birch. The 10 new astronauts will spend the next two years in intensive training, during which they will “learn NASA's history and our vision for the future, they will take classes in geology and in water survival and space health,” said Stephen Koerner, the deputy director of NASA's Johnson Space Center. “They even get to train in our high performance jets,” Koerner added. And that could be a different experience than those picked during the last selection round in 2021. At that time, NASA still had a decade of International Space Station operations ahead. Two billionaires have very different — and equally wild — visions of a future in space. While Norman Knight, director of NASA flight operations, said during Monday's news conference that “many of these candidates sitting here today will have the opportunity to visit” the ISS, he emphasized that space station is supposed to serve as a learning laboratory for more difficult missions deeper into space. It's not clear what other flight assignments these astronauts may be eligible for. NASA is likely to tap more experienced astronauts for moon missions. The agency has already selected a group of veteran fliers for Artemis II, a test mission that will fly around the moon as soon as next year. But NASA officials did indicate that they hope the young group of astronauts selected on Monday may be eligible for flights later in the Artemis program to the moon and perhaps even to Mars — where no human has yet traveled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After remaining mum on fellow ABC host Jimmy Kimmel's suspension last week, the hosts of “The View” on Monday spoke out against the Trump administration's recent crackdown on free speech. “Did y'all really think we weren't going to talk about Jimmy Kimmel? Goldberg explained that the long-running daytime talk show hadn't addressed Kimmel's indefinite suspension during Thursday's and Friday's broadcasts because the co-hosts “took a breath to see if Jimmy was going to say anything about it first.” While the co-hosts did not directly attack ABC or its parent company Disney for benching Kimmel, they did sharply criticize what they described as the Trump administration's attacks on the First Amendment. Disney removed Kimmel from the air last week after Brendan Carr, the Trump-aligned Federal Communications Commission chairman, threatened to revoke ABC affiliate licenses over Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's suspected killer. Someone can say something they shouldn't and get taken off the air,” Goldberg said. Co-host Ana Navarro, who likened Trump's attacks on the press to the actions of dictatorships she lived under in Nicaragua, expressed dismay at “how the government itself is using its weight and power to bully and scare people into silence.” She added: “This is what dictators and authoritarians do; it does not matter the ideology.” “The First Amendment is the first for a reason, because you need to be able to hold those in power accountable,” said co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, a former Trump administration official-turned-critic. Kimmel has yet to publicly address his suspension. Meanwhile, “The View,” which is known for its fiery, no-holds-barred criticism of President Trump, has come under its own fire from the Trump administration. In late July, FCC chair Carr told Fox News that the long-running talk show was “in the crosshairs of this administration” because of co-host Joy Behar's repeated attacks on the president. And on Thursday, following Kimmel's suspension, Carr told CNN commentator Scott Jennings that it might be “worthwhile” for his agency to also target “The View.” Instead, Goldberg ended the conversation by imploring viewers to stand up for free speech.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Talks on UN-led stabilisation force follow recognition of Palestine by France, Canada and the UK Arab and Muslim leaders are to meet Donald Trump in New York to discuss their plan for a UN-mandated international stabilisation force in Gaza after France joined the UK, Canada and Australia in recognising Palestine as a state. Israel has warned that it might respond to the recognition of Palestine by annexing the West Bank, citing claims from Hamas that recognition by allies of Israel was a victory for the terror group. France has said the plan for a stabilisation force would marginalise Hamas by disarming the group and excluding it from power. The proposal, which is due to be endorsed on Monday at a UN conference on Palestinian statehood, includes a UN-mandated force to provide security in Gaza as well as oversee the disarmament of Hamas and help train a Palestinian Authority (PA) police force. The Arab League declared in July that Hamas must play no further role in governance, with power handed to a newly elected PA to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. He is expected to meet leaders from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Arab leaders see the meeting as a chance to pin down Trump on whether he supports the Arab League's proposals for Gaza's future, or even a variation put to him by a working group led by Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, and Jared Kushner, who is the president's son-in-law. Neither of the reconstruction plans proposes the mass expulsion of Palestinians, a proposal that Trump at times has appeared to support. The Arab states are likely to insist they will not join any international force unless the reformed PA is given a future role. The PA, which exercises limited civic rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was forced out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, has said it was ready to govern Gaza and the West Bank with international support. However, others in his rightwing coalition want to annex Gaza. Israel has driven the PA close to bankruptcy by withholding monthly revenue transfers. UAE leaders, bidding to present themselves as the startup nation of the future, did not suggest they would leave the accords but instead said plans for greater regional integration would become a dead letter. France's foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said the recognition of a Palestinian state was a disavowal of Hamas since the plan called for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza. He pointed out that the general assembly had already endorsed a seven-page declaration this month outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution, while also condemning Hamas and calling for it to surrender and disarm. However distant it may seem at this moment, a negotiated two-state solution is the path that can enable both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security and dignity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is fully ready to respond to threats with force, President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Russian Security Council. He also noted that Russia is prepared to continue observing the core tenets of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) for one year after it expires. The West's destructive actions have "significantly undermined the foundation of constructive relations and practical cooperation between nuclear powers." The system of agreements between Russia and the US on nuclear and strategic defensive weapons "has been almost entirely dismantled." The destructive actions of the West are aimed at "undermining global parity, at gaining, trying to gain, absolute, overwhelming superiority." Russia "prefers and prioritizes political and diplomatic methods of maintaining international peace based on the principles of equal rights, indivisible security, and mutual respect for interests." Russia is prepared to respond to any strategic threats "not with words but with military and technological measures." Russia is confident in the "reliability and effectiveness" of its deterrent forces. Russia "is not interested in further escalating tensions or fueling an arms race." Russia would like to preserve the status quo established by the New START Treaty "to avoid provoking a further strategic arms race and to ensure an appropriate level of predictability and restraint." After the treaty's expiration, Russia is ready to continue "adhering to the core quantitative restrictions" for one year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia and Ukraine swapped accusations of deadly drone strikes on civilian areas of their countries Monday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky anticipated “a very intense week” of diplomacy at the UN General Assembly in New York, where the Security Council was expected to discuss the more than three-year war. Additionally, international concerns have mounted recently that the fighting could spread beyond Ukraine's borders as European countries rebuked Russia for what they said were provocations. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media that Russia was testing NATO's political and military response and aiming to reduce Western support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources toward the defence of alliance countries. Russia was doing just enough not to cross a red line, but things could still spiral, he added. NATO leaders express alarm over growing Russian hostility after drone incursion in Poland Zelensky said he also planned to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose drive for a peace deal after taking office in January has yielded no progress. He said that over the past week Russia fired more than 1,500 strike drones, 1,280 glide bombs and 50 missiles of various types at Ukraine. More than 132,000 foreign components were found in those weapons from dozens of countries, he said. Local officials take pictures inside a school building that was damaged on Sunday in what local authorities called a Ukrainian drone attack, in the town of Foros, Crimea.Alexey Pavlishak/Reuters Meanwhile, at least seven Russian aircraft bombarded the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing three people and wounding two others, according to regional administration head Ivan Fedorov. Residential buildings, shopping malls, a parking lot and “critical infrastructure” were targeted, he said. “None of the sites had anything to do with military infrastructure,” Fedorov said. The Ukrainian air force said it stopped 132 out of 141 strike and decoy drones launched by Russian forces overnight. The Moscow-appointed head of Ukraine's Russia-occupied Crimea peninsula, Sergei Aksyonov, said three people were killed and 16 others were wounded late Sunday by Ukrainian drones that struck the popular vacation resort of Foros. In Russia's Belgorod border region, three people were killed and another 10 were wounded by Ukrainian drone attacks on Sunday, according to the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. The Defence Ministry said 114 Ukrainian drones were downed early Monday over several Russian regions. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sept. 22 that Russia is ready to respond to any threats as he accused the West of seeking superiority in the nuclear domain. The comments come amid rising tensions between NATO and Russia, following the downing of Russian drones over Poland and airspace violations in Estonia. Putin announced that Russia is willing to uphold the treaty's quantitative limits for another year and will decide on any future restrictions according to its own assessment. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty in February 2023 but did not fully withdraw, claiming to continue to uphold its quantitative limits. U.S. President Donald Trump, who met Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, has said he wants to maintain the limits set by the New START agreement. The Kremlin's chief further warned that Russia is "ready to respond to any existing or emerging threats" with "military-technical means" rather than just words. Since launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has repeatedly issued veiled or overt nuclear threats against the invaded country and its Western partners. During his address, Putin went on to accuse the West of "destructive steps" endangering the dialogue between nuclear-armed powers and said that Russia has confidence in its deterrent forces. According to estimates from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in 2024, the United States has 3,708 nuclear warheads, while Russia has 4,380, excluding retired weapons. Satellite imagery published earlier this year showed that Russia has expanded and modernized at least five nuclear-related facilities near European borders in recent years.

He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. "There is currently no evidence that any of these drones posed a direct threat. So far, none have been identified as combat drones capable of detonating or causing harm," Donald Tusk said. The Sept. 26 meeting, convened by EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius, will include representatives from seven EU states — Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria — along with Ukraine. The latest measures will target two Russian energy giants, Rosneft and Gazprom, but neither company plays a significant role in supplying oil via the Druzhba pipeline, according to European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. Reuters reported on Sept. 22 that Russia is pressing the U.N. civil aviation agency to lift sanctions on the shipment of aircraft parts and overflights, warning that they allegedly threaten air safety. The agency cited an undisclosed source and working papers. Polish national Jerzy Tyc was the head of the Kursk Association, an organization involved in restoring Soviet war memorials in Poland. Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said that no hostile activity was observed near the Ukrainian border either during or after the drills.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, a behavioral scientist shares how she stays focused Don't already get First Thing in your inbox? Donald Trump told a crowd of tens of thousands at a memorial for Charlie Kirk that he “hates” his opponents, despite Kirk's widow saying she forgives the man charged with fatally shooting her husband. He said Kirk told a staff member he was not afraid of students who disagreed with him in the crowd at Utah Valley University. But Trump said he felt differently to the rightwing activist, adding: “That's where I disagreed with Charlie. He used his eulogy to call Kirk “a martyr for the Christian faith”, despite no evidence that religion played a role in his killing. David Smith reflects that the speech may have been a canny attempt to lock in a new generation of young Christians before 2028. The recognition of Palestinian statehood is part of a wider strategy that aims to both isolate Hamas and challenge attempts by the Israeli government to erase the chance of a Palestinian homeland. Portugal also recognized Palestinian statehood late on Sunday. The strategy, led by France, which plans to make the same move on Monday, aims to make recognition part of a wider process, including a reformed, democratically elected Palestinian Authority to supersede Hamas in Gaza. A US state department spokesperson on Sunday dismissed the move to recognise Palestine as “performative”. You can follow the latest updates on our liveblog. Two German Eurofighter jets were scrambled on Sunday to intercept a Russian military aircraft above the Baltic Sea, as Estonia said it would call an emergency meeting of the UN security council after Russian planes violated its airspace. Germany's air force said the Russian Il-20M reconnaissance plane had switched off its transponders and ignored requests to make contact. Sunday's move comes after a series of actions that European governments consider to be deliberate Russian provocations. On Friday, three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace in the Gulf of Finland. When asked if the US would defend EU countries from further Russian aggression, Donald Trump on Sunday said: “Yeah, I would. Despite medical guidelines, Donald Trump's administration is reportedly set to link pregnant women's use of Tylenol to a risk of autism. Most scientists believe genes play a role in autism. The behavioral scientist Zelana Montminy is worried that burnout has become normalised. She believes many of us are exhausted – not necessarily from doing too much, but “from being everywhere and nowhere all at the same time”. Here's what she does to build focus in her daily life. Governments around the world are increasing coal, gas and oil extraction to levels that will make achieving climate goals impossible, data has shown. Rather than “transition away from fossil fuels”, as countries pledged to do at UN climate summits, nations have stepped up their planned extraction compared with 2023. If it all goes ahead, the world will produce more than double the quantity of fossil fuels in 2030 than the amount that would make restricting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow has devised a plan to interfere in the Moldovan parliamentary elections and disrupt the country's path toward EU membership, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 22, citing documents it had seen. Separately, a BBC investigation published on Sept. 21 uncovered that a secret Russia-funded network is attempting to influence the outcome of the upcoming vote. The news comes before the Sept. 28 elections, in which a group of Russian-friendly parties will challenge the ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) with potentially major ramifications for Moldova's EU accession efforts. According to the documents, the Kremlin's tactics include recruiting Moldovan citizens living abroad, including in Russia, to vote at polling stations in the EU and other countries, organizing disruptive protests, and running a widespread disinformation campaign on social media. Undercover reporting by BBC journalists also uncovered that a Russian-funded network offered payments to individuals willing to spread pro-Russian propaganda and fake news aimed at discrediting Sandu's party. The BBC found that participants were paid to covertly recruit supporters of pro-Russian opposition parties and conduct so-called polls on behalf of a non-existent organization. Sandu's PAS faces a challenge from several groups, including the nominally pro-EU Alternative Bloc and a pro-Russian party led by former Moldovan President Igor Dodon. Moldovan law enforcement agencies carried out more than 250 searches across the country on Sept. 22 as part of an investigation into plans to incite mass unrest and destabilization, Moldovan news outlet NewsMaker reported. Chisianu has long warned against Moscow's attempt to destabilize Moldova. Last year, pro-EU Sandu secured re-election by a narrow margin against Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former top prosecutor backed by Dodon. Sandu has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pushed for Moldova's EU membership. Russia, in turn, claims many Moldovans want to maintain ties with Moscow and accuses Sandu of fostering "Russophobia." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged on July 4 that the European Union will help Moldova defend itself against hybrid threats by "agents of autocracy" as elections approach. "There is currently no evidence that any of these drones posed a direct threat. So far, none have been identified as combat drones capable of detonating or causing harm," Donald Tusk said.

Polish national Jerzy Tyc was the head of the Kursk Association, an organization involved in restoring Soviet war memorials in Poland. Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said that no hostile activity was observed near the Ukrainian border either during or after the drills. Fires broke out an electrical substation in the town of Staroderevyankovskaya in southwest Russia amid a drone attack overnight on Sept. 22.</p>

SEOUL, September 22. /TASS/. North Korea has "acquired a secret weapon" as part of its efforts to build up its defense capabilities, the Korean Central News Agency reported, citing the country's leader Kim Jong Un.

"Our state and party are achieving continuous and rapid development in strengthening our defense capabilities," Kim Jong Un said. He mentioned the construction of new destroyers as "the first important step in building a maritime power," as well as the "relentless strengthening of strategic forces" and improvements to serial weapons.

"In addition, we have acquired new secret weapons. Significant progress has been made in the field of defense science and research, which will greatly contribute to a sharp increase in combat capabilities," Kim Jong Un said.

During his speech at the regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim Jong Un stated that North Korea is ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington abandons its desire to denuclearize the country. He added that North Korea now feels most secure thanks to the development of its nuclear forces.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maga figures portrayed the slain activist as a martyr during emotional memorial service If the assassination of Charlie Kirk was an attempt to silence American conservatives, then his memorial service marked a stunning repudiation of that plan. Thousands more could not get in, the gargantuan stadium, normally home to American football games or hosting A-list pop stars, quickly filled to its capacity of 63,400. Kirk was killed by an assassin's bullet 11 days ago, shot in the throat as he addressed students at a college campus in Utah. You have made him immortal,” Stephen Miller, a long-time aide to Mr Trump, declared from the lectern equipped with bulletproof glass, set up on stage. “You have immortalised Charlie Kirk, and now millions will carry on his legacy. “And we will devote the rest of our lives to finishing the causes for which Charlie gave his last measure of devotion,” Mr Miller said. Erika Kirk, the widow of the murdered activist, was less fiery, but nonetheless the stadium was silent, taking a collective intake of breath as she pledged to continue her husband's work – and said she forgave his assassin. “I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it's what Charlie would do,” she said through tears, the cavernous stadium so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Kirk was gone, but Turning Point USA, the activist movement he built, which, by the time of his death, had a presence on hundreds of college campuses, would endure. Mrs Kirk, who wore a white suit and displayed a crucifix around her neck, recalled forcing herself to see the murdered body of her husband. “Charlie didn't suffer”, she had realised, and the crowd saw it too. Several times she would smile as she recalled her husband's habits – the love notes they exchanged – and look into the distance. At other points, her face would crumple and she dabbed at her eyes, before looking down, steeling herself and pushing on. When Mrs Kirk reappeared on stage after Donald Trump gave the closing speech, she appeared to be physically exhausted. The newly appointed head of Turning Point repeatedly embraced Mr Trump, who paid tribute to Kirk as a “giant of his generation”, clinging to the president and burying her head in his shoulder. Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point, said the turnout from fans and America's most powerful figures showed the impact of Kirk's work and how it had been spurred on by his death. He told The Telegraph: “Had there not been the Turning Point USA ecosystem, this would be nothing but mourning and a massive gaping hole. “The opposite has happened … We're seeing millions of Charlie Kirks rising up across all 50 states, and even internationally.” Vigils for the slain influencer have taken place all over the world, from South Korea to Spain, Australia and London, a fact also pointed out by Mr Trump. Mr Trump was pictured shaking hands with Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire and, at one time his closest political ally, with whom he fell out spectacularly earlier this year. At one point during the feud, Mr Musk accused his former boss of being named in government documents relating to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Vance said those who celebrated Kirk's killing should lose their jobs, while Mr Rubio and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, issued penalties for foreign nationals and US troops who did the same. Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night talk show host, was suspended on Wednesday hours after the government threatened to cancel broadcasting licenses because of comments he made about Kirk's killing. Republicans ranging from former George W Bush adviser Karl Rove to Texas senator Ted Cruz and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson have warned using Kirk's death to target political rivals could chip away at civil liberties and backfire. That hatchet appeared to be at least temporarily buried on Sunday. Carlson, who made a speech paying tribute to Kirk, concentrated his remarks on the theme of repentance and avoided antagonising Mr Trump, who was watching nearby. How long that uneasy truce will last is unclear. We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil.” Confiscated items piled up on tables run by security outside. Joshua Runkles, reportedly a former deputy sheriff in Idaho, claimed he was providing private security and presented outdated law enforcement credentials. Authorities are still attempting to work out what precisely he was doing. Inside the arena, where sniffer dogs patrolled with their handlers, a bulletproof screen was set up at the lectern where Mr Trump and other senior political paid tribute to Kirk. “This is the most high-profile event in probably 30 years,” Mr Bowyer said. Many of the attendees would not have known Kirk personally: but they were devotees of his viral videos, in which he would show up at colleges and challenge students to debates, beating the drum for his muscular brand of conservatism. Holding an enormous American flag aloft on a pole, Mr Rehweld – a dual American and Canadian citizen – had travelled from British Columbia all the way to Arizona. He declared Jesus Christ as lord,” he told The Telegraph, calling Kirk a “very important figure in the common-sense conservative world” whose influence would live on after his death.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump, left, and Erika Kirk, right, wife of slain conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and the new CEO of Turning Point USA during a memorial service at State Farm Stadium, in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday.Brian Snyder/Reuters It was a spiritual reawakening for the millions of MAGA followers and a startling awakening for their opponents, who in an event stretching more than four hours were introduced to, if not reminded of, the power of the new conservatism. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a 'martyr for American freedom' on Sunday and vowed at his memorial service to carry on his work, while again accusing what he called the 'radical left' for Kirk's murder. Some of the tributes were personal (“We loved Charlie as a friend,” said Vice-President JD Vance). Some expressed heartache (“at a level I didn't know existed,” said his widow, Erika Kirk, who in an affecting moment said she would “forgive” his killer). Some were pugilistic (White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller spoke of what he called the “righteous fury our enemies cannot see or understand”). Those whose presence may be the most significant in their tribute to a political figure who never held political office were the nameless who, because they were part of a crowd of an estimated 200,000 – half in State Farm Stadium, half in overflow lots – were rendered faceless, though not powerless. It was those in what Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called “Charlie's church” who dressed in red, white, and blue and donned “I Am Charlie Kirk” T-shirts. It was the youth who Democrats thought they owned because of their commitment to diversity, and the non-voters political experts doubted would participate in elections, and the new activists energized by Mr. Kirk's life and, now, rededicated by his death to their movement. Together they provided a unifying moment for an otherwise fractured GOP, divided by style (old guard versus MAGA ascendancy), issues (the clamour for further disclosures involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein), potential new rifts (over vaccine mandates), and concerns about the future (with speculation about the 2028 presidential race). Top officials at the White House and other high profile supporters gathered to pay tribute to conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Sunday, whose assassination has intensified political tensions in the United States. They sent a wave of grief across university campuses where Mr. Kirk tested his often-provocative conservative creed even as he spoke out for the free exchange of ideas; created new tests of the country's freedom of expression, codified 234 years ago in the First Amendment; demonized those who didn't display sufficient grief or were perceived to be disrespectful only to have the same individuals become celebrated by others as sentinels of liberty; and spawned efforts like the one undertaken by New Hampshire state Representative Mike Belcher. Last week, he drafted a “Countering Hate And Revolutionary Leftist Indoctrination in Education (CHARLIE)” bill to fight “woke activists” he said were disseminating “Marxist ideology” to schoolchildren at taxpayer expense. And they also promoted a surge of interest in Mr. Kirk's Turning Point USA movement, which reported that in the first six days since his slaying, more than 54,000 high-school and college students contacted the organization to join a chapter or to start one. Charlie Kirk suspect's alleged trolling is the latest example of mass violence as a meme It was an outpouring of grief that Lysiane Gagnon noted in an account in The Globe was possessed of a subtle “political context” for a symbol of francophone pride and a hockey star whose 1955 suspension prompted an uprising known as the Richard Riot and often regarded as a spur to Quebec nationalism.
