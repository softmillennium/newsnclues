                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Famously private, Scott only discusses her donations through her website and does not confirm them until after the recipients do. “This extraordinary gift is a powerful vote of confidence in HBCUs and in the work of UNCF,” the nonprofit's President and CEO Dr. Michael L. Lomax told The Associated Press in a statement. “It provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity for our member institutions to build permanent assets that will support students and campuses for decades to come.” Lomax said Scott's donation would be used for UNCF's pooled endowment, which aims to establish a $370 million fund — $10 million for each UNCF member HBCU. That fund will be invested and designed to pay out about 4% annually, which will then be divided among the HBCUs to help stabilize their budgets. The broader $1 billion fundraising effort is an attempt to help HBCUs address the funding disparity they face when compared to other colleges and universities. A 2023 study by philanthropic research group Candid and ABFE, a nonprofit that advocates for investments in Black communities, found that the eight Ivy League schools received $5.5 billion from the 1,000 largest US foundations compared to $45 million for the 99 HBCUs in 2019. Since Scott, a novelist who received the bulk of her fortune after divorcing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, signed the Giving Pledge in 2019, promising to donate more than half her wealth, HBCUs have been among her favorite grantees. Though Scott hasn't addressed HBCU donations specifically, she wrote in 2020 that her funding decisions were “driven by a deep belief in the value different backgrounds bring to problem-solving on any issue.” Scott hasn't made any announcements about her giving since she acknowledged $2 billion in gifts in 2024, bringing her total to $19.2 billion. According to Forbes, Scott's net worth is currently around $34 billion. Her unusual donations — which are much larger than most foundations give at one time and carry no restrictions on when they can be used or what they can be used for — financially strengthened the nonprofits that received them, said Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, which studied Scott's giving over three years. “We didn't see the fears people predicted come to pass,” said Buchanan, who disclosed that The Center for Effective Philanthropy received a one-time $10 million grant from Scott. Though some worried that the large gifts would cause the recipients to increase staffing too much or hurt their fundraising efforts, Buchanan said their study of 2,000 nonprofits saw little evidence of that. “This shows that if you carefully vet nonprofits, we can trust them to make good use of funds.” It's a lesson that UNCF hopes other funders will learn, following Scott's example. “We are deeply grateful for MacKenzie Scott's continued support,” Lomax said. “By entrusting UNCF to decide how best to use these funds, she affirms that HBCUs merit investment at this scale and her generosity will strengthen our member institutions and provide pathways to success for tomorrow's changemakers.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of widely trumpeted investigations spearheaded by the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump announced that pregnant women should limit their use of acetaminophen, usually branded as Tylenol in the US or paracetamol elsewhere, which he claimed heightens the risk of autism in children when it is used by pregnant women, an assertion hotly contested by scientists internationally and contradicted by studies. Speaking from the White House, flanked by Kennedy, the president said he had “waited for 20 years for this meeting” and added: “It's not that everything's 100% understood or known, but I think we've made a lot of strides.” But he declared: “Taking Tylenol is not good … All pregnant women should talk to their doctors about limiting the use of this medication while pregnant.” Later, he reinforced the comment, saying: “Don't take Tylenol. He also spoke about upcoming recommendations that vaccines such as the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) shots should be given in a delayed manner or in smaller doses, despite limited evidence of the impacts. And he spoke about the hepatitis B shot, currently given to newborns as part of national vaccine standards, and possible recommendations to delay the first dose – again with limited evidence. Trump, who has frequently voiced his concern over autism, said, along with Kennedy, that the US is suffering from an “epidemic”, and had flagged the major initiative on Sunday at Charlie Kirk's memorial in Arizona. One in 31 children aged eight had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) – a condition denoting communication and social difficulties, along with repetitive behaviors – in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He told Monday's event that the National Institutes of Health had been guilty of focusing “almost solely on political safe and entirely fruitless research” about autism's causes. “One area we are currently examining is vaccines,” said Kennedy, who has frequently floated theories that the increase in the condition's prevalence is fueled by vaccinations. They have also said the causes are predominantly dictated by genetics. Scientists in the US and UK reacted to the Tylenol link sceptically, with British physicians denouncing it as “fearmongering” that risked stigmatising parents of children with autism. Alison Singer, president and founder of the Autism Science Foundation, voiced scathing criticism of the administration's approach – specifically its assertions on Tylenol, which she called “not scientifically based”. “It's misleading to families who deserve clear more factually based information.” “We're uncertain as to why this press conference is being held today. Speaking on a call organized by Defend America Action, a campaign group, Debra Houry, a former chief medical officer and deputy director at the CDC, told journalists: “As of three weeks ago, we hadn't seen evidence that acetaminophen was linked with autism, so it's curious to know how quickly that was developed.” “There are many studies which refute a link, but the most important was a Swedish study of 2.4m births published in 2024 which used actual sibling data and found no relationship between exposure to paracetamol [known in the US as acetaminophen] in utero and subsequent autism, ADHD or intellectual disability,” said Dr Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University US medical practitioners also cast doubt on the putative link with acetaminophen. But then over time, what we saw was [Kennedy] having an increasingly top down approach, essentially ‘my way or the highway,' with no regard again for the scientific processes.” Irva Hertz-Picciotto, an epidemiologist and autism specialist at the University of California, Davis, told the Washington Post that unrealistic expectations could lead to a loss of trust. Bruce Mirken, communications co-chair of Defend Public Health, poured cold water on the announcements in advance. “While we don't know what he will claim today, we do know that Kennedy has a history of false statements related to autism and that the scientific evidence shows there is no ‘autism epidemic',” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Trade Commission's complaint, filed in June 2023, alleges that Amazon knowingly used designs known as “dark patterns” to deceive consumers into signing up for the $139-per-year Prime service during checkouts. The case centers on two main allegations: that Amazon enrolled customers without clear consent through confusing checkout processes, and that it created a deliberately complex cancellation system internally nicknamed “Iliad” – after Homer's epic about the long, arduous Trojan War. The case was heard in a federal court in Seattle by judge John Chun, who is also presiding over a separate FTC case that accuses Amazon of running an illegal monopoly, due to go to trial in 2027. Amazon was allegedly aware of widespread nonconsensual enrollment in Prime but resisted changes that would reduce these unwanted sign-ups because they negatively affected the company's revenue. The FTC alleges that Amazon's checkout process forced customers to navigate confusing interfaces where declining Prime membership required finding small, inconspicuous links while signing up for the service was done through prominent buttons. Crucial information about Prime's price and automatic renewal was often hidden or disclosed in fine print, the FTC also alleges. The lawsuit also targets Amazon's cancellation process, which required customers to navigate what the FTC describes as a “labyrinthine” four-page, six-click, 15-option process to cancel their membership. A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives The company has also argued that it made improvements to its Prime enrollment and cancellation processes and that the allegations are out of date. If the FTC prevails, Amazon could face substantial financial penalties and be required to overhaul its subscription practices under court supervision.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Proposed cuts to Section 8 put 3.3 million people at risk of eviction and homelessness. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. If the federal government has its way, programs that provide housing subsidies to low-income people will soon be cut, and current recipients will have to comply with work rules and time limits on residency. Those who receive Section 8 subsidies are now facing draconian budget-slashing that will put millions in danger of losing their homes. These plans have long been on the right's anti-poor wish list. Among other things, the multifaceted document recommended repeal of the 57-year-old Fair Housing Act, which prohibits landlords and building owners from discriminating against potential renters and home buyers “on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, family status, or national origin.” That particular suggestion was relatively new, but the right has for decades wanted to eliminate the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program, and has advocated for the removal of undocumented people living in mixed-status households from public or subsidized housing. Right-wing politicians have also sought to impose work requirements and time limits on the receipt of Section 8 rental subsidies. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Scott Turner, a former NFL player tapped to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in February, made his contempt for Section 8 subsidies clear, telling a Newsweek reporter that “the taxpayer-funded vacation is over.” Deborah Thrope, deputy director of the National Housing Law Project, told Truthout that after Congress failed to consolidate five federal housing programs, including Section 8, into a single State Rental Assistance Block Grant as requested by the president, the administration changed tactics to pursue a rules change. Announced this summer by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the proposed discretionary rule to allow housing providers to impose work rules and time limits in all federal housing programs is a first step in a federal effort to cut the subsidized housing rolls. “We still don't know the details of what they're proposing or what time limit on residency they're recommending, but we expect it to be between two and five years,” Thrope said. “We also expect the rule to require ‘able-bodied' people under the age of 62 to work at least 20 hours a week if they are not already doing so. It also imposes onerous paperwork on local agencies that will have to monitor compliance.” The public was then given a fixed amount of time to weigh in. After HUD reviewed the comments, final rules were promulgated. This time, she said, it seems possible that Trump will completely undercut this process by declaring a housing emergency under the ill-defined National Emergencies Act of 1976, legislation that gives the president discretionary power to declare a state of emergency and institute changes on virtually any issue. Despite these unknowns, Thrope said housing justice proponents are mobilizing. “Tenants in HUD housing are joining with disability rights advocates, seniors, and families with young children who won't be able to comply with work rules because of ongoing child care issues.” In the short term, she says that both tenants and advocates are keeping a watchful eye on the administration to see what actions they're taking. “This is a war on the poor,” Whitehead said. “We have seen almost every decision this administration has made favor those at the top of the economic ladder, whether it's about education, housing, or immigration.” On top of this, he continued, work rules have been tried before: “The government keeps going back to this tired and faulty playbook.” In 2016, Whitehead says, the program, called Moving to Work (MtW), was expanded to 139 Housing Authorities; by 2022, however, the majority had abandoned MtW. A HUD publication attests to the program's failure: “Literature documenting outcomes of work requirement policies in other federal government programs reveals few, if any, beneficial outcomes and several negative outcomes for program participants.” In studying the impact of work requirements on recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, a cash benefit, HUD admitted that the project had “failed to help families achieve financial independence.” HUD also noted a discernible rise in “deep poverty” among those who lost eligibility for the program. Advocates fear that this outcome will repeat itself if work rules are mandated for Section 8 recipients, a policy that will be exacerbated if it is coupled with time limits on residency. “Even working full-time at 40 hours per week, nearly half of all workers in the U.S. are not paid wages high enough to rent a modest one-bedroom home.” The right is unfazed by these details, expressing views like, “Section 8 shouldn't be a lifestyle, it should be a lifeline,” and trumpeting self-sufficiency while doing nothing to address the need for affordable housing, the lack of jobs paying a living wage, shortages in child care and transportation, or cuts to benefits programs. Moreover, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) found that cuts to rental assistance programs will put 3.3 million people at risk of eviction and homelessness, including 1.7 million children and 2 million households in which at least one adult is already employed. The CBPP further reports that even without these cuts, only about a quarter of those who need rental assistance — and qualify for it — receive it. The upshot is stark: “Even working full-time at 40 hours per week, nearly half of all workers in the U.S. are not paid wages high enough to rent a modest one-bedroom home,” CBPP reported. Janet, a resident of Florence, Kentucky, said Section 8 has been extremely helpful to her daughter and grandchildren. “My 39-year-old daughter has migraines and mood swings but does not receive SSI or Disability benefits,” she told Truthout. Their rent is $859, which is manageable since they also get SNAP and Medicaid, but if they lose their Section 8, all of our lives will be a roller coaster. In an interview with Truthout, Benjamin Finegan of Bozeman Tenants United expressed outrage and frustration at the whole business model of housing provision. Forming tenant unions, Finegan added, is the only way to demand improved conditions and protect against unlawful evictions. “We need to fight for more resources to protect people from displacement and homelessness and build a robust tenant movement,” they said. “Long-term, we need social housing, but in the short term, we need to fight for affordable housing, federal support, and build tenant power.” Asantewaa Nkrumah-Ture, an activist with the Philadelphia Tenants Union, agrees with Finegan and sees the housing justice movement as part of a long continuum of social justice organizing. I can only hope that the housing justice movement continues to do grassroots organizing, political education, research, and lobbying to make the idea of housing as a human right a reality.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power, cut against the mainstream narrative and uplift the movements resisting fascism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, Ukrainian forces hit two Russian Be-12 Chayka amphibious aircraft in occupied Crimea, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) reported on Sept. 22. The Prymary unit has been responsible for a number of successful drone strikes against Russian military assets during the full-scale war. The Soviet-designed Be-12 Chayka (NATO reporting name Mail) is an anti-submarine amphibious aircraft equipped with high-value systems used for detecting and engaging submarines. Separately, Ukrainian forces also struck one Russian Mi-8 helicopter, HUR claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sept. 22 that Russia is ready to respond to any threats as he accused the West of seeking superiority in the nuclear domain. Putin announced that Russia is willing to uphold the treaty's quantitative limits for another year and will decide on any future restrictions according to its own assessment. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty in February 2023 but did not fully withdraw, claiming to continue to uphold its quantitative limits. U.S. President Donald Trump, who met Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, has said he wants to maintain the limits set by the New START agreement. The Kremlin's chief further warned that Russia is "ready to respond to any existing or emerging threats" with "military-technical means" rather than just words. The strikes were aimed at "disrupting Russian occupation plans," the military said as Moscow's forces seek to push forward in Ukraine's east. A Russian S-400 air defense system was also hit in Kaluga Oblast in western Russia, the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces reported separately on Sept. 22. Ukrainian strike drones reportedly struck one S-400 launcher and a radar system after special forces detected the battery overnight on Sept. 5. Russia was reportedly attempting to distribute over 19,000 drones — including the Molniya, Boomerang, Vandal Novgorodsky, and Gorynych models — and related equipment to forces in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast. The attack came after Russian trucks reportedly delivered thousands of mines, grenades, tank rounds, artillery shells, and other ammunition to Russian forces near occupied Bohdanivka in Luhansk Oblast. Fires broke out at an electrical substation in the town of Staroderevyankovskaya in Russia's Krasnodar Krai amid a drone attack overnight on Sept. 22, the regional administration claimed. Emergency services were dispatched to the scene, and no casualties have been reported. The Ukrainian Telegram media channel Exilenova Plus reported that the substation was hit by Ukrainian drones at least five times. Russian air defenses intercepted 114 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 25 over Krasnodar Krai, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed. Russian Telegram channels reported a number of explosions in the region overnight. The Sochi  airport temporarily suspended operations, disrupting over 20 flights. Moscow violated Polish airspace on Sept. 10, prompting Warsaw to shoot down Russian drones over its territory. "There is currently no evidence that any of these drones posed a direct threat. So far, none have been identified as combat drones capable of detonating or causing harm," Tusk said. The search and identification process is ongoing, and the exact number of drones involved has yet to be confirmed, according to Tusk. Polish authorities reported at least 21 violations of their airspace on Sept. 10. In response, NATO invoked Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which calls for consultations when a member state's territorial integrity, political independence, or security is threatened.

If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. The Board of Immigration Appeals has ordered Emmy-award winning journalist Mario Guevara to be deported to El Salvador, a country he fled more than two decades ago after being persecuted for his reporting. The court didn't issue a decision but asked for further briefing. In the meantime, Mario Guevara is still at risk of being sent to El Salvador. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. “This is yet another example of the Trump administration's pervasive attempts to stifle journalists and media from doing honest reporting or speaking unfavorably about the administration,” State Sen. Josh McLaurin (D) said in a statement. “This is one of the most dangerous periods for free speech in American history.” “In a democracy, journalists should not be arrested for exercising their constitutional rights to report the news.” If he gets to the road, lock his a** up. He's been warned multiple times,” according to his habeas petition. Although all charges were dropped, he has remained in ICE custody. The judge who granted Guevara bond in July wrote that he “has a history of following the laws of the United States, as he legally entered the U.S. with a B1 visa, he has employment authorization and a social security number so that he can legally work in the United States, and he has a history of paying his taxes.” Prosecutors successfully obtained a stay, or pause, of the bond decision. The government has argued that Guevara “is a danger to the community because Mr. Guevara had ‘on five separate occasions … recorded or live streamed' law enforcement officers and ‘post[ed] videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers,'” as per Guevara's petition. Guevero told The Altanta-Journal Constitution in a phone interview that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is retaliating against him because, “I was following them. I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” He said while he's been locked up, some officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. SPJ said in a statement that the decision is “a chilling signal to every reporter in this country: If your coverage makes the government uncomfortable, you could be silenced.” “Deporting him under these circumstances would undermine the First Amendment, erode public trust and set a dangerous precedent for all who believe in a free press.” For much of that time he has been held in solitary confinement. He's experienced panic attacks and sunk into a depression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear a rush appeal that will decide whether President Donald Trump acted lawfully as he has wrested control of independent federal agencies by firing the board members who led them. Since retaking power in February, Trump has sought to upend a decades old system that gives some agencies within the government a degree of independence to do their work without political considerations. The court's three liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented from that decision. The court's majority, Kagan wrote, “may be raring” to invalidate for-cause removal requirements approved by Congress. But until it does, she wrote, a 1935 precedent on that issue should control. “Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars,” she wrote, echoing a point she made earlier in the year in a similar case. In a separate order Monday, the court declined to hear arguments in two related cases – one dealing with Cathy Harris, former chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal firings and can reinstate wrongly terminated workers, and another focused on Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board. The court's moves Monday squarely queued up the question of whether a 1935 precedent, Humphrey's Executor v. US, should be overturned. It was Trump himself who first placed Slaughter on the FTC in 2018. Former President Joe Biden nominated her for a second term, and the Senate confirmed her without opposition last year. The agency enforces anti-trust and consumer protection laws. A federal district court ordered Slaughter's reinstatement in July and an appeals court in Washington, DC, ultimately declined to overturn that ruling. In a series of recent emergency orders, the court has allowed Trump – ever eager to remove dissenting voices from power – to fire leaders of independent agencies who were appointed by Biden. Humphrey's – a case that dealt directly with the president's ability to fire a member of the FTC – allowed Congress to require presidents to show cause – before dismissing board members overseeing independent agencies. Overturning that ruling would give presidents immense power to sweep away from service officials who enforce anti-trust laws, labor rules and disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies. The Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 supermajority, has signaled skepticism in recent years about the for-cause protections Congress sometimes includes for executive branch officials. But the court's 5-4 decision left Humphrey's in place, with Roberts noting that it applied only to independent agencies led a by a single director rather than multi-member boards. “In a future case,” Thomas wrote, “I would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.” The Humphrey's Executor case dates to President Franklin Roosevelt, who fired a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission in 1933 who was appointed by President Herbert Hoover. William Humphrey continued to argue he was a member of the commission until his death in 1934. “It is quite evident,” the court wrote then, “that one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another cannot be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter's will.” This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

LONDON, September 22. /TASS/. The United States plans to impose additional sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC), extending restrictions beyond individuals to the organization itself, Reuters reported, citing sources.

According to the report, the move has been under discussion within the US government, though the exact date of the announcement remains unclear.

Reuters said ICC officials have already held emergency meetings with representatives of member states to assess the potential consequences of such comprehensive measures. The sanctions could affect the court's ability to pay staff and restrict access to bank accounts and computer software at ICC offices.</p>

Speaking to reporters at a press briefing, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt rejected the reports that Homan had accepted such a payment. “The White House and the president stand by Tom Homan 100% because he did absolutely nothing wrong,” Leavitt said. She said that FBI agents and prosecutors found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing by Homan. On Sunday, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent last year in a since-closed U.S. Justice Department bribery investigation. Trump's border czar Tom Homan accepted $50,000 in bribery sting operation, sources say Homan rejected the claims during an appearance on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle show, saying he “did nothing criminal” or illegal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is pressing the U.N. civil aviation agency to lift sanctions dealing with the shipment of aircraft parts and overflights, warning they allegedly threaten air safety, Reuters reported on Sept. 22, citing its undisclosed source and working papers. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, international sanctions have restricted Russian airlines' access to Western-made spare parts, hampering the country's ability to maintain and repair its commercial aircraft fleet. Moscow is now seeking to negotiate the easing of those limitations, arguing they pose a risk to flight safety, the source told Reuters. Russia submitted its request to ICAO after the U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian state carrier Belavia, measures that had also been imposed in response to Russia's war against Ukraine. According to working papers seen by Reuters, Russia claimed the sanctions violate international aviation rules. The source added that much of Russia's Boeing and Airbus fleet is aging, and that some replacement parts are now only available through unofficial "gray" market channels. "If in the near future a Russian Boeing or Airbus crashes and people die - what then? In any case, it will be blamed on sanctions," the source said. Russia's aviation sector has also been disrupted by frequent Ukrainian attacks, which have forced airports in regions within range of Ukrainian drones to delay or cancel flights. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. All flights at Denmark's Copenhagen Airport were halted after police reported 2-3 large drones in the area. "There is currently no evidence that any of these drones posed a direct threat. So far, none have been identified as combat drones capable of detonating or causing harm," Donald Tusk said. The Sept. 26 meeting, convened by EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius, will include representatives from seven EU states — Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria — along with Ukraine. The latest measures will target two Russian energy giants, Rosneft and Gazprom, but neither company plays a significant role in supplying oil via the Druzhba pipeline, according to European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. Reuters reported on Sept. 22 that Russia is pressing the U.N. civil aviation agency to lift sanctions on the shipment of aircraft parts and overflights, warning that they allegedly threaten air safety. The agency cited an undisclosed source and working papers. Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said that no hostile activity was observed near the Ukrainian border either during or after the drills.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is fully ready to respond to threats with force, President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of the Russian Security Council. He also noted that Russia is prepared to continue observing the core tenets of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) for one year after it expires. The West's destructive actions have "significantly undermined the foundation of constructive relations and practical cooperation between nuclear powers." The system of agreements between Russia and the US on nuclear and strategic defensive weapons "has been almost entirely dismantled." The destructive actions of the West are aimed at "undermining global parity, at gaining, trying to gain, absolute, overwhelming superiority." Russia "prefers and prioritizes political and diplomatic methods of maintaining international peace based on the principles of equal rights, indivisible security, and mutual respect for interests." Russia is prepared to respond to any strategic threats "not with words but with military and technological measures." Russia is confident in the "reliability and effectiveness" of its deterrent forces. Russia "is not interested in further escalating tensions or fueling an arms race." Russia would like to preserve the status quo established by the New START Treaty "to avoid provoking a further strategic arms race and to ensure an appropriate level of predictability and restraint." After the treaty's expiration, Russia is ready to continue "adhering to the core quantitative restrictions" for one year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia and Ukraine swapped accusations of deadly drone strikes on civilian areas of their countries Monday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky anticipated “a very intense week” of diplomacy at the UN General Assembly in New York, where the Security Council was expected to discuss the more than three-year war. Additionally, international concerns have mounted recently that the fighting could spread beyond Ukraine's borders as European countries rebuked Russia for what they said were provocations. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media that Russia was testing NATO's political and military response and aiming to reduce Western support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources toward the defence of alliance countries. Russia was doing just enough not to cross a red line, but things could still spiral, he added. NATO leaders express alarm over growing Russian hostility after drone incursion in Poland Zelensky said he also planned to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose drive for a peace deal after taking office in January has yielded no progress. He said that over the past week Russia fired more than 1,500 strike drones, 1,280 glide bombs and 50 missiles of various types at Ukraine. More than 132,000 foreign components were found in those weapons from dozens of countries, he said. Local officials take pictures inside a school building that was damaged on Sunday in what local authorities called a Ukrainian drone attack, in the town of Foros, Crimea.Alexey Pavlishak/Reuters Meanwhile, at least seven Russian aircraft bombarded the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing three people and wounding two others, according to regional administration head Ivan Fedorov. Residential buildings, shopping malls, a parking lot and “critical infrastructure” were targeted, he said. “None of the sites had anything to do with military infrastructure,” Fedorov said. The Ukrainian air force said it stopped 132 out of 141 strike and decoy drones launched by Russian forces overnight. The Moscow-appointed head of Ukraine's Russia-occupied Crimea peninsula, Sergei Aksyonov, said three people were killed and 16 others were wounded late Sunday by Ukrainian drones that struck the popular vacation resort of Foros. In Russia's Belgorod border region, three people were killed and another 10 were wounded by Ukrainian drone attacks on Sunday, according to the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. The Defence Ministry said 114 Ukrainian drones were downed early Monday over several Russian regions. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maga figures portrayed the slain activist as a martyr during emotional memorial service If the assassination of Charlie Kirk was an attempt to silence American conservatives, then his memorial service marked a stunning repudiation of that plan. Thousands more could not get in, the gargantuan stadium, normally home to American football games or hosting A-list pop stars, quickly filled to its capacity of 63,400. Kirk was killed by an assassin's bullet 11 days ago, shot in the throat as he addressed students at a college campus in Utah. You have made him immortal,” Stephen Miller, a long-time aide to Mr Trump, declared from the lectern equipped with bulletproof glass, set up on stage. “You have immortalised Charlie Kirk, and now millions will carry on his legacy. “And we will devote the rest of our lives to finishing the causes for which Charlie gave his last measure of devotion,” Mr Miller said. Erika Kirk, the widow of the murdered activist, was less fiery, but nonetheless the stadium was silent, taking a collective intake of breath as she pledged to continue her husband's work – and said she forgave his assassin. “I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it's what Charlie would do,” she said through tears, the cavernous stadium so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Kirk was gone, but Turning Point USA, the activist movement he built, which, by the time of his death, had a presence on hundreds of college campuses, would endure. Mrs Kirk, who wore a white suit and displayed a crucifix around her neck, recalled forcing herself to see the murdered body of her husband. “Charlie didn't suffer”, she had realised, and the crowd saw it too. Several times she would smile as she recalled her husband's habits – the love notes they exchanged – and look into the distance. At other points, her face would crumple and she dabbed at her eyes, before looking down, steeling herself and pushing on. When Mrs Kirk reappeared on stage after Donald Trump gave the closing speech, she appeared to be physically exhausted. The newly appointed head of Turning Point repeatedly embraced Mr Trump, who paid tribute to Kirk as a “giant of his generation”, clinging to the president and burying her head in his shoulder. Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point, said the turnout from fans and America's most powerful figures showed the impact of Kirk's work and how it had been spurred on by his death. He told The Telegraph: “Had there not been the Turning Point USA ecosystem, this would be nothing but mourning and a massive gaping hole. “The opposite has happened … We're seeing millions of Charlie Kirks rising up across all 50 states, and even internationally.” Vigils for the slain influencer have taken place all over the world, from South Korea to Spain, Australia and London, a fact also pointed out by Mr Trump. Mr Trump was pictured shaking hands with Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire and, at one time his closest political ally, with whom he fell out spectacularly earlier this year. At one point during the feud, Mr Musk accused his former boss of being named in government documents relating to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Vance said those who celebrated Kirk's killing should lose their jobs, while Mr Rubio and Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, issued penalties for foreign nationals and US troops who did the same. Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night talk show host, was suspended on Wednesday hours after the government threatened to cancel broadcasting licenses because of comments he made about Kirk's killing. Republicans ranging from former George W Bush adviser Karl Rove to Texas senator Ted Cruz and conservative commentator Tucker Carlson have warned using Kirk's death to target political rivals could chip away at civil liberties and backfire. That hatchet appeared to be at least temporarily buried on Sunday. Carlson, who made a speech paying tribute to Kirk, concentrated his remarks on the theme of repentance and avoided antagonising Mr Trump, who was watching nearby. How long that uneasy truce will last is unclear. We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil.” Confiscated items piled up on tables run by security outside. Joshua Runkles, reportedly a former deputy sheriff in Idaho, claimed he was providing private security and presented outdated law enforcement credentials. Authorities are still attempting to work out what precisely he was doing. Inside the arena, where sniffer dogs patrolled with their handlers, a bulletproof screen was set up at the lectern where Mr Trump and other senior political paid tribute to Kirk. “This is the most high-profile event in probably 30 years,” Mr Bowyer said. Many of the attendees would not have known Kirk personally: but they were devotees of his viral videos, in which he would show up at colleges and challenge students to debates, beating the drum for his muscular brand of conservatism. Holding an enormous American flag aloft on a pole, Mr Rehweld – a dual American and Canadian citizen – had travelled from British Columbia all the way to Arizona. He declared Jesus Christ as lord,” he told The Telegraph, calling Kirk a “very important figure in the common-sense conservative world” whose influence would live on after his death.</p>
