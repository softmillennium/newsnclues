Fritz, 27, has opened up about his introverted ways early in his career—describing himself as “shy in person” and dealing with “pretty bad social anxiety”—and later embraced the label when doing the "Suspect Challenge" Tik Tok trend with Riddle last year.“Suspect has such bad social anxiety he can't order his own drink at Starbucks,” teased Riddle.The post got high marks from fans on Reddit, who called the move a “green flag” and “introvert at the club coded.”The current world No. 5 in the ATP rankings, Fritz will aim for more memeable moments—along with some low-key celebrations—this fall when he plays for the chance to qualify for a third ATP Finals berth, having finished runner-up at the season-ending championships in 2024. “Suspect has such bad social anxiety he can't order his own drink at Starbucks,” teased Riddle.The post got high marks from fans on Reddit, who called the move a “green flag” and “introvert at the club coded.”The current world No. 5 in the ATP rankings, Fritz will aim for more memeable moments—along with some low-key celebrations—this fall when he plays for the chance to qualify for a third ATP Finals berth, having finished runner-up at the season-ending championships in 2024. 5 in the ATP rankings, Fritz will aim for more memeable moments—along with some low-key celebrations—this fall when he plays for the chance to qualify for a third ATP Finals berth, having finished runner-up at the season-ending championships in 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniel Rincon glanced up from the baseline and suddenly froze. 1 Nadal watching, although the match was almost halfway over, so Rincon “didn't have too much time to think about it”. Rincon's triumph at his stomping grounds — with friends, family and other supporters (like Rafa!) “It was the best week of my life, by far. I really cannot compare it to anything else,” said the No. “I thought about how it could be before the final, or the feelings of winning there, but it was even more than I imagined. Both of Rincon's Challenger triumphs have featured memorable moments. He battled through the opening rounds with only three racquets, borrowed strings and grips. “I was going with a little bag on court, I was looking like an amateur player going to practise on a Sunday,” Rincon said at the time. “Just with three t-shirts and going to do laundry every day.” “In the second round, I knew he was coming,” Rincon said. So the first day, I was basically looking for him.” Rincon's connection to the Rafa Nadal Academy runs deep. He first arrived at the state-of-the-art facility as a 16-year-old in September 2019. The Manacor Challenger final was being played on his first day, so it is fitting he would one day claim a special victory at the same event.

US Open finalist Amanda Anisimova leads the WTA 500's 28-player singles field, and she'll be joined by Mirra Andreeva, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, China's Qinwen Zheng and Elena Rybakina. Other notable names in the draw include Elina Svitolina, Karolina Muchova, Emma Navarro and Paula Badosa. Played on outdoor hard courts, the Ningbo Open was founded in 2010. It became a WTA 125 event in 2013, and last year was elevated to the 500 level. Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka leads the field, and she'll be joined by Elise Mertens, former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez, Linda Noskova and 17-year-old Iva Jovic, who won in Guadalajara this past weekend to become the youngest champion on the Hologic WTA Tour this year. Other notable names in the Osaka field include French Open semifinalist Lois Boisson, American Hailey Baptiste, former Top 5 player Maria Sakkari, Filipina sensation Alexandra Eala and American Peyton Stearns. Also known as the Japan's Women Open, this tournament became a WTA event in 2009. Prior to that, both women and men competed in the joint Japan Open. Suzan Lamens -- a main-draw alternate this year -- is the defending champion in Osaka. She defeated Australian Kimberly Birrell (also a main-draw alternate) in the final. Ena Shibahara and Laura Siegemund are the defending doubles champions.

In a dominant performance against Wu, Bublik fired 19 aces past the home favourite to reach the championship match after 61 minutes. Clearly he was a little tired from yesterday. It is never easy to play someone from a specific region at home," Bublik said. Bublik is 30-17 on the season and is on course for a career-best season, having earned a previous 35 wins in 2021, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Bublik is up three spots to 12th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will look to finish the season strongly in a bid to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. He will meet French qualifier Valentin Royer in the championship match on Tuesday. Royer continued his breakthrough week with a 6-3, 6-2 triumph against countryman Corentin Moutet. The 24-year-old was competing in his first tour-level semi-final and is the fourth qualifier to reach an ATP Tour final this year. Royer struck 15 winners and committed 13 unforced errors against Moutet and dealt with the lefty's court craft to seal victory in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. 75 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career-high on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova. Another key storyline will be the return to action of hometown hero Zheng Qinwen, playing her first tournament since undergoing right elbow surgery in July. 7 seed, has not competed since her first-round exit at Wimbledon to Katerina Siniakova. She will open against either Suzan Lamens, a quarterfinalist last week in Seoul, or compatriot Wang Yafan. Swiatek will start against either Yulia Putintseva or wild card Yuan Yue, while Gauff will face either Kamilla Rakhimova or Lucia Bronzetti. Two former major champions are unseeded threats in the draw as they also make their way back from injury layoffs. Barbora Krejcikova takes on Anna Blinkova in her opener, with the winner to play Seoul finalist and No. Meanwhile, Bianca Andreescu returns to action for the first time since injuring her ankle in Montreal a month ago. Australian Open champion Madison Keys joined US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka on the sidelines, withdrawing from the tournament on Monday due to injury. [1] Iga Swiatek vs. [16] Emma Navarro[12] Naomi Osaka vs. [5] Jessica Pegula[4] Mirra Andreeva vs. [14] Daria Kasatkina[10] Clara Tauson vs. [7] Zheng Qinwen[6] Jasmine Paolini vs. [11] Elina Svitolina[13] Karolina Muchova vs. [3] Amanda Anisimova[8] Elena Rybakina vs. [9] Ekaterina Alexandrova[15] Belinda Bencic vs. [2] Coco Gauff Here's how the draw breaks down by quarter: 28 seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round, No. 16 seed Emma Navarro in the fourth round and No. The player she defeated in that year's final, No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu, who will be making her tournament debut, in the third round; she currently owns a 2-1 head-to-head lead over the Briton, including 2-0 on hard courts. Whoever emerges from that tussle could face either 2019 champion Naomi Osaka, the No. First-round matches to watch: Ann Li vs. Camila Osorio, Rebecca Sramkova vs. Elena-Gabriela Ruse After winning back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, Mirra Andreeva solidified her Top 5 status by compiling a 31-8 record this year through Roland Garros. 4 seed in Beijing, where she was a quarterfinalist last year, Andreeva will open against either wild card Zhu Lin or a qualifier. She'll have to navigate a section that includes big-hitting No. 29 seed Dayana Yastremska in a potential third round. In the last 16, Andreeva could face either No. 14 seed Daria Kasatkina or her regular doubles partner, No. Shnaider could face a tricky opener against fast-rising 19-year-old Maya Joint, who made her first career WTA 500 semifinal last week in Seoul. Zheng has a mixed record against the young talents in her section. This time last year, the 19-year-old Canadian was ranked No. Mboko will bid to notch her first win since lifting the Montreal trophy against either Siniakova or Anastasia Potapova. First-round matches to watch: Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. Jaqueline Cristian, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [WC] Wei Sijia, Katerina Siniakova vs. Anastasia Potapova, Suzan Lamens vs. [SR] Wang Yafan Fresh off leading Italy to a successful defense of their Billie Jean King Cup title last week, No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini enters Beijing on a high. She could face a tricky opponent off the bat, though -- 2018 runner-up Anastasija Sevastova, whom she barely escaped in three sets at Wimbledon. 221, but since returning from an ACL injury in April the Latvian has already scored wins over Pegula and Jelena Ostapenko. Paolini's route doesn't get any easier after that. Kenin is searching for some form -- the 2020 Australian Open champion hasn't won back-to-back main-draw matches since Roland Garros -- but throughout her career has a track record of hitting her hot streaks with little warning. In the last 16, Paolini could resume her rivalry with No. 11 Elina Svitolina -- a matchup that has provided some thrilling contests this year. The American will play her first match as a Top 5 player against either Hailey Baptiste or Katie Boulter, and is projected to face home favorite and No. A potential fourth-round meeting between Anisimova and No. 13 seed Karolina Muchova, last year's runner-up, could make for a fascinating stylistic clash. The pair have only played once previously, with Anisimova advancing via retirement at Roland Garros 2022. First-round matches to watch: Magda Linette vs. [SR] Bianca Andreescu, Tatjana Maria vs. Marie Bouzkova, Katie Boulter vs. Hailey Baptiste Gauff's up-and-down form in 2025 has seen the American at her gritty best during the clay swing, which culminated in her second major title at Roland Garros -- but also fail to reach a final on any other surface, with her service yips returning to afflict her during the North American hard court swing. 25 seed Leylah Fernandez, whom she has a 2-0 head-to-head lead over, in the third round. In the last 16, Gauff could then meet either No. Since reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, Bencic's record is just 2-3, while Ostapenko has won just three out of nine matches since Roland Garros. 8 seed Elena Rybakina has landed in a section full of dangerous opponents. The big-serving Kazakhstani will have to be prepared to take on a barrage of variety in her opener against either Wimbledon quarterfinalist Laura Siegemund or Caty McNally, two players with net-rushing instincts and every shot in the book. Rybakina is 6-1 overall against Siegemund, but was forced to retire in her only previous meeting with McNally. 32 seed spot here after capturing her first WTA title in Guadalajara two weeks ago. Despite Jovic's inexperience -- Beijing will be just her 11th tour-level event -- this is already a familiar matchup for her; Rybakina defeated her in straight sets at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros this year. Two-time major champion Krejcikova's return from a back injury this year has been riveting to watch -- not least due to the number of unlikely comebacks the Czech has pulled off. Since June, she's won from match points down on four separate occasions, the latest of those being an escape from 6-4, 5-2 down against Raducanu last week in Seoul. If Krejcikova's second-round clash against Alexandrova happens, it could be one to circle; with a 41-20 record so far, Alexandrova is quietly putting together a career-best season, and the 30-year-old could be eyeing a Top 10 debut in the closing two months. Alexandrova has a 3-2 head-to-head advantage over Krejcikova, though they have not played since 2021. Whoever emerges from that match could have to face either No. 20 seed Elise Mertens or McCartney Kessler -- both two-time titlists this year -- in order to reach a potential last-16 meeting with Rybakina. First-round matches to watch: Laura Siegemund vs. Caty McNally, Barbora Krejcikova vs. Anna Blinkova, Ashlyn Krueger vs. Maria Sakkari Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova.</p>

Paolini rallied to win her singles match and teamed up with Sara Errani for the decisive doubles victory. Italy advanced to the Billie Jean King Cup final for the third consecutive year after its doubles pair secured a decisive victory to defeat first-time semifinalist Ukraine 2-1 on Friday. Jasmine Paolini played a starring role for the Italians, rallying to win her singles match before teaming with Sara Errani to clinch the doubles point. 26 Marta Kostyuk gave Ukraine a strong start, defeating Elisabetta Cocciaretto 6-2, 6-3. The 23-year-old Ukrainian did not face a single break point and converted four of eight chances on Cocciaretto's serve. Svitolina, who led their head-to-head 2-0, appeared headed for another victory after building a 6-3, 4-2 lead. But Paolini stormed back, earning her sixth win in her last seven Billie Jean King Cup matches to level the tie at 1-1. Svitolina, seeking a record-extending 19th victory for Ukraine in the competition, was left disappointed as her team's dream of reaching its first final was put on hold. Paolini returns with Errani to seal the final berth They faced Kostyuk and Lyudmyla Kichenok, breaking early for a 3-0 lead before closing out the first set 6-2. In the other semifinal on Saturday, 18-time champion United States will meet Great Britain, which is seeking its first Billie Jean King Cup title. The Americans advanced with a 2-1 win over Kazakhstan, clinched by Jessica Pegula and Taylor Townsend in doubles. Britain moved through after Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter won singles matches in straight sets against Japan. Italy secured a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup final by defeating Ukraine 2-1, with Jasmine Paolini leading the charge. Paolini rallied to win her singles match and teamed up with Sara Errani for the decisive doubles victory.</p>

At 19 years old, Joao Fonseca scored a crucial victory in his Laver Cup debut, defeating Flavio Cobolli in straight sets to prevent a Team Europe blowout on Day 1. Fritz took that momentum into Days 2 and 3, scoring back-to-back victories over Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev to help lead Team World to its third Laver Cup victory.“Just the energy from the team, it feels…the moments of winning feel so much better and the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,” Fritz explained on court. “Just the energy from the team, it feels…the moments of winning feel so much better and the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,” Fritz explained on court. 1 Andre Agassi stepped into the role as Captain, taking over for John McEnroe after the Hall of Famer ended a seven-year tenure in 2024.“Seeing these guys on the bench, getting pumped up, seeing a legend of the sport like Andre jumping out of his seat, cheering for me,” Fritz said. “It's impossible not to be so fired up and just give it everything you have every point.”Suffice to say Team World—Fonseca included—will have plenty to celebrate after pulling off a significant upset this weekend. “Seeing these guys on the bench, getting pumped up, seeing a legend of the sport like Andre jumping out of his seat, cheering for me,” Fritz said. “It's impossible not to be so fired up and just give it everything you have every point.”Suffice to say Team World—Fonseca included—will have plenty to celebrate after pulling off a significant upset this weekend.</p>

Playing nearly as well as he did last night when he beat Carlos Alcaraz, Fritz broke Zverev in the German's opening service game and, save for a hiccup when he served at 4-3 in the second set, was quite dominant, winning 79 percent of his first serve points and 70 percent on his second. In the end, though, Fritz rapidly took charge of the second set tiebreaker, a beautiful backhand topspin lob winner taking him to a 3-0 lead. Fritz closed it out on Team World's first championship point with a deft backhand volley winner. Fritz's victory upped his head-to-head record versus Zverev to 9-5, including the last six in a row. It also helped turn around what had been a frustrating September for the 27-year-old American. But here in San Francisco, Fritz earned two victories that thoroughly revealed how impressively he can compete.</p>
