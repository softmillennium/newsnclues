                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mass General Brigham study also finds link to violent behaviors such as carrying a weapon, highlighting the vicious cycle between lack of sleep and violence. New research led by Mass General Brigham researchers reveals an association between insufficient sleep and the witnessing of neighborhood violence by adolescents. Based on nationwide survey data from more than 40,000 teenagers, the study also showed that individuals who slept less than the recommended 8-10 hours per night were more likely to engage in violent behaviors, such as carrying weapons or fighting. This is one of the first studies to connect community violence with how much teenagers actually sleep. It's a reminder that sleep isn't just an individual health habit, it's also shaped by the safety and stability of the communities our kids live in." Cornelia Griggs, MD, first author, pediatric surgeon and critical care specialist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Surgery In the survey, respondents were asked questions, including how many hours of sleep they get on an average school night, whether they have ever witnessed violence in their neighborhood, and whether they have carried weapons or been in a physical fight in the past 30 days. Altogether, the researchers analyzed surveys from 44,161 young adults aged 14-19 years old. More than three-quarters of respondents (77%) reported getting insufficient sleep on an average school night (defined as less than eight hours for older children and adolescents), and 10% reported getting four hours of sleep or less. Individuals who reported getting insufficient sleep were more likely to report having witnessed someone getting physically attacked, beaten, stabbed, or shot in their neighborhood, and this association became stronger with each additional hour of sleep lost. For individuals who slept four hours or less, the odds of having been exposed to violence increased nearly threefold. Getting insufficient sleep was also strongly linked to higher odds of violent behaviors such as carrying a weapon, getting into physical fights, being threatened or injured at school, and skipping school due to feeling unsafe. "This study sheds light on how insufficient sleep can contribute to cycles of violence," said senior author Rebecca Robbins, PhD, a sleep researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders. "Future efforts should include advocacy around noise reduction and reducing nighttime violence, which could promote healthier sleep habits in communities that are disproportionately impacted by violence." "One possible explanation for this association is that adolescents with longer sleep duration may be experiencing underlying conditions such as depression, anxiety, or sleep disorders," said Robbins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a collaboration between Turun yliopisto and the University of Turku, researchers led by Birgitta Paranko and Lauri Nummenmaa explored the immediate effects of bullying on the brain. As reported in their JNeurosci paper, the researchers measured neural and attentional responses while tweens (aged 11 to 14) and adults watched first-person videos of either people being bullied or more positive social interactions. For participants of all ages, bullying triggered distressful alarm states, activating social and emotional brain networks as well as autonomic threat response systems. Measuring eye-tracking responses and pupil sizes in a separate group of adults during video viewing supported these findings, showing stronger emotional and attentional responses to bullying than other social interactions. The researchers also discovered that these neural responses and alarm states were linked to viewers having previous real-life experiences being victims of bullying. In sum, says Nummenmaa, "We mapped distress pathways in the brain that may be promptly engaged when someone gets bullied, and showed that the continuous alarm state is hazardous for both mental and somatic health due to the increased autonomic activation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have created a low-cost gluten sensor that combines lateral flow strips with smartphone imaging, exposing hidden contamination in everyday foods from fries to salads and offering peace of mind to millions on gluten-free diets. Study: Empowering Gliadin Detection: A Visible-Code Semiquantitative Lateral Flow System for Rapid and Reliable Results. Wheat bread has been a central part of the human diet for centuries. Yet today, gluten, the main wheat protein, is suspected of triggering potentially serious food reactions. This means the need to test foods for gluten in such individuals. A recent paper published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry presents a newly developed gluten detection system that could revolutionize food analysis. These allergies cost about $25 billion in healthcare alone. Tests are needed to accurately identify allergen-containing foods, especially since those with food allergies tend to be more food-insecure. Wheat-related conditions include celiac disease (an autoimmune disorder, not a classic allergy) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Gluten-related immune reactions are triggered primarily by the gliadin component of this wheat protein. Being largely insoluble, gliadin precipitates to form fibers in the presence of glutenin, increasing the chances of cross-contamination and making it difficult to detect. Patients with celiac disease often cannot eat out safely or have a limited range of safe foods. Gluten testing based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or electrochemical sensors is typically costly and complex. This prompted the current study, which sought to develop a reliable yet simple test. The new system, termed LEO (lateral flow enhanced by optical imaging), combines lateral flow assays with smartphone-based image analysis aided by Internet of Things technology. Lateral flow assays are tests that detect the presence of a target substance in a liquid sample. They are used widely to detect pesticides, cancer-related biochemicals, and food allergens. However, they provide only qualitative results and have mediocre accuracy. This innovative next-generation test strip combines competitive and sandwich detection methods. Absence of the O line indicates an invalid test. The presence of gliadin <5 ppm causes both O and E to appear. Between 5 and 10 ppm, all three lines appear. If the O line alone is seen, it indicates that both E and L lines have disappeared due to the hook effect. This portable system can tell whether the sample contains gliadin in less than three minutes, since it extracts gliadin using an ionic liquid. Its detection limits of 5–10 ppm are well below the 20 ppm threshold that the Food and Drug Administration has for such tests. The LEO assay results agreed well with those obtained by conventional ELISA testing, but took less than three minutes compared to three hours for ELISA. The test system correctly detected and quantified gliadin in the sample across a range of up to 40 ppm concentrations. It was highly specific for gluten even when milk was present, since only wheat-containing samples produced signals. The gluten recovery rate was 100% in spiked rice noodle tests, showing efficient extraction under controlled conditions. The LEO interface, coupled with a smartphone, can create a shareable map of local restaurants serving gluten-free food. Real-world tests of supposedly gluten-free dishes on a restaurant menu confirmed the high accuracy. The foods tested include burgers, salads with dressing, pizza, and beer. French fries were an exception, showing significant cross-contamination from the fryers used. The salads contained gluten, probably because of cross-contamination during mixing in bowls that previously held croutons or perhaps due to the dressing. In addition, both LEO and another widely used strip-based antibody assay were used to compare commercial food products like Ferrero or M&M's chocolate, bagels, Lay's potato crisps, or Lotus Biscoff Spread. In contrast to LEO, the other strip test requires a prepared sample, a buffer that needs to be refrigerated, and more time. The gluten levels ranged between 0 and >20 ppm. Gliadin levels in some foods were below the ELISA detection threshold but were picked up by LEO. “With its fast, accurate results and user-friendly design, LEO supports safer food choices for individuals with celiac disease and is suitable for personal, clinical, industrial, and regulatory use.” Compared to other gluten tests, it can reduce the risk of missed detections from the hook effect, is cost-effective at <$10 per test, and needs no extra equipment. Ruling out contamination can help people with dietary restrictions avoid accidental, potentially dangerous exposures. Its adaptability could allow it to detect other compounds, including nucleic acids and toxins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UK study reveals that simply reordering hospital meal options, without changing recipes, may deliver significant health and climate gains. Study: Strategic menu optimization could reduce carbon emissions and saturated fat consumption: a simulation modelling study of UK hospital inpatient meals. A recent study in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of B: Biological Sciences examined the impact of strategic menu optimization on saturated fat consumption and carbon emissions in an inpatient environment. The study used simulation to predict whether strategic menu swaps in a hospital inpatient setting could reduce carbon emissions and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake. Efforts to change food consumption behavior via legislation may not last permanently, despite some studies showing that they promote environmentally sustainable and healthy food choices. Moreover, in specific settings (e.g., hospitals), traditional interventions may not be practical or appropriate, as patients are more concerned with enjoying food than its sustainability. One study under the Transforming UK Food Systems (TUKFS) Programme noted reductions in carbon footprint and SFA intake of about 31% and 6%, respectively, by strategically designing menus in a university hall of residence. This suggests that there could be benefits across other sectors beyond a university setting. Diners' menu choices affect nutritional and environmental outcomes, depending on both the menu options selected and those not selected. Competition between menu items matters, and by altering the choice architecture, one can influence the frequency of selection of each dish and thereby influence target outcome variables (e.g., carbon footprint). Researchers convenience-sampled NHS hospitals across the 12 UK regions that made their weekly inpatient dining menus publicly available. Since hospitals did not publish recipe-level data, the carbon footprint and SFA content were calculated using ingredient lists from BBC Good Food recipes and the Klimato tool. All dishes served at a mealtime on weekdays were extracted, with the first three dishes available daily across all sites making up a baseline dataset. Furthermore, food preference data from 50 online survey participants recruited via Prolific and matched by region were collected for each hospital because food choices can differ across individuals and areas. The optimizing approach generated a single menu that minimized carbon footprint and SFA intake across 50 people across 5 days of the week, rather than at an individual level. The weekly menu, i.e., five groups of three dishes, formed a total of 1,401,400 unique combinations, which was reduced to 113,400 after applying a requirement that at least one vegetarian dish be offered daily. Across these combinations, for each participant, identification was done for the five dishes that they would most likely choose in a week. These results were then combined, for each site, to compute the average weekly SFA consumption for all participants and the carbon footprint. The menu optimization was suitable for 11 out of 12 hospitals. For the remaining sites, while targeting a reduction in carbon footprint as the sole objective, a predicted reduction of 12.7–29.3% was achieved. The corresponding reductions for SFA consumption were between 6.5% and 31.5%. The results were broadly similar for carbon footprint and SFA intake when they were minimized jointly, i.e., 9.1 to 29.3% and 5.0 to 26.5%, respectively. There was considerable variation across hospital sites in the potential for reductions, with some menus showing much greater opportunities to cut carbon emissions and saturated fat than others. In sum, simulation modelling showed that strategic menu swapping has the potential to reduce SFA consumption and food carbon footprint. The main strength of this approach is that it can be simultaneously applied with other strategies based on reformulation. Additionally, hospitals could choose other variables to minimize, such as sugar or salt consumption, or maximize variables like fibre intake. Finally, since no meal needs to be removed from the menu, caterers do not have to change their recipes. The key limitation of the current study is that the hospital selection might not have been representative, as only those hospitals were chosen that made their menus publicly available. Furthermore, the participant sample recruited was younger on average than typical hospital inpatients. The authors emphasized that these are early-stage estimates, and real-world implementation is premature until further trials are conducted. Practical challenges such as logistics, costs, and stakeholder acceptance must be addressed before wider rollout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Basic to Breakthrough series chronicles how investments from the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science at our National Laboratories have led to new technologies that are changing our world. There, he had access to the discovery science expertise and world-class research facilities at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). He used these resources to develop and test his breakthrough: the world's first long-acting antibacterial adhesive resin for dental restorations. "My idea was to develop dental adhesives that would provide long-term protection from oral bacteria," said Esteban Florez, the lead inventor. In the U.S. alone, a long-acting antibacterial dental adhesive could help prevent more than 60 million dental procedures per year and save patients over $5 billion annually. But as a dentist with limited training in scientific research, developing and testing my idea for antibacterial nanoparticles and putting them in a clinical product seemed out of reach." These 28 User Facilities, located at National Laboratories around the country, provide state-of-the-art research facilities to the global science community at little or no cost to users. Esteban Florez and Khajotia submitted a user proposal to ORNL to work with scientists at the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) and the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). "I'm grateful for the DOE's user program, which enabled me, a dentist without advanced scientific training, to access the world-leading expertise and resources at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It saved me six to eight years of development time," said Esteban Florez. The team modified titanium dioxide nanoparticles that produce highly reactive chemicals, known as reactive oxygen species, that can kill bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. Unlike with antibiotics, microbes cannot develop resistance to these chemicals. The nanoparticles were then dispersed in an adhesive resin commonly used by dentists. Researchers examined samples of the experimental adhesive resin using a helium-ion microscope at CNMS and small-angle neutron scattering using the Bio-SANS instrument at HFIR. With these tools, they determined the optimal particle shape, modifications, and dispersion method. According to Esteban Florez, the experimental results showed that for the first time in dentistry, nanoparticles had dispersed without clustering and functioned well within a polymer and displayed strong antibacterial properties without light irradiation. "We are currently talking with a leading dental products company about commercializing this patented technology for a wide range of products," said Esteban Florez.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new international study has uncovered a concerning lack of public understanding about cystitis and urinary tract infections (UTIs) – common health issues that disproportionately affect women. Among younger adults aged 18–24, fewer than half (45%) were able to identify cystitis correctly. Despite medical consensus that women are significantly more affected by UTIs, only half (51%) of respondents recognised this, while nearly 1 in 5 men incorrectly believed that men are more commonly affected. Encouragingly, awareness was higher among women themselves, with 63% correctly identifying their increased risk compared to just 38% of men. UTIs are often preventable, but knowledge of basic prevention strategies is worryingly low: Many teenagers today are sexually active without understanding the risks of bladder infections. Young women in particular are more vulnerable because of their anatomy, yet too often they think the contraceptive pill protects them from all risks and that condoms are unnecessary. We urgently need to address this through school education and social media, otherwise we risk a new generation of young women suffering repeated urinary tract infections and even long-term bladder damage." While not all UTIs require antibiotics, 16% of respondents incorrectly believe they are always needed-a misconception that fuels antibiotic overuse and resistance. Even among those affected, awareness of the risks associated with antibiotic resistance is not widespread. "Urinary tract infections affect over 400 million people worldwide and cause approximately 240,000 deaths each year, with rising antibiotic resistance making them harder to treat," said Prof. Gernot Bonkat (CH), chair of the EAU Infections Guidelines Panel. "This study shows that raising public awareness, as well as education about symptoms, causes, and treatment, is still essential to prevent infections, reduce suffering, and slow the spread of resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at The University of Osaka have developed a groundbreaking, minimally invasive method for recording brain activity through blood vessels. This technique could potentially transform the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions like epilepsy and paving the way for advanced brain-computer interfaces. It eliminates the need for invasive open-brain surgery, offering a safer and more accessible way to monitor and stimulate brain function. Current methods for directly measuring brain activity require invasive procedures, either removing part of the skull to place electrodes on the brain surface or inserting electrodes directly into brain tissue. While non-invasive methods like EEG exist, they lack the precision needed for detailed analysis. This new method bridges the gap, offering high-fidelity recordings without the risks associated with traditional invasive approaches. The research team, led by Professor Takufumi Yanagisawa used a catheter to insert ultra-thin wire electrodes into the cortical and deep veins of pig brains. They successfully recorded brainwaves from these vessels with accuracy comparable to traditional methods. It also unlocks new possibilities for understanding deep brain functions and developing next-generation brain-computer interfaces, potentially allowing individuals with severe paralysis to communicate and control devices."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ferroptosis is a newly discovered regulated cell death mechanism, which involves the rupture of the outer membrane of cell and mitochondrial collapse. Recent research works suggest that it plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression, thus providing new opportunities in cancer treatment. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 85% of cases. Treatment options for this particular type of cancer are still limited and researchers are exploring effective diagnostic and therapeutic targets for RCC. Understanding how the ferroptosis pathway is regulated in RCC can help in developing a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RCC. Previous studies established the role of acyl-CoA synthetase family member 4 (ACSL4) protein in mediating this cell death mechanism. In this study, a research team led by Dr. Meng Zhang from Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, China, decided to understand the role of PRMT5 and ACSL4 in the ferroptosis regulation of RCC. Our recent research work revealed that PRMT5-mediated methylation of ALKBH5, a protein involved in RNA metabolism, leads to immune escape in colorectal cancer. We wanted to understand how PRMT5 influences RCC progression and if it affects the ferroptosis process in RCC by regulating ACSL4 methylation." Dr. Meng Zhang, Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University The researchers used renal cancer cell line to conduct this study. The group also screened around 765 epigenetic compounds to identify the novel regulators involved in ferroptosis of renal cancer cells. Different assays were conducted to study cell viability, protein expression, and ferroptosis pathway regulation. Patient samples were analyzed to understand RCC prognosis. "ACSL4 has arginine, a basic amino acid at the 549th position. PRMT5 regulates the methylation of ACSL4 at this position," explains Dr. Zhang. "We wanted to understand how PRMT5 affects the ferroptosis process. We inhibited PRMT5 expression in the cancer cells and noticed an increase in ferroptosis," mentioned Dr. Zhang, while talking about the role of PRMT5. Thus, PRMT5 induces ferroptosis resistance in renal cancer cells, increasing their viability. Ferroptosis reinforces the antitumor effect of immunotherapeutic treatments. When PRMT5 was inhibited, the researchers noticed an elevation in the ferroptosis process and an improved effect of immunotherapeutic treatment. Additionally, the research team identified a PRMT5 inhibitor called GSK3326595 which could function as a novel antitumor agent. Integrating this newly identified antitumor agent with a programmed death-1 blockade can have potential therapeutic implications. Combined therapeutic strategies, often involving the simultaneous application of two or more treatment modalities, are increasingly used to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance in various diseases. Further research and clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficiency of this combination therapy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Macrophages rely on lysosomes to balance microbial killing with self-protection, generating reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during phagocytosis. Using platinum nanoelectrodes, researchers at Wuhan University tracked these reactive molecules in real time, revealing that lysosomal pH acts as a chemical dial. Acidic conditions favor hydrogen peroxide, while mild alkalinization promotes nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and nitrite. This precise pH-dependent control shapes immune responses, oxidative stress, and inflammatory signaling, offering insights for therapies targeting macrophage function. Macrophages, the sentinels of the innate immune system, are tasked with a delicate balancing act: they must destroy invading pathogens while limiting damage to surrounding tissues. Central to this function is phagocytosis, the process by which macrophages engulf and neutralize microbes. While the importance of ROS and RNS in immune defense is well established, the precise mechanisms that regulate their production and timing within macrophages have remained poorly understood.Recent research has highlighted lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles known as cellular waste disposers, as pivotal regulatory hubs in immune signaling. Lysosomes not only digest pathogens but also create microenvironments that influence the chemistry of ROS and RNS production. It is speculated that the acidity within lysosomes, typically maintained at low pH, might dictate which reactive species are generated and in what quantity. But how exactly does lysosomal pH control the chemical arsenal of macrophages during phagocytosis, and could pH manipulation alter ROS/RNS production?To address this question, a research team led by Dr. Wei-Hua Huang from Wuhan University, China, and Dr. Christian Amatore from Xiamen University, China, developed a nanoelectrochemical sensor that enables real-time monitoring of ROS and RNS dynamics directly inside lysosomes. When lysosomal pH dropped below 5.0, protonation of superoxide anions facilitated the conversion to hydrogen peroxide without changing the production rates of superoxide and nitric oxide precursors. This shift increased oxidative activity within the lysosome while keeping overall ROS generation controlled. Both acidic and alkaline conditions elevated oxidative stress and stimulated proinflammatory signaling, suggesting that deviations from the optimal lysosomal pH can have significant consequences for immune regulation.This finding underscores that lysosomes are not passive containers but active chemical modulators, controlling the release and conversion of reactive molecules according to local acidity.The interplay between ROS and RNS species is also an interesting part of the study. Acidic lysosomes favored hydrogen peroxide formation, optimal for killing certain bacteria, while mild alkalinization promoted peroxynitrite and nitrite accumulation, which may target other pathogens or signal to neighboring immune cells. This nuanced chemical regulation allows macrophages to tailor their microbicidal arsenal to specific microbial threats, an adaptive feature that had long been hypothesized but never directly visualized.The use of nanoelectrochemical sensors is novel. This precision enabled the researchers to map the kinetics of ROS and RNS in unprecedented detail, revealing that temporal regulation and chemical conversion within lysosomes are highly pH-dependent.The study has therapeutic potential as well. Dysregulated lysosomal pH has been implicated in chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and impaired microbial clearance. Modulating lysosomal acidity could therefore provide a targeted strategy to enhance or suppress macrophage activity. For example, stabilizing lysosomal pH in aged or immunocompromised individuals might boost pathogen clearance, while controlled alkalinization could reduce excessive oxidative stress in autoimmune diseases.Overall, the study highlights lysosomal pH as a critical determinant of ROS and RNS homeostasis during phagocytosis. By providing real-time, nanoscale insights into reactive species dynamics, the research illuminates a previously hidden layer of immune regulation: how macrophages balance killing microbes while avoiding self-harm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Childhood exposure to chemicals used to make plastic household items presents growing health risks that can extend long into adulthood, experts from NYU Langone Health report. In their report, the authors outline decades of evidence that substances often added to industrial and household goods may contribute to disease and disability, particularly when they are encountered early in life. The review focuses on three classes of chemical - phthalates used to make plastic flexible, bisphenols, which provide rigidity, and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which help materials resist heat and repel water. The results of the studies, which together assessed thousands of pregnant mothers, fetuses, and children, tied these toxins to a wide range of long-term health concerns, including heart disease, obesity, infertility, and asthma. Our findings point to plastic's role in the early origins of many chronic diseases that reverberate into adolescence and adulthood." Leonardo Trasande, MD, MPP, study lead author and pediatrician "If we want kids to stay healthy and live longer, then we need to get serious about limiting the use of these materials," added Trasande, the Jim G. Hendrick, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. The chemicals are found in a range of items, such as food packaging, cosmetics, and paper receipts, notes Trasande, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health. Chemicals used in plastic materials have been shown to prompt an overactive immune response (inflammation) throughout the body's tissues as well as disrupt the function of hormones that influence many bodily processes. The substances are also believed to affect brain development, with numerous studies linking early-life exposure to IQ loss and neurodevelopmental issues such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. "There are safe, simple steps that parents can take to limit their children's plastic exposure without breaking the bank," said Trasande, who serves as director of NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Division of Environmental Pediatrics and NYU Langone Health's Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards. Trasande adds that by offering clear guidance, health care providers can empower parents to make informed decisions about the products they use and steer them toward safer options. He also suggests that clinicians partner with schools and community organizations to engage younger generations about the health risks of plastic exposure. The developing treaty represents an international effort to tackle plastic pollution, with more than 100 countries calling for legally binding caps on production. The Global Plastics Treaty will be part of the discussion during NYU Langone Health's 2025 Plastics, Human Health, and Solutions Symposium. Despite its health risks, plastic can play an essential role in pediatric medicine, such as its use in ventilators and feeding tubes for premature infants, nebulizers for children with asthma, and masks that help prevent the spread of infection. The symposium will be held at NYU Langone Health on Sept. 22. The event will also be live streamed on YouTube for registered attendees. Funding for the study was provided by National Institutes of Health grants R01ES022972, R01ES029779, R01ES032214, R01ES034793, and P2CES033423.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today marks a milestone in global health governance as the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) enter into force. This reflects a renewed global commitment to cooperation in the face of public health emergencies, shaped by hard-earned lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IHR are global regulations that guide 196 States Parties, including all 194 WHO Member States, on their rights and obligations concerning public health risks. They recognize that infectious diseases and other public health risks do not respect borders, and that coordinated global action is critical. Initially governed by bilateral and regional treaties, these efforts were made global under the International Sanitary Regulations in 1951 following the founding of WHO. These regulations were later renamed the IHR and have since evolved to meet the changing landscape of global health. One of the changes is the introduction of a new level of global alert – a "pandemic emergency" – to trigger stronger international collaboration when a health risk escalates beyond a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and poses the risk of becoming, or has already become, a pandemic, with widespread impact on the health system and disruption to societies. The amendments also introduce the establishment of National IHR Authorities by governments to coordinate IHR implementation, and include provisions to strengthen access to medical products and financing based on equity and solidarity. These changes were driven by lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside the amended IHR, Member States also adopted the WHO Pandemic Agreement at this year's World Health Assembly and are actively negotiating an annex to the agreement on Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing. For them, previous versions of IHR continue to apply, though rejections may be withdrawn at any time. WHO will support IHR States Parties, as requested, in integrating the amendments to the regulations into national legal frameworks and strengthening institutional capacities to work together to build a safer, healthier future for all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists reveal how your daily cup of coffee may guard against liver disease, connecting population trends with the molecular pathways that drive inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer. In a recent review published in the journal Biochemical Pharmacology, researchers collated and synthesized decades of scientific literature across epidemiological, clinical, and experimental data to elucidate coffee's hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) benefits. These findings offer a valuable resource for coffee consumers and healthcare professionals seeking to enhance their overall well-being. Patients with hepatitis C drinking 3+ cups daily saw triple the response rate to older antiviral therapy (peginterferon/ribavirin) compared to non-coffee drinkers, hinting at a potential treatment boost. The liver serves as the body's metabolic command center, responsible for a range of critical housekeeping functions, including processing nutrients, filtering toxins, and synthesizing essential proteins. Unfortunately, this heavy workload, combined with recent surges in viral infections, alcohol consumption, and metabolic disorders, makes the liver vulnerable to damage and conditions like cirrhosis and cancers, resulting in an unprecedented spike in liver disease prevalence. While the liver does display the remarkable ability to regenerate (replace damaged or lost tissue with fresh/healthy cells), persistent chronic damage can result in systemic liver inflammation, which if left unchecked can progress to fibrosis (the formation of scar tissue), cirrhosis (advanced, irreversible scarring), and ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. While decades of research have produced several medical treatments for some liver conditions, the general consensus remains that prevention and management through lifestyle factors remain paramount. Among these, coffee consumption has consistently emerged as a powerful protective factor against liver disease in epidemiological studies. Individuals who practice regular coffee consumption demonstrate a significantly lower risk of developing various liver diseases and experience slower disease progression. However, these studies are largely observational and cannot prove direct causation. This narrative review addresses the knowledge gap by comprehensively collating and elucidating decades of scientific research to synthesize and explain the hepatoprotective actions of coffee. The review draws on a wide array of sources, from large-scale population studies to detailed molecular experiments in the lab, focusing on coffee's key bioactive compounds (caffeine, chlorogenic acids, diterpenes). It systematically investigates how each of these components interacts with the cellular pathways that drive liver damage. Crucially, the review details coffee's five main lines of defense: its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, metabolism-modulating, and gut microbiota-balancing properties. It also explores emerging evidence for epigenetic regulation via microRNAs (e.g., miRNA-122). By connecting epidemiological trends to specific molecular targets, this work provides clear, mechanistic explanations for coffee's long-observed benefits, while acknowledging limitations such as inconsistent results in hepatitis B cohorts. Regular coffee intake consistently lowered key liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, GGT) – established markers of liver cell damage – across viral hepatitis, alcohol-related disease, and MASLD patients. This review confirms that regular coffee consumption is associated with a significantly reduced risk of liver disease across all studies. A meta-analysis included in the review found that regular coffee drinkers have a 29% lower risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the most common chronic liver condition worldwide. Multiple meta-analyses have found that coffee consumption is associated with up to a 40% reduction in the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. However, this protective effect was attenuated in patients with hepatitis B who had high viral replication. These bioactives further suppress a primary inflammatory pathway, Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), thereby reducing the production of tissue-damaging cytokines. Emerging evidence suggests epigenetic effects, such as modulation of miRNA-122, may further regulate fat metabolism and inflammation. Unfiltered coffee drinkers might miss some benefits: Filtering removes certain diterpenes linked to cholesterol concerns, but also potentially reduces some protective effects seen in espresso or French press preparations. This review provides strong associative evidence of coffee's physiological benefits, particularly in relation to liver protection. The world's third most popular beverage has been shown to provide a robust defense against the primary drivers of liver disease, including oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and gut dysbiosis, which are attributed to its rich blend of bioactive compounds. Potential risks include anxiety or arrhythmias in caffeine-sensitive individuals, elevated cholesterol from unfiltered coffee (e.g., French press), and potential interactions with medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., certain antidepressants). More clinical trials are needed to validate preclinical findings; however, this review solidifies coffee's status as a key functional food in preventing and managing chronic liver disease, transforming a simple daily ritual into a scientifically backed health intervention.
