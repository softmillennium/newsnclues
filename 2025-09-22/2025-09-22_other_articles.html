                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tucker Carlson has been accused by Jewish groups and Israeli media outlets of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories about the the assassination of Charlie Kirk. “So it's about 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem, and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power, and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people, and they hate it, and they just go bonkers,” Carlson told the huge crowd gathered at the State Farm Stadium in Glendal, Arizona, to celebrate the life of Kirk. We've got to shut this guy up,'” he continued. “And I can just sort of picture the scene in a lamp-lit room with a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus, thinking about — ‘What do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? And there's always one guy with the bright idea, and I can just hear him say, ‘I've got an idea. His comments sparked outcry from a number of Jewish groups and Israeli figures, who accused Carlson of evoking medieval “blood libel” conspiracies about Jewish people being responsible for the death of Christ. Others said his mention of hummus, which was not eaten 2,000 years ago, was a clear attempt to evoke modern Israel. “Complete with a laugh like a cartoon villain, Tucker Carlson uses Charlie Kirk's funeral to spread an antisemitic blood libel,” former Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy wrote on X. “Tucker Carlson pushed an antisemitic trope, painting the Pharisees as ‘sitting around eating hummus' plotting Christ's crucifixion — then comparing it to people supposedly silencing Charlie Kirk by killing him, as if Jews killed Kirk the way they killed Christ,” Infowars host Adam King wrote on X. No matter what happens, someone, somewhere will find a way to blame it on Jews,” Compact Magazine editor Matthew Schmitz posted. Now he's known for dog whistles, blaming everything on Jews, heaping praise on fake-historian Hitler apologists, apologizing to the Bin Laden terrorist family, denying Hamas is a terrorist group, siding with Islamist terrorists, and pretending Russians enjoy a higher standard of living than Americans,” Max Abrahms, a Republican political scientist, wrote on X. Meanwhile, Carlson's words were amplified by Palestinian media outlet the Quds News Network. “Tucker Carlson suggests Israeli involvement in Charlie Kirk's death during TPUSA's memorial for its late founder,” the network wrote in a post sharing a clip of the video. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and a number of other senior Republicans spoke on the same stage as Carlson during Sunday's event. Some prominent Jewish speakers at the memorial included Stephen Miller and Laura Loomer.</p>

At the heart of NCA2025 is a groundbreaking initiative led by UAP National President, Ar. With an allocated dedicated budget, the UAP is taking decisive legal steps to pursue cases against unauthorized practitioners. This administrative initiative is emblematic of a deeper commitment to uphold the dignity of every licensed Filipino architect. Another conference milestone is the return of Pacific Paint (Boysen) Philippines, standing shoulder-to-shoulder again with Davies Paints Philippines. Mark Louie M. Soriquez, executive director for the Commission on Convention, Assemblies, and Exhibits, marks a significant moment of unity within the industry. Their joint presence will anchor the inaugural UAP Regional Exhibition of Construction and Building Materials (Regionex 2025), a visionary showcase of cutting-edge technologies, sustainable solutions, and regional innovation led by Regionex director, Ar. More than an exhibition, Regionex is a platform for collaboration, a celebration of craftsmanship, and a testament to the strength of partnerships that transcend competition. It will serve as a dynamic space where professionals, suppliers and innovators converge to shape the future of Philippine architecture and construction. The conference unfolds over three immersive days, beginning with community-driven CSR initiatives under the banner of “RAHBA sa Bacolod.” These include a mural-painting activity at Bacolod City National High School and a Playground Equipment Donation in Barangay Mansilingan, symbolic gestures of the profession's commitment to public service and social impact. Strategic assemblies such as the Chapter Presidents' Assembly and the National Board of Directors Meeting will set the tone for governance and collaboration, followed by Area Town Hall Meetings, CPD Seminars, and the pivotal General Assembly. Cultural and fellowship events will enrich the experience, including the “Kalingawan sa Kapitolyo” Welcome Night hosted by the Provincial Government of Negros Occidental and Boysen Paints Philippines; and the “Pag-inupdanay” Fellowship Night hosted by Davies Paints Philippines. Delegates will be treated to curated tours showcasing Bacolod's heritage, natural beauty, and culinary delights, a well-rounded experience blending professional growth with cultural immersion. Adding a spirited dimension to the conference is the “Hinampang sa NCA,” a sports fest that fosters camaraderie and healthy competition among architects nationwide. It is a collective affirmation that justice, identity and unity are not abstract ideals but actionable commitments. To encourage broader participation, the SANDAGsenang SAYA promo offers one complimentary slot for every group of 11 registered delegates during the regular registration period, which ends on Sept. 30. For inquiries, contact the NCA2025 Secretariat at [email protected]. See you in Bacolod, where justice meets vision, and unity builds the future. Reynaldo M. Cristobal Jr., UAP, PIEP, RMP, is the director of the UAP National Conference of Architects 2025. He previously served as chairman for the UAP World Architecture Day 2022 and UAP National Architecture Week 2021.</p>

The first trailer for The Healing has arrived and it teases a slow-burn supernatural nightmare in the spirit of films like Midsommar. Directed by Denis Kryuchkov, the movie follows Lyuba, played by Alena Mitroshina, who escapes her abusive husband and joins friends at a secluded retreat. 

What starts as a hopeful search for renewal quickly spirals into eerie rituals, strange visions, and a sinister atmosphere that makes you question whether this refuge is a sanctuary or a trap.

The cast also includes Wolfgang Czerny, Vyacheslav Chepurchenko, Ekaterina Solomatina, Victoria Skitskaya, Maxim Khanzhov, and Hermes Zygott. 

The official synopsis reads: “In the vein of cult horror classics like MIDSOMMAR, Lyuba flees her abusive husband for a mysterious retreat with friends. Surreal rituals and haunting visions reveal dark secrets, pushing her to confront a terrifying choice: escape or succumb to a chilling fate.” 

The trailer promises an unsettling journey into psychological terror with striking imagery that suggests The Healing will be one of the year's most unnerving horror experiences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Animal psychic Jackie Weaver is renowned for reading pets' minds around the world, and it seems Reach journalist, Vikki White's cat Humphrey has a sixth sense too. Just five minutes before Jackie arrived at Vikki's home, the normally laid back British Blue Shorthair was on high alert. With animal psychic readings booming on social media platforms like TikTok, Vikki decided to give it a go, naturally seeking out the crème de la crème. Jackie has worked with some famous pets, including Coronation Street legend Bill Roache's dogs and actor Matthew Rhys' horses, but could she read Vikki's pride and joy? Luckily, Humphrey's curiosity won out, and by the time Vikki had heard all about Jackie's impressive career, he was back, just in time for his reading. And it's fair to say he wasn't too keen at first. Meeting Jackie, he jumped onto the kitchen table, rolled onto his side to lure her in, and then to Vikki's horror, went for the kill. After the bumpy introduction, they were soon ‘chatting away'. He admitted to getting under Vikki's feet too – no surprise, given his attempts to take her out on the stairs. Humphrey also revealed he enjoys when Vikki's young daughter covers him with a blanket and draws pictures of him. Occasionally, he cheekily taps her on the head with his paws. Vikki asked Jackie why he won't sleep in her daughter's room. Humphrey says she needs to be less hands on and stop talking in her sleep. Humphrey is childlike himself, Jackie added, noting his habit of switching between the top and bottom of Vikki's bed. So how would Humphrey sum up his life? Surprisingly, he expressed a fondness for the outdoors, particularly the back garden, and requested "cat mint", a plant he loved in Vikki's old garden. "I had no idea I was psychic for a long time," says Jackie of how she got started in the business. "I got to my early 40s and got stage four cancer, they only gave me four weeks to live. "At that point I had no physical strength. "She talked to my rescue dog who told her I could communicate too and the penny dropped. She showed me how to do it - when it comes into your head it often sounds like your own thoughts and you have to learn to distinguish between the two." Jackie is busier than ever, with clients ranging from everyday pet owners to high-flyers and celebrities. She specialises in spirit work and end-of-life readings, describing it as the most rewarding - and most needed - part of her work. "Animals are so accepting of going to heaven," she says, detailing how she often passes on a dying pet's last request. She recently took on her first bearded dragon. "It told me: 'My skin's actually soft' Jackie recalled. "He looked very spiky in the photo, but his owner confirmed the skin on his belly was soft." Another client was a guide dog who became unusually stressed when his blind owner, who rode horses, took her wheelbarrow over to the manure heap at the stables. She works worldwide, mainly by phone, and can communicate with pets from a photo, a description, or even just their name. Her services are especially sought after in the United States and Australia. Vikki, naturally sceptical, was surprised at how accurate Jackie's reading of Humphrey proved. While there were no earth shattering revelations, she took away plenty of insights and reassurance. By the time Jackie left, it was clear Humphrey was a very happy cat and it was easy to see how these readings bring comfort to owners whose pets have passed away.

The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered strange "dark beads "above a four-armed star pattern in Saturn's atmosphere. Yet what they noticed instead were dark, bead-like features — separated by vast distances yet possibly interconnected — drifting slowly in the charged plasma of the planet's ionosphere, and a lopsided star-shape structure in the stratosphere beneath. They published their findings Aug. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Saturn's Hexagon was first discovered in 1980 by NASA's Voyager spacecraft and imaged in fine detail by the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited the planet from 2004 to 2017. It rises as an 18,000-mile-wide (29,000 kilometers) six-sided tower whirling above the planet's surface, making a complete rotation roughly once every 10 hours. To investigate, the astronomers focused JWST's NIRSpec instrument on Saturn's ionosphere and stratosphere, located 684 miles (1,100 km) and 373 miles (600 km) above the planet's nominal surface, respectively.

To understand what could be causing the features, and their effects on Saturn's atmosphere, the team hopes to conduct followup observations with JWST.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As only a casual anime watcher, I must admit that when Tissot announced its collaborative PRX with UFO Robot Grendizer last year, I wasn't sure what to make of it. In Australia, Grendizer isn't a household name – but in Europe, it was extremely popular, being one of the first anime series to make its way to the continent (in particular, its French dub was the first-ever anime series to be telecast in France). MB&F's Max Büsser is a fan, as is Tissot CEO Silvain Dolla, which is probably why the collab happened in the first place, and also probably why it's making an encore to mark Grendizer's 50th anniversary in 2025. Like the initial Grendizer release, it takes the form of an automatic 40mm PRX, but immediately differentiates itself from 2024's release thanks to its black PVD-coated case and bracelet. Actually, this marks a first for Tissot: just as 2024's Grendizer PRX was the first-ever analogue PRX without a date window, this 2025 model is the first-ever PRX with a blacked-out case and bracelet. Powering this mecha-inspired mechanical watch is the Powermatic 80 movement, which, as the name implies, offers an 80-hour power reserve and is regulated by an anti-magnetic Nivachron balance spring. The movement's rotor is engraved with a Grendizer graphic, too. The watch comes housed in a capsule shaped like Grendizer's ‘Spazer' UFO, which is itself housed within a striking gold and black outer box boasting drawings specially created for this limited edition, created and hand-signed by Grendizer creator Go Nagai. The Tissot PRX 40mm UFO Robot Grendizer is a limited edition of 1975 individually numbered pieces, in honour of the year Grendizer first aired.
