                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clear and startling images of what appears to be a UFO were captured over Los Angeles, sparking fresh debate about what's flying over America's biggest cities. A pair of Los Angeles residents were on their balcony when they spotted a black, V-shaped craft covered in lights moving slowly over the city on August 28. The pair was able to capture both pictures and clear videos with a cellphone camera, zooming in to see nine white lights along the UFO's hull. UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee told the Daily Mail he believes the craft was not an alien spaceship, adding it was likely an unmanned drone testing out new technology for the US government or some other world power. However, Lee made one stunning claim based on his analysis of this sighting and several famous UFO incidents throughout the UK, suggesting that the US military has created technology many would think was still only science fiction in 2025. 'I'm convinced that a lot of famous UFO incidents are basically highly advanced terrestrial technology that is 30 to 40 years ahead of what we think they have,' Lee explained. The UFO was seen having a V shape with nine lights along its body According to NUFORC, there have been several reports this year which specifically mention seeing a V-shaped wedge or triangle with multiple lights along its surface flying over the US. 'It moved around a little bit but didn't go too far. At the end it just flew off in the south direction until I couldn't see it anymore,' they added. The boomerang-shaped object also appeared to have a small body at its center, making it look similar to a F-117 stealth fighter. 'It's definitely not flares and is in my opinion a structured craft, most likely a top secret drone,' Lee declared. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, there have been multiple V-shaped UFO sightings throughout the US in 2025 An ultralight refers to a type of small, lightweight aircraft, often just a motorized hang glider or powered parachute, that's popular among recreational flyers. These are super basic machines, having a minimal frame, no heavy engine, and being generally quiet and slow-moving. Los Angeles has a storied history with UFO sightings, going all the way back to the infamous 'Battle of Los Angeles' in 1942 when the US military shot at what they thought were could have been alien ships invading the West Coast. Lee thinks LA isn't actually an alien hotspot, but a hotbed of activity by super-advanced human technology being launched from nearby facilities such as Vandenberg Space Force Base, Edwards Air Force Base, and the infamous Area 51.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A South Korean man found himself at the center of a controversial legal battle after criticizing the appearance of  Plave, a K-pop boy band made up of five digital avatars. Digital models and influencers are all the rage online these days, with some of them raking in millions for their creators, but Plave isn't your run-of-the-mill AI-generated K-pop group. Yes, the five members – Yejun, Noah, Bamby, Eunho, and Hamin – are digitally rendered, but they are the rendering of five real-life artists' performances using motion capture technology. This makes criticizing the group in an otherwise harmless post on X (Twitter) problematic, as one South Korean man recently learned. After posting a negative comment about the look of Plave's members, the unidentified man was sued for 6.5 million won in compensation for each of the group's members. The man found himself embroiled in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit, which could cost him a fortune. Even though the man insisted that he had merely criticized the digital avatars, the plaintiffs argued that the five mysterious people – whose names and faces remain a secret – suffered serious damage to their reputation as a result of the insults. “In the era of the metaverse, the avatar is more than a virtual image; it is a means of expression for the user, their identity, and their way of communicating with society,” the Korean court said in its verdict. Legal experts agreed that while definitely wacky in nature, the case is important because the court ruled that insulting a digital avatar is tantamount to insulting the real person behind it. That person is a legal entity that can file a complaint and seek financial compensation.</p>

Paper airplanes flew, scientists sang about stomach bugs and one person dressed as a giant ball of mozzarella: Last Thursday, the 35th Ig Nobel Prize ceremony honored strange scientific pursuits with more than a touch of whimsy. Actual Nobel laureates presented the ten prizes to highlight unusual research efforts. (For anyone wondering, more stripes led to fewer fly bites, and the effects of alcohol on aviation were not positive.) “It's a great honor for us,” says Sanchez, who studied the drunken bats. You can see that scientists are not really square and super serious and can have some fun while showing interesting science.” Other awardees included a team of Italian researchers who created the perfect cacio e pepe sauce; an American historian who tracked his fingernail growth for 35 years, honored posthumously; and an international team that studied the choices of lizards at a seaside resort when presented with different types of pizza. It also offered a chance for friends to cook together. Last year, the Ig Nobel Prizes honored research on mammals breathing through their anuses, the movements of dead fish in currents, drunk worms and the effects of exploding paper bags near cats and cows. Carly York, a biologist at Lenoir-Rhyne University who was not involved with the Ig Nobel Prizes, tells CNN's Jack Guy that seemingly silly research forms the backbone of many important discoveries. Last year, Nature's Catriona Clarke reported that several former honorees credit the awards with improving their careers. Over the next several months, Improbable Research will hold several “Face to Face” events around the world, where winners will answer questions about their research. Editor and mathematician Marc Abrahams founded the unusual awards in 1991. “Every great discovery ever, at first glance seemed screwy and laughable,” he wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gravesite of Oak Grove Jane Doe exhumedMark William Graves Oregon authorities on Monday exhumed the dismembered remains of a woman long known as Oak Grove Jane Doe — the state's oldest unidentified person case at the heart of a nearly 80-year-old unsolved murder. Authorities had believed the woman's partial remains were lost to time, but the Oregon State Police Medical Examiner's Office earlier this year used a website to determine that they were likely interred at Mountain View Cemetery in Oregon City. The headstone, which reads only “UNKNOWN WOMAN 1946,” had been obscured by layers of dirt, located deep within the cemetery in one of its oldest sections. City records do not include details of who arranged for the burial in 1951, said Tracy Nimrod, who works at the cemetery office. The state's forensic anthropologist, Hailey Collord-Stalder, reviewed the case recently and “discovered that there wasn't an understanding of where those remains were,” said Oregon State Police Capt. So authorities turned to findagrave.com and searched for gravesites that might line up. They found one possibility at Mountain View Cemetery, Kennedy said. The woman, likely between 30 and 50 and petite in stature, died from blunt-force trauma to the head, police said. A saw was used to dismember her body. Three fishermen discovered her torso floating in an eddy near what was called Wisdom Light Moorage in Oak Grove between Portland and Milwaukie. Two days later, her arms and thighs were found; they were wrapped in burlap and tied with telephone wire. Later that year, in October, a woman walking along the river found the unidentified woman's head wrapped in newspaper. It too had been bound in wire and anchored with window sash weights, according to news accounts from the time. Her skull appeared to have been fractured by a “solid blow with a heavy object,” The Oregonian reported in a front page story about the discovery. “Her long hair was neatly done up,” the story noted. “His trail was found along the line of an old abandoned railroad track which a stranger would have had difficulty in locating” and his footprints traced a “distance of 200 feet from the rough, virtually unused, road down a steep bluff to the old railroad tracks and onto the river,” the story said. This week, state police said the victim's remains “went missing from law enforcement custody” in the 1950s, “with no documentation of their disposition.” Similar murders popped up in other cities, leading to speculation that the killer remained active. Kennedy said it is difficult to say how long it will take experts to identify the remains. “The condition of remains this old presents challenges that even modern technology may struggle with,” he said. “We are going to continue the effort to positively identify her remains for as long as it takes.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of its mid-October release, a verdict for Black Phone 2 has arrived thanks to critic reviews. Directed by Scott Derrickson, the highly anticipated horror sequel looks to up the supernatural vibes as Ethan Hawke's The Grabber has been resurrected to make your dreams a living nightmare. Most reviews have been complementary of Derrickson's direction and the performances of the cast, which sees Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw and Ethan Hawke once again return in prominent roles. If you got Freddy Krueger vibes from the trailer, it seems like that was no mistake. Slant Magazine states that "Scott Derrickson collapses dreams, reality, past, and present sidelong into a singular cinematic haunted space." For many, horror sequels tend to be a step-down from their predecessors, especially since studios are always keen on cashing in on popular films. Some work better than others, but it seems Black Phone 2 was able to surpass the original film, which boasts an 81% on Rotten Tomatoes. io9 called it "excellent" and the "rare sequel that outshines its predecessor," blending horror and emotion for one big gut punch. pointed out, it seems the horror follow-up grows up with its characters, leading to more stakes and a "supernatural fear" that better matches the stage of life the kids are at right now. "The original film offered simplicity for young characters, and in Black Phone 2, it offers supernatural fear and accelerated stakes to match where the kids are now in their lives. Not every sequel works, but Black Phone 2 does." But true evil transcends death … and the phone is ringing again. Four-time Academy Award® nominee Ethan Hawke returns to the most sinister role of his career as The Grabber seeks vengeance on Finn (Mason Thames) from beyond the grave by menacing Finn's younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw). As Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, the headstrong 15-year-old Gwen begins receiving calls in her dreams from the black phone and seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake. There, she uncovers a shattering intersection between The Grabber and her own family's history. Together, she and Finn must confront a killer who has grown more powerful in death and more significant to them than either could imagine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UFO expert claims the government has axed planned talks with him about alien encounters. Mark Christopher Lee said he was also warned off from speaking about a “British Roswell” incident in Rendlesham, Suffolk. But he claims the talks have been scrapped and a mystery person ordered him to stop speaking about the Rendlesham Forest incident which he made a film about. Mark said: “Some of the things I've been told not to talk about. “It was an anonymous person, they'd seen the stuff I'd been posting about Rendlesham." He added: “I'm not getting too far with the UK government. You've got the Rendlesham things and then me being contacted. “The doors have been closed, but I'm not giving up. I'm trying not to get too paranoid, or conspiracy ridden. Or is it just the government has got more pressing concerns? Mark's film probed a close encounter at Rendlesham Forest in 1980, just outside RAF Woodbridge. And a letter was hand delivered to Sir Keir Starmer on behalf of his UFO group and an aide of the PM had arranged for a minister from the House of Lords to meet with Mark. But rather than staying silent, he is more determined to expose the truth. The documentary maker added: “We're doing a UK Disclosure film. There's a big one in America coming out, it's called the Age of Disclosure. “We've got whistleblowers that are coming forward, so this could be the catalyst for it, really.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence is putting an excessive load on power systems across the planet, and large data computing facilities and cooling networks are consuming tremendous amounts of energy. Caltech's MAPLE experiment on SSPD-1 satellite on a recent test showed the energy of solar power could be beamed through space. The second wave of AI has also made engineers look to outer space so that they can get sustainable energy solutions. The rate of increase in artificial intelligence is exceeding most power grids. Developing large models requires megawatts, and executing it on clouds, edge devices, and IoT devices requires virtually constant power. The renewable solutions are seasonal, weather-dependent, and can not exist at night, yet transmission of power to the long-distance needs, as well as storage, is already expensive and unproductive. This concept is referred to as space-based solar power (SBSP). Those ground receiving stations are referred to as rectennas. On the SSPD-1 satellite, Caltech's SSPP undertook several experiments with MAPLE and was able to transmit power through the satellite and send back a detectable signal to Earth. An example is a project carried out by the Air Force Research Laboratory called SSPIDR, which aims to create solar panel tiles and then transform the obtained solar energy and send it back to earth with the help of radio frequency (RF). Construction of those modular RF elements will proceed to Arachne, a flight demonstration to demonstrate full solar-energy harvesting, conversion, and beaming with these elements, just like the rainbow panel with unexpected performance. AI will play a key role in the feasibility of space-based solar power. Artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions are streamlining each stage of the process. The drawbacks include high launch prices, systems for constructing huge in-orbit structures, energy wastage, and regulatory or safety considerations. To make the very action of having reliable, efficient space-based energy become real, materials should be lightweight, durable, radiation-resistant, and deployable. These may provide much power, integrate solar in renewable intermittency, and reduce costs, which might substitute large portions of present-day renewable energy overall in case technology and performance advance as foreseen. The experiments of Caltech's MAPLE and the ESA's SOLARIS have demonstrated the feasibility of transmitting solar energy through orbit and providing nearly indefinite, clean power, like this hidden energy from Earth. The primary issues are cost, safety, and logistics.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tucker Carlson has been accused by Jewish groups and Israeli media outlets of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories about the the assassination of Charlie Kirk. “So it's about 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem, and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power, and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people, and they hate it, and they just go bonkers,” Carlson told the huge crowd gathered at the State Farm Stadium in Glendal, Arizona, to celebrate the life of Kirk. We've got to shut this guy up,'” he continued. “And I can just sort of picture the scene in a lamp-lit room with a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus, thinking about — ‘What do we do about this guy telling the truth about us? And there's always one guy with the bright idea, and I can just hear him say, ‘I've got an idea. His comments sparked outcry from a number of Jewish groups and Israeli figures, who accused Carlson of evoking medieval “blood libel” conspiracies about Jewish people being responsible for the death of Christ. Others said his mention of hummus, which was not eaten 2,000 years ago, was a clear attempt to evoke modern Israel. “Complete with a laugh like a cartoon villain, Tucker Carlson uses Charlie Kirk's funeral to spread an antisemitic blood libel,” former Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy wrote on X. “Tucker Carlson pushed an antisemitic trope, painting the Pharisees as ‘sitting around eating hummus' plotting Christ's crucifixion — then comparing it to people supposedly silencing Charlie Kirk by killing him, as if Jews killed Kirk the way they killed Christ,” Infowars host Adam King wrote on X. No matter what happens, someone, somewhere will find a way to blame it on Jews,” Compact Magazine editor Matthew Schmitz posted. Now he's known for dog whistles, blaming everything on Jews, heaping praise on fake-historian Hitler apologists, apologizing to the Bin Laden terrorist family, denying Hamas is a terrorist group, siding with Islamist terrorists, and pretending Russians enjoy a higher standard of living than Americans,” Max Abrahms, a Republican political scientist, wrote on X. Meanwhile, Carlson's words were amplified by Palestinian media outlet the Quds News Network. “Tucker Carlson suggests Israeli involvement in Charlie Kirk's death during TPUSA's memorial for its late founder,” the network wrote in a post sharing a clip of the video. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and a number of other senior Republicans spoke on the same stage as Carlson during Sunday's event. Some prominent Jewish speakers at the memorial included Stephen Miller and Laura Loomer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It encapsulates the spirit of solidarity and resilience that will define the proceedings, as architects from across the archipelago unite to fortify professional advocacy, elevate competence, and reinforce ethical practice. At the heart of NCA2025 is a groundbreaking initiative led by UAP National President, Ar. With an allocated dedicated budget, the UAP is taking decisive legal steps to pursue cases against unauthorized practitioners. This administrative initiative is emblematic of a deeper commitment to uphold the dignity of every licensed Filipino architect. Another conference milestone is the return of Pacific Paint (Boysen) Philippines, standing shoulder-to-shoulder again with Davies Paints Philippines. Mark Louie M. Soriquez, executive director for the Commission on Convention, Assemblies, and Exhibits, marks a significant moment of unity within the industry. Their joint presence will anchor the inaugural UAP Regional Exhibition of Construction and Building Materials (Regionex 2025), a visionary showcase of cutting-edge technologies, sustainable solutions, and regional innovation led by Regionex director, Ar. More than an exhibition, Regionex is a platform for collaboration, a celebration of craftsmanship, and a testament to the strength of partnerships that transcend competition. It will serve as a dynamic space where professionals, suppliers and innovators converge to shape the future of Philippine architecture and construction. The conference unfolds over three immersive days, beginning with community-driven CSR initiatives under the banner of “RAHBA sa Bacolod.” These include a mural-painting activity at Bacolod City National High School and a Playground Equipment Donation in Barangay Mansilingan, symbolic gestures of the profession's commitment to public service and social impact. Strategic assemblies such as the Chapter Presidents' Assembly and the National Board of Directors Meeting will set the tone for governance and collaboration, followed by Area Town Hall Meetings, CPD Seminars, and the pivotal General Assembly. Cultural and fellowship events will enrich the experience, including the “Kalingawan sa Kapitolyo” Welcome Night hosted by the Provincial Government of Negros Occidental and Boysen Paints Philippines; and the “Pag-inupdanay” Fellowship Night hosted by Davies Paints Philippines. Delegates will be treated to curated tours showcasing Bacolod's heritage, natural beauty, and culinary delights, a well-rounded experience blending professional growth with cultural immersion. Adding a spirited dimension to the conference is the “Hinampang sa NCA,” a sports fest that fosters camaraderie and healthy competition among architects nationwide. It is a collective affirmation that justice, identity and unity are not abstract ideals but actionable commitments. To encourage broader participation, the SANDAGsenang SAYA promo offers one complimentary slot for every group of 11 registered delegates during the regular registration period, which ends on Sept. 30. For inquiries, contact the NCA2025 Secretariat at [email protected]. See you in Bacolod, where justice meets vision, and unity builds the future. Reynaldo M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experimental musical instruments have always occupied a fascinating space between functional tools and artistic statements, but few creators push this boundary as playfully as Love Hultén. A matching yellow strap suggests this instrument was meant to be worn and performed with, while the flat, extended neck bristles with metallic touch points that function as an unconventional fretboard. The cylindrical handle protruding from the main body, adorned with metallic rings, looks like something you'd expect to find on a piece of alien technology rather than a musical instrument. This magnetic liquid creates hypnotic, organic patterns that shift and dance with every note, turning the act of playing music into a visual performance as well. The ferrofluid display transforms the instrument from a simple sound generator into a living, breathing piece of kinetic art that captivates both performer and audience. The control surface reads like a love letter to vintage synthesizers, with an array of rotary knobs, toggle switches, and colored buttons labeled for parameters like attack, sustain, glide, and filter type. The touch-sensitive neck allows for both polyphonic and monophonic play, while the metallic handle likely serves as a pitch bend or modulation controller, adding gestural expression to performances. Every surface invites tactile exploration, encouraging users to sculpt and morph sounds through physical interaction. Love Hultén has built a reputation for creating objects that spark curiosity and conversation, and the Extraterrestrial Guitar Thing continues this tradition by refusing to fit neatly into any single category. Its sci-fi aesthetic, ferrofluid visualizer, and hands-on controls create an experience that feels genuinely otherworldly, reminding us that the most memorable musical instruments are often the ones that transport us to entirely new sonic and visual territories. Your phone's dying, the tap water looks questionable, and you can't find anything useful in that… Music boxes bring the tunes of nostalgia back and how!

The first trailer for The Healing has arrived and it teases a slow-burn supernatural nightmare in the spirit of films like Midsommar. Directed by Denis Kryuchkov, the movie follows Lyuba, played by Alena Mitroshina, who escapes her abusive husband and joins friends at a secluded retreat. 

What starts as a hopeful search for renewal quickly spirals into eerie rituals, strange visions, and a sinister atmosphere that makes you question whether this refuge is a sanctuary or a trap.

The cast also includes Wolfgang Czerny, Vyacheslav Chepurchenko, Ekaterina Solomatina, Victoria Skitskaya, Maxim Khanzhov, and Hermes Zygott. 

The official synopsis reads: “In the vein of cult horror classics like MIDSOMMAR, Lyuba flees her abusive husband for a mysterious retreat with friends. Surreal rituals and haunting visions reveal dark secrets, pushing her to confront a terrifying choice: escape or succumb to a chilling fate.” 

The trailer promises an unsettling journey into psychological terror with striking imagery that suggests The Healing will be one of the year's most unnerving horror experiences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Animal psychic Jackie Weaver is renowned for reading pets' minds around the world, and it seems Reach journalist, Vikki White's cat Humphrey has a sixth sense too. Just five minutes before Jackie arrived at Vikki's home, the normally laid back British Blue Shorthair was on high alert. With animal psychic readings booming on social media platforms like TikTok, Vikki decided to give it a go, naturally seeking out the crème de la crème. Jackie has worked with some famous pets, including Coronation Street legend Bill Roache's dogs and actor Matthew Rhys' horses, but could she read Vikki's pride and joy? Luckily, Humphrey's curiosity won out, and by the time Vikki had heard all about Jackie's impressive career, he was back, just in time for his reading. And it's fair to say he wasn't too keen at first. Meeting Jackie, he jumped onto the kitchen table, rolled onto his side to lure her in, and then to Vikki's horror, went for the kill. After the bumpy introduction, they were soon ‘chatting away'. He admitted to getting under Vikki's feet too – no surprise, given his attempts to take her out on the stairs. Humphrey also revealed he enjoys when Vikki's young daughter covers him with a blanket and draws pictures of him. Occasionally, he cheekily taps her on the head with his paws. Vikki asked Jackie why he won't sleep in her daughter's room. Humphrey says she needs to be less hands on and stop talking in her sleep. Humphrey is childlike himself, Jackie added, noting his habit of switching between the top and bottom of Vikki's bed. So how would Humphrey sum up his life? Surprisingly, he expressed a fondness for the outdoors, particularly the back garden, and requested "cat mint", a plant he loved in Vikki's old garden. "I had no idea I was psychic for a long time," says Jackie of how she got started in the business. "I got to my early 40s and got stage four cancer, they only gave me four weeks to live. "At that point I had no physical strength. "She talked to my rescue dog who told her I could communicate too and the penny dropped. She showed me how to do it - when it comes into your head it often sounds like your own thoughts and you have to learn to distinguish between the two." Jackie is busier than ever, with clients ranging from everyday pet owners to high-flyers and celebrities. She specialises in spirit work and end-of-life readings, describing it as the most rewarding - and most needed - part of her work. "Animals are so accepting of going to heaven," she says, detailing how she often passes on a dying pet's last request. She recently took on her first bearded dragon. "It told me: 'My skin's actually soft' Jackie recalled. "He looked very spiky in the photo, but his owner confirmed the skin on his belly was soft." Another client was a guide dog who became unusually stressed when his blind owner, who rode horses, took her wheelbarrow over to the manure heap at the stables. She works worldwide, mainly by phone, and can communicate with pets from a photo, a description, or even just their name. Her services are especially sought after in the United States and Australia. Vikki, naturally sceptical, was surprised at how accurate Jackie's reading of Humphrey proved. While there were no earth shattering revelations, she took away plenty of insights and reassurance. By the time Jackie left, it was clear Humphrey was a very happy cat and it was easy to see how these readings bring comfort to owners whose pets have passed away.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered strange "dark beads "above a four-armed star pattern in Saturn's atmosphere. Yet what they noticed instead were dark, bead-like features — separated by vast distances yet possibly interconnected — drifting slowly in the charged plasma of the planet's ionosphere, and a lopsided star-shape structure in the stratosphere beneath. They published their findings Aug. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Saturn's Hexagon was first discovered in 1980 by NASA's Voyager spacecraft and imaged in fine detail by the Cassini spacecraft, which orbited the planet from 2004 to 2017. It rises as an 18,000-mile-wide (29,000 kilometers) six-sided tower whirling above the planet's surface, making a complete rotation roughly once every 10 hours. To investigate, the astronomers focused JWST's NIRSpec instrument on Saturn's ionosphere and stratosphere, located 684 miles (1,100 km) and 373 miles (600 km) above the planet's nominal surface, respectively.

To understand what could be causing the features, and their effects on Saturn's atmosphere, the team hopes to conduct followup observations with JWST.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As only a casual anime watcher, I must admit that when Tissot announced its collaborative PRX with UFO Robot Grendizer last year, I wasn't sure what to make of it. In Australia, Grendizer isn't a household name – but in Europe, it was extremely popular, being one of the first anime series to make its way to the continent (in particular, its French dub was the first-ever anime series to be telecast in France). MB&F's Max Büsser is a fan, as is Tissot CEO Silvain Dolla, which is probably why the collab happened in the first place, and also probably why it's making an encore to mark Grendizer's 50th anniversary in 2025. Like the initial Grendizer release, it takes the form of an automatic 40mm PRX, but immediately differentiates itself from 2024's release thanks to its black PVD-coated case and bracelet. Actually, this marks a first for Tissot: just as 2024's Grendizer PRX was the first-ever analogue PRX without a date window, this 2025 model is the first-ever PRX with a blacked-out case and bracelet. Powering this mecha-inspired mechanical watch is the Powermatic 80 movement, which, as the name implies, offers an 80-hour power reserve and is regulated by an anti-magnetic Nivachron balance spring. The movement's rotor is engraved with a Grendizer graphic, too. The watch comes housed in a capsule shaped like Grendizer's ‘Spazer' UFO, which is itself housed within a striking gold and black outer box boasting drawings specially created for this limited edition, created and hand-signed by Grendizer creator Go Nagai. The Tissot PRX 40mm UFO Robot Grendizer is a limited edition of 1975 individually numbered pieces, in honour of the year Grendizer first aired.
