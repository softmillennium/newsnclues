Fox News contributor Karl Rove discusses the crime issue plaguing the country and how cashless bail and the 'soft on crime mentality' impact city residents on 'The Story.' A New York City felon known as the "Burberry Bandit" is back on the streets after being released from jail following a string of alleged bank robberies. Cornell Neilly, 35, earned the nickname after he was caught on surveillance camera in 2012 wearing a similar pattern associated with the luxury brand, according to the New York Post. Neilly was arrested on Sept. 15 after police said he robbed five banks throughout New York City over the course of one month, the outlet reported. In each case, Neilly allegedly passed a note to the bank teller demanding cash, the NYPD confirmed to Fox News Digital. Cornell Neilly previously earned the nickname "Burberry Bandit" after allegedly robbing several banks while wearing a plaid shirt similar to that of the luxury designer. The teller reportedly handed him $1,000 before he made his escape. Neilly allegedly asked for the same amount of money when he entered the Chase Bank on Park Avenue and East 26th Street on Aug. 25, where he ultimately walked out with $716, the outlet said. Just two weeks later, on Sept. 9, Neilly is accused of entering another Chase Bank in Midtown and demanding $4,500 – but reportedly ran off when the teller sounded the alarm. On Sept. 12, Neilly allegedly demanded $3,500 from the Chase Bank on West Fourth Street in the West Village. Neilly has a long rap sheet of over 34 prior arrests for previous bank robberies, the NYPD confirmed to Fox News Digital. However, upon appearing in front of Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Jeffrey Gershuny, he was allowed back on the streets on supervised release, according to the Post. The 2019 appointee of then-Mayor Bill de Blasio reportedly rejected the prosecution's request for $50,000 cash bail or $150,000 bond. Chase Bank in Manhattan, New York City on July 16, 2024. "It shows a real lack of care for public safety." The controversial decision comes just one month after Gershuny was demoted to presiding over misdemeanor cases in criminal court following an incident in which he reportedly pulled out his own gun on the bench while hearing a weapons case, the Post reported. Sign at the entrance to a Chase branch in Manhattan on Aug. 15, 2025. According to the Post, in an August court hearing, Gershuny asked a police officer to demonstrate how a suspect was concealing a weapon, before reaching for his own gun while presiding over the case. The incident reportedly resulted in Gershuny being moved to hearing night court cases in Manhattan Criminal Court. "The court system does not comment on individual bail determinations, whether in Criminal Court or in Superior Court," Al Baker, spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. That assessment involves due consideration of information and arguments presented by the prosecutor and defense counsel, as well as other materials submitted to the court." Neilly is charged with five counts of felony robbery and is scheduled to return to court on Oct. 1, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Neilly's attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. You can follow her at @juliabonavita13 on all platforms and send story tips to julia.bonavita@fox.com.

Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the House vote that could cause a government shutdown if not passed, putting an estimated 2.3 million federal employees out of work. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., wants to jam Senate Democrats with the GOP's short-term funding extension, but so far they aren't ready to play ball. Republicans and Democrats in the upper chamber blocked dueling continuing resolutions (CRs) from both parties last week and have now left Washington, D.C., until Sept. 29, effectively giving lawmakers in the upper chamber only two working days before the midnight deadline on Sept. 30. Senate Republicans argue that the "clean" extension, which would last until Nov. 21 and lacks any partisan policy riders, is everything Democrats dreamed of when they controlled the upper chamber. Senate Democrats led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., however, argue that they want a seat at the negotiating table and are adamant that expiring Obamacare premium subsidies must be dealt with now, rather than at the end of the year. "They're trying to use what they think is leverage to get a bunch of stuff done," Thune said. Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension to the expiring Obamacare subsidies, clawbacks of canceled funding for NPR and PBS, and it would have repealed the healthcare provisions in President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" — policy that would reverse the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts while also getting rid of the $50 billion rural hospital fund. "This is just a cold-blooded partisan political attempt to try and score political points with a left-wing base." Though he has not taken the option off the table, it's unlikely that Thune would cut this recess short. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., played into that strategy, too, when he announced that the House would not return until after the funding deadline. Thune is ready to bring the same CR passed by House Republicans last week to the floor. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks with reporters outside the Senate Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 10, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., railed against the likelihood that lawmakers wouldn't return to Capitol Hill until the deadline was directly on them. "The Republicans want to shut down," he said. "A) they refuse to negotiate, and B) they're sending us home for the week before the government shuts down. As far as I can tell, there's zero effort, zero effort by Republicans to try to solve this problem." Schumer and Democrats have pinned the blame on Trump and argue that his insistence that Thune only needs Republican votes was a sign that Democrats should be cut out of the process. The top Senate Democrat hoped Thune and Republicans would "now see that the only way to avoid a shutdown is negotiate with Democrats." "But Republicans have now left town with no sign they want to avoid a shutdown in a week. President Donald Trump during a bilateral meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, not pictured, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 7, 2025 (Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also sent a letter on Saturday to Trump demanding a meeting, where the pair charged that "Republicans would bear the responsibility" of a partial shutdown. "As a result, it is now your obligation to meet with us directly to reach an agreement to keep the government open and address the Republican healthcare crisis," they wrote. Trump said on Saturday that he would "love to meet with them, but I don't think it's going to have any impact." "I think we could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time," Trump said. Thune may have defections within his own ranks to contend with, too. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted against the GOP's bill. Only Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., crossed the aisle to support it. Paul's vote against the bill wasn't a surprise. However, Murkowski, who is an appropriator, contended that she wanted a better bill on the floor than the one presented by Republicans and charged that the back-to-back failures of both bills was a "messaging exercise." "I want to project a message of something that can actually get us through this impasse," she said. "And so my message is a short-term CR that also addresses three past appropriations bills that we've already done. We should include a short-term fix of the premium tax credits."

Elon Musk amplified a post from Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, weighing in as transgender bathroom policies again take center stage in the state's off-year election. Musk alleged Spanberger "tr[ied] to weasel out" of a question from ABC Washington reporter Nick Minock about whether the former congresswoman supports biological males using women's locker rooms as the Department of Education scrutinizes five major school districts. "Spanberger obviously does shamefully support boys in girl's sports and is trying to weasel out of the question by blaming the president," Musk said, retweeting Spanberger's response to Minock – who encountered her after she visited an early-voting poll. Minock mentioned the Trump administration is investigating potential Title IX violations in allowing students to use their desired restroom or changing facility, for which Fairfax, Loudoun, Arlington, Alexandria and Prince William County schools under scrutiny. Virginia gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, left; Elon Musk, right. Spanberger replied that court cases brought on the matter of transgender students' restroom use have already played out, including the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who challenged the local school's bathroom policy in Grim v. Gloucester County School Board, arguing it violated equal protection and Title IX. In that case, the Richmond-based Fourth Circuit upheld a lower court's judgment against the school district and ruled its biologically-based restroom policy led to discrimination against Grimm. "In fact, the argument is the assessment is there needs to be much clearer guidance in terms of what is an executive order's binding assessment of Title IX versus what has been a decision of a court," Spanberger said. "But ultimately, the real impact here is, once again, it is the Trump administration taking dollars away from Virginia. Threatening education dollars to our public schools is an attack on Virginia's kids. Spanberger said her priority is making Virginia schools the best in the country and painted President Donald Trump as an official who is "coming after Virginia." When Minock asked again whether Spanberger specifically supported such policies, she did not respond. However, in comments to Fox News Digital, a Spanberger spokesperson rebuffed Musk, saying the Democratic nominee is a mother of three Virginia public schoolchildren and a former federal law enforcement officer who investigated child predators. "Nothing is more important to her than the safety of all of Virginia's kids," the spokesperson said. "Ultimately, Abigail believes that these are decisions between parents and local schools — and she believes that politicians need to stop politicizing Virginia's public schools." Fox News Digital also reached out to Lt. Gov. Glenn Youngkin was credited with pulling off an upset win against former Gov. Many of the individual cases affected schools in heavily-Democratic areas like Loudoun County, where McAuliffe still won, but Youngkin mildly increased expected margins. A case in Loudoun involving a transgender student allegedly assaulting another student also made headlines during the campaign. Earle-Sears has called for requiring students to use the restroom assigned to their biological sex as "common sense," and recently appeared alongside demonstrators outside a Loudoun school board meeting in Ashburn earlier this month. Appearing at an Arlington school board meeting, where a protester held up a sign telling Earle-Sears – who is Black – she should not share her water fountain if people can't share bathrooms, the Republican said the continuing trend is "dangerous, insane and has to stop." There are two sexes: boys and girls." Musk's former DOGE counterpart, Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, headlined a rally on Friday to endorse Earle-Sears, lieutenant governor candidate John Reid and Attorney General Jason Miyares. Reid, who approached and embraced Spanberger at her recent appearance in Henrico, highlighted Musk's comments and said both sides of the aisle "can and should be polite to each other – but also must clearly highlight the differences between the candidates…" "Abigail Spanberger is dodging the trans in the girls locker room issues because she's smart enough to know it's a big loser for her," Reid said. No boys in girls' locker rooms and vice versa. No medical engagement with minors without parental consultation and consent. No underage surgical or hormonal procedures on anyone," Reid said. "We should do our best to let adults make their own decisions as long as they fully own the costs and consequences." Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That was clear yesterday at the Arizona memorial for Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated this month, allegedly by a hate-filled leftist. After Kirk's widow, Erika, forgave her husband's killer, Trump, himself the target of two assassination attempts and years of political attacks, said he admired Kirk's ability to forgive, but it's something he could never do. He wanted the best for them,” Trump said of Kirk. For some at CNN and MSNBC, that was the big takeaway of the hourslong event as they searched for a way to portray it as divisive. Clearly, somebody who she loves, but come out and directly say, ‘I disagree with Charlie Kirk. He added, “And I think that says a lot about where we are and the questions about where we go moving forward. VAUGHN HILLYARD: I think what, honestly, I'll take away from tonight is watching the weight of a woman, a mother, lose her husband. Most people cannot say they've experienced losing a spouse at this young of an age, and I don't know who we are to suggest how somebody should respond in real time. One week after her husband's passing, she went in front of a crowd of 40 to 50,000 people, people watching all over the world. Co-host Elise Jordan: I thought it was just remarkable. HILLYARD: A remarkable moment because in so many ways, where America stands in 2025 is: How do we respond going forward? And the woman that just lost her husband stood there in front of the world and said, ‘I forgive.' Clearly, somebody who she loves, but come out and directly say, ‘I disagree with Charlie Kirk. And I think that says a lot about where we are and the questions about where we go moving forward. Jorge Bonilla, a news analyst with the Media Research Center's NewsBusters, explained our pick: “In the immediate aftermath of the powerful Charlie Kirk memorial, Trump-deranged MSNBC showed that they couldn't leave well enough alone. What began as a complimentary reaction turned into Trump-deranged brainworms for MSNBC consumption. Erika Kirk's testimony of forgiveness towards her husband's murderer stands as a potent example of Christ-like behavior in a most difficult time. But Hillyard couldn't leave well enough alone, and he had to fabricate this oppositional friction where none exists between the Kirks and Trump. It's almost as if they didn't watch the memorial, and its many underlying messages centering around grace.”</p>

Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn reports on the latest in the case against Luigi Mangione, accused of killing a CEO, on 'Special Report.' Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are again asking a federal judge in New York to block the Justice Department's attempt to seek the death penalty if he is convicted in the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, arguing that the government is pursuing capital punishment for political purposes and that top officials have inappropriately discussed the proceedings outside of court. After a photo of the grinning suspect went viral, police found him in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was arrested five days after the Dec. 4 ambush. Luigi Mangione, suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City, arrives at a heliport with members of the NYPD on Dec. 19, 2024, in New York City. In a 118-page motion filed Saturday, Mangione's lawyers accused the Trump administration of using his case to launch the president's renewed push to expand the use of capital punishment and "to demonstrate its loathing of the prior administration" after former President Joe Biden removed 37 out of 40 inmates from the federal death row before leaving office. "Luigi Mangione is a 27-year-old Italian-American dual citizen whose beautiful, promising life has been derailed," six attorneys for Mangione claimed in the motion. "Born in Maryland into a large, close, loving family, he is now fighting for his life against a government that seeks to execute him." In particular, they singled out a comment she made on "Fox News Sunday" in April: "I was a capital prosecutor. I tried death penalty cases throughout my career. If there was ever a death case, this is one." "The Attorney General of the United States is telling the public that based on her personal experience as a capital prosecutor who tried death penalty cases throughout her career that Mangione is guilty and should be executed." Slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's family was allegedly harassed in the hours after his murder by Shane Daley of Galway, New York. According to his lawyers, the Justice Department and law enforcement leaders have "serially violated his constitutional rights." They claim he was "overcharged" with a death penalty-eligible offense and noted that a New York judge recently threw out state-level terror charges brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He now faces a top state charge of second-degree murder. A screenshot from surveillance footage released by the NYPD showed an alleged person of interest wanted in connection with the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. Additionally, the defense accused New York City leaders of overhyping and overcharging the state case, leaking details about a "manifesto," a term they don't want used, and anti-health insurance industry messages written on bullet casings connected to the murder. Federal prosecutors previously shot back that the defense has no authority over how prosecutors present evidence to a grand jury. Thompson, 50, was a Minnesota father of two visiting New York City for a publicly announced shareholder conference. Mangione faces charges in New York, Pennsylvania and federal court in connection with the slaying and the suspected murder weapon, which had 3D-printed parts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• France is expected to recognize the state of Palestine during a summit later today in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized Palestine yesterday. • US President Donald Trump will speak at the UN General Assembly tomorrow. The US remains vehemently opposed to the recognition of statehood and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed “there will be no Palestinian state.” • At least 50 Palestinians were killed yesterday in Israeli strikes on Gaza and the war has overall killed more than 65,000 people, according to the enclave's health ministry. Israel's deepening ground offensive in the Gaza City area has shut two hospitals, according to an aid group and the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The hospitals in Gaza City were forced to shut down Monday due to Israel's escalating military offensive, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. Continuous fire from Israeli quadcopters has made access to Al-Rantisi Children's Hospital and the Specialized Eye Hospital in the territory's largest city “impossible,” UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians said Monday. “It is worth noting that Al-Rantisi Hospital was directly bombed a few days ago, causing extensive damage,” the ministry of health added in a statement. The Israel Defense Forces says more than 300,000 Palestinians have left Gaza City since it ordered civilians to evacuate. In remarks at an emergency meeting of the UN body after Russian jets entered Estonian airspace, Waltz said the United States and its allies “will defend every inch of NATO territory.” “This event, following on the heels of the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, creates the impression that Russia either wants to escalate and pull more countries into this conflict with Ukraine, or doesn't have full control of those who operate its fighter planes and drones,” he said. Waltz, who was confirmed on Friday and sworn in on Saturday, urged Russia “as a permanent member of this Council, to uphold international peace and security, to respect the sovereignty of its neighbors, to cease violating their airspace.” Palestinians in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem offered mixed opinions about the future after Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized a Palestinian state yesterday. It's like they're making a fool out of us. It has no benefit,” Kamal Abu Kweidar, a Palestinian shopkeeper, told CNN. Another shopkeeper, Ishaq Hijzai, told CNN that Palestinians are “peace-loving people” but the situation on the ground is going “from bad to worse.” Today, there is no peace and no safety… From what I see, it is impossible to recognize a Palestinian state and it is impossible for a Palestinian state to exist at all,” Hijzai said. Meanwhile, Khaled Shweiki thanked those European nations who have moved to recognize a state of Palestine. Luxembourg's Prime Minister Luc Frieden has been speaking to CNN today. “The only way forward is to make sure that now the two-state solution gets new energy (and) a second chance,” Frieden said. Luxembourg is set to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, along with France, Belgium, Malta and San Marino. Speaking from New York, Frieden stressed Luxembourg's decision did not show hostility toward Israel but was taken to oppose the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We are taking decisions against the actions of Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, with which we disagree, because those actions are against a rules-based international order.” Obviously, what's going on now in Gaza is a violation of international humanitarian law,” he added. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the UK, Canada and Australia's recognition of Palestine by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.” The Israeli leader said despite immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, he has prevented the establishment of what he called a “terror state” for years. All the more so, we have doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria — and we will continue on this path,” he said, deploying the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is under pressure to announce formal recognition of the state of Palestine after Britain, Australia, Canada and Portugal did so yesterday, piling pressure on Israel over its campaign in Gaza. The flotilla departed for Gaza last week, after gathering around 40 vessels between Sicily and Malta. More than 30,000 people had gathered in front of Rome's Termini station by early Monday afternoon, local police said. After four Western countries formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, at least five others are expected to do so today, as the high-level week at the United Nations General Assembly kicks off in New York. France is expected to recognize the state of Palestine during a summit later Monday, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. • France-Saudi summit: France and Saudi Arabia will co-chair a summit at UNGA this afternoon, in which France – which has spearheaded Western efforts to revive a two-state solution – is set to announce formal recognition of Palestine. • Western recognition: Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized the state of Palestine on Sunday, joining more than 140 UN members who already do so. Belgium, Luxembourg, San Marino and Malta are expected to announce recognition of Palestine later Monday, along with France. • Israel's isolation: The diplomatic moves underscore Israel's growing isolation, and how its war in Gaza has alienated many of its closest allies. The United States, however, remains vehemently opposed to the recognition of statehood and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed “there will be no Palestinian state.” • Impact of recognition: While the recognition of Palestine by Western countries marks a symbolic shift, the situation on the ground makes it hard to imagine that a two-state solution could become a reality anytime soon, according to analysts and activists. • Syria at UNGA: Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has arrived in New York and is set to become the first Syrian leader to attend UNGA since 1967. Al-Sharaa, once an al-Qaeda affiliate, swept to power in December after the regime of Bashar al-Assad crumbled. • Gaza City offensive: Meanwhile, Israel is pressing on with its ground assault on Gaza City, which it is aiming to occupy fully. Dozens of people were reported killed yesterday, as hospitals in Gaza reported receiving nearly 50 bodies in the first 12 hours of Sunday. In July, French President Emmanuel Macron called for countries to join France in announcing their recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly this week. They will join the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal in formally recognizing a Palestinian state. We've been hearing from French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. He has hailed Monday as a “historic day” ahead of a French and Saudi-led summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, when France and several other countries are expected to announce formal recognition of the state of Palestine. As we've been reporting, French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded Western efforts to recognize a Palestinian state and revive the push for a two-state solution. Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of Palestine on Sunday. France is expected to join them during a special summit Macron is co-chairing at UNGA with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It also endorses those Palestinians who have chosen to renounce violence and terrorism.” “Our plan, France's plan… aims for a two-state solution and includes concrete steps to prepare for the immediate post-war period… so that an international stabilization mission can come to Gaza to ensure the protection of both Palestinians and Israelis,” Barrot added. France's plan has been criticized by Israel and its ally, the United States. During a call earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed to Barrot the US' “strong opposition to any unilateral recognition” of a Palestinian state. Al-Sharaa heads a high-level delegation that includes several Syrian ministers and senior officials, SANA reported yesterday. Once an al-Qaeda affiliate and a key player in Syria's bloody civil conflict, al-Sharaa has rebranded himself as a pragmatic leader intent on rebuilding his war-torn nation and repairing Syria's fractured international relationships. The US has signaled a willingness to engage with the new Syrian leadership while emphasizing that it will judge them by their actions. Husam Zomlot, head of the mission, praised UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to recognize Palestine, saying the move was “long overdue.” “International recognition is more than just a diplomatic position. It is an acknowledgement that Palestine has always, always been a land with a people,” Zomlot said at a news conference outside the mission in the British capital.“This recognition is not about affirming what we already know. It is about righting historic wrongs and committing together to a future based on freedom, fundamental human rights,” he added. The Israeli military said “numerous terrorists who were preparing to carry out terror attacks” had been killed yesterday in the Gaza City area, where it is pressing on with a ground offensive. It said one airstrike had set off “numerous secondary explosions.” An intensifying campaign: Israel is attempting to take control of Gaza City, the enclave's largest urban area, which it says is a Hamas stronghold. The Israel Defense Forces says more than 500,000 Palestinians have left the Gaza City area since it ordered civilians to evacuate on September 9. People in the area told CNN on Sunday that northern neighborhoods have emptied as people have moved to western parts of Gaza City or joined the exodus toward central and southern Gaza. Peter, a 70-year-old retired police officer, said the recognition is “rewarding Hamas.” But I don't think this is the way forward. I think it emboldens them and will only lead to further trouble on the world stage,” Peter, who declined to give his surname, told Reuters today. “I think it's acknowledging that there's a people here who are suffering the most awful genocide. And actually, it's time for the rest of the world to say enough is enough and give them a place to call home,” he said. We've been reporting on the growing momentum to recognize Palestinian statehood, with France among a host of nations set to join the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal. Because China and Russia recognized a Palestinian state in 1988, the US may soon be left as the only permanent Security Council member not to do so, reinforcing how Washington increasingly stands as a bulwark between Israel and growing international isolation. Europe and G7 split: Other countries, too, have shown no sign of recognizing Palestinian statehood. France and Saudi Arabia will today hold a summit of world leaders aiming to revive the long-thwarted two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with several of the participants expected to recognize a Palestinian state. French President Emmanuel Macron will co-chair the summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who will attend via video link. The summit comes a day after Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it doubles down on its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. Macron was the prime mover in July, calling for Western countries to announce their recognition of a Palestinian state at UNGA. France is expected to announce formal recognition of Palestine this afternoon. For context: Today's summit, held on the opening day of UNGA's high-level week, seeks to build on recent efforts to revive the two-state solution. On September 12, the General Assembly adopted by a wide margin the “New York Declaration,” proposed during a July conference also co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, calling for a “just and lasting peace” based on implementing the two-state solution. But East Jerusalem has long been annexed by Israel, and decades of expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have turned the would-be state into a collection of disjointed Palestinian pockets cut off from each other by checkpoints, roads, and swathes of land controlled by the Israeli military. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers, most of whom are Jewish, now live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, in settlements considered illegal under international law. In recent months, the Netanyahu government has approved a massive expansion of settlements, including E1, a controversial project to build thousands of new homes that would effectively cut the West Bank in two. Read more about why a two-state solution remains elusive. A growing number of countries are pledging to recognize a Palestinian state, with more than 145 nations now joining the call for international recognition. Many other non-Western states followed suit in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Those recent announcements leave the US increasingly isolated from some of its closest allies on the issue of Israel and how it has conducted its military campaign and aid restrictions. Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of a Palestinian state yesterday, piling pressure on Israel as it presses on with its war in Gaza despite growing international outrage. France is among the countries expected to announce recognition of Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in New York this week. More than 140 other members of the UN already recognize Palestine, a number that has grown in the face of mounting alarm over Israel's war in Gaza. What Israel said: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.” Netanyahu said Israel's response would come after he meets US President Donald Trump next week. Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, said the move is a “welcomed step,” but must be accompanied by “practical measures on the ground.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>West Point cadets walk on campus during lunchtime break at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., April 9, 2014. NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is banning opinions by professors in the classroom and some books and courses in a crackdown that violates the First Amendment, a law professor at the military school said in a lawsuit Monday seeking class action status. Tim Bakken filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court and named the school and its leaders as defendants. He said he wants to protect free speech and the right to academic freedom at an institution where he has flourished despite his public criticisms of the academy and the U.S. military. Bakken also noted in the lawsuit that he has a contract with a publisher for a book that is critical of some aspects of West Point and doesn't want to seek approval from the school's leadership prior to its publication because “it is very likely such approval will be withheld.” The lawsuit seeks class action status for West Point's civilian faculty members, believed to be more than 100 individuals, and a court order to stop restrictions on free speech, along with unspecified damages and legal fees. Bakken's lawsuit said the school began to scrutinize faculty speech after a January executive order from President Donald Trump to “carefully review the leadership, curriculum and instructors of the United States Service Academies and other defense academic institutions.” The lawsuit said the academy in the spring withdrew books from its library, removed words and phrases from faculty members' syllabi, eliminated courses and majors and threatened or punished faculty members for teaching, speaking and writing without prior approval from the school. “As a professor of law, Plaintiff's inability to express opinions on the subject matter being taught is stifling and disruptive to the educational process,” the lawsuit said. It added that he no longer would be able to express to students whether a major or dissenting opinion is persuasive and why. The military academy did not immediately return a request for comment. Bakken, a civilian professor of law in the academy's Department of Law and Philosophy for the last 25 years, is the longest-serving law professor in West Point's history and has written extensively, including books, articles and essays, along with appearances on podcasts, radio and television, the lawsuit said. He seeks class action status for West Point's faculty and a court order to stop restrictions on free speech.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the heart of Africa, in the mineral-rich eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, new recruits are being trained for battle. The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump's claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream. The deal, portrayed as a “wonderful treaty” by Trump, was signed by the foreign ministers of Rwanda and DR Congo in Washington on June 27. However, it has yet to end the wider bloodshed that began after the 1994 Rwandan genocide and is estimated to have killed 6 million people. “Our aim is to go to Kinshasa,” says Corneille Nangaa, a former election-chief-turned-rebel-leader, in an interview with CNN inside the rebel-held city of Goma. Nangaa's rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), of which M23 is a key member, plans to go to Kinshasa, the country's capital, to overthrow his one-time ally President Felix Tshisekedi, whom he considers illegitimate. We need to take away this corrupted regime, and then we need to build the state,” said Nangaa, who heads AFC-M23's political wing. M23, which is allegedly backed by Rwanda, took control of eastern DR Congo's two largest cities – Goma and Bukavu – in a lightning offensive at the start of this year. We got that,” Trump told reporters at a press conference in the United Kingdom alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Most of the wars “were not thought to be settleable,” he added. Experts say his claims to have “solved seven wars” are debatable. CNN visited Goma, home to more than 2 million people, in the week the United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) released a fact-finding report on the escalation of hostilities between January and July 2025 in North and South Kivu, the provinces where Goma and Bukavu are located. The findings “underscore the gravity and widespread nature of violations and abuses committed by all parties to the conflict, including acts that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.” It said, after capturing territories, “M23 engaged in a campaign of intimidation and violent repression through a pattern of summary executions, torture and other forms of ill-treatment, detention and enforced disappearances against the civilian population, carried out with the stated objective of restoring order, security and stability.” Eight months on from M23's violent takeover of Goma, the city's Birere market is once again bustling with hundreds of stalls packed with fresh produce. Women dangle live chickens from their hands, and carry spices piled high in plastic buckets on their heads. “Ça va un peu,” or “it's kind of OK,” says one young man selling brightly colored cloth, when asked how life has been since January. “We have suffered enough already,” another woman selling fish laid out on a small wooden table says. Like many, she declines to talk about life under the control of an armed militia or to give her name. Announcing the findings of the fact-finding report in Geneva on September 9, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said: “My team confirmed that the M23 committed widespread torture and other mistreatment, including sexual violence, against detainees. The report also detailed a massacre that took place in Rutshuru territory, in North Kivu, allegedly at the hands of M23 and Rwandan soldiers – just weeks after the draft Rwanda-DR Congo peace agreement was signed in Washington. “In July, M23 members, together with alleged soldiers of the RDF (Rwandan Defense Force) and civilians armed with machetes, massacred hundreds of people – mainly Hutus – in four villages in Rutshuru. Human Rights Watch also previously documented the mass killings in Rutshuru, near Virunga National Park, a crucial gorilla habitat. The organization said the mass killings appeared to be part of a military campaign against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a mostly Rwandan Hutu armed group that HRW says is formed by participants in Rwanda's 1994 genocide, and other opposing armed groups. M23 says that peace deals since have not done enough to protect the Tutsi minority in DR Congo; critics say this is a pretext and that the Rwandan-backed rebels are seeking to exploit the region's mineral wealth. “I reject all those reports because they are propaganda from Kinshasa,” Nangaa told CNN when asked about the allegations of severe human rights abuses and war crimes leveled at M23 in the reports by the UN and HRW. He claimed that the findings were invented to raise donor funding, calling them all lies. He also denied the group is backed by Rwanda. CNN contacted the Rwandan government for comment on the UN's fact-finding report, but has not yet received a response. The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) “remains a republican army, fully subject to the Constitution, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and applies a policy of zero tolerance for any serious violations in this regard,” DR Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said in response to CNN's questions regarding the UN fact-finding report. Muyaya said the government considers it “inappropriate” to compare M23 to a national army, describing the rebel group as “a subversive armed group, auxiliary to a neighboring State, whose strategy is based on terror, mass crimes and the illegal exploitation of natural resources.” The government closed banks in eastern Congo in response to M23's takeover of Goma and Bukavu, resulting in residents and businesses struggling to access cash to carry out basic transactions. “We are staring down a humanitarian catastrophe,” WFP country director Cynthia A. Jones said. “Without immediate funding and safe access, millions in eastern DRC will be cut off from life-saving assistance. The nutritional situation is deteriorating rapidly, the WFP said, with 4.75 million children under five facing or expected to face acute malnutrition, including 1.4 million in severe condition. More than 7.8 million people are now internally displaced in eastern DRC – the highest figure on record, according to UN figures reported in August. In North Kivu province, “there is fighting going on every day” between M23 and other armed groups and people are still being displaced, one aid worker in the DR Congo, who did not wish to be named for fear of reprisal, told CNN. “There's more than a million people who've been displaced by the fighting in Masisi,” a town around 50 miles (80km) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma, they said. “So that is then creating further humanitarian needs.” CNN met a mother of four young children from Masisi at the border crossing between Goma and Rwanda. It said the “voluntary repatriations” take place under UNHCR's direct supervision in strict compliance with the tripartite mechanism. Camps for internally displaced people have been dismantled by M23 in the months since the group seized control, with many of those sheltering there forced to go back to what remains of their homes and villages. Some of them were able to go back and find their houses, but the majority found that the houses were either destroyed, there were people living in them, and people had taken their land,” the aid worker said. Earlier this year, an order placed for 100,000 post-rape kits, which include medication for preventing infection from HIV and other STDs, that was set to be delivered to multiple organizations treating sexual violence survivors in eastern DR Congo was canceled. “It's really hard to find them here right now, so that has had a devastating effect,” the aid worker said. “Between January and April 2025, more than 7,400 survivors were treated in the Ministry of Public Health facilities supported by MSF in Goma. While colonial-era border disputes and ethnic tensions have helped to fuel this entrenched conflict, control over DR Congo's mineral riches is also at its core. The Central African nation, which is roughly the size of Western Europe, is endowed with the world's largest reserves of cobalt – used to produce batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles – and coltan, which is refined into tantalum and has a variety of applications in phones and other devices. However, previous truce agreements have failed to bring lasting peace between M23 and the Congolese armed forces. Parallel peace negotiations are currently ongoing, namely a Qatar-led process, which have yet to bring concrete results. Nangaa told CNN that Trump has been fooled if he thinks DR Congo's president can offer him minerals in return for peace. M23 this year seized areas where mining sites are concentrated, including the so-called “coltan capital” of Rubaya. But Nangaa denied the suggestion that M23's fight is about minerals, claiming he had not seen any minerals himself. “The root causes of the conflict, is not discussed in Washington… I'm afraid that even if they sign, nothing is going to happen here, because we are in Goma, we are Congolese. We are not going to go in exile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The drug boat destroyed by a U.S. air strike announced on Friday by President Donald Trump was carrying about 1,000 kilograms, or about 2,200 pounds, of suspected cocaine, Dominican Republic officials confirmed. “It is noteworthy that this is the first time in history that the Dominican Republic and the United States have carried out a joint operation against narcoterrorism in the Caribbean region,” the National Directorate for Drug Control said in a post on X Sunday. The strike, which occurred about 80 miles south of Isla Beata off the southern edge of the Dominican Republic, was the third announced U.S. strike in a series of defense efforts to ward off drug traffickers. The Trump administration said the first strike on Sept. 2 killed members of the Venezuelan-based Tren De Aragua gang and the second strike also hit a boat of alleged Venezuelan origin. He said he authorized Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to carry out the attack. “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage en route to poison Americans. It was during this operation that they located the 377 packages of cocaine, 60 of which were completely destroyed in the strike, the officials said. In August, the Pentagon deployed thousands of troops and several naval warships off the coast of Latin America to escalate its efforts to fight the influence of drug cartels. The repeated air strikes have received pushback from Sens. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Tim Kaine (D-VA), who have sponsored a war powers resolution to curb Trump's ability to strike at suspected designated foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five months after ending development of its own obesity treatment, Pfizer is accelerating its push into the rapidly growing field with a nearly $5 billion acquisition. The COVID-19 vaccine and treatment maker said Monday that it will pay $47.50 in cash for each share of development-stage drugmaker Metsera. That represents a premium of more than 42% to Metsera's closing price Friday. Pfizer also could pay an additional $22.50 per share depending on how Metsera's product pipeline develops. Metsera Inc. has no products on the market, but its pipeline includes four programs in clinical development and one in mid-stage testing. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla noted in a statement from the drugmaker that there are more than 200 health conditions associated with obesity, which he called “a large and growing space.” Demand for obesity treatments has soared in recent years, due to unprecedented weight loss provided by regular injections of market leaders Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Co.'s Zepbound. But the drugs can cost patients hundreds of dollars a month, and experts in the field are looking for competition to potentially drive down prices. Pfizer currently has no obesity treatments on the market but has some in clinical development. Earlier this year, the company said it was ending development of a potential once-daily pill treatment before it started late-stage testing, the biggest and most expensive phase of clinical development. Pfizer said the boards of both New York-based companies have approved the deal, but Metsera shareholders still need to OK it. It still needs approval from regulators. Shares of Pfizer Inc. climbed 38 cents to $24.40 before markets opened Monday while Metsera's stock advanced about 61%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (not shown) hold a joint press conference at the Prime Minister's Office, during Rubio's visit, in Jerusalem, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025. Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney delivers opening remarks at the Liberal caucus in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. A woman walks past a vehicle that was burnt overnight by Israeli settlers in an attack that left three Palestinians killed and burnt several vehicles and damaged homes, according to residents in the West Bank village of Kafr Malik, east of Ramallah, Thursday, June 26, 2025. Israeli flags flutter on top of a hill that is adjacent to Palestinian properties that were under attack by Israeli settlers overnight, leaving several burnt vehicles and damaged homes, residents said, in the West Bank village of Bruqin, near Salfit, Friday, May 23, 2025. Those efforts include a new road map for eventual Palestinian statehood in territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, and moves by several Western countries to join a global majority in recognizing such a state before it has been established. Britain, Canada and Australia formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, joining nearly 150 countries that have already done so, and France is expected to follow suit at this week's General Assembly. But the efforts to push a two-state solution face major obstacles, beginning with vehement opposition from the United States and Israel. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has threatened to take unilateral action in response — possibly including the annexation of parts of the West Bank. The alternative, they say, is the status quo in which Jewish Israelis have full rights and Palestinians live under varying degrees of Israeli control, something major rights groups say amounts to apartheid. “Without a two-state solution, there will be no peace in the Middle East.” Peace talks launched in the early 1990s repeatedly faltered amid violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements aimed at preventing a Palestinian state. No substantive negotiations have been held since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, considers it part of its capital, and has long encouraged the growth of Jewish settlements in and around Palestinian neighborhoods. The occupied West Bank is home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship and some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in scattered enclaves. A new offensive threatens to empty and flatten the largest Palestinian city. Netanyahu's government and most of Israel's political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war. The Trump administration has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, instead calling for the relocation of much of Gaza's population to other countries, a plan Israel has eagerly adopted even as critics say it would amount to ethnic cleansing. Perhaps hoping this is a darkest-before-dawn moment, France and Saudi Arabia have advanced a phased plan to end the conflict by establishing a demilitarized state governed by the Palestinian Authority with international assistance. Hamas would hand power to a politically independent committee under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority — something it has already agreed to — and lay down its arms, which it has not. Regional peace and integration, likely including Saudi normalization of ties with Israel, would follow. The Gaza ceasefire talks broke down again when Israel carried out a Sept. 9 strike targeting Hamas' negotiators in Qatar, one of the main mediators. The U.S. had walked away from the talks in July, blaming Hamas, and Israel unilaterally ended an earlier ceasefire in March. Israel also says that creating a Palestinian state would allow Hamas to carry out another Oct. 7-style attack on an even wider scale. Hamas leaders have at times indicated they would accept a state on the 1967 lines, but the group remains formally committed to Israel's destruction. Netanyahu portrays international recognition of Palestinian statehood as an attack on Israel. During a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, Netanyahu said “it is clear that if unilateral actions are taken against us, it simply invites unilateral actions on our part.” Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners have long wanted to annex large parts of the West Bank, which would make it virtually impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state. It also relies heavily on the Palestinian Authority, the current leadership of which is despised by many Palestinians who view them as corrupt and autocratic. Israel says they are not fully committed to peace and accuses the Palestinian Authority of incitement despite recent reforms. The plan calls for Palestinian elections to be held within a year, but President Mahmoud Abbas has delayed previous votes when it looked like his party would lose, blaming Israeli restrictions. Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006, would be excluded unless it gives up its weapons and recognizes Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK CITY – President Donald Trump's problems ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are poised to mar his return to the United Nations in New York City this week, though he is more empowered than he was the last time he made an appearance at the annual leaders summit in 2019. Despite his criticism of the U.N. building and the multilateral organization more broadly, a White House source underscored that Trump “is excited to participate” and is expected to “lay out his vision for a safe, prosperous, peaceful America and world.” “Under President Trump's leadership, our country is strong again, which has made the entire globe more stable,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle told the Washington Examiner, citing how Trump has “brokered seven peace deals, secured historic trade deals and investments, and strengthened alliances across the world.” Through a State Department spokesperson, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defined the U.N.'s core mandates as being “an effective tool for advancing peace, not a bloated bureaucracy that compromises national sovereignty and pushes destructive ideologies like [diversity, equity, and inclusion].” But although Trump may dislike multilateralism and is still contending with the wars, he is heading to the U.N. in a position of strength compared to previous High-Level Weeks. For Jon Alterman, the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Zbigniew Brzezinski Chair in Global Security and Geostrategy, the most striking difference between now and Trump's other appearances at the U.N. is that leaders once “tried to avoid [the U.N. General Assembly] because they thought it would be awkward to run into” him. “Now I think everybody in the world has concluded that they both can and need to engage with him,” Alterman told the Washington Examiner. There is this desire across the spectrum to engage and I think a belief that you're much better off engaging than not engaging. And I think that's very different from the first term when people thought there was too much risk, too much uncertainty, and they would just avoid the encounter entirely.” Leaders are also advantaged now in contrast to then because “there's a much greater understanding of how [Trump] operates, what he prioritizes, his keen interest in negotiations, and his belief that negotiations can resolve differences,” according to Alterman. Regarding Trump's highly anticipated address, Alterman previewed potential presidential references to Israel, Gaza, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, and China, in addition to Iran, North Korea, and maybe even Venezuela. “Getting it so that the allies are moving where you want them to move and the adversaries are moving where you want them to move, and not just the adversaries think they can play him and the allies think they have to hedge against abandonment. More generally, American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Brett Schaefer predicted Trump would speak to two audiences through his address, one domestic and the other foreign. The White House has noted that he's been involved in resolution of conflicts, or at least cessation of hostilities, in about six different conflicts around the world.” More specifically, Schaefer assumed Trump would defend Israel, demand that Hamas release its remaining hostages, and implore Russia to “end the fighting in Ukraine,” though he has repeatedly put pressure on Zelensky to agree to a peace deal with Putin. “The review of U.S. involvement in international organizations has still not been publicly released,” he said. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Alterman agreed that the U.N. has a challenge in how it demonstrates it makes a positive difference, particularly amid the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars. To that end, U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, recognized Palestinian statehood in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank on Sunday before Monday's U.N. General Assembly conference regarding a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians. “As the president stated, he would be rewarding Hamas and would be hindering efforts to bring home the hostages if he recognizes a Palestinian state, and he doesn't think they should be rewarded. So he is not going to do that,” a White House official told the Washington Examiner on Sunday of recognizing Palestinian statehood. Recognizing Palestinian statehood is part of a package that “hopefully takes us from the appalling situation we're in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters alongside Trump last week during their press conference concluding the president's three-day state trip to the U.K. And we need aid to get into Gaza at speed,” he said. Trump, from behind his press conference podium, expressed his concerns regarding recognizing Palestinian statehood, reiterating that his priority is Hamas releasing the hostages, with both Trump and Starmer agreeing Hamas cannot govern Palestinians in the future. At the same time, the limits of Trump's power over Putin will also be on display during the U.N. General Assembly's High-Level Week after last month's meeting in Anchorage, Alaska similarly failed to yield a ceasefire or peace deal with Ukraine. “The one that I thought would be easiest would be because of my relationship with President Putin, but he's let me down. “If the price of oil comes down, Putin is going to drop out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben on why “you can't stop the sun.” Talking about climate change can feel hopeless. But for the most part, it's bad news. So many of the disasters we were warned about years ago are starting to pile on. Now we're staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency and the potential unraveling of what little climate progress we've made. But there's a twist: Solar and wind are booming, and they're now the world's cheapest energy sources. Many cities, towns, and in some cases countries are running almost entirely on renewables. Is it too late to turn this thing around? His new book, Here Comes the Sun, is about the revolution in solar and wind power and it might be the most hopeful thing he's ever written. I invited McKibben onto The Gray Area to talk about that and the many possibilities in front of us. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. This book is much more optimistic than I expected. Much of what I've been describing since The End of Nature in the late '80s is now happening in real time. We're watching the climate system come apart. And yet, at the same time, I have news of one big good thing: a transformation in how we make and use energy that's actually moving fast enough to matter. So I get to be the bearer of some good news, for once. You're clear that we're past being able to “stop” global warming. Stopping warming entirely isn't on the menu. These are enormous systems with momentum. But every tenth of a degree matters. Each tenth we avoid keeps tens or hundreds of millions of people within a livable climate zone. That remains the biggest task humans have ever had: keep the damage within survivable limits. That's why the clean energy news is so important. California, which is the fourth-largest economy on Earth, has quietly hit a tipping point. On many days, it supplies more than 100 percent of its power for long stretches from clean energy. The net result is that California used about 40 percent less natural gas for electricity this summer than two years ago. If that spreads globally, you start shaving tenths of a degree off the future. That's the best number I've heard in almost 40 years of doing this. We're talking in mid-August, more than six months into President Donald Trump's second term. He's doing extraordinary damage and he's doing it with the spineless support of a lot of Republicans who know better. What Trump is really doing — and this should make any American furious — is ceding the energy future to China, often for technologies that were developed here. Now we're practically handing the future to Beijing on a platter. In the long run, that might still be good for the planet because they're pushing these technologies everywhere, but it's a staggering abdication by the US. Second, even here at home, the story isn't finished. The most interesting state in America for energy right now is Texas. It's installing renewables faster than California. In the spring, fossil fuel interests tried to ram through a “DEI for gas” bill, which is basically forcing one unit of gas buildout for every unit of solar. People in rural Texas came out of the woodwork to say, Don't do this. Wind and solar keep schools open, fund elder care. And one reason I'm optimistic is that a lot of this is now mundane economics. We live on a planet where the cheapest way to make power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. This is no longer the Whole Foods of energy — nice but pricey. The federal picture is obviously grim. The EPA under Trump revoked a long-held scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare, which is the legal basis for a lot of climate regulation. Do you think the courts will stop it? But it's an “up is down” administration. They insist DC is a crime-ridden hellscape when the data say otherwise, and they insist climate's no big deal as entire neighborhoods burn, as Texas floods, as wildfire smoke becomes a seasonal feature in the East, and as we log the hottest months in recorded history. But physics doesn't care about press releases. So we can't just rely on the superior economics of solar, wind, and batteries. We also need activism to change laws and minds. There's a lot that states and cities can do — even with Washington hostile. Rooftop solar in the US costs roughly three times as much, and takes far longer, than in many other countries. In Australia, you can call on Monday and have panels up by Friday; 40 percent of homes there have rooftop solar. The difference isn't the price of panels; it's our baroque, Byzantine permitting across 15,000 municipalities. The National Renewable Energy Lab built an instant-permitting tool — SolarAPP+ — and states like California, Maryland, and New Jersey have adopted it. Another example is “balcony solar.” In the past two years, millions of Europeans — apartment-dwellers! — have bought a plug-in panel that hangs off the balcony and instantly supplies around 20 percent of a home's power. That's illegal across the US, except in Utah, where a libertarian state senator asked the obvious question: Why can Hamburg do it but Provo can't? Now you can find people in Utah happily plugging in balcony panels and watching the meter spin backward. Why did so many people — including environmentalists — so badly underestimate how fast solar and wind would scale? That got lodged in our heads. Even climate advocates focused on things like carbon taxes to raise fossil prices so renewables could compete. But about four or five years ago we crossed an invisible line and people didn't update. If you want a date, I'd circle June 2023. That's when global temperatures began their latest spike. Some of the hottest months in at least 125,000 years, and it's also the month humanity started installing a gigawatt of solar every day. Since then the pace has only accelerated. In April, China alone was installing around 3 gigawatts per day, which is the equivalent of a coal plant's capacity every eight hours. In your book, you note that in 2022, China spent 26 times as much on the clean energy supply chain as Europe and the US combined. The Inflation Reduction Act was starting to narrow that gap. With Trump back, how dramatically will that change? Will we get anywhere close to that expected number or will China just continue to lap us? The IRA was our best chance to catch up; parts may survive, but a lot won't. Twenty years from now, the US may be a kind of theme park where tourists come to see how people used to make energy by setting things on fire. Eventually, we'll try to catch up, but we won't be owning that future anymore. I wanted to ask about movement politics since you've been so involved for so long. For decades, climate politics was about stopping bad things — pipelines, leases, drilling. The movement now has to be about building. I've been writing for a year that people like me — old white guys — should stop reflexively suing to block projects we don't like. It's absurd to block solar farms because you don't like looking at them. That's why we're focused on permitting reform at the local and state level. But states — red and blue — can move. If you're a “my home is my castle” American, solar makes that literally truer; if you love the idea of a network powered by something elegant and natural, you're on board for different reasons. Why did this become a red-blue cultural fight when it really doesn't have to be? The fossil fuel industry spent decades and billions making it partisan. The Koch network effectively bought one of our political parties. “Beautiful” isn't a word people associate with utility-scale power — but you lean into it. The sun already gives us light, warmth, and photosynthesis. Big Oil is still powerful, but a lot of what they're pushing — like leaning on countries to lock themselves into US liquefied natural gas — may backfire. If you're Indonesia or Vietnam, do you really want to tie your future energy supply to a fickle superpower? Or do you want to harvest the sun and wind that fall on your own land and sea? There's a perverse wrinkle here: Sun and wind are so cheap they don't fit neatly into a profit model built on scarcity. It's an investment problem for some incumbents. But for countries, cheap power is a competitive advantage. That's what China is aiming at. Meanwhile, if the US insists on expensive options — coal, gas, or boutique nuclear — we handicap ourselves. You also make the blunt point that breaking the centralized power of the fossil fuel industry is a big deal if we do want a more humane politics. Cut emissions or the planet fries — that's incentive enough. About 9 million people die each year from air pollution tied to fossil combustion. And we unlock a wave of useful appliances: heat pumps that use a little electricity to move latent heat in the air and keep homes comfortable year-round; EVs and e-bikes that make cities quieter and cleaner. I have hope that it's worth the try. I can't think of a better way to spend a life than working on the gravest problem our species has stumbled into. On page one you say there's still a path forward. We've never run this experiment with people watching. The last five times the atmosphere filled with carbon — because of massive volcanic eruptions — there were mass extinctions. We're adding carbon faster now than in those episodes. But unlike volcanoes, our “eruptions” are cars, factories, and power plants we could shut down quickly if we chose. It may be that we've already waited too long. The momentum in polar melt and the knock-on effects on jet and Gulf streams are frightening. My first book was called The End of Nature. But for the first time, we have a scalable response. So we should try like hell and hope the Hollywood ending works at least a little. If we don't get this right, what's the world like in 10, 50, 100 years? At 3 degrees Celsius, the UN estimates 1 to 3 billion climate refugees. A couple of million people at our southern border nearly broke American politics; now multiply by a thousand. That's why every tenth of a degree we avoid is the most important political work humans have ever undertaken.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rural health providers that rely on Medicaid funding were already under strain before the bill cut federal health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger recently campaigned in Buena Vista, a 6,600-person town that is losing its clinic, as she tries to improve her party's standing with rural voters ahead of this fall's election. Ken Nunnenkamp, executive director of the Virginia GOP, pushed back on criticism of the Augusta Health closures in a statement to CNN. Augusta Health, which declined to comment beyond its statement, noted in its announcement that patients at two of the clinics could be reassigned to other facilities less than 10 miles away and that it would use a mobile clinic to serve people affected by the third closure. “If two health clinics consolidate in order to provide better, more consistent, and more accessible service to the patients from both locations, that is a win for rural communities,” Nunnenkamp said in a statement. About 7.5 million more people would be uninsured in 2034 due to the policy changes, with 5.3 million of them being affected by the addition of work requirements for many low-income adult enrollees, according to the CBO's most recent analysis. The work requirements are likely to affect rural communities more, said Tim Layton, an associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia, because it's harder for residents in those communities to find employment. “You can expect those places to be impacted by now having people who don't even have Medicaid,” Layton said. Rural health care providers disproportionately rely on Medicaid enrollees. They were already struggling with limited patient pools and long-term population loss. Researchers at the University of North Carolina, cited in a letter by Democratic senators opposing the GOP legislation, identified 338 rural health facilities nationwide endangered by the policy changes, including six total in Virginia. She's been raising concerns with local media and spoke to CNN. “The staff there are so kind and caring. To alleviate the impact of the cuts, Republicans in Washington created a $50 billion fund for rural health providers, inviting “all 50 states to apply for funding to address each state's specific rural health challenges.” “If we invest this money wisely, we won't just have health care systems barely hanging on in rural America,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Provisions like work requirements to root out waste, fraud, and abuse do not take effect until December 2026 or later. By making these reforms in cooperation with our health care providers, we can ensure that all Americans, especially those in rural areas, receive the high-quality health care they deserve,” Cline said in a statement. Layton said the rural health care fund was a “short-term patch,” noting that “$50 billion will go pretty quick.” The Kaiser Family Foundation, a national nonprofit focused on health policy, wrote in a July study that “federal Medicaid spending in rural areas is estimated to decline by $137 billion, more than the $50 billion appropriated for the rural health fund.” Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, has also proposed tapping the state's rainy day fund to help cover additional funding. You know, we have put money aside for rainy day,” Sears said at an event in Marion, according to a report from Cardinal News. “The bank account has never been that full. And so we are ready for any changes that happen.” Spanberger says that rainy day fund – which outgoing GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin said last month held $4.7 billion – won't be enough. This is a bad bill that came out of Washington,” Spanberger said on the first day of early voting in Virginia at an event in Fairfax on Friday. Pete Barlow is a Democrat running to unseat Cline and lives in Augusta County, where two of the affected clinics are. “This administration has really taken a bloody ax to rural health care. He says that as he speaks to people in the community, they don't always immediately “connect the dots” about why they are losing services, but it's a recipe for eventually breeding deep frustration. “How is it making America great again for us to be cutting our rural health care? Lynlee Thorne, political director of Rural GroundGame, a group supporting Democratic candidates in Virginia, said Democrats are “willing to listen” as they engage with rural voters on the policy changes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The initial announcement on Friday ignited immediate and widespread confusion, culminating in chaotic scenes like the one aboard an Emirates flight from San Francisco to Dubai. “Due to the current circumstances, obviously they're unprecedented for us here at Emirates,” he can be heard saying over the speaker of the plane as confused passengers check their phones. “We are aware that a number of passengers do not wish to travel with us. Washington has justified its latest immigration crackdown as a necessary measure to curb what it describes as “systemic abuse” of the program and to encourage the hiring of American workers. The H-1B visa is a work visa that's valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Economists have argued the program allows US companies to maintain competitiveness and grow their business, creating more jobs in the US. For decades, the H-1B visa has served as a gateway for some of India's brightest minds to enter the US workforce, acting as a crucial launchpad for building long-term careers in America. This has not only allowed skilled Indian professionals to contribute their expertise but in many ways, enabled them to become deeply integrated into the fabric of American innovation. The most striking evidence of this success is visible across the top leadership of today's tech giants: Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai, IBM's Arvind Krishna, and Adobe's Shantanu Narayen were all born in India and earned degrees from American universities. India's National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), a non-governmental trade association and advocacy group, said the new order “can potentially have ripple effects on America's innovation ecosystem and the wider job economy.” The second-largest recipient was Indian tech giant Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), with just over 5,500 approved petitions. CNN has reached out to several of the largest Indian beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program for comments, including TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions, HCL Tech, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree, and Mphasis. In a research note, the Japanese financial services group predicted the fee will likely accelerate a strategic shift towards increased offshoring and automation. It also forecast a rise in hiring in “near-shore” locations like Mexico and Canada, with the costly H-1B visa being reserved only for “extremely critical roles” where local talent is unavailable. The move follows last month's imposition of 50% tariffs on Indian goods, which the White House justified as a punitive measure for India's importation of Russian oil. “Service exports have finally been dragged into the ongoing global trade and tech war,” wrote Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, in a note on Sunday. However, Arora also argued that the policy could have an unexpected upside for India, potentially bringing talent back home. While it could concentrate top professionals within India's largest tech firms, she said it could also “catalyze India's transformation into a more powerful global innovation and delivery hub.” “It is a loss for America not India,” he told Reuters. “Those people who go abroad and can't pay that much money, they will open their offices here.</p>

Demonstrators protest an amnesty bill that could absolve former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted for a 2023 coup attempt, in Brasilia, Brazil, Sunday, Sept. 21, 2025. SAO PAULO (AP) — Thousands of Brazilians protested in all 26 states and the federal district Sunday against a possible pardon for former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies, who were convicted of attempting a coup. Calls for demonstrations grew after the lower house Tuesday passed a constitutional amendment that would make it harder to arrest or launch criminal proceedings against lawmakers. The following day the lower house voted to fast-track a bill backed by right-wing opposition lawmakers that could grant amnesty to Bolsonaro, his closest allies and hundreds of supporters convicted of their roles in the January 2023 uprising. In São Paulo, 42,400 people joined the protest, while 41,800 turned out in Rio de Janeiro, according to estimates by the University of São Paulo's Monitor of Political Debate and the nonprofit More in Common. “Right-wing mobilizations have typically been three times larger than those of the left,” Ortellado said. Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Sept. 11 for attempting to stay in power after losing a 2022 reelection bid. He is the first former president convicted of trying to overturn an election in Latin America's largest economy. “They (politicians) are rich, have plenty of money and keep stealing. That's one more reason we're in the streets today,” Brito said. Some of Brazil's most prominent artists helped organize and promote Sunday's demonstrations. Music legends Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil — who defied censorship during the military dictatorship of the 1960s — reunited in Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana neighborhood to protest. “I was outraged by the news that many deputies voted in favor of a shielding law for themselves and their colleagues,” Veloso told Brazilian news outlet UOL in an interview published Saturday. I think I identified with the majority of the Brazilian population, who do not want these things to go through.” Brazilian actor Wagner Moura attended the protest in Salvador, Bahia. Instead, he emphasized “this extraordinary moment in Brazilian democracy, which serves as an example to the entire world.” Sunday's protests were organized by artists and left-wing groups that have struggled to mobilize large crowds compared with the right. Two weeks ago, right-wing demonstrators unfurled a huge U.S. flag during a protest in Sao Paulo, with many thanking Trump for the sanctions against Brazil. Trump called the trial a witch hunt, and in July announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods and explicitly linked the import tax to Bolsonaro's fate. Later, the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on Supreme Court JusticeAlexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case and is seen by Bolsonaro as a foe. Polls show the country remains deeply divided over Bolsonaro. Associated Press writer Eduardo François contributed reporting from Brasilia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is set to advise pregnant women against taking Tylenol due to a possible link between the common painkiller and an increased risk of autism in children, according to multiple reports. The Washington Post reported on Sunday night that President Donald Trump's planned Monday announcement on autism will include raising new concerns about acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and its possible links to the disorder. According to Mayo Clinic, leucovorin is primarily used to combat the negative effects of a cancer medicine and treat certain kinds of anemia, or a deficiency in red blood cells. The announcement makes good on a promise from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to find the cause of what he has called an “autism epidemic” in the country by sometime in September. Both findings were teased earlier this month by the Wall Street Journal, leading to an immediate plunge in the stock price for Kenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol. Spokespeople for the company have since maintained that there is no link between the over-the-counter drug and autism. At the time, the outlet also said those findings would be filed in a larger HHS report, which was expected to be a review of existing research. According to Politico, no such report from Kennedy exists ahead of Monday's presser, citing one unnamed senior Trump administration official. Still, Trump used part of his remarks at the funeral for Charlie Kirk earlier on Sunday to tease what he called “one of the biggest announcement[s] … medically, I think, in the history of our country.” I think we found an answer to autism,” the president told the thousands who attended the memorial in Arizona.</p>
