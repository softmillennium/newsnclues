FIRST ON FOX: Two of the top Republicans in the solid red state of Ohio are endorsing each other, representing a move toward unity in the state where Republicans are hoping to win next November without President Trump on the ticket. "I'm proud to back Jon Husted for U.S. Senate," Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said in a press release alongside an event with Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted in Columbus on Monday night. "Jon represents Ohio values, and he is a common-sense leader who I've known for years. He's a fighter for our families and our freedoms, and he'll carry Ohio's voice to Washington without compromise." Sen. Jon Husted and Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy endorsed each other on Monday night (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) "Vivek has articulated bold ideas for our state, and I believe his vision for excellence aligns closely with the priorities Ohioans expect and deserve," Husted said. The press release touted Husted's "reputation as Ohio's common-sense public servant who streamlines government and expands opportunity" along with Ramaswamy's "perspective of a successful entrepreneur who champions innovation and free markets." Husted, appointed to the U.S. Senate by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to replace Vice President JD Vance, is running for re-election against former Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republicans across the country have circled the wagons in support of the freshman senator. "After 50 years of living off the tax payer, losing an election by a wide margin with $300 million in out of state money, abandoning working Ohioans to be Chuck Schumer's lap dog, and sucking up to coastal elites, it's time for @SherrodBrown to just go away," Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, who defeated Brown last year despite entering the race as an underdog in the polls, said on X after Brown entered the race. "Ohio is lucky to have @SenJonHusted in the Senate!," Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan posted on X after Brown jumped in the race. Husted, who has previously served as Ohio's lieutenant governor and secretary of state, has Trump's endorsement as he runs next year to fill the final two years of Vance's six-year term. Ramaswamy, a billionaire entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector, catapulted onto the political scene when he ran for president in 2024 before dropping out and endorsing Trump but continuing a push for the "America First" agenda as a surrogate. Ramaswamy had also stated an interest in being appointed to the Senate to replace Vance before Husted was appointed. "One of my core areas of focus that I think is really resonating, is elevating the standards of educational achievement in our state," Ramaswamy said earlier this year about his gubernatorial campaign. Ramaswamy launched his Ohio gubernatorial campaign during the event. Ramaswamy and Husted endorsing each other represents a united Republican front between Husted, elevated to the Senate by DeWine, a longtime political stalwart viewed as an establishment figure, and Ramaswamy, who has taken up the mantle of the Republican "MAGA" base in Ohio. RNC surrogate and Ohio attorney Mehek Cooke told Fox News Digital that "this kind of unity is rare" in "today's political climate" and sends a "powerful message" that the Republican Party is a "big tent." "We don't all have to look the same, speak the same, or even come from the same lane to believe in what's best for Ohio," Cooke said. From excellence in our schools, to economic growth that empowers families, to building safe and strong communities rooted in opportunity, Vivek and Jon are showing that when leaders come together, Ohioans win."

During a Monday press conference about various autism topics, federal health officials noted the potential for an existing cancer drug to double as therapy for the neurodevelopmental condition. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Jay Bhattacharya, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz discussed research suggesting that leucovorin, a prescription vitamin used to treat cancer and anemia, is effective in off-label use for children with autism. The FDA plans to approve prescription leucovorin as a "potential treatment for speech-related deficits associated with ASD," according to a press release from HHS. The NIH will also launch new research initiatives into leucovorin's safety and effectiveness. Studies have shown that leucovorin could help some non-verbal children gain the ability to speak. Leucovorin functions similarly to folic acid, helping to restore folate levels in patients who may have difficulty absorbing or using it, according to Katy Dubinsky, a New York pharmacist and the CEO and co-founder of Vitalize, a private supplement company. "Leucovorin is FDA-approved to reduce the toxic effects of high-dose methotrexate in cancer treatment and to prevent or treat certain types of anemia caused by folate deficiency," Dubinsky previously told Fox News Digital. While leucovorin isn't yet prescribed for the treatment of autism, some families have found that its off-label use has led to significant improvements in autistic children's communication skills, experts say. Richard E. Frye, M.D., Ph.D., a behavioral child neurologist in Arizona, has studied the drug in his research of experimental treatments for children with autism spectrum disorder. "Leucovorin is a special form of vitamin B9 that is water-soluble and does not build up in your body," he previously told Fox News Digital. "Folates have been found to be safe long-term for many years and that is why we supplement our food with folate." Leucovorin's main benefit for children with autism is improvement in language, Frye said, but other advantages may include enhanced social function, reduced repetitive behaviors and stronger attention skills. Leucovorin, a prescription vitamin that is used to treat cancer and anemia, has been shown in studies to be effective in off-label use for children with autism. "We do find that leucovorin helps a substantial number of children with autism," he said. Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, also spoke to Fox News Digital about why the drug may have this positive impact. "Leucovorin is given at much higher doses than regular vitamins, so it's very important to work with a doctor knowledgeable in how to prescribe it." Leucovorin is converted to folate in the brain by a different pathway, Siegel said. "Small studies are showing that it improves neurological function and communication skills in kids with ASD, but larger studies need to be done." "One of the advantages of using leucovorin is that it's been used for decades to protect the body from the effects of chemotherapy, so we know what dose to use and any side effects it may produce," Frye told Fox News Digital. The main benefit of leucovorin for children with autism is improvement in language, say doctors, but other advantages may include enhanced social function, reduced repetitive behaviors and stronger attention skills. "Leucovorin is given at much higher doses than regular vitamins, so it's very important to work with a doctor knowledgeable in how to prescribe it," Frye said. While leucovorin is available at pharmacies, Frye said some children need a compounded form because they are sensitive to some of the additives in commercial products. "Our goal is to get leucovorin approved by the FDA for autism so it can be widely prescribed to children as one of the first treatments once they are diagnosed," he previously said. While leucovorin isn't prescribed for the treatment of autism, some families have found that its off-label use has led to significant improvements in autistic children's communication skills. Dubinsky agreed physicians may prescribe the "widely used and well-tolerated drug" for autism treatment based on their "clinical judgment and emerging evidence" — but also stressed the importance of clinical trials. "FDA approval would provide stronger medical backing, making it a recognized treatment rather than just an off-label option," she told Fox News Digital. "This could lead to insurance coverage, standardized dosing guidelines and broader acceptance in the medical community." Siegel added that leucovorin is a "safe drug" and should be considered for large-scale use based on the findings of recent research. Frye said there is "no magic bullet" for autism, with many children benefiting from a combination of multiple treatments. "We believe that leucovorin can improve outcomes for these therapies." An expert pointed out that there is "no magic bullet" for autism, with many children benefiting from a combination of multiple treatments. "There is little evidence to suggest that the benefits observed [in individual cases] can be generalized to the broader autistic community," he previously told Fox News Digital. "While some small studies have explored leucovorin as a potential treatment for people with autism, larger controlled clinical trials are needed to determine its efficacy and safety. We urge families to consult with their doctors before considering off-label treatments." Dubinsky added that if larger studies confirm leucovorin's effectiveness, it could become a more accessible treatment for children with autism who may benefit from it.

This story appeared in The Logoff, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Welcome to The Logoff: The Trump administration has ended a federal bribery investigation into one of its top immigration officials. Last year, President Donald Trump's “border czar” Tom Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from “businessmen” — undercover FBI agents — in exchange for promising to help secure government contracts, spurring a Justice Department investigation. Homan was a private citizen when he is said to have accepted the cash, but he had boasted about playing a prominent role in a potential second Trump administration in the months leading up to the payment. As border czar, Homan has been one of the public faces of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown. He served as acting ICE director in Trump's first term, and claimed last year that he would “run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen.” The Homan story — thousands in cash delivered clandestinely in a takeout bag — would be a major scandal in any other era, under any other administration. Here, it's one data point in a growing body of evidence for the politicization of Trump's DOJ, including the Friday resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert and a subsequent Truth Social post by Trump calling for criminal charges against his political opponents. That's the promise, more or less, of environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben's latest book, Here Comes the Sun, which is all about how solar and wind energy are poised to drive a clean-energy revolution. My colleague Sean Illing spoke with McKibben for The Gray Area, and you can listen to their conversation here (or read an excerpt here).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? We're making this story accessible to all readers as a public service. At Vox, our mission is to help everyone access essential information that empowers them. During a highly anticipated announcement today, President Donald Trump urged pregnant people to avoid taking Tylenol if possible because of the painkiller's possible link to autism. At the same time, Trump promoted leucovorin, a decades-old medication that mimics folic acid and is often used to restore nutrients in patients who are taking chemotherapy drugs. Before we get any further: The link between Tylenol and autism is unclear, and physician groups still recommend the medicine for pregnant people experiencing pain or fever, in consultation with their doctor. Delivering leucovorin could, in theory, improve symptoms — and, in those small experiments, some parents and investigators have been thrilled with the results, as well as the strong safety profile. But the evidence here is also still very limited; one study involved fewer than 50 patients. It is not clear whether this drug would work for all patients on the autism spectrum. Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have been promising the American public answers on autism for months. But Monday's announcement outpaces any science that could adequately back up the administration's guidance. The National Institutes of Health has undertaken a massive review of autism science, but, according to the Washington Post, that research review was not completed in time for Trump's White House announcement.' Kennedy has long theorized that there is a link between vaccines and autism, and Trump, too, indulged in the debunked theory that autism could be caused by vaccines during Monday's announcement. The Make America Healthy Again movement emphasizes, in general, the possibility that pharmaceutical drugs could be causing a number of health problems in America's children. Of course, many autism scientists and advocates are alarmed by the administration's announcement. The evidence linking Tylenol to autism's development is mixed — some studies have found an association, including a cohort study based out of Boston cited by Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary at the press conference. Trump's and Kennedy's fixation that autism rates are rising — and that something must be driving that increase — misses some important context: Most autism scientists believe that increase is actually largely the result of more public awareness about autism, and the subtle ways that it can manifest, as well as a changing and expanding definition of what is classified as autism. As for autism's underlying causes, as I reported earlier this year, our country's leading autism scientists have identified hundreds of genes that are associated with the development of autism-like symptoms. Those scientists acknowledge there may be some non-genetic factors that play a role — such as more people giving birth at a later age — but they dismiss previous claims by Kennedy that a single chemical toxin can explain the uptick in autism diagnoses. The White House press conference “alarms us researchers who have committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said a statement from the Coalition of Autism Scientists. He said repeatedly, “Don't take it,” unless you have an extremely high fever. (Current medical guidance already stipulates that a pregnant person should talk with their doctor before taking acetaminophen for fever or pain.) Some scientists have argued in recent years that there may be a link between taking Tylenol during pregnancy and the development of autism. Other scientists, too, pointed out limitations with the Harvard evidence review. Second, most were observational studies that could have difficulty controlling for confounding factors, like the parents' genetic disposition toward autism, or other drugs the pregnant person may have taken. When taken together, the link between Tylenol and autism is still unclear, and Monday's announcement risks overstating the painkiller's dangers to developing babies. “Regarding Tylenol in pregnancy, this is rushed science and not yet borne out in the data,” Stephen Scherer, director of the Center for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, told me. Discouraging pregnant people from taking Tylenol has its own risks. Pregnant people are already discouraged from taking ibuprofen because of a more serious risk of birth defects, leaving acetaminophen as their first and most reliable choice for relieving pain and fevers. The increase in autism diagnoses is very real: According to a sweeping 2000 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a range of 2 to 7 per 1,000, or roughly 0.5 percent of US children, were diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. That figure has risen to 1 in 35 kids, or roughly 3 percent. But today we have criteria that include a wide range of social and emotional symptoms with three subtypes — the autism spectrum disorder we're familiar with today. It makes sense, then, that as the criteria for autism expanded, more and more children would meet it, and autism rates would rise. Other known risk factors — like more people now having babies later in their life, given that parental age is linked to a higher likelihood of autism — are more likely to be a factor than anything Kennedy has been pointing at, experts told me earlier this year. “It's very clear it's not going to be one environmental toxin,” Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation and parent of a child with profound autism, told me back in May. “If there were a smoking gun, I think they would have found it.” Instead, many autism scientists continue to focus on genetics. Clinical trials for gene-based therapies are getting underway, offering another avenue for providing relief to patients and families — but one that Kennedy, who called genetics a dead end for understanding autism, and the Trump administration have so far ignored. The administration itself seems to acknowledge that Tylenol is far from a smoking gun; that's why the NIH's research efforts are still ongoing. But after promising for months to deliver some kind of answer on autism, this seems to be the best they could come up with.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Residents across the San Francisco Bay Area were jolted awake early Monday by a moderate earthquake that was felt widely across the region. The 4.3 magnitude quake hit shortly before 3 a.m. just east-southeast of Berkeley, across the bay from San Francisco, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, or USGS. No injuries or major damage was reported, but some businesses said windows were broken and merchandise tumbled from shelves. “Things were shaking in our newsroom,” posted Dave Clark, a news anchor for KTVU-TV. In an AP interview, Meteorologist Brayden Murdock, with the National Weather Service in the San Francisco area says earthquakes in the 4-magnitude range are not typically hazardous. Bay Area Rapid Transit trains ran with delays for several hours as crews made safety inspections of the tracks systemwide. BART said trains returned to regular service around midday. People reported feeling shaking as far away as Salinas, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) to the south, according to media reports. “As far as earthquakes go, this is kind of the ones where people feel them, but there's not a whole lot of impacts to them,” said Brayden Murdock of the National Weather Service in Monterey. The USGS said the last quake of a similar size near Berkeley was a magnitude 4.4 that hit on Jan. 4, 2018.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembélé won his first Ballon d'Or award on Monday, while Barcelona's Aitana Bonmatí captured her third straight Ballon d'Or Féminin at the annual soccer awards celebrating the best players in the men's and women's game. Chants of Dembélé's name rang down from the theater's balcony as the French footballer accepted the award from former Brazilian and PSG star Ronaldinho. Dembélé had another brilliant season for the French giants, helping lead PSG to trophies galore, including the European treble of the Champions League, Ligue 1 and French Cup titles. He scored a remarkable 35 times last season. Dembélé scored eight goals and assisted on six others in 15 matches as he led a young PSG side to its first-ever Champions League crown. While primarily utilized as a winger during his career, Dembélé often played down the middle for Luis Enrique's side, spearheading a fluent and formidable front three, flanked by the dynamic Désiré Doué and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. The role suited the former Barcelona man as he was able to link play between his teammates and receive the ball in positions where he could cause the most damage for opposition teams – as seen during PSG's historic night in Munich. Despite not scoring, Dembélé was a constant thorn in the side of Inter Milan and set up two goals while also helping to create another during his side's 5-0 win. Dembélé was able to attend Monday's ceremony as he is recovering from a right hamstring injury suffered during national team duty earlier this month. His teammates couldn't celebrate in person as PSG faced Marseille on France's south coast in a previously postponed Ligue 1 match. No stranger to earning this award, Bonmatí has now been named the best women's soccer player in the world for an incredible three years running. The midfielder has dominated world football in recent years and was once again crucial to Barcelona Femení's success last season. Barcelona picked up a domestic treble as the side continued its stranglehold on Spanish soccer but the 27-year-old will no doubt be disappointed after losing two major finals against English opposition. Bonmatí's Barcelona lost to Arsenal in the Champions League final before falling to England on penalties at Euro 2025. Reigning Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmatí hospitalized with meningitis less than a week before Euro 2025 We are leading by example through all the world. For the new generations coming, I think they can dream about being footballers, not like our generation. This is the best thing we can achieve,” Bonmatí said. Barcelona's Lamine Yamal won the men's Kopa Trophy for a second straight year, awarded to the best under-21 player. She guided the Lionesses to back-to-back Women's Euro titles in 2025. After leading his side to the Champions League and Ligue 1 titles last season, PSG's manager, Luis Enrique, captured the men's Johan Cruyff Trophy. France Football has been honoring the sport's best since 1956.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A collection of elected Republicans and prominent conservatives are stepping in to serve as featured guests on the national college tour that slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk was embarked on before his assassination at an event in Utah earlier this month. The list of prominent speakers includes Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, and Ohio GOP gubernatorial nominee Vivek Ramaswamy, along with influential media figures such as Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson, and Glenn Beck. Turning Point USA, the conservative youth network that Kirk founded in 2012, announced the slate of speakers on Monday, quoting on its website Kirk's wife, Erika, who declared that “our campus tour this fall will continue” despite the tragedy. The organization announced a total of 11 campus dates over the next two months, preserving seven stops originally planned before Kirk's death, and adding four additional events in Virginia, Oklahoma, Alabama, and California. In the wake of Kirk's death, Erika Kirk has been named CEO of TPUSA. Speaking at a memorial in Arizona on Sunday, she vowed to take up her late husband's mantle, saying that the world “needs a group that will point young people away from the path of misery and sin.” “I promise you today, every part of our work will become greater,” she said. Hours after she spoke, she sent a fundraising email expressing her grief and asking recipients to “carry the torch” her husband lit by donating to Turning Point USA.</p>

Ambassador Mike Waltz warned Monday the U.S. and its allies will defend "every inch" of NATO territory after Russian fighter jets violated Estonian airspace. "The United States stands by our NATO allies in the face of these airspace violations, and I want to take this first opportunity to repeat and to emphasize the United States and our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory," Waltz said during opening remarks of the United Nations General Assembly high-level week. The warning marked one of Waltz's first public statements since winning Senate confirmation Friday. It came days after three Russian MiG-31 jets flew deep into Estonian airspace — the closest such incursion to the Baltic nation's Parliament building in years — raising fears Moscow is testing NATO's resolve. Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna revealed Monday morning that the jets were armed. The jets were in Estonian airspace for 12 minutes. Waltz vows U.S. will defend 'every inch' of NATO territory. Tsahkna noted that Russia remains a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council even as it continues its war on Ukraine and now pushes into NATO territory. Article 5 of the NATO treaty states that an armed attack against one or more NATO members in Europe or North America is considered an attack against them all. In practice, this means that if any member nation is attacked, the others are committed to take action. Waltz, a former House member from Florida, served as President Donald Trump's national security advisor until May. A separate vote to confirm him as U.S. representative to the General Assembly did not come up — it's unclear whether that will have any effect on his participation at UNGA. Dmitry Polyansky, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, speaks during a United Nations Security Council meeting. The Estonia incursion followed an incident where at least 19 Russian drones entered Poland's airspace just one week after Polish President Karol Nawrocki met with President Donald Trump at the White House. Last week, Romania reported a Shahed drone of Russian origin was found in its territory. Russia called reports of the incursions "groundless accusations." "There is no proof except the Russophobic hysteria coming from Tallinn," said Dmitry Polyansky, Russia's First Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N., referring to Estonia's capital. "There was a time when Europe was associated with the renaissance, enlightenment cutting edge of philosophy, culture and science. Polyansky claimed the "only ideology" of European states is "primitive hatred" for Russia. "Any events are immediately interpreted through an anti-Russian prism," he said. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting on the jet incursions into Estonia at Tallinn's request. "Russia's reckless actions represent not only a breach of international law, but also a destabilizing escalation that brings the entire region closer to conflict than at any time in recent years," Tsahkna said. "Such a provocation is profoundly disrespectful towards the collective and tireless efforts of the international community to bring an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and to restore peace and stability in accordance with international law."

FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the latest on the Meta antitrust trial as it enters its third week and the FTC's lawsuit against Uber. The Supreme Court on Monday backed President Donald Trump's decision to fire a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, sending yet another signal that the high court intends to revisit a 90-year-old court precedent about executive firing power. The temporary decision to maintain Biden-appointed Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter's termination was issued 6-3 along ideological lines. Trump's decision to fire Slaughter and another Democrat-appointed commissioner, Alvaro Bedoya, faced legal challenges because it stood in tension with the FTC Act, which says commissioners should only be fired from their seven-year tenures for cause, such as malfeasance. Rebecca Slaughter, commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, testifies before the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, D.C., on July 13, 2023. Trump fired Slaughter and Bedoya shortly after he took office without citing a cause other than the president's broad constitutional authority over the executive branch. Bedoya resigned, but Slaughter vowed to fight her firing in court and see the case through to its conclusion. A lower court initially sided with Slaughter and reinstated her, but she has since been fired and rehired several times as her case made its way to the Supreme Court. The case raises a pivotal question of whether Trump has the ability to fire members of independent agencies as the president pushes for a more unified executive branch. Independent agencies, such as the FTC, various labor boards and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have long been insulated by law from at-will firings. The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. (AP/Jon Elswick) Slaughter had argued to the Supreme Court that siding with Trump, even on an interim basis, directly flew in the face of the precedent set in Humphrey's Executor vs. the United States, which deemed President Franklin D. Roosevelt's firing of an FTC commissioner unlawful. Legal experts have speculated that the current conservative-leaning Supreme Court is interested in narrowing or reversing Humphrey's Executor, which could carry broader implications about a president's ability to fire members of certain independent agencies. The three liberal justices dissented and would have denied Trump's stay request. Writing for the dissent, Justice Elena Kagan speculated that the court's majority may be "raring" to reverse Humphrey's Executor. "Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars," Kagan wrote. "Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation's separation of powers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That was clear yesterday at the Arizona memorial for Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated this month, allegedly by a hate-filled leftist. After Kirk's widow, Erika, forgave her husband's killer, Trump, himself the target of two assassination attempts and years of political attacks, said he admired Kirk's ability to forgive, but it's something he could never do. He wanted the best for them,” Trump said of Kirk. For some at CNN and MSNBC, that was the big takeaway of the hourslong event as they searched for a way to portray it as divisive. Clearly, somebody who she loves, but come out and directly say, ‘I disagree with Charlie Kirk. He added, “And I think that says a lot about where we are and the questions about where we go moving forward. VAUGHN HILLYARD: I think what, honestly, I'll take away from tonight is watching the weight of a woman, a mother, lose her husband. Most people cannot say they've experienced losing a spouse at this young of an age, and I don't know who we are to suggest how somebody should respond in real time. One week after her husband's passing, she went in front of a crowd of 40 to 50,000 people, people watching all over the world. Co-host Elise Jordan: I thought it was just remarkable. HILLYARD: A remarkable moment because in so many ways, where America stands in 2025 is: How do we respond going forward? And the woman that just lost her husband stood there in front of the world and said, ‘I forgive.' Clearly, somebody who she loves, but come out and directly say, ‘I disagree with Charlie Kirk. And I think that says a lot about where we are and the questions about where we go moving forward. Jorge Bonilla, a news analyst with the Media Research Center's NewsBusters, explained our pick: “In the immediate aftermath of the powerful Charlie Kirk memorial, Trump-deranged MSNBC showed that they couldn't leave well enough alone. What began as a complimentary reaction turned into Trump-deranged brainworms for MSNBC consumption. Erika Kirk's testimony of forgiveness towards her husband's murderer stands as a potent example of Christ-like behavior in a most difficult time. But Hillyard couldn't leave well enough alone, and he had to fabricate this oppositional friction where none exists between the Kirks and Trump. It's almost as if they didn't watch the memorial, and its many underlying messages centering around grace.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• France is expected to recognize the state of Palestine during a summit later today in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized Palestine yesterday. • US President Donald Trump will speak at the UN General Assembly tomorrow. The US remains vehemently opposed to the recognition of statehood and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed “there will be no Palestinian state.” • At least 50 Palestinians were killed yesterday in Israeli strikes on Gaza and the war has overall killed more than 65,000 people, according to the enclave's health ministry. Israel's deepening ground offensive in the Gaza City area has shut two hospitals, according to an aid group and the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The hospitals in Gaza City were forced to shut down Monday due to Israel's escalating military offensive, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. Continuous fire from Israeli quadcopters has made access to Al-Rantisi Children's Hospital and the Specialized Eye Hospital in the territory's largest city “impossible,” UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians said Monday. “It is worth noting that Al-Rantisi Hospital was directly bombed a few days ago, causing extensive damage,” the ministry of health added in a statement. The Israel Defense Forces says more than 300,000 Palestinians have left Gaza City since it ordered civilians to evacuate. In remarks at an emergency meeting of the UN body after Russian jets entered Estonian airspace, Waltz said the United States and its allies “will defend every inch of NATO territory.” “This event, following on the heels of the Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace, creates the impression that Russia either wants to escalate and pull more countries into this conflict with Ukraine, or doesn't have full control of those who operate its fighter planes and drones,” he said. Waltz, who was confirmed on Friday and sworn in on Saturday, urged Russia “as a permanent member of this Council, to uphold international peace and security, to respect the sovereignty of its neighbors, to cease violating their airspace.” Palestinians in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem offered mixed opinions about the future after Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized a Palestinian state yesterday. It's like they're making a fool out of us. It has no benefit,” Kamal Abu Kweidar, a Palestinian shopkeeper, told CNN. Another shopkeeper, Ishaq Hijzai, told CNN that Palestinians are “peace-loving people” but the situation on the ground is going “from bad to worse.” Today, there is no peace and no safety… From what I see, it is impossible to recognize a Palestinian state and it is impossible for a Palestinian state to exist at all,” Hijzai said. Meanwhile, Khaled Shweiki thanked those European nations who have moved to recognize a state of Palestine. Luxembourg's Prime Minister Luc Frieden has been speaking to CNN today. “The only way forward is to make sure that now the two-state solution gets new energy (and) a second chance,” Frieden said. Luxembourg is set to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, along with France, Belgium, Malta and San Marino. Speaking from New York, Frieden stressed Luxembourg's decision did not show hostility toward Israel but was taken to oppose the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We are taking decisions against the actions of Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, with which we disagree, because those actions are against a rules-based international order.” Obviously, what's going on now in Gaza is a violation of international humanitarian law,” he added. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the UK, Canada and Australia's recognition of Palestine by vowing “there will be no Palestinian state.” The Israeli leader said despite immense pressure, both domestically and internationally, he has prevented the establishment of what he called a “terror state” for years. All the more so, we have doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria — and we will continue on this path,” he said, deploying the term usually used in Israel to refer to the occupied West Bank. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is under pressure to announce formal recognition of the state of Palestine after Britain, Australia, Canada and Portugal did so yesterday, piling pressure on Israel over its campaign in Gaza. The flotilla departed for Gaza last week, after gathering around 40 vessels between Sicily and Malta. More than 30,000 people had gathered in front of Rome's Termini station by early Monday afternoon, local police said. After four Western countries formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, at least five others are expected to do so today, as the high-level week at the United Nations General Assembly kicks off in New York. France is expected to recognize the state of Palestine during a summit later Monday, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. • France-Saudi summit: France and Saudi Arabia will co-chair a summit at UNGA this afternoon, in which France – which has spearheaded Western efforts to revive a two-state solution – is set to announce formal recognition of Palestine. • Western recognition: Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal formally recognized the state of Palestine on Sunday, joining more than 140 UN members who already do so. Belgium, Luxembourg, San Marino and Malta are expected to announce recognition of Palestine later Monday, along with France. • Israel's isolation: The diplomatic moves underscore Israel's growing isolation, and how its war in Gaza has alienated many of its closest allies. The United States, however, remains vehemently opposed to the recognition of statehood and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed “there will be no Palestinian state.” • Impact of recognition: While the recognition of Palestine by Western countries marks a symbolic shift, the situation on the ground makes it hard to imagine that a two-state solution could become a reality anytime soon, according to analysts and activists. • Syria at UNGA: Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has arrived in New York and is set to become the first Syrian leader to attend UNGA since 1967. Al-Sharaa, once an al-Qaeda affiliate, swept to power in December after the regime of Bashar al-Assad crumbled. • Gaza City offensive: Meanwhile, Israel is pressing on with its ground assault on Gaza City, which it is aiming to occupy fully. Dozens of people were reported killed yesterday, as hospitals in Gaza reported receiving nearly 50 bodies in the first 12 hours of Sunday. In July, French President Emmanuel Macron called for countries to join France in announcing their recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly this week. They will join the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal in formally recognizing a Palestinian state. We've been hearing from French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. He has hailed Monday as a “historic day” ahead of a French and Saudi-led summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, when France and several other countries are expected to announce formal recognition of the state of Palestine. As we've been reporting, French President Emmanuel Macron has spearheaded Western efforts to recognize a Palestinian state and revive the push for a two-state solution. Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of Palestine on Sunday. France is expected to join them during a special summit Macron is co-chairing at UNGA with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It also endorses those Palestinians who have chosen to renounce violence and terrorism.” “Our plan, France's plan… aims for a two-state solution and includes concrete steps to prepare for the immediate post-war period… so that an international stabilization mission can come to Gaza to ensure the protection of both Palestinians and Israelis,” Barrot added. France's plan has been criticized by Israel and its ally, the United States. During a call earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stressed to Barrot the US' “strong opposition to any unilateral recognition” of a Palestinian state. Al-Sharaa heads a high-level delegation that includes several Syrian ministers and senior officials, SANA reported yesterday. Once an al-Qaeda affiliate and a key player in Syria's bloody civil conflict, al-Sharaa has rebranded himself as a pragmatic leader intent on rebuilding his war-torn nation and repairing Syria's fractured international relationships. The US has signaled a willingness to engage with the new Syrian leadership while emphasizing that it will judge them by their actions. Husam Zomlot, head of the mission, praised UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to recognize Palestine, saying the move was “long overdue.” “International recognition is more than just a diplomatic position. It is an acknowledgement that Palestine has always, always been a land with a people,” Zomlot said at a news conference outside the mission in the British capital.“This recognition is not about affirming what we already know. It is about righting historic wrongs and committing together to a future based on freedom, fundamental human rights,” he added. The Israeli military said “numerous terrorists who were preparing to carry out terror attacks” had been killed yesterday in the Gaza City area, where it is pressing on with a ground offensive. It said one airstrike had set off “numerous secondary explosions.” An intensifying campaign: Israel is attempting to take control of Gaza City, the enclave's largest urban area, which it says is a Hamas stronghold. The Israel Defense Forces says more than 500,000 Palestinians have left the Gaza City area since it ordered civilians to evacuate on September 9. People in the area told CNN on Sunday that northern neighborhoods have emptied as people have moved to western parts of Gaza City or joined the exodus toward central and southern Gaza. Peter, a 70-year-old retired police officer, said the recognition is “rewarding Hamas.” But I don't think this is the way forward. I think it emboldens them and will only lead to further trouble on the world stage,” Peter, who declined to give his surname, told Reuters today. “I think it's acknowledging that there's a people here who are suffering the most awful genocide. And actually, it's time for the rest of the world to say enough is enough and give them a place to call home,” he said. We've been reporting on the growing momentum to recognize Palestinian statehood, with France among a host of nations set to join the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal. Because China and Russia recognized a Palestinian state in 1988, the US may soon be left as the only permanent Security Council member not to do so, reinforcing how Washington increasingly stands as a bulwark between Israel and growing international isolation. Europe and G7 split: Other countries, too, have shown no sign of recognizing Palestinian statehood. France and Saudi Arabia will today hold a summit of world leaders aiming to revive the long-thwarted two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with several of the participants expected to recognize a Palestinian state. French President Emmanuel Macron will co-chair the summit at the United Nations General Assembly in New York with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who will attend via video link. The summit comes a day after Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it doubles down on its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage. Macron was the prime mover in July, calling for Western countries to announce their recognition of a Palestinian state at UNGA. France is expected to announce formal recognition of Palestine this afternoon. For context: Today's summit, held on the opening day of UNGA's high-level week, seeks to build on recent efforts to revive the two-state solution. On September 12, the General Assembly adopted by a wide margin the “New York Declaration,” proposed during a July conference also co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, calling for a “just and lasting peace” based on implementing the two-state solution. But East Jerusalem has long been annexed by Israel, and decades of expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have turned the would-be state into a collection of disjointed Palestinian pockets cut off from each other by checkpoints, roads, and swathes of land controlled by the Israeli military. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers, most of whom are Jewish, now live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, in settlements considered illegal under international law. In recent months, the Netanyahu government has approved a massive expansion of settlements, including E1, a controversial project to build thousands of new homes that would effectively cut the West Bank in two. Read more about why a two-state solution remains elusive. A growing number of countries are pledging to recognize a Palestinian state, with more than 145 nations now joining the call for international recognition. Many other non-Western states followed suit in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Those recent announcements leave the US increasingly isolated from some of its closest allies on the issue of Israel and how it has conducted its military campaign and aid restrictions. Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced formal recognition of a Palestinian state yesterday, piling pressure on Israel as it presses on with its war in Gaza despite growing international outrage. France is among the countries expected to announce recognition of Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in New York this week. More than 140 other members of the UN already recognize Palestine, a number that has grown in the face of mounting alarm over Israel's war in Gaza. What Israel said: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.” Netanyahu said Israel's response would come after he meets US President Donald Trump next week. Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas' political office, said the move is a “welcomed step,” but must be accompanied by “practical measures on the ground.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>West Point cadets walk on campus during lunchtime break at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., April 9, 2014. NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Military Academy at West Point is banning opinions by professors in the classroom and some books and courses in a crackdown that violates the First Amendment, a law professor at the military school said in a lawsuit Monday seeking class action status. Tim Bakken filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court and named the school and its leaders as defendants. He said he wants to protect free speech and the right to academic freedom at an institution where he has flourished despite his public criticisms of the academy and the U.S. military. Bakken also noted in the lawsuit that he has a contract with a publisher for a book that is critical of some aspects of West Point and doesn't want to seek approval from the school's leadership prior to its publication because “it is very likely such approval will be withheld.” The lawsuit seeks class action status for West Point's civilian faculty members, believed to be more than 100 individuals, and a court order to stop restrictions on free speech, along with unspecified damages and legal fees. Bakken's lawsuit said the school began to scrutinize faculty speech after a January executive order from President Donald Trump to “carefully review the leadership, curriculum and instructors of the United States Service Academies and other defense academic institutions.” The lawsuit said the academy in the spring withdrew books from its library, removed words and phrases from faculty members' syllabi, eliminated courses and majors and threatened or punished faculty members for teaching, speaking and writing without prior approval from the school. “As a professor of law, Plaintiff's inability to express opinions on the subject matter being taught is stifling and disruptive to the educational process,” the lawsuit said. It added that he no longer would be able to express to students whether a major or dissenting opinion is persuasive and why. The military academy did not immediately return a request for comment. Bakken, a civilian professor of law in the academy's Department of Law and Philosophy for the last 25 years, is the longest-serving law professor in West Point's history and has written extensively, including books, articles and essays, along with appearances on podcasts, radio and television, the lawsuit said. He seeks class action status for West Point's faculty and a court order to stop restrictions on free speech.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the heart of Africa, in the mineral-rich eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, new recruits are being trained for battle. The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump's claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream. The deal, portrayed as a “wonderful treaty” by Trump, was signed by the foreign ministers of Rwanda and DR Congo in Washington on June 27. However, it has yet to end the wider bloodshed that began after the 1994 Rwandan genocide and is estimated to have killed 6 million people. “Our aim is to go to Kinshasa,” says Corneille Nangaa, a former election-chief-turned-rebel-leader, in an interview with CNN inside the rebel-held city of Goma. Nangaa's rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), of which M23 is a key member, plans to go to Kinshasa, the country's capital, to overthrow his one-time ally President Felix Tshisekedi, whom he considers illegitimate. We need to take away this corrupted regime, and then we need to build the state,” said Nangaa, who heads AFC-M23's political wing. M23, which is allegedly backed by Rwanda, took control of eastern DR Congo's two largest cities – Goma and Bukavu – in a lightning offensive at the start of this year. We got that,” Trump told reporters at a press conference in the United Kingdom alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. Most of the wars “were not thought to be settleable,” he added. Experts say his claims to have “solved seven wars” are debatable. CNN visited Goma, home to more than 2 million people, in the week the United Nations Human Rights Office (OHCHR) released a fact-finding report on the escalation of hostilities between January and July 2025 in North and South Kivu, the provinces where Goma and Bukavu are located. The findings “underscore the gravity and widespread nature of violations and abuses committed by all parties to the conflict, including acts that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.” It said, after capturing territories, “M23 engaged in a campaign of intimidation and violent repression through a pattern of summary executions, torture and other forms of ill-treatment, detention and enforced disappearances against the civilian population, carried out with the stated objective of restoring order, security and stability.” Eight months on from M23's violent takeover of Goma, the city's Birere market is once again bustling with hundreds of stalls packed with fresh produce. Women dangle live chickens from their hands, and carry spices piled high in plastic buckets on their heads. “Ça va un peu,” or “it's kind of OK,” says one young man selling brightly colored cloth, when asked how life has been since January. “We have suffered enough already,” another woman selling fish laid out on a small wooden table says. Like many, she declines to talk about life under the control of an armed militia or to give her name. Announcing the findings of the fact-finding report in Geneva on September 9, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said: “My team confirmed that the M23 committed widespread torture and other mistreatment, including sexual violence, against detainees. The report also detailed a massacre that took place in Rutshuru territory, in North Kivu, allegedly at the hands of M23 and Rwandan soldiers – just weeks after the draft Rwanda-DR Congo peace agreement was signed in Washington. “In July, M23 members, together with alleged soldiers of the RDF (Rwandan Defense Force) and civilians armed with machetes, massacred hundreds of people – mainly Hutus – in four villages in Rutshuru. Human Rights Watch also previously documented the mass killings in Rutshuru, near Virunga National Park, a crucial gorilla habitat. The organization said the mass killings appeared to be part of a military campaign against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a mostly Rwandan Hutu armed group that HRW says is formed by participants in Rwanda's 1994 genocide, and other opposing armed groups. M23 says that peace deals since have not done enough to protect the Tutsi minority in DR Congo; critics say this is a pretext and that the Rwandan-backed rebels are seeking to exploit the region's mineral wealth. “I reject all those reports because they are propaganda from Kinshasa,” Nangaa told CNN when asked about the allegations of severe human rights abuses and war crimes leveled at M23 in the reports by the UN and HRW. He claimed that the findings were invented to raise donor funding, calling them all lies. He also denied the group is backed by Rwanda. CNN contacted the Rwandan government for comment on the UN's fact-finding report, but has not yet received a response. The Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) “remains a republican army, fully subject to the Constitution, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and applies a policy of zero tolerance for any serious violations in this regard,” DR Congo government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya said in response to CNN's questions regarding the UN fact-finding report. Muyaya said the government considers it “inappropriate” to compare M23 to a national army, describing the rebel group as “a subversive armed group, auxiliary to a neighboring State, whose strategy is based on terror, mass crimes and the illegal exploitation of natural resources.” The government closed banks in eastern Congo in response to M23's takeover of Goma and Bukavu, resulting in residents and businesses struggling to access cash to carry out basic transactions. “We are staring down a humanitarian catastrophe,” WFP country director Cynthia A. Jones said. “Without immediate funding and safe access, millions in eastern DRC will be cut off from life-saving assistance. The nutritional situation is deteriorating rapidly, the WFP said, with 4.75 million children under five facing or expected to face acute malnutrition, including 1.4 million in severe condition. More than 7.8 million people are now internally displaced in eastern DRC – the highest figure on record, according to UN figures reported in August. In North Kivu province, “there is fighting going on every day” between M23 and other armed groups and people are still being displaced, one aid worker in the DR Congo, who did not wish to be named for fear of reprisal, told CNN. “There's more than a million people who've been displaced by the fighting in Masisi,” a town around 50 miles (80km) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma, they said. “So that is then creating further humanitarian needs.” CNN met a mother of four young children from Masisi at the border crossing between Goma and Rwanda. It said the “voluntary repatriations” take place under UNHCR's direct supervision in strict compliance with the tripartite mechanism. Camps for internally displaced people have been dismantled by M23 in the months since the group seized control, with many of those sheltering there forced to go back to what remains of their homes and villages. Some of them were able to go back and find their houses, but the majority found that the houses were either destroyed, there were people living in them, and people had taken their land,” the aid worker said. Earlier this year, an order placed for 100,000 post-rape kits, which include medication for preventing infection from HIV and other STDs, that was set to be delivered to multiple organizations treating sexual violence survivors in eastern DR Congo was canceled. “It's really hard to find them here right now, so that has had a devastating effect,” the aid worker said. “Between January and April 2025, more than 7,400 survivors were treated in the Ministry of Public Health facilities supported by MSF in Goma. While colonial-era border disputes and ethnic tensions have helped to fuel this entrenched conflict, control over DR Congo's mineral riches is also at its core. The Central African nation, which is roughly the size of Western Europe, is endowed with the world's largest reserves of cobalt – used to produce batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles – and coltan, which is refined into tantalum and has a variety of applications in phones and other devices. However, previous truce agreements have failed to bring lasting peace between M23 and the Congolese armed forces. Parallel peace negotiations are currently ongoing, namely a Qatar-led process, which have yet to bring concrete results. Nangaa told CNN that Trump has been fooled if he thinks DR Congo's president can offer him minerals in return for peace. M23 this year seized areas where mining sites are concentrated, including the so-called “coltan capital” of Rubaya. But Nangaa denied the suggestion that M23's fight is about minerals, claiming he had not seen any minerals himself. “The root causes of the conflict, is not discussed in Washington… I'm afraid that even if they sign, nothing is going to happen here, because we are in Goma, we are Congolese. We are not going to go in exile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The drug boat destroyed by a U.S. air strike announced on Friday by President Donald Trump was carrying about 1,000 kilograms, or about 2,200 pounds, of suspected cocaine, Dominican Republic officials confirmed. “It is noteworthy that this is the first time in history that the Dominican Republic and the United States have carried out a joint operation against narcoterrorism in the Caribbean region,” the National Directorate for Drug Control said in a post on X Sunday. The strike, which occurred about 80 miles south of Isla Beata off the southern edge of the Dominican Republic, was the third announced U.S. strike in a series of defense efforts to ward off drug traffickers. The Trump administration said the first strike on Sept. 2 killed members of the Venezuelan-based Tren De Aragua gang and the second strike also hit a boat of alleged Venezuelan origin. He said he authorized Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to carry out the attack. “Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage en route to poison Americans. It was during this operation that they located the 377 packages of cocaine, 60 of which were completely destroyed in the strike, the officials said. In August, the Pentagon deployed thousands of troops and several naval warships off the coast of Latin America to escalate its efforts to fight the influence of drug cartels. The repeated air strikes have received pushback from Sens. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Tim Kaine (D-VA), who have sponsored a war powers resolution to curb Trump's ability to strike at suspected designated foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five months after ending development of its own obesity treatment, Pfizer is accelerating its push into the rapidly growing field with a nearly $5 billion acquisition. The COVID-19 vaccine and treatment maker said Monday that it will pay $47.50 in cash for each share of development-stage drugmaker Metsera. That represents a premium of more than 42% to Metsera's closing price Friday. Pfizer also could pay an additional $22.50 per share depending on how Metsera's product pipeline develops. Metsera Inc. has no products on the market, but its pipeline includes four programs in clinical development and one in mid-stage testing. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla noted in a statement from the drugmaker that there are more than 200 health conditions associated with obesity, which he called “a large and growing space.” Demand for obesity treatments has soared in recent years, due to unprecedented weight loss provided by regular injections of market leaders Wegovy from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly and Co.'s Zepbound. But the drugs can cost patients hundreds of dollars a month, and experts in the field are looking for competition to potentially drive down prices. Pfizer currently has no obesity treatments on the market but has some in clinical development. Earlier this year, the company said it was ending development of a potential once-daily pill treatment before it started late-stage testing, the biggest and most expensive phase of clinical development. Pfizer said the boards of both New York-based companies have approved the deal, but Metsera shareholders still need to OK it. It still needs approval from regulators. Shares of Pfizer Inc. climbed 38 cents to $24.40 before markets opened Monday while Metsera's stock advanced about 61%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (not shown) hold a joint press conference at the Prime Minister's Office, during Rubio's visit, in Jerusalem, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025. A woman walks past a vehicle that was burnt overnight by Israeli settlers in an attack that left three Palestinians killed and burnt several vehicles and damaged homes, according to residents in the West Bank village of Kafr Malik, east of Ramallah, Thursday, June 26, 2025. Israeli flags flutter on top of a hill that is adjacent to Palestinian properties that were under attack by Israeli settlers overnight, leaving several burnt vehicles and damaged homes, residents said, in the West Bank village of Bruqin, near Salfit, Friday, May 23, 2025. Those efforts include a new road map for eventual Palestinian statehood in territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, and moves by several Western countries to join a global majority in recognizing such a state before it has been established. Britain, Canada and Australia formally recognized a Palestinian state on Sunday, joining nearly 150 countries that have already done so, and France is expected to follow suit at this week's General Assembly. But the efforts to push a two-state solution face major obstacles, beginning with vehement opposition from the United States and Israel. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposed to Palestinian statehood, has threatened to take unilateral action in response — possibly including the annexation of parts of the West Bank. The alternative, they say, is the status quo in which Jewish Israelis have full rights and Palestinians live under varying degrees of Israeli control, something major rights groups say amounts to apartheid. “Without a two-state solution, there will be no peace in the Middle East.” Peace talks launched in the early 1990s repeatedly faltered amid violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements aimed at preventing a Palestinian state. No substantive negotiations have been held since Netanyahu returned to office in 2009. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, considers it part of its capital, and has long encouraged the growth of Jewish settlements in and around Palestinian neighborhoods. The occupied West Bank is home to over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship and some 3 million Palestinians who live under Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in scattered enclaves. A new offensive threatens to empty and flatten the largest Palestinian city. Netanyahu's government and most of Israel's political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war. The Trump administration has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, instead calling for the relocation of much of Gaza's population to other countries, a plan Israel has eagerly adopted even as critics say it would amount to ethnic cleansing. Perhaps hoping this is a darkest-before-dawn moment, France and Saudi Arabia have advanced a phased plan to end the conflict by establishing a demilitarized state governed by the Palestinian Authority with international assistance. Hamas would hand power to a politically independent committee under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority — something it has already agreed to — and lay down its arms, which it has not. Regional peace and integration, likely including Saudi normalization of ties with Israel, would follow. The Gaza ceasefire talks broke down again when Israel carried out a Sept. 9 strike targeting Hamas' negotiators in Qatar, one of the main mediators. The U.S. had walked away from the talks in July, blaming Hamas, and Israel unilaterally ended an earlier ceasefire in March. Israel also says that creating a Palestinian state would allow Hamas to carry out another Oct. 7-style attack on an even wider scale. Hamas leaders have at times indicated they would accept a state on the 1967 lines, but the group remains formally committed to Israel's destruction. Netanyahu portrays international recognition of Palestinian statehood as an attack on Israel. During a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week, Netanyahu said “it is clear that if unilateral actions are taken against us, it simply invites unilateral actions on our part.” Netanyahu and his far-right coalition partners have long wanted to annex large parts of the West Bank, which would make it virtually impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state. The U.S. has not taken a public position on the issue, but in an interview with Fox News, Rubio linked “this conversation about annexation” to the issue of statehood recognition. It also relies heavily on the Palestinian Authority, the current leadership of which is despised by many Palestinians who view them as corrupt and autocratic. Israel says they are not fully committed to peace and accuses the Palestinian Authority of incitement despite recent reforms. The plan calls for Palestinian elections to be held within a year, but President Mahmoud Abbas has delayed previous votes when it looked like his party would lose, blaming Israeli restrictions. Hamas, which won the last national elections in 2006, would be excluded unless it gives up its weapons and recognizes Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK CITY – President Donald Trump's problems ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are poised to mar his return to the United Nations in New York City this week, though he is more empowered than he was the last time he made an appearance at the annual leaders summit in 2019. Despite his criticism of the U.N. building and the multilateral organization more broadly, a White House source underscored that Trump “is excited to participate” and is expected to “lay out his vision for a safe, prosperous, peaceful America and world.” “Under President Trump's leadership, our country is strong again, which has made the entire globe more stable,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle told the Washington Examiner, citing how Trump has “brokered seven peace deals, secured historic trade deals and investments, and strengthened alliances across the world.” Through a State Department spokesperson, Secretary of State Marco Rubio defined the U.N.'s core mandates as being “an effective tool for advancing peace, not a bloated bureaucracy that compromises national sovereignty and pushes destructive ideologies like [diversity, equity, and inclusion].” But although Trump may dislike multilateralism and is still contending with the wars, he is heading to the U.N. in a position of strength compared to previous High-Level Weeks. For Jon Alterman, the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Zbigniew Brzezinski Chair in Global Security and Geostrategy, the most striking difference between now and Trump's other appearances at the U.N. is that leaders once “tried to avoid [the U.N. General Assembly] because they thought it would be awkward to run into” him. “Now I think everybody in the world has concluded that they both can and need to engage with him,” Alterman told the Washington Examiner. There is this desire across the spectrum to engage and I think a belief that you're much better off engaging than not engaging. And I think that's very different from the first term when people thought there was too much risk, too much uncertainty, and they would just avoid the encounter entirely.” Leaders are also advantaged now in contrast to then because “there's a much greater understanding of how [Trump] operates, what he prioritizes, his keen interest in negotiations, and his belief that negotiations can resolve differences,” according to Alterman. Regarding Trump's highly anticipated address, Alterman previewed potential presidential references to Israel, Gaza, Russia, Ukraine, Europe, and China, in addition to Iran, North Korea, and maybe even Venezuela. “Getting it so that the allies are moving where you want them to move and the adversaries are moving where you want them to move, and not just the adversaries think they can play him and the allies think they have to hedge against abandonment. More generally, American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Brett Schaefer predicted Trump would speak to two audiences through his address, one domestic and the other foreign. The White House has noted that he's been involved in resolution of conflicts, or at least cessation of hostilities, in about six different conflicts around the world.” More specifically, Schaefer assumed Trump would defend Israel, demand that Hamas release its remaining hostages, and implore Russia to “end the fighting in Ukraine,” though he has repeatedly put pressure on Zelensky to agree to a peace deal with Putin. “The review of U.S. involvement in international organizations has still not been publicly released,” he said. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Alterman agreed that the U.N. has a challenge in how it demonstrates it makes a positive difference, particularly amid the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars. To that end, U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, recognized Palestinian statehood in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank on Sunday before Monday's U.N. General Assembly conference regarding a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians. “As the president stated, he would be rewarding Hamas and would be hindering efforts to bring home the hostages if he recognizes a Palestinian state, and he doesn't think they should be rewarded. So he is not going to do that,” a White House official told the Washington Examiner on Sunday of recognizing Palestinian statehood. Recognizing Palestinian statehood is part of a package that “hopefully takes us from the appalling situation we're in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have, and a viable Palestinian state,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters alongside Trump last week during their press conference concluding the president's three-day state trip to the U.K. And we need aid to get into Gaza at speed,” he said. Trump, from behind his press conference podium, expressed his concerns regarding recognizing Palestinian statehood, reiterating that his priority is Hamas releasing the hostages, with both Trump and Starmer agreeing Hamas cannot govern Palestinians in the future. At the same time, the limits of Trump's power over Putin will also be on display during the U.N. General Assembly's High-Level Week after last month's meeting in Anchorage, Alaska similarly failed to yield a ceasefire or peace deal with Ukraine. “The one that I thought would be easiest would be because of my relationship with President Putin, but he's let me down. “If the price of oil comes down, Putin is going to drop out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Environmental activist and writer Bill McKibben on why “you can't stop the sun.” Talking about climate change can feel hopeless. But for the most part, it's bad news. So many of the disasters we were warned about years ago are starting to pile on. Now we're staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency and the potential unraveling of what little climate progress we've made. But there's a twist: Solar and wind are booming, and they're now the world's cheapest energy sources. Many cities, towns, and in some cases countries are running almost entirely on renewables. Is it too late to turn this thing around? His new book, Here Comes the Sun, is about the revolution in solar and wind power and it might be the most hopeful thing he's ever written. I invited McKibben onto The Gray Area to talk about that and the many possibilities in front of us. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. This book is much more optimistic than I expected. It's an odd moment for me. Much of what I've been describing since The End of Nature in the late '80s is now happening in real time. We're watching the climate system come apart. And yet, at the same time, I have news of one big good thing: a transformation in how we make and use energy that's actually moving fast enough to matter. So I get to be the bearer of some good news, for once. You're clear that we're past being able to “stop” global warming. Stopping warming entirely isn't on the menu. But every tenth of a degree matters. Each tenth we avoid keeps tens or hundreds of millions of people within a livable climate zone. That remains the biggest task humans have ever had: keep the damage within survivable limits. That's why the clean energy news is so important. California, which is the fourth-largest economy on Earth, has quietly hit a tipping point. On many days, it supplies more than 100 percent of its power for long stretches from clean energy. The net result is that California used about 40 percent less natural gas for electricity this summer than two years ago. If that spreads globally, you start shaving tenths of a degree off the future. That's the best number I've heard in almost 40 years of doing this. We're talking in mid-August, more than six months into President Donald Trump's second term. He's doing extraordinary damage and he's doing it with the spineless support of a lot of Republicans who know better. What Trump is really doing — and this should make any American furious — is ceding the energy future to China, often for technologies that were developed here. Now we're practically handing the future to Beijing on a platter. In the long run, that might still be good for the planet because they're pushing these technologies everywhere, but it's a staggering abdication by the US. Second, even here at home, the story isn't finished. The most interesting state in America for energy right now is Texas. It's installing renewables faster than California. In the spring, fossil fuel interests tried to ram through a “DEI for gas” bill, which is basically forcing one unit of gas buildout for every unit of solar. People in rural Texas came out of the woodwork to say, Don't do this. Wind and solar keep schools open, fund elder care. And one reason I'm optimistic is that a lot of this is now mundane economics. We live on a planet where the cheapest way to make power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. This is no longer the Whole Foods of energy — nice but pricey. The federal picture is obviously grim. The EPA under Trump revoked a long-held scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare, which is the legal basis for a lot of climate regulation. Do you think the courts will stop it? But it's an “up is down” administration. They insist DC is a crime-ridden hellscape when the data say otherwise, and they insist climate's no big deal as entire neighborhoods burn, as Texas floods, as wildfire smoke becomes a seasonal feature in the East, and as we log the hottest months in recorded history. But physics doesn't care about press releases. So we can't just rely on the superior economics of solar, wind, and batteries. We also need activism to change laws and minds. There's a lot that states and cities can do — even with Washington hostile. Rooftop solar in the US costs roughly three times as much, and takes far longer, than in many other countries. In Australia, you can call on Monday and have panels up by Friday; 40 percent of homes there have rooftop solar. The difference isn't the price of panels; it's our baroque, Byzantine permitting across 15,000 municipalities. The National Renewable Energy Lab built an instant-permitting tool — SolarAPP+ — and states like California, Maryland, and New Jersey have adopted it. Another example is “balcony solar.” In the past two years, millions of Europeans — apartment-dwellers! — have bought a plug-in panel that hangs off the balcony and instantly supplies around 20 percent of a home's power. That's illegal across the US, except in Utah, where a libertarian state senator asked the obvious question: Why can Hamburg do it but Provo can't? Now you can find people in Utah happily plugging in balcony panels and watching the meter spin backward. Why did so many people — including environmentalists — so badly underestimate how fast solar and wind would scale? That got lodged in our heads. Even climate advocates focused on things like carbon taxes to raise fossil prices so renewables could compete. But about four or five years ago we crossed an invisible line and people didn't update. If you want a date, I'd circle June 2023. That's when global temperatures began their latest spike. Some of the hottest months in at least 125,000 years, and it's also the month humanity started installing a gigawatt of solar every day. Since then the pace has only accelerated. In April, China alone was installing around 3 gigawatts per day, which is the equivalent of a coal plant's capacity every eight hours. In your book, you note that in 2022, China spent 26 times as much on the clean energy supply chain as Europe and the US combined. The Inflation Reduction Act was starting to narrow that gap. With Trump back, how dramatically will that change? Will we get anywhere close to that expected number or will China just continue to lap us? The IRA was our best chance to catch up; parts may survive, but a lot won't. Twenty years from now, the US may be a kind of theme park where tourists come to see how people used to make energy by setting things on fire. Eventually, we'll try to catch up, but we won't be owning that future anymore. I wanted to ask about movement politics since you've been so involved for so long. For decades, climate politics was about stopping bad things — pipelines, leases, drilling. The movement now has to be about building. I've been writing for a year that people like me — old white guys — should stop reflexively suing to block projects we don't like. It's absurd to block solar farms because you don't like looking at them. That's why we're focused on permitting reform at the local and state level. But states — red and blue — can move. If you're a “my home is my castle” American, solar makes that literally truer; if you love the idea of a network powered by something elegant and natural, you're on board for different reasons. Why did this become a red-blue cultural fight when it really doesn't have to be? The fossil fuel industry spent decades and billions making it partisan. The Koch network effectively bought one of our political parties. Fifty years ago, environmentalism was bipartisan. “Beautiful” isn't a word people associate with utility-scale power — but you lean into it. The sun already gives us light, warmth, and photosynthesis. Big Oil is still powerful, but a lot of what they're pushing — like leaning on countries to lock themselves into US liquefied natural gas — may backfire. If you're Indonesia or Vietnam, do you really want to tie your future energy supply to a fickle superpower? Or do you want to harvest the sun and wind that fall on your own land and sea? There's a perverse wrinkle here: Sun and wind are so cheap they don't fit neatly into a profit model built on scarcity. It's an investment problem for some incumbents. But for countries, cheap power is a competitive advantage. Meanwhile, if the US insists on expensive options — coal, gas, or boutique nuclear — we handicap ourselves. You also make the blunt point that breaking the centralized power of the fossil fuel industry is a big deal if we do want a more humane politics. Cut emissions or the planet fries — that's incentive enough. About 9 million people die each year from air pollution tied to fossil combustion. And we unlock a wave of useful appliances: heat pumps that use a little electricity to move latent heat in the air and keep homes comfortable year-round; EVs and e-bikes that make cities quieter and cleaner. I have hope that it's worth the try. I can't think of a better way to spend a life than working on the gravest problem our species has stumbled into. On page one you say there's still a path forward. We've never run this experiment with people watching. The last five times the atmosphere filled with carbon — because of massive volcanic eruptions — there were mass extinctions. We're adding carbon faster now than in those episodes. But unlike volcanoes, our “eruptions” are cars, factories, and power plants we could shut down quickly if we chose. It may be that we've already waited too long. The momentum in polar melt and the knock-on effects on jet and Gulf streams are frightening. My first book was called The End of Nature. But for the first time, we have a scalable response. So we should try like hell and hope the Hollywood ending works at least a little. If we don't get this right, what's the world like in 10, 50, 100 years? At 3 degrees Celsius, the UN estimates 1 to 3 billion climate refugees. A couple of million people at our southern border nearly broke American politics; now multiply by a thousand. That's why every tenth of a degree we avoid is the most important political work humans have ever undertaken.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is set to advise pregnant women against taking Tylenol due to a possible link between the common painkiller and an increased risk of autism in children, according to multiple reports. The Washington Post reported on Sunday night that President Donald Trump's planned Monday announcement on autism will include raising new concerns about acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and its possible links to the disorder. According to Mayo Clinic, leucovorin is primarily used to combat the negative effects of a cancer medicine and treat certain kinds of anemia, or a deficiency in red blood cells. The announcement makes good on a promise from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to find the cause of what he has called an “autism epidemic” in the country by sometime in September. Both findings were teased earlier this month by the Wall Street Journal, leading to an immediate plunge in the stock price for Kenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol. Spokespeople for the company have since maintained that there is no link between the over-the-counter drug and autism. At the time, the outlet also said those findings would be filed in a larger HHS report, which was expected to be a review of existing research. According to Politico, no such report from Kennedy exists ahead of Monday's presser, citing one unnamed senior Trump administration official. Still, Trump used part of his remarks at the funeral for Charlie Kirk earlier on Sunday to tease what he called “one of the biggest announcement[s] … medically, I think, in the history of our country.” I think we found an answer to autism,” the president told the thousands who attended the memorial in Arizona.</p>
