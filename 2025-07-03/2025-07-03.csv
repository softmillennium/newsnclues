            As the Trump administration has doubled down on its hardline immigration agenda, behind the scenes senior Trump officials and the president himself have grappled with the consequences of that crackdown against a key portion of the workforce: migrant workers.
    


            President Donald Trump has wavered repeatedly on the topic: At times he has suggested farms and other industries employing migrants should be protected, even as he and some top aides have pushed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to intensify its immigration sweeps.
    


            “We're working on it right now,” Trump said Tuesday. “We have a lot of cases where ICE would go into a farm and these are guys that have been there 10 or 15 years, and the farmers know them – it's called farmer responsibility. Or owner responsibility. But they're going to be largely responsible for these people. And they know these people. They've worked at the farms for 15 years.”
    


            Senior administration officials have had discussions with stakeholders as they quietly try to find a durable compromise on the fate of migrant workers, floating various new ways of granting them legal status, multiple sources told CNN. But it's unclear what, if any, solution they can reach without Congress, according to experts.
    


            “President Trump is a tireless advocate for American farmers – they keep our families fed and our country prosperous. He trusts farmers and is committed to ensuring they have the workforce needed to remain successful,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement, maintaining that deporting “dangerous criminals and targeting the sanctuary cities that provide them safe harbor is a top priority for the President.”

            The focus on migrant workers reveals the delicate balance the Trump administration is wrestling with as it tries to carry out a historic number of deportations and avoid agitating key industries or unsettling a fragile economy. Similarly, the president faces headwinds from immigration hardliners who view additional protections for migrant workers as an unnecessary form of relief. The ambiguity in Trump's approach has kept both sides of the debate off balance.
    


            CNN reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            “They are working at a breakneck speed to better understand employers' issues with current guest worker visa programs and cut down on paperwork processing delays. Effective reform is a complex undertaking, and initial attempts may not get it entirely right from the start,” said Kip Eideberg, senior vice president of government and industry relations at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, describing the message he's received from the administration.
    


            “The Administration recognizes this and have been clear that they will make adjustments based on feedback from industry to strike the right balance between border security and immigration reform,” he added.
    


            Undocumented immigrants account for 4% to 5% of the total US workforce and between 15% to 20% in industries like crop production, food processing, and construction, according to Goldman Sachs, which warned in a recent report that losing a “significant share” of those workers could result in temporary bottlenecks, shortages, and price increase.
    


            Multiple industry representatives have raised alarm over indiscriminate immigration sweeps where undocumented immigrants without criminal records have been picked up for deportation, including in sectors that are critical to the president's broader agenda.
    


            “It will make it damn near impossible to lean into the administration's effort to strengthen manufacturing,” Eideberg said, despite overwhelming support within the industry for that effort.
    


            “We're stuck between a rock and a hard place,” he said, noting that mass deportations will shrink the labor force. One of the primary concerns for customers is that they won't have enough workers to harvest crops, which will likely have a trickle-down effect on equipment manufacturers and reduce demand, according to Eideberg.
    


            But tilting toward helping manufacturers and other employers could cause political problems for the president.
    


            “The more he panders to employers of illegal workers, the more he's going to anger his base of voters who expected – and voted for – tough immigration enforcement across the board without exemptions for politically connected people,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for limited immigration.
    


            Representatives from various industries have taken their worries directly to the administration, including the departments of Labor and Agriculture.
    


            In an April Cabinet meeting, Trump appeared to nod to those concerns, telling Homeland Security Kristi Noem after her presentation: “We're also going to work with farmers that if they have strong recommendations for their farms for certain people, we're going to let them stay in for a while and work with the farmers and then come back and go through a process of – legal process.”
    


            He later tasked Noem, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to work on the issue, according to a source familiar with the move.
    


            Last month, Chavez-DeRemer established the Office of Immigration Policy to try to streamline industry needs and thread the needle of delivering on Trump's mass deportation promise while helping employers navigate existing programs.
    


            “Under President Trump's leadership, I'm working closely with Secretary Rollins, Secretary Noem, and our federal partners on fulfilling this Administration's mission to cut red tape, support agricultural employers, and ensure they have the legal workforce needed to keep our food supply secure,” Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement.
    


            According to an agriculture industry source, a similar idea had been discussed in a meeting with Rollins earlier this year that would include setting up a program for farmers to ensure they had enough laborers. It's unclear how that program would be different from existing temporary farm visas known as H-2A.
    


            The source said Trump has also raised the idea to Rollins of creating a mechanism that would allow farmers to sign a document or affidavit for undocumented workers, who would self-deport and then be allowed to return legally. But that kind of proposal would draw objections from hardliners.
    


            “It ends up being who's going to win this tug of war,” said Chris Chmielenski, president of the Immigration Accountability Project, which advocates for limited immigration, describing a form of relief for undocumented migrant workers akin to “amnesty.”
    


            “I have no idea which way it's going to go,” he said.
    


            There are 2.4 million farmworkers in the United States, according to the Economic Policy Institute, 40% of whom the Agriculture Department estimates lack legal status. United Farm Workers President Teresa Romero previously told CNN that she's been getting calls from concerned farmworkers across California about ICE crackdowns in the state.
    


            Separate from the existing undocumented population, the administration has also made a series of moves to strip temporary protections from migrants who had been given permission to legally work and live in the country – suddenly depriving some employers of workers.
    


            “We might keep losing legal workers from the system,” said Jennie Murray, president and chief executive officer of the National Immigration Forum. “All of them (industries) are extremely worried. They're worried they don't have future flows of workers coming into the country. They're extremely worried to lose these temporary workers they've become dependent on.”
    


            An immigration raid at an Omaha meat production plant on June 10 that resulted in dozens of workers being taken away sparked fresh concerns about the administration's priorities – culminating in a phone call between Rollins and Trump the following day over the issue.
    


            Two days later, Trump posted on his Truth Social: “Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace… This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!”
    


            Immigration and Customs Enforcement quickly issued guidance to agents limiting immigration raids at farms, hotels, and restaurants.
    


            Just a few days later, Trump posted on his Truth Social account telling ICE officials “to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.” ICE soon announced worksite enforcement would continue.
    


            ICE has conducted sweeps at construction sites, popular vacation destinations like Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, as well as local Home Depots, which are a common spot for contractors and homeowners to approach and hire laborers.
    


            Rosanna Maietta, president and CEO of the American Hotel & Lodging Association, told CNN in a statement that the organization has also held meetings with administration officials “to convey our acute workforce shortage challenges and underscore the importance of a strong hospitality and tourism sector.”
    


            Trump seemed to shift course again in the last week, saying the administration is working on a temporary pass for migrant workers, particularly those working on farms and in the hospitality industry, arguing he's on “both sides.”
    


            “I'm the strongest immigration guy that there's ever been, but I'm also the strongest farmer guy that there's ever been,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.”
    


            The whiplash has been indicative of the two factions within the administration – one focused on the impact on labor, and another intent on arresting and deporting as many people as possible. The latter has been led by White House deputy chief of staff and architect of Trump's hardline immigration policies Stephen Miller.
    


            Miller has argued on CNN that the administration's immigration crackdown wouldn't disrupt the agriculture industry and result in higher prices, saying that migrants who recently arrived to the US “aren't doing farmwork.”
    


            Rollins sees the issue differently.
    


            “The labor question is a significant one. It is one that is perhaps not the very top of the list, but for some they would say the very top of the list,” the agriculture secretary told lawmakers at a congressional hearing in mid-June.
    


            In a CNBC interview Wednesday, Rollins said Trump's “goal, that he has tasked me with effectuating, is making sure that we have a 100% legal workforce. That anyone that is here illegally must pay the consequences, return to the country, and then eventually, as he's talked about in different ways, come back. So, we are working on all of that right now.”
    


            She cited reforms to temporary worker visas, arguing: “There will be zero amnesty. We will ensure all laws are followed.”
    


            Sources familiar with the dynamic between Rollins and Miller told CNN the relationship between the two is professional and despite the different viewpoints on immigration policy, it hasn't devolved.
    


            “There's a respect between the two, and also a very clear understanding that Trump likes and is deeply reliant on both,” one administration official said.
    


            “This is an area where their equities overlap and are quite different. They both understand that – or at least have up to this point. But POTUS cares deeply about farmers and ranchers and beyond his personal affinity for the Secretary, really values hearing directly from her about what the industry is saying,” the official said. “And they're freaking out right now – and have been for months.”

Clayton Kershaw was laboring in pursuit of his 3,000th strikeout. His pitch count soaring, he was down to the last batter he would face, needing one more swing and miss to become the 20th pitcher to reach the milestone.
    


            “It's a little bit harder when you're actually trying to strike people out,” he said, smiling. “I never really had to do that before.”
    


            Kershaw accomplished the feat when Vinny Capra of the Chicago White Sox took a slider for a called third strike for the final out of the sixth inning on Wednesday night.
    


            “I made it interesting. Made it take too long,” Kershaw said. “Honestly, I didn't pitch that great tonight. The slider was so bad.”
    


            In his 18th season in Los Angeles, Kershaw joined Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators and Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals as the only pitchers with 3,000 or more strikeouts all for one team.
    


            Freddie Freeman capped a three-run ninth by singling in Shohei Ohtani, giving the Dodgers a 5-4 win. Kershaw didn't get a decision.
    


            The sellout crowd of 53,536 was on its feet roaring as the 37-year-old left-hander walked off the mound to end the sixth. Kershaw paused and doffed his cap, with teammates briefly holding off hugging him to allow him to soak in the cheers.
    


            Kershaw waved to his wife Ellen and four children in the stands and then patted his chest and mouthed, “Thank you.”
    


            “I feel bad for Ellen. I know she was nervous,” he said. “I made her last six innings out there just stressed out that I wasn't going to get it and have to go to Milwaukee to do it.”
    


            Kershaw shared a clubhouse toast with his teammates, coaches, training staff and front office executives.
    


            “Just super thankful for tonight, super thankful for my teammates,” he said. “I told my teammates individual awards are great, but if you don't have anybody to celebrate with it doesn't matter.”
    


            The game was delayed for nearly six minutes between pitches, a gap that included a tribute video.
    


            Kershaw joined Justin Verlander of San Francisco (3,468) and Max Scherzer of Toronto (3,412) as the only active pitchers with that many. Kershaw is just the fourth left-hander in the club.
    


            “It's an incredible list,” he said. “It's special to finally be in that group.”
    


            Capra, hitting ninth, was retired on four pitches, with plate umpire Jim Wolf calling the third strike on a slider, Kershaw's season-high 100th pitch of the night. Wolf is the brother of retired pitcher Randy Wolf, once a teammate of Kershaw's.
    


            “I wanted it to come easy,” Kershaw said. “I would much rather have got it done in the first.”
    


            Manager Dave Roberts had said before the game that he would manage the three-time Cy Young Award winner differently with the milestone within reach. That was apparent when Kershaw jogged out for the sixth to an ovation, having already tossed a season-high 92 pitches with just two strikeouts. He came into the game needing three to make history.
    


            “I was going to give him every opportunity to do it at home,” Roberts said. “You could see the emotion he had trying to get that third strike. It just happened the way it was supposed to happen.”
    


            Kershaw retired Lenyn Sosa on three pitches for No. 2,999 in the fifth. Sosa fouled off Kershaw's first two pitches before ending the inning by striking out on a 72 mph curveball.
    


            In the third, Miguel Vargas took called strikes on his first two pitches before he swung and missed on another 72 mph curveball from his former Dodgers teammate.
    


            Chicago swung aggressively against Kershaw, who gave up a two-run homer to Austin Slater and two more runs as the White Sox led 4-2 after six innings.
    


            “You could just feel it. They wanted it for me so bad,” he said of the crowd. “You could feel the tension. They were trying to will me to do it.”
    


            Kershaw made history one batter after Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was injured in tagging out Michael A. Taylor on a steal attempt. Muncy had to be helped off the field, barely able to put any weight on his left leg.
    


            Kershaw has provided much-needed stability for the Dodgers' pitching staff, which has been decimated by injuries.
    


            “It's just again a reminder for me, for anyone, to never bet against that guy,” Roberts said before the game. “It doesn't matter – health, stuff – he's going to will himself to doing whatever the team needs.”
    


            Kershaw allowed five runs over four innings in his first start after returning from knee and foot surgeries last offseason. Since then, he has held opposing batters to a .222 average.
    


            “The first three months of the season, we've needed some length from the starter,” Roberts said. “Once he kind of got his footing after the first few, he's done everything and more that we've needed. That doesn't go unnoticed.”
    


            In his prime from 2010-15, Kershaw led the National League in ERA five times, in strikeouts three times and wins twice.
    


            Kershaw had one of the best seasons ever in 2014, when he finished with a 21-3 record, 1.77 ERA and 233 strikeouts to win both the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player in the National League.
    


            Age and less dominant stuff has changed the way Kershaw does his job. He knows his consistency isn't the same but with the depth of the team's staff, he doesn't need to be perfect every outing.
    


            Kershaw no longer overpowers hitters the way he did during the height of his career, but he remains stubbornly determined and possesses a craftiness honed over two decades as well as a slider that still can fool.
    


            “I've seen him grow more than any player,” Roberts said. “Hasn't lost the compete, but I think that the world is not as black and white as he used to see it. I think that his edges are softer, I think that fatherhood, Father Time, does that to a person.”

Former US President Joe Biden has claimed that foreign leaders have been urging him to reengage in global affairs, despite his retirement from public office.

Speaking at the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) conference in San Diego on Wednesday, Biden, 82, said “I'm getting calls – I'm not going to go into them, I can't – from a number of European leaders asking me to get engaged.”

The ex-president said that he declined to do so “because things are different.” At the same time, Biden acknowledged that while he is “not actively involved with NATO issues,” he is still “giving advice.” 

Biden also said he remains in touch with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. “I've been dealing with a lot of Democrat and Republican colleagues calling me… wanting to talk and bounce things off of me,” he said, adding that he remains involved in political discussions “because I really cared about what I was doing.”

Biden went on to voice frustration over the rollback of several of his administration's policies under President Donald Trump, although he avoided mentioning his successor by name. “Many of the things I worked so damn hard [on] that I thought I changed in the country are changing so rapidly,” he said.

The Democrat noted that he was focused on completing a memoir about his four years in the White House, adding that he is “working like hell with a publisher to write another 500-page book.” 

Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race in the face of widespread criticism over recurring public gaffes and his disastrous debate performance against Trump, which raised concerns in his own party about his age and mental acuity. He formally withdrew from the contest in July 2024, endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, who lost the November vote to Trump.

In May 2025, Biden revealed that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. He continues to appear in public and has struck an optimistic tone when speaking about his chances of beating the disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Top Western firms switching to Chinese AI","https://www.rt.com/news/620916-us-china-ai-arms-race/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 04:16:00 GMT","

A growing number of top Western companies are adopting Chinese artificial intelligence models, challenging US dominance and potential profits in the global AI industry, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

Major firms such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Saudi Aramco have begun deploying or testing Chinese AI systems, including models developed by DeepSeek and Alibaba, according to a WSJ report published on Wednesday. Even US-based cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are offering DeepSeek to clients, despite alleged security concerns flagged by the White House.

The surge in global interest comes as Chinese AI companies offer performance on par with leading US models at a fraction of the cost. According to data from research firm Sensor Tower, DeepSeek has already recorded 125 million global downloads, compared to ChatGPT's 910 million.

China's AI developers are further gaining traction by open-sourcing their models, encouraging widespread customization and adoption.

In South Africa, the University of the Witwatersrand chose DeepSeek for a pilot research project due to its offline capability and open-source flexibility. Similarly, Japan's Ministry of Economy selected Alibaba's Qwen model over US alternatives. On platforms such as Latenode, a fifth of global users reportedly now prefer DeepSeek for building AI tools.

Industry experts say the trend could erode US influence in setting global AI standards. Microsoft President Brad Smith warned during a recent US Senate hearing that “the No. 1 factor that will define whether the US or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world.”

Although the open-source versions of Chinese models are unrestricted, critics argue that consumer-facing apps often reflect Chinese government policies – and with wider adoption, could allow Beijing to embed its digital standards globally. The shifting landscape has raised concerns in Washington, with lawmakers considering legislation to block federal agencies from using Chinese-developed AI.

Meanwhile, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned of strategic moves by other Chinese rivals like Zhipu AI to dominate emerging markets. “We want to make sure democratic AI wins over authoritarian AI,” claimed Altman, whose company recently signed a $200 million deal with the Pentagon. 

With the AI competition increasingly seen as a new technological arms race, US firms are ramping up efforts to maintain the lead. Meta recently launched a new division focused on developing superintelligent AI, and President Donald Trump has backed a $500 billion federal initiative to secure American leadership in advanced AI technologies.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will hold a phone call with his US counterpart, Donald Trump, on Thursday.

The Russian leader made the announcement while touring an exhibition in Moscow of emerging Russian brands, adding that he “will definitely suggest that he use this material to promote it on the American market.” Putin did not provide further details on the agenda of the call.

Trump has confirmed the plans for a conversation, which he said will take place at 14:00 GMT.

Speaking at the forum, Putin asked attendees for questions he could potentially pose to his US counterpart. One guest asked the Russian leader to raise the topic of exchanging films that could shed light on the cultural values of both countries.

At around 6 p.m. Moscow time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the phone call between Trump and Putin was underway. He added that the Kremlin intends to hold a briefing on the results of the conversation after it concludes.

Since Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, he and Putin have held at least five official phone calls. The discussions have focused on efforts to negotiate an end to the Ukraine conflict, arms control, and restoring bilateral ties, which sank to an all-time low during the previous US administration. The latest phone call took place on June 14 and revolved around Israel's strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as well as retaliation from Tehran.

Earlier in the day, Peskov did not comment when asked if Putin was planning to congratulate Trump on US Independence Day, celebrated on July 4.

On June 12, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Russia on its national day, voicing hope for a lasting peace between Moscow and Kiev. Ukraine, however, criticized countries that extended messages to Russia, claiming that Moscow should not be “rewarded” on the world stage.

Putin also expressed regret about leaving the conference, but said it would be “awkward” to keep Trump waiting.

TEL AVIV, July 3. /TASS/. Israeli state broadcaster Kan claims that Israel and Russia are secretly maintaining contacts regarding the settlement of conflict situations in Israel's relations with Iran and Syria.

According to its information, it is about ""high-level diplomatic talks"" that began after the end of Israel's military campaign against Iran, which lasted from June 13 to 24. The stated goal of this operation was to destroy the Islamic Republic's missile and nuclear programs. Tehran responded with missile attacks on Israeli territory. On the night of June 22, the United States entered the conflict by attacking three nuclear facilities in Iran. In response, on June 23, the Islamic Republic launched a missile strike on the largest American air base in the Middle East, Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and on June 24, Washington announced a ceasefire between the parties.

As Kan notes, the dialogue began ""about a week"" after the end of the campaign and in light of Moscow's signals about its readiness to ""act as a mediator"" between Iran and Israel. The television and radio company especially stresses that ""Moscow did not arm Tehran"" during the 12-day conflict. In addition, the Israeli side maintains contacts with Russia ""in connection with efforts to achieve a political solution"" regarding Syria, Kan claims.

At the same time, Israel is seeking to achieve diplomatic guarantees regarding Iran in dialogue with the United States, the television and radio company notes. The issue is expected to be one of the topics of conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump during their meeting in Washington next week, Kan reports.

On June 13, immediately after the start of a 12-day exchange of blows between Israel and Iran, the Kremlin press service reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, expressed Moscow's readiness to provide mediation services in the situation of the Israeli-Iranian conflict. On the same day, the Kremlin reported a conversation between Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, following which it was stated that Russia will continue close contacts with both Iran and Israel in order to avoid harmful consequences of their conflict for the entire Middle East.

Speaking at the plenary session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 20, Putin stressed that Russia is not seeking to mediate in the conflict between Iran and Israel, but is ""offering its own ideas"" for a settlement. According to him, Russia will only be happy if these ideas ""seem attractive to both countries."" At the same time, Putin noted that he sees possible points of contact for Iran and Israel.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

LONDON, July 3. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump will hold a phone call with Vladimir Zelensky on Friday to discuss the suspension of US arms deliveries to Ukraine, the Financial Times reported, citing sources.

Earlier, The New York Times said that the United States would suspend deliveries of Patriot air defense interceptor missiles, GMLRS precision-guided munitions, Hellfire guided missiles, Stinger portable missile systems, and a range of other weapons to Ukraine. In response, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has summoned US Charge d'Affaires in Kiev, John Ginkel, to discuss the suspension.

Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell later declined to specify which weapons are still being supplied to Kiev.

MOSCOW, July 3. /TASS/. Russia is not discussing its peace memorandum which has yet to be reviewed by the Ukrainian side in public domain, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

""We have not brought the memorandum which has yet to be discussed with the Ukrainian side to public discussion. We believe that discussing it in media may harm the [negotiation] process,"" Peskov said in response to a reporters' question about whether the Russian document proposes mutual amnesty for political prisoners with Ukraine.

The peace memorandum that the Russian delegation handed over to the Ukrainian negotiators at a recent round of talks in Istanbul demands for ensuring Ukraine's neutrality and imposing a ban on any military activity by third countries on its soil.

The first part of the document outlines ""the fundamental parameters of a final settlement."" The second part, discussing a ceasefire, envisages, among two available scenarios, amnesty for political prisoners and the release of POWs and civilian prisoners by Kiev.

The third part of the Russian memorandum lays down a sequence of steps and timeframes for implementing them.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Key rule approved at 4am after Republican holdouts agree to move forward on debate. Plus, fragments show Israeli military used US-made 500lb bomb in strike on Gaza cafe

Good morning.

Donald Trump's signature tax-and-spending bill passed a procedural step in the House of Representatives at close to 4am local time, paving the way for the possible passage of the legislation later today as lawmakers continue to debate.

The House speaker, Mike Johnson, is determined to pass the bill as soon as possible but has been frustrated by lawmakers – Democrats but also a handful of Republicans – who object to its provisions and overall cost. Overnight, they had blocked the House from approving a rule that was necessary to begin debate on the measure and set the stage for the proposed legislation's passage.

But the procedural passage appeared to suggest that the Republican holdouts had been brought into line, and that Trump's bill – which he has made the centerpiece of his legislative agenda – would soon pass.

The bill would add $3.3tn to the US budget deficit from 2025 to 2034, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates.

What would it mean for deportation policy? Thousands of new immigration enforcement officers; tens of thousands of extra detention beds; fees on asylum applications; and further construction on the border wall. Here's how Trump's bill will supercharge mass deportations by funneling $170bn to Ice.

And social security? According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the welfare cuts will result in about 10.6 million people losing their Medicaid healthcare and 8 million people losing their Snap food stamp benefits.

The Israeli military used a 500lb (230kg) bomb – a powerful and indiscriminate weapon that generates a massive blast wave and scatters shrapnel over a wide area – in an attack on a target in a crowded beachfront cafe in Gaza on Monday, evidence seen by the Guardian has revealed.

Experts in international law said the use of such a munition despite the known presence of many unprotected civilians including children and elderly people was almost certainly unlawful and may constitute a war crime.

Fragments of the weapon from the ruins of al-Baqa cafe photographed by the Guardian have been identified by ordnance experts as parts of an MK-82 general purpose 230kg bomb, a US-made staple of many bombing campaigns in recent decades.

What was the civilian death toll from Monday's bombing? Medical and other officials said between 24 and 36 Palestinians were killed in the attack and dozens more were injured. The dead included the film-maker Ismail Abu Hatab, the artist Amna al-Salmi, and a four-year-old child. Among the injured were a 14-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl.

A jury in New York has found Sean “Diddy” Combs guilty of two counts and not guilty on three counts after a closely watched seven-week federal trial marked by emotional and graphic testimony.

In a mixed verdict, Combs was found not guilty of the biggest charge, racketeering conspiracy, as well as not guilty of the sex trafficking of Casandra Ventura or of “Jane”. He was found guilty on two counts of the transportation to engage in prostitution in relation to the two women.

What happens next? The judge proposed a sentencing date of October 3, but said he was willing to move up the date at the defense's request. Combs's bail request was denied, with the judge saying he had demonstrated a “disregard for the rule of law and a propensity of violence”.

Kilmar Ábrego García was physically and psychologically tortured in Salvadorian custody, according to court documents of the man who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The Dalai Lama said the centuries-old spiritual institution bearing his name would continue after his death, and that only his inner circle, not Beijing, would have the authority to identify his successor.

Thailand's constitutional court has suspended the prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, while it investigates a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen.

Donald Trump has reached a $16m settlement with Paramount, the parent of CBS News, over what he claimed was false editing of an interview with Kamala Harris, in what is likely to be seen as further media capitulation to Trump. Paramount is preparing for a $8.4bn merger that requires FCC approval.

Alberto Varela claimed he wanted to use sacred plant medicine to free people's minds. But as the organisation grew, his followers discovered a darker reality. Traditional ayahuasca practitioners protested he was bringing their practice into disrepute. Accidents would happen, they said.

Drought is pushing tens of millions of people to the edge of starvation around the world, according to a report published by the US National Drought Mitigation Center, UN Convention to Combat Desertification and International Drought Resilience Alliance. In Somalia, a quarter of the population is edging towards starvation.

Once a hangout for drug users, a parking lot in Medellín, Colombia, has been reborn as a green haven for all. “You dig up the concrete, water gets into the ground, vegetation grows up, and the people come back,” said one of the social urbanists credited with reducing crime and temperatures.

Astronomer says object could be further evidence that ‘interstellar wanderers' are common in galaxy

It isn't a bird, it isn't a plane and it certainly isn't Superman – but it does appear to be a visitor from beyond our solar system, according to astronomers who have discovered a new object hurtling through our cosmic neighbourhood.

The object, originally called A11pl3Z and now known as 3I/Atlas, was first reported by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, on Tuesday.

According to Nasa, subsequent analysis of data collected by various telescopes before this date has extended observations back to 14 June, and further observations have also been made. As a result, experts have been plotting the path of the visitor.

Now about 416m miles away from the sun and travelling from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, the object is believed to be whizzing through the solar system at about 37 miles per second (60km/s) relative to the sun on a highly eccentric, hyperbolic orbit. That suggests that, like the cigar-shaped object 'Oumuamua that appeared in 2017 and the comet 2I/Borisov that turned up in 2019, it is a visitor from afar.

Dr Mark Norris, a senior lecturer in astronomy at the University of Central Lancashire, said: “If confirmed, it will be the third known interstellar object from outside our solar system that we have discovered, providing more evidence that such interstellar wanderers are relatively common in our galaxy.”

While the nature of the new visitor was not initially apparent, the Minor Planet Center has revealed that tentative signs of cometary activity have been spotted, noting that the object has a marginal coma and short tail. As a result, the object has been given the additional name of C/2025 N1.

While some experts have suggested the object could be as large as 12 miles (20km) in diameter – bigger than the space rock that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs – it seems Earth residents do not need to worry.

Nasa said: “The comet poses no threat to Earth and will remain at a distance of at least 1.6 astronomical units [about 150m miles].”

Colin Snodgrass, a professor of planetary astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, said the object could turn out to be smaller.

“Based on the brightness reported in the initial observations, that translates to a 20km asteroid if you assume typical properties, but only if you assume it is an asteroid and not a comet,” he said. “There are reports that it shows a small comet-like tail, so that implies a lot of the brightness will be from the coma (atmosphere) of dust around the object, and it is likely that the solid nucleus is smaller.”

Nasa said the object would reach its closest approach to the sun around 30 October, coming within about 130m miles of the star – or just within the orbit of Mars. The comet is then expected to leave this solar system and head back out into the cosmos.

Norris said: “As it gets closer, it's expected to brighten, especially if it turns out to be a comet rather than an asteroid. By the time it makes its closest approach, it will be a relatively easy target for amateur astronomers to observe.”

Jake Foster, a Royal Observatory Greenwich astronomer, said: “At the moment, the comet is not expected to be visible to the naked eye, but it should be visible through a reasonably sized amateur telescope in late 2025 and early 2026. As it is studied more over the coming weeks we'll get a better idea of just how visible it will realistically be.”

Maj Gen Mikhail Gudkov personally promoted by Putin and had previously led one of Russia's most notorious brigades

Europe live – latest updates

A deputy commander of the Russian navy who had previously led one of the military's most notorious brigades has been killed near the frontline with Ukraine, Moscow has confirmed.

Maj Gen Mikhail Gudkov, who was responsible for Russia's marine units, was killed on Wednesday in a Ukrainian missile attack on a field headquarters in the Kursk region, amid reports the position had been revealed by poor security.

Oleg Kozhemyako, the governor of Primorsky Krai in Russia's far east, said Gudkov had died “performing his duty as an officer alongside his fellow soldiers” and that despite his rank, he “continued to personally visit the positions of our marines”.

Russia's ministry of defence confirmed later that Gudkov had been killed “during combat operations” in the border areas of Kursk region on Wednesday, though there were some reports on social media that the attack had happened a day earlier.

Gudkov had been personally promoted by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in March, having led the 155th Marine Brigade, a frontline unit repeatedly reconstituted because so many of its members had been killed.

A Russian Telegram channel, MiG 41, said that according to “unofficial information” the base may have been revealed by a mole, or discovered by Ukrainian military intelligence after some marines called family and friends in Vladivostok as the eastern city began to celebrate its city day on Wednesday.

At least four missiles were said to have struck the base, a city publication reported, and a number of other senior officers were killed in the attack near the village of Korenevo in the Kursk region, about 19 miles (30km) from the front.

A social media posting from a Russian servicemen's organisation said more than 10 others were killed alongside him, including the brigade's new commander.

Originally considered an elite unit, members of the 155th brigade have been accused of war crimes by Kyiv during the course of the war, such as the execution of nine Ukrainian prisoners of war in the Kursk region last summer. A captured Russian marine said he had witnessed the killing of two other PoWs a month earlier in the same sector.

The Russian unit participated in the failed attempt to take Kyiv in spring 2022, and was then involved in the repeated offensives at Vuhledar in 2023 in the south-east corner of the frontline, before being redeployed to fight off Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk province.

Gudkov is one of at least 10 Russian major generals or lieutenant generals to have been killed in the war so far. Some of the attacks appear carefully planned by Ukraine though on the evidence so far the hit on Gudkov looks opportunistic.

Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian military's chemical, biological and radiological weapons unit, was killed after a bomb detonated outside his apartment in December. Ukraine's SBU security service claimed responsibility for the operation.

In April, Yaroslav Moskalik, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the general staff of the Russian armed forces, died after a car exploded in the town of Balashikha outside Moscow in April. Though Ukraine did not say it was behind this attack, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, praised the country's foreign intelligence for the killing of top Russian military figures.

An explosion on Thursday also killed Manolis Pilavov, a former mayor of the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, Russian authorities said. Pilavov ran the city's administration for nine years after it was separated from Ukraine in 2014 and was wanted by Kyiv for violating the integrity of the country.

Across Ukraine, three people were reported killed and 34 injured in Russian air attacks in different parts of the country on Thursday. Ukraine's air force said 52 Shahed and dummy drones were launched by Moscow's forces, with it successfully intercepting or jamming 40 of them.

Earlier this week, it emerged that the US had paused the delivery of Patriot air defence missile interceptors and other precision weapons to Ukraine amid concerns about the level of its stockpiles. Donald Trump said last month that Patriot missiles had been given to Israel to help it defend itself from Iran.

The US president and Zelenskyy are expected to discuss the issue on Friday, the Financial Times reported. Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that “one way or another, we must ensure protection for our people”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

When one door closes, you would hope that another opens. As the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was formally shut down on Monday, a once-in-a-decade development financing conference was beginning in Seville, Spain. 

While initially intended to move the world closer to its ambitious 2030 sustainable development goals, it now looks more like an attempt to prevent a reversal of the progress already made.

A study published in the Lancet predicted that US President Donald Trump's aid cuts could claim more than 14 million lives by 2030, one-third of them among children. 

For many poor countries, the scale of the shock would be similar to that of a major war, the authors found. More than four-fifths of the US agency's programs have been cut, with surviving projects folded into the US Department of State.

The US was by far the world's largest donor to global development — although its contributions were a fraction of the G7 target of 0.7 percent of GDP. 

Yet the damage does not end there. Its move has encouraged others to follow suit. The UK, Germany and France are slashing their aid budgets to spend more on defense. 

Oxfam said that the collective retrenchment by G7 nations is the biggest aid cut since 1960, with spending 26 percent lower next year than it was last year. 

Do not expect China or the Gulf states to fill this gaping hole.

It is not just grim news for aid recipients. It bodes ill for all. It would be naive to imagine that aid is a high-mindedly altruistic endeavor. Just as conflict breeds hunger and poverty, so injustice and deprivation breed instability and a more dangerous world. Slashing health budgets also increases the risks of another global pandemic.

Developing countries hoped that the UN and Spanish-hosted International Conference on Financing for Development would at least see a willingness to tackle an international financial system stacked against the global majority. Instead, the US, the UK, the EU and others shamefully acted as blockers, watering down the language on a UN intergovernmental process to tackle the debt crisis. The US reportedly proposed 400 amendments across a multitude of issues to the conference's outcome document before pulling out entirely. Others would need to be held to their too-limited commitments.

More than two-fifths of the global population live in low-income countries which are in debt distress or close to it. Many poor African nations are spending more on debt financing than they are on health or education. 

Contrary to popular perception — and any sense of justice and decency — wealth is flowing from those countries to developed nations. The UN says that servicing debt cost developing countries US$847 billion last year, rising to US$947 billion this year.

Yet developed countries are choosing to shore up an unfair global financial system. The keenness of the UK and others to focus on private sector-oriented solutions looks like better news for the City of London than developing nations. The promise that private finance would turn “billions to trillions” was enthusiastically promoted a decade ago, yet largely failed to materialize.

Despite the enduring inequality, the past few decades saw extraordinary progress in areas such as cutting child mortality. For all their flaws, USAID-funded programs alone saved almost 92 million lives over 20 years. 

We know that remarkable leaps in human well-being are possible. We will all regret it if, in this time of conflict and crisis, we slam the door shut on such advances and block out the call of justice.

These dolls are sold out in stores from Singapore to London; a human-sized version recently fetched a whopping US$150,000 at an auction in Beijing. With all the social media buzz, it is worth asking if we are witnessing the rise of a new-age collectible, or whether Labubu is a mere fad destined to fade. 
Investors certainly want to know. Pop Mart International Group Ltd, the Chinese manufacturer behind this trendy toy, has rallied 178 percent                                    



                                                                                My youngest son attends a university in Taipei. Throughout the past two years, whenever I have brought him his luggage or picked him up for the end of a semester or the start of a break, I have stayed at a hotel near his campus. In doing so, I have noticed a strange phenomenon: The hotel's TV contained an unusual number of Chinese channels, filled with accents that would make a person feel as if they are in China. It is quite exhausting.
A few days ago, while staying in the hotel, I found that of the 50 available TV channels,

This trope has gained traction in the world of Taiwanese news, likely with the best intentions. Anything that breaks the China-controlled narrative that Taiwan is doomed to be conquered is welcome, but after observing its rise in recent months, I now believe that the “silicon shield” is a myth — one that is ultimately working against Taiwan.
The basic silicon shield idea is that the world, particularly the US, would rush to defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion because they do not want Beijing to seize the nation's vital and unique chip industry.
However,                                    



                                                                                Cosmetics have long been one of the “golden pillars” of revenue for department stores in Taiwan. With rows of beauty counters and a full lineup of brands, they once served as a powerful draw for customers. However, since last year, the halo surrounding the sector has begun to fade. It is not an isolated issue affecting one retailer — it is a widespread phenomenon across department stores in Taiwan.
Department store executives admit that business is tough, but they also stress that the root cause is not a drop in Taiwan's spending power or a surge in outbound travel. Instead, a                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Taiwanese freediver Chan Kai-hsiang on Wednesday won three gold medals and broke two Asian records at an international championship in Japan.

Chan claimed gold in the Dynamic With Fins (DYN) and Dynamic Without Fins (DNF) events at the 34th International Association for the Development of Apnea (AIDA) Freediving Pool World Championship in Wakayama, swimming 300m with fins and 240m without, both in a single breath. His 300m swim also set a new Taiwanese national record.

He also won silver in the Dynamic With Bifins (DYNB) event, covering 270m in one breath, and set another national record in the Static Apnea (STA) by holding his breath for 8 minutes, 41 seconds — his second domestic record of the meet.

With a combined score of 509.2 points across four disciplines, Chan was crowned the overall men's champion, securing his third gold medal at the AIDA competition.

Chan's most notable achievement was breaking the continental records with his swims in the DNF and DYNB events, setting new distance benchmarks for Asia.

Fellow Taiwanese freediver Lee Po-yen briefly held the Asian DNF record with a 202m swim at the same championship before Chan surpassed it. Lee's overall score of 450.6 points earned him third place and a third bronze medal at the competition.

His other two bronze medals came from the DNF event and the DYNB, the latter involving a 264m swim.

Together, Chan and Lee's successes helped Taiwan earn three gold, one silver and three bronze medals at the competition.

Both men also received the AIDA's Natalia Molchanova Memorial Award, given to the championship's most accomplished freedivers.

In womens events, Taiwan's Liu Yu-han and Lin Hsin-ju set new national records. Lin broke the national DNF record with a 138m swim, surpassing the previous mark set by Hsieh Hsin-ying.

Lin's record was overtaken by debutant Liu, who swam 153m and also set a new Taiwanese STA record by holding her breath for 6 minutes, 39 seconds.

Chen Yu-jung, who has held Taiwan's female DYN record since 2023, broke her own record by swimming 215m.

Playing at home, the Kings pulled ahead with Jeremy Lin's (林書豪) clutch three-pointers, securing their victory over the Aquas in the TPBL final.
The Kings came out strong in the first quarter, dominating to build a 35-18 lead. By halftime, they had stretched their advantage to 61-38.
In the third quarter, the Aquas narrowed the deficit to 12 points, but Lin stepped up, sinking several tough three- pointers to extend the lead.
In the final quarter, the Kings pushed the

Petanque, the bowling game also known as boules, is more readily associated with French village squares where locals launch metal balls at a jack while enjoying an afternoon drink, but for decades, it has also been a beloved pastime for members of a club near the iconic Meskel Square in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. 
It was founded in the early 20th century to cater to French railway workers, who built a line connecting Addis Ababa                                    


SEMI-FINAL SWEEP: 
                                        Taiwanese are to take up all four berths in the men's doubles semi-finals, while three Taiwanese women's doubles pairings secured spots                                        Taiwan's badminton ace Chou Tien-chen stayed hot as he secured a semi-final berth in the men's singles at the US Open at Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Friday.
Chou entered the Super 300 tournament as the top seed and breezed past Victor Lai of Canada 21-19, 21-8 in 37 minutes, advancing to the semi-finals for the second straight tournament.
Earlier this month, the 35-year-old veteran finished runner-up at the Indonesia Open, becoming the oldest male shuttler to reach a Super 1000-level final.

Let us first discuss the national experience of transitioning from the British Empire to the Commonwealth of Nations. During the Age of Discovery, all European maritime powers had colonies — Portugal in South Asia and South America, Spain in Southeast Asia and South America, and the British Empire in North America and Asia. When the people of Britain's North American colonies gained independence and became a non-imperial nation-state, it influenced the independence of Britain's other colonies. 

When the US gained independence, most of its citizens were originally British colonists, in addition to indigenous Native Americans. Later, the global changes brought on by World War I and II attracted immigrants from various — mainly European — countries, thereby shaping the US into a global superpower. 

Many immigrants criticize the US, but if forced to decide between the US and the countries they left, they would still choose to remain in the US. From colonization to immigration — in today's world, the movement of nations and citizens has shifted from being forced to free choice. In the case of Taiwan and China, the citizens of the countries known as the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) can also choose to become citizens of other nations.

China has constantly claimed Taiwan as its own — but this claim defies the principles of historical experience. After the US gained independence from the British Empire, many of Britain's overseas colonies were also granted independence. The monarchy is now recognized only symbolically, and the king serves only as a ceremonial head of state of the constitutional monarchy. 

The UK is a civilized kingdom. Beyond the union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the British Empire formerly included countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand — all of which are now independent member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. Should any of the association's 56 member states choose to leave, it would not be an issue.

When the PRC considers Taiwan's national status, it often forgets the humiliation it went through and now seeks to impose such humiliation on others. It never imagined the kind of new international relationships that emerged when the British Empire allowed its colonies to become independent, thereby forming close bonds among nations. Those independent nations welcomed new immigrants — including those from China — and China itself has also accepted immigrants. 

The countries of today's world are no longer defined solely by the vertical inheritance of family lineage. Now, it is people who choose their country. 

In 1895, the Qing Empire ceded Taiwan to Japan, which colonized the nation for five decades. Later, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) — under the name ROC — held Taiwan hostage for more than 50 years. The now-democratized Taiwan must first break free from its history of colonization. China should not collude with the KMT — a party which once controlled Taiwan under the pretext of anti-communism, but now seeks to threaten Taiwan by aligning itself with the Chinese Communist Party. 

In many respects, China has already developed into a major global power, and thus should respect Taiwan's break away from the KMT's coercion. The two countries should develop bilateral relations based on national subjectivity. Peaceful and civil relations between Taiwan and China would earn global recognition. It is about time the PRC acted like a civilized country.

These dolls are sold out in stores from Singapore to London; a human-sized version recently fetched a whopping US$150,000 at an auction in Beijing. With all the social media buzz, it is worth asking if we are witnessing the rise of a new-age collectible, or whether Labubu is a mere fad destined to fade. 
Investors certainly want to know. Pop Mart International Group Ltd, the Chinese manufacturer behind this trendy toy, has rallied 178 percent

Throughout the past two years, whenever I have brought him his luggage or picked him up for the end of a semester or the start of a break, I have stayed at a hotel near his campus. In doing so, I have noticed a strange phenomenon: The hotel's TV contained an unusual number of Chinese channels, filled with accents that would make a person feel as if they are in China. It is quite exhausting.
A few days ago, while staying in the hotel, I found that of the 50 available TV channels,

This trope has gained traction in the world of Taiwanese news, likely with the best intentions. Anything that breaks the China-controlled narrative that Taiwan is doomed to be conquered is welcome, but after observing its rise in recent months, I now believe that the “silicon shield” is a myth — one that is ultimately working against Taiwan.
The basic silicon shield idea is that the world, particularly the US, would rush to defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion because they do not want Beijing to seize the nation's vital and unique chip industry.

With rows of beauty counters and a full lineup of brands, they once served as a powerful draw for customers. However, since last year, the halo surrounding the sector has begun to fade. It is not an isolated issue affecting one retailer — it is a widespread phenomenon across department stores in Taiwan.
Department store executives admit that business is tough, but they also stress that the root cause is not a drop in Taiwan's spending power or a surge in outbound travel. Instead, a                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Ukrainian drones struck a Russian ammunition depot in occupied Donetsk Oblast overnight on July 3, setting off a series of huge explosions, Ukraine's State Security Service said on July 3.

""Starting at 10 p.m., explosions rang out at the depots, followed by a powerful secondary detonation of ammunition and a fire,"" the SBU said in a post on social media. 

According to the SBU, the ammunition depot is located in the occupied Ukrainian city of Khartsyzsk, near Donetsk, which is ""of important strategic importance, as it is used by the Russians as a rear base.""

""The enemy has placed command posts, logistics centers, and ammunition depots there. All of them are legitimate military targets,"" the statement added.

Elsewhere on July 3, Ukraine confirmed strikes on the Energia factory in Russia's Lipetsk Oblast overnight, a facility that produces components for missiles and drones, including batteries for the Iskander missile system and cruise missiles.

Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Counter-Disinformation Center at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, confirmed the strike, calling Energia ""one of the most critical targets for Russia."" 

According to Kovalenko, the facility manufactures batteries for missile guidance and glider modules, including for the Iskander system and cruise missiles.

Ukraine's military regularly strikes military targets in Russian-occupied territories and deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues its war against Ukraine.

On the evening of June 30, Ukraine similarly struck a command post of the 8th Combined Arms Army of the Russian Armed Forces in the Russian-occupied part of Donetsk Oblast.

Russia has for months focused its offensive efforts on the embattled town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast and has recently been escalating attempts to break through to neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a region that has not yet seen combat.

U.S. weapons already in Poland en route to Ukraine have been halted, including advanced air defense systems and precision missiles, the Wall Street Journal reported on July 2.

The Pentagon confirmed the halt in a July 2 briefing, citing an ongoing ""capability review"" aimed at ensuring U.S. military assistance ""aligns with its strategic defense priorities.""

The shipment in Poland includes over two dozen PAC-3 Patriot missiles, more than two dozen Stinger air-defense systems, Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, and over 90 AIM air-to-air missiles intended for use with Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets, according to U.S. administration and congressional officials cited by the Wall Street Journal.

""We see this as a common-sense, pragmatic step towards having a framework to evaluate what munitions are sent and where,"" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said. 

The decision has sparked backlash from both sides of the political aisle in Washington. Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, called the pause ""unacceptable,"" while Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal labeled it ""fallacious and maybe even disingenuous.""

The pause comes at a critical moment for Ukraine, which faces intensified Russian missile and drone strikes. On June 29, Russia launched the largest aerial assault against Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022, targeting civilian infrastructure and cities far beyond the frontline.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, speaking on July 2, emphasized the urgency of continued Western support for Kyiv. ""I totally understand that the U.S. always has to make sure its interests are covered,"" he said. ""But in the short term, Ukraine cannot do without all the support it can get.""

The Pentagon has not provided a timeline for when the held-back shipments might resume.

Canada's air-traffic control agency says service is gradually resuming at major airports across the country where bomb threats early Thursday led to evacuations and ground stop orders.

Travellers were asked earlier in the morning to check with their airlines for flight-schedule disruptions, after Nav Canada said it was responding to threats made to its facilities at airports across the country.

Nav Canada later said on X that service is “gradually resuming” at affected sites after evacuation and “subsequent threat assessment by authorities.”

In an earlier social media post, the agency said six Canadian airports were affected.

“Early this morning, Nav Canada was made aware of bomb threats affecting facilities in Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver,” the agency said on X.

“Employees at impacted locations are safe, and a temporary ground stop has been implemented at the affected airports. We are collaborating with authorities to address the situation and ensure the safety of all personnel and passengers. Travellers are advised to check directly with their airline for the latest updates, as delays may occur.”

The Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport said on X that it was investigating a security incident and warned that operations may be disrupted, urging travellers to check their flight status.

The Ottawa Police Service also said on X that it was investigating a security incident at the airport.

The airport and police department gave no details on what caused the ground stoppage.

Officials at the Montreal airport were not immediately available for comment.

Canada's largest airport was unaffected by the threats. “Operations at Toronto Pearson continue to function without interruption,” said Erica Vella of the Greater Toronto Airports Authority.

Spokespeople for Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver's international airports confirmed a “security incident” had briefly affected their facilities, but had minimal impact on operations.

According to the airports' websites, most flights were delayed at mid-morning in Calgary, Montreal and Ottawa on Thursday, with a handful of cancelled departures in Ottawa.

According to FlightRadar24, the average delay at Ottawa's airport on Thursday morning is 70 minutes, compared with 26 minutes in Montreal and 38 minutes in Quebec City.

The delays cascaded through the domestic network, causing delayed arrivals in Toronto, Vancouver and other airports.

Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the impact on the airline was “minimal.”

Canada's national police force said Thursday that it is working with local police to monitor the security issues that arose at the airports.

“The RCMP is aware of threats made to various airports across Canada this morning and we continue to monitor the situation with our domestic partners,” said spokeswoman Camille Boily-Lavoie.

The federal government's transportation department is amplifying the message that travellers should double check for delays on Thursday.

“We are working with the airport authorities, Nav Canada and law enforcement to assess the situation and ensure the safety of passengers, employees and our airport infrastructures,” Simon Rivet, a spokesman for Transport Canada said in a statement.

“The situation may cause delays to flights, and we urge passengers to reach out to their carriers to stay up to date with any scheduling changes.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","What is BRICS and why does it matter?","https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-brics-and-why-does-it-matter/a-73087358","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 07:32:32 GMT","

BRICS leaders meet in Brazil this weekend to advance plans to challenge Western dominance. As more nations join the economic bloc, how will BRICS reshape power, trade and influence in a rapidly shifting world?

Leaders of the world's fast-growing BRICS economies gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this weekend, promising to strengthen trade and technology exchange within the bloc in the shadow of US President Donald Trump's tariff threat.

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will host the three-day talks, attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang among others.

The Kremlin has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an outstanding arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes over the war in Ukraine, will not be appearing.

DW recaps the history of BRICS and the nascent bloc's plans to take on the West.

Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill coined the term BRIC in 2001 to identify Brazil, Russia, India, and China as fast-growing economies with the potential to become global economic powers by 2050.

The term highlighted their rising gross domestic product (GDP), large populations, and increasing global influence.

Despite diverse political ideologies and social structures, policymakers in Brazil, Russia, India and China then took up the baton, initially holding informal talks between foreign ministers to lay the groundwork for collaboration. 

The first BRICS leaders' summit was held in Russia's Yekaterinburg in 2009. A year later, South Africa was invited to join the emerging bloc, and an 'S' was added to the BRIC acronym.

The creation of BRICS has since been described as a significant challenge to the US-led global political, economic and financial systems that have dominated since World War II.

The original members have advocated for a multipolar world order and a greater voice for fast-developing countries of the Global South in world affairs.

BRICS has since created an alternative to the World Bank, which funds infrastructure and development projects, as well as a new mechanism to provide financial support during economic crises, partially rivaling the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

BRICS policymakers have also mooted the possibility of launching their own currency to challenge the US dollar, the world's reserve currency, but progress has been slow.

The bloc has been keen to sign up other developing nations, especially those seeking greater alignment with other fast-growing economies.

BRICS now comprises 10 countries — the original five, along with Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia, which joined earlier this year.

Although it remains an informal bloc, the Brazilian Center for International Relations (CEBRI) last week labeled BRICS ""the first-ever transregional association of non-Western States,"" in a preview report for this weekend's Brazil summit.

Despite having no founding treaty, supporting secretariat or headquarters, BRICS has, on paper, grown into a significant geopolitical and economic power. 

The bloc represents more than 40% of the world's population and more than a third of global economic growth, based on purchasing power parity, exceeding that of the G7 group of developed nations.

Thanks to new members like Iran and the UAE, BRICS countries also control significant commodity markets, including around 40% of global oil production. The bloc also controls nearly three-quarters of rare earth materials, according to the BRICS website.

Mutual trade among members has already surpassed $1 trillion (€0.85 trillion), the website says.

According to CEBRI, BRICS nations applied for 44 million patents between 2009 and 2023, more than half of all patents registered globally. 

Through its New Development Bank (NDB), BRICS has approved over $39 billion for 120 projects, focusing on infrastructure, clean energy and sustainable development.

The BRICS chair position rotates every year among the different members, where the bloc's leaders have pushed for reform of global institutions like the United Nations Security Council, IMF and World Bank.

BRICS nations also continue to diversify from US dollar-denominated trade, a process known as dedollarization. Intra-BRICS trade is increasingly done in local currencies and alternative payment systems to the Western-backed Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).

However, plans for a BRICS currency have hit a stumbling block due to resistance from some members, particularly India, to China's economic dominance.

The plans were further stymied when Trump warned BRICS that the bloc would face 100% tariffs on imports to the US if a common currency were announced.

According to the bloc's website, BRICS is set for explosive growth, with 44 nations either formally applying for membership or making exploratory moves toward joining.

This year alone, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Uganda and Uzbekistan became partner countries, a prelude to formal membership, under the moniker BRICS+.

Other nations expressing interest in joining include: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Chad, Colombia, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Honduras, Laos, Kuwait, Morocco, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the Palestinian territories, Senegal, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

Saudi Arabia, which has strong ties with the United States, was slated to join BRICS last year but has not yet made a final decision. The BRICS website, however, still has the Kingdom listed as a member.

Turkey's plan to join was vetoed by India, citing Ankara's close ties with foe Pakistan.

Argentina had applied to join, but its application was withdrawn under President Javier Milei in December 2023, citing a preference to maintain close ties with the West.

BRICS is poised for massive expansion. Some analysts predict it could further challenge Western-led global institutions, while others argue that internal divisions and competing national interests may impede its progress.

China and Russia actively position BRICS as a counterweight to Western hegemony, while India and Brazil prioritize economic cooperation over geopolitical confrontation, potentially creating tensions within the bloc.

As well as China and India's border dispute, rivalries between Saudi Arabia — if it joins — and Iran, or Egypt and Ethiopia over the Nile River dam, could hinder consensus on political issues and dilute the bloc's ability to advance its interests.

The US currency's entrenched role in global trade and Beijing's curbs on the Chinese yuan's use in international trade could hamper the push for dedollarization, which some see more as an attempt by China and Russia to circumvent Western sanctions than a realistic strategy for a new reserve currency.

The US and European Union imposed punitive measures on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Iran's economy is similarly hurt by sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.

Analysts say other countries are supportive of plans for an alternative financial system to hedge their bets in case they face similar sanctions in the future.

Economic disparities among members pose another challenge for BRICS as the bloc grows. China's GDP far exceeds that of South Africa or newer members like Ethiopia, risking skewing priorities toward Beijing's interests.

There are also growing concerns about how democracies like India and Brazil can align with autocracies like China, Iran and Russia.

O'Neill, who coined the term BRIC, now thinks the grouping is a failed project, writing in November that BRICS ""serves no real purpose beyond generating symbolic gestures and lofty rhetoric.""

A shock group stage exit at the 2023 World Cup and a number of retirements mean a new look Germany face their first big test at Euro 2025. Germany are the most successful team in Euros history with eight titles.

New coach Christian Wück is leading the team in his firstmajor tournament and has already ruffled some feathers. Wück faced criticism from within the team for poor communication while dropping veteran defender Felicitas Rauch and Frankfurt striker Nicole Anyomi. Despite the snafu, it seems things have been papered over and Germany enter Switzerland in good spirits.

""We're so excited to be here,"" said midfielder Linda Dallmann as the squad arrived earlier this week. The team is particularly pleased about another change from recent tournaments  — Germany's camp is a stone's throw from downtown Zürich, a departure from the past approach of setting up an isolated compound far from any distractions (or things to do). 

""It's always cool to be well connected and have some opportunities for the team to get out and about. That's really important over the course of a tournament, so I think this is a perfect location,"" continued Dallmann.

""It's great — its nice to have our own space, but also good that it's not only football, football, football and only seeing the exact same people all the time, even if we cherish time together as a team. It's always good to be able to get out into the city,"" said defender Rebecca Knaak, who's preparing for her first major tournament.                

Another change from Germany's 2023 World Cup outing should immediately catch fans' eyes. Giulia Gwinn's captain's armband will look different from Popp's: she will be sporting a rainbow armband, which was banned by FIFA in Australia and New Zealand. 

“It's great that we'll be able to wear the rainbow armband. If we have the opportunity to wear it when we play, swapping it for something else is never up for debate,"" said Gwinn.

Captian's armbands explicitly supporting LGBTQ+ pride have a controversial past in German football. In addition to FIFA not allowing them in the last women's World Cup, they were famously banned at the 2022 Men's World Cup in Qatar.

The German team protested this decision before their tournament opener setting off a media firestorm which quickly heaped further pressure on the squad. UEFA has proven more lenient on the topic than FIFA in the past and rainbow armbands are likely to be a popular choice among captains in Switzerland.

“Our team stands for so much, and it's amazing that we can wear our values on our sleeve on such a big stage,"" said Gwinn.

On paper, this Germany squad looks thin compared to the side which reached the final of the last Euros. The international retirements of Popp, Svenja Huth, Marina Hegering and Merle Frohms have left a deficit of top level experience while Lena Oberdorf, the engine of Germany's midfield, wasn't able to recover from a season-long injury.

Gwinn's role will be crucial in bringing together the new generation. Sjoeke Nüsken, of Chelsea, is another who Wück will look to build his team around while the likes of Klara Bühl, Dallmann and Jule Brand need to make the step up from talented squad members to big game players if Germany are to succeed.

Despite an exceptional goal record of 52 in 75 caps, Lea Schüller has spent her Germany career in the shadows, behind Popp. Her only previous tournament goals have come in big Germany wins against less fancied opposition but Schüller now has the weight of expectation on her shoulders.

With three goals in Germany's last two matches and a hat trick in the German Cup final that completed the double for Bayern Munich in May, Schüller arrives brimming with confidence.

Tournament debutants Poland are Germany's first opponent (July 4)  and should prove straightforward if Wück's side play to their potential. After that, it's Denmark (July 8) and Sweden (July 12).

The final group match looks the toughest, with the Swedes unbeaten since a loss to France in July 2024 and having knocked out the USA on a run to the semifinals of the 2023 World Cup. The likes of Magdalena Eriksson (121 caps), Sofia Jakobsson (165) and captain Kosovare Asllani (199) offer huge experience while Barcelona forward Fridolina Rolfö is a top class performer.

Denmark also have one of those in Pernille Harder but appear to have less depth of talent and have struggled at recent tournaments.

The battle for President Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" appears to be nearing an end. But Trump's signature tax and spending policy isn't popular, even within his own party.

Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" has passed the US Senate and now only needs to be sent to his desk by the Republican-controlled House to be signed into law.

It means the US president, who has long pressured Republicans to pass the bill, is now on the brink of an important legislative milestone and political victory.

Much of his second term has so far been marked by executive orders, which are presidential instructions with the force of laws but which don't need the approval of Congress. But having this major spending and tax bill passed by Congress will finance a huge chunk of his presidential campaign promises. 

""I think, politically, this is a winner for Donald Trump, he can point to some sort of legislative success for his agenda,"" said Steven Webster, a political scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington.

Trump has demanded the House pass the bill for him to sign by July 4 — suggesting his desire for an Independence Day-themed victory lap — but there are still hurdles to overcome within his own party.

""Some people dislike the bill because of the cuts to part of the American health care and safety net system,"" said Peter Loge, a political analyst at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

""Some people don't like the legislation because it adds a tremendous amount to the US debt. It's incredibly expensive.""

The big bill is a big attempt to check off Trump's long list of campaign promises.

It includes a mix of individual and business tax cuts, massive cash injections to immigration controls, increased military spending and a ramping up of fossil fuel incentives.

There are also changes to health and social program eligibility and a winding down of some of the climate transition initiatives introduced by former President Joe Biden.

The winners, unsurprisingly, are policy realms that have been the foundation of Trump's ""America First"" mantra.

A total of $178 billion (about €150 billion) in spending will go to programs intended to restrict immigration, including resuming the construction of Trump's Mexico border wall, as well as to staff and resource border police, immigration prosecutions, detention and criminal investigations.

Around $153 billion will be spent on defense: shipbuilding, missile defense, nuclear weapons and supporting military assistance of the border.

And after promising to ""drill, baby, drill"" during his campaign and in his victory speech — a call for fossil fuel extraction to be ramped up — the bill would simultaneously incentivize gas exploration and exports, while ending concessions and incentives for electric vehicles, clean energy and emissions reduction programs.

There are also tax cuts of about $4.5 trillion (€3.8 trillion) for individuals and businesses, which include Trump's pledges to stop taxing tips and overtime. 

""Nothing in this bill should be surprising,"" Loge said, ""It promises to spend a lot of money capturing immigration concerns in the US... it would spend a huge amount of money strengthening our immigration system and finding and deporting people who are here without proper authorization. That's by-and-large popular among many people.""

In both houses, Republican leaders have been forced to balance the demands of holdouts — those unhappy with the measures contained within the bill.

Debt is a major concern for fiscal conservatives. Nonpartisan analysts project about $3.4 trillion (€2.3 trillion) will be added to the US national debt over the next decade because of the bill. The debt limit has been raised by $5 trillion.

The debt disquiet inside the Capitol has been echoed outside, most notably from one-time Trump ally Elon Musk. 

Prior to the Senate passing the bill, the world's richest person and the top donor to Trump's presidential campaign threatened to run candidates against Republicans who supported the measures during upcoming primary contests, and went as far to suggest he'd start his own ""America Party"" in opposition.

""I think the party is likely to struggle to explain how adding three-and-a-half trillion dollars to the national debt is in line with their stated goal of getting the nation's fiscal house in order,"" said Webster.

The bill is also unpopular with the public.

According to a Quinnipiac University poll from late June, 55% of US voters oppose the bill and 29% support it (the rest didn't offer an opinion). About two-thirds of Republican voters are in favor. Analysts DW spoke with said that when the content of the bill tends to be explained to voters, including Republicans, support declines.

Changes to health and social programs likely play a major role. 

New eligibility rules, particularly for the Medicaid scheme which extends health care coverage to low-income people, and the SNAP food aid program, could see millions of people lose health insurance coverage by 2034, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office. In all, more than $1 trillion have been cut from health measures. 

""It's about 17 million that would lose coverage,"" said Elisabeth Wright Burak, a senior fellow at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, a nonpartisan research center.

""Even if there are some sort of tax or other benefits, if you're losing your health insurance coverage, or you're losing your nutrition assistance, that's a hit to your [personal] bottom line."" 

That could also hit important parts of Trump's MAGA base — including working Americans who have flipped their support to him during the last decade.

While many of the health program changes have been made because of what Trump has called large-scale ""fraud and abuse"" within the US public health infrastructure, many experts have argued that the claimed attempt to cut fat from health care initiatives is hacking into muscle. 

""There's not a lot of fat in Medicaid,"" said Wright Burak. ""Certainly there are things that could be improved, but most of that money is already going to health care services.""

Trump is expected to take a major hand in final negotiations with the Republican House representatives. According to The Associated Press, he has already met with moderate Republicans and is set to do the same with the conservative caucus.

They're saying little publicly in the face of cuts that will punch multibillion-dollar holes in their states' budgets.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The last time a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump moved to slash Medicaid spending, in 2017, a key political force stood in their way: GOP governors.

Now, as Congress steamrolls toward passing historic Medicaid cuts of about $1 trillion over 10 years through Trump's tax and spending legislation, red-state governors are saying little publicly about what it does to health care — even as they face reductions that will punch multibillion-dollar holes in their states' budgets.

Medicaid, a program jointly run by states and the federal government, covers more than 70 million low-income or disabled people, including nearly half of the nation's children. Republicans say the $900 billion-a-year program was allowed to grow too large under Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden by adding nondisabled adults they say don't deserve government assistance, and they have long sought to scale it back.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Some of the biggest health cuts in the legislation Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill” are achieved through new policies that would reduce enrollment by imposing more paperwork demands on enrollees, including a requirement that many prove they're working. Those policies would affect only states that expanded Medicaid to more low-income people under the Affordable Care Act.

Nineteen of those states are led by Republican governors. Their silence on the bill's health measures is giving political cover to GOP lawmakers from their states as they seek to cut Medicaid coverage for millions of people who gained it within the last decade.

KFF Health News contacted all 19 governors for comment on the legislation's Medicaid cuts. Only six responded. Most said they backed imposing a work requirement on adult Medicaid enrollees.

“Implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults is a good and necessary reform so that Medicaid is being used for temporary assistance and not a permanent entitlement,” said Drew Galang, a spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia.

“Governor Rhoden supports workforce participation as a requirement of Medicaid expansion eligibility,” said Josie Harms, a spokesperson for South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, adding that congressional lawmakers have the governor's support: “South Dakota has an excellent federal delegation, and Governor Rhoden trusts them to fight for South Dakota's priorities while delivering on President Trump's promises.”

In a sign of how the political winds have changed, none of the governors said anything about another of the legislation's significant cuts, to provider taxes — a tool that all of their states use to help pay their share of Medicaid and gain additional funds from the federal government. That change is expected to cost states billions.

In contrast to the radio silence from GOP governors, Democratic governors have campaigned against the megabill for weeks.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro posted on the social platform X that Trump and congressional Republicans were misleading Americans by saying they were cutting only waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid.

“They're rushing to kick hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians off their healthcare — and lying about it,” he posted. “The damage this will do here in Pennsylvania and across America is staggering and will be felt for years to come.”

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul on July 1 charged that Trump's legislation would devastate hospitals and could lead to more than 34,000 job cuts in her state.

“The collective impact of the GOP reconciliation bill in Washington, D.C., could force hospitals to curtail critically needed services such as maternity care and psychiatric treatment, not to mention to downsize operations, and even close entirely,” she said in a statement.

In 2017, the chorus was bipartisan, as Republican governors in Ohio, Nevada, and Massachusetts spoke out against cutting Medicaid. Trump's bill to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act and roll back its Medicaid expansion narrowly failed in the Senate.

“It's been surprising that red-state governors, particularly those in Medicaid expansion states, haven't spoken out against Medicaid cuts,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “Republican governors were a potent political force in the failed 2017 effort to repeal and replace the ACA, including Medicaid expansion.”

What's changed since 2017, policy experts say, is that there are fewer moderate Republican governors, and GOP state executives who advocated for Medicaid expansion over a decade ago are no longer in office.

Additionally, seven of the then-red states that expanded Medicaid did so via ballot initiative, mostly over opposition from their governors.

In fact, the Medicaid work requirement is backed by many Republican governors, even if it means less federal Medicaid money and leads to fewer people covered.

Several states, including Arkansas and Ohio, have already passed state laws to implement a requirement that adults enrolled under the ACA's Medicaid expansion work, volunteer, go to school, or participate in job training. Most states have yet to bring work requirement programs to fruition because they are waiting for federal government approval.

Charles “Chip” Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, a trade group of investor-owned hospitals, said that while fewer governors have engaged publicly in trying to block Medicaid cuts under the bill, federal lawmakers are hearing from legislators in their states.

A political dilemma for Republican governors is that, unlike in 2017, the bill before Congress is not legislation aimed expressly at repealing Obamacare. With a scope broader than health care, it would extend many of Trump's tax cuts and direct billions in new spending toward border security, immigration enforcement, and the military, while also cutting health care spending.

“It's like playing multidimensional chess rather than focusing on one issue,” Kahn said.

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said some Republican governors may have expressed concerns privately to their states' GOP senators but are not speaking out publicly for fear of drawing Trump's wrath.

“Why are they being cagey? Trump and not wanting to be ‘Liz Cheney'd,'” Jacobs said, referring to the Republican former Wyoming lawmaker whom Trump helped oust after she served as vice chair of an inquiry into his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The political peril Republican lawmakers face in publicly challenging Trump remains explicit. On June 29, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced he would not run for reelection after he voiced concerns about the bill and the president threatened to back a primary challenger. Tillis was one of three GOP senators to vote against it on July 1, though it still narrowly passed.

In addition to the work requirement, the biggest Medicaid cuts in the bill stem from its restrictions on provider taxes — levies that states impose on hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care institutions to help increase their federal reimbursement. Much of the additional money is then returned to the health care providers in the form of higher payments for their Medicaid patients.

The practice, which has been adopted in every state but Alaska, has been criticized by some Beltway Republicans as “money laundering” — even though the taxes are approved by state lawmakers and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and have been allowed under federal law for decades.

The Senate bill would limit the money states could raise — a move that would mean billions in funding cuts to states and their hospitals.

The states with Republican governors that expanded Medicaid are Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Utah.

One of the governors who expressed concerns about repealing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in 2017 was Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Democrat at the time.

In a June 2017 letter to West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, Justice wrote: “Since so many of our people count on Medicaid, any cut to Medicaid would destroy families in West Virginia.” He added that “the consequences would be beyond catastrophic.”

On July 1, Justice — elected to the Senate as a Republican last year — voted for Trump's megabill, including its Medicaid cuts.

“The Senator believes this bill strikes a good balance between protecting the most vulnerable and those who rely on the program while rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure the program is run efficiently for those deserving,” William O'Grady, a Justice spokesperson, said in an email July 2.

Fawning for Trump's favor, European leaders are ramping up military spending at the expense of public benefits.

Fawning for Trump's favor, European leaders are ramping up military spending at the expense of public benefits.

At last week's NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his country would be buying a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S., each one capable of carrying a payload of tactical nuclear weapons. It marks the first time since shortly after the end of the Cold War that U.S. nuclear weapons capable of being dropped from aircraft are to be stationed in the U.K.

At the NATO summit, a triumphant Trump — who has made skepticism about NATO and, at best, ambivalence about its collective defense provisions centerpieces of his emergent political ideology over the decades – engaged in one of the most brazen displays of shakedown politics in modern history. In exchange for maintaining U.S. security commitments, the U.S. president demanded, in the weeks leading up to the summit, that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent of their GDP on defense and security, more than doubling what most NATO members, with the exception of Poland and the Baltic States, currently spend.

Leaders of the NATO member countries competed with each other over who could fawn the most in efforts to gain Trump's favor, and ultimately almost all of them fell into line, agreeing to huge defense spending hikes over the coming decade. Their goal is that by 2035 they will be spending at least 3.5 percent of their respective GDPs on core military spending, and another 1.5 percent on security and miscellaneous other expenditures designed to harden economies and infrastructure against cyberattacks, people trafficking, and additional risks and perceived risks to NATO economies.

The one exception was Spain, the socialist government of which balked at the increased spending commitment and received an opt-out, to the chagrin of Trump, who launched a blitz of social media posts against the Spanish government and declared that, in consequence, Spain would have to pay twice as much in tariffs in any future trade deal with the U.S. (This seemingly ignores the fact that Spain is a part of the EU and can't be treated differently from other bloc members in any negotiated agreement.)

NATO leader Mark Rutte, ex-head of the Dutch government, lauded Trump as “Daddy,” and praised to the rafters his decision to pre-emptively attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Photos showed him laughing and smiling at every Trump aside, like a courtier at the Sun King's court, a display of quite astounding sycophancy. Other NATO leaders followed suit. Cumulatively, The Guardian wrote, it was an “orchestrated grovel,” the likes of which hadn't previously been seen in U.S. relations with its allies. This wasn't a conference of equals; rather it was a spectacle in which the U.S.'s strongman demanded — and received — the sort of accolades and over-the-top tributes that Soviet general secretaries used to demand from satellite state leaders in Eastern Europe, or that emperors of old required of conquered vassals.

Trump demanded that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent of their GDP on defense and security

Trump's agenda was pretty straightforward: if Europe and Canada wanted the security guarantees that the U.S. has provided since World War II, then they would have to pay through the nose for the privilege. This would be manifested through massively increasing military spending, reducing domestic safety net spending, and channeling hundreds of billions of dollars toward U.S. arms manufacturers.

The F-35A fighter jets alone will cost the British government over 1 billion pounds, and, once refueling planes, which the jets will need to operate far from U.K. shores, and other supportive infrastructure are factored in, that cost will rise still further. That's money going straight to Lockheed Martin.

This same week, the U.K. government has been pushing for massive reductions to social safety-net payments for hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities — and has, in consequence, faced a huge rebellion from within its own Labour Party ranks. And that follows on from an ill-fated effort last year to curtail an energy assistance program intended to ensure that Brits, especially pensioners, could keep their heating on during the cold winter months.

Much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems.

Similar trade-offs will, in coming years, be felt throughout NATO. Unlike the U.S., which for years has been able to tap international lenders' willingness to fund an American debt spree, most other NATO members simply do not have the market clout — or under the rules that bind the EU together, the legal right — to borrow on such a massive scale. As a result, much of the increase in military spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and even pension and health care systems. Germany, for example, is planning to nearly double its military spending over the next five years, leaving a hole of tens of billions of euros in its budget. Denmark has created an “acceleration fund” that will channel an additional $7 billion into military spending over the coming two years, representing roughly 1.5 percent of its GDP. France, which has long battled with its own budget woes, will likely have to introduce a combination of tax hikes and social spending cuts to fund its military build-up. Poland has asked the European Commission to shift nearly $7 billion in green projects expenditures allotted to Poland into military spending instead. The continental commitments to increased military spending likely will result in a further erosion of the decades-old European social compact.

While Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up.

Caught between Putin's expansionist and imperialistic impulses — as demonstrated so brutally in Ukraine and with the increasingly militarist rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin — and Trump's transactional, America First foreign policy, Europe's leaders have decided to embrace the sort of massive ramp-up in military spending that so often serves as the prelude to war. No one wants to be caught wrongfooted should Putin order his military to breach NATO borders on the East, or NATO airspace elsewhere in Europe. No one wants to be the country that Trump steps back from defending — as he has, in the past explicitly said he would do, announcing he would encourage Putin's forces to “do whatever the hell they want” — because they aren't meeting the military spending goals that he has laid out. And thus, NATO's member states have ratcheted up military expenditures to a degree that, even a couple of months ago, would have seemed to be both implausible and dangerously destructive toward Europe and Canada's social compacts.

Not all of that money now earmarked for military spending will flow to U.S. defense contractors; but given the U.S.'s pre-eminence in the field of high-tech weaponry, it's a sure bet that, at least in the short term, while Europe grapples with how to diversify away from an unpredictable and even predatory U.S., an awful lot of it will.

All of this stands to benefit the military-industrial complex mightily. The losers, of course, will be those who rely on the social safety net programs that get pushed aside in the rush to find funds to boost military spending. But it won't happen without resistance: Stamer's announcement immediately triggered opposition from anti-nuclear groups. During the last years of the Cold War, groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament engaged in civil disobedience campaigns to pressure the government to remove nuclear weapons from the Greenham Common air base. Now, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups have once again begun mobilizing for rallies, as early as this weekend, at the Royal Air Force bases slated to host the planes and weapons.

It is, of course, early days. But there are signs that European populaces won't uncritically rally around Trump's demand for wholesale, breakneck rearmament. Of course, Europe and Canada do need to work out ways to protect their interests in the face of U.S. retrenchment. But what Trump is demanding is something entirely different; he is insisting on a form of tribute imposed via mandated weapons purchases — and while Europe's leaders fawn, it's not at all clear that their populaces will back them up.

They are the authors of Crowded Out: The Competitive Landscape of Contemporary International NGOs.

 Sarah Bush and Jennifer Hadden

The 1990s were a golden age for nongovernmental organizations. It was a time when well-known groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Oxfam grew their budgets and expanded their global reach. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of international NGOs—not-for-profit groups that are largely independent from government and work in multiple countries in pursuit of the public good—increased by 42 percent. Thousands of organizations were founded. Many of these organizations championed liberal causes, such as LGBTQ rights and gun control. Conservative groups emerged, too, with rival policy agendas.

As their numbers grew, NGOs became important political players. Newly minted organizations changed state policies. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a coalition of NGOs formed in 1992, successfully pushed for the adoption of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention in 1997—an effort that won it the Nobel Peace Prize. Transparency International, a Berlin-based NGO established in 1993, raised the profile of corruption issues through its advocacy, building momentum toward the adoption of the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2003. Future UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan declared at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights that “the twenty-first century will be an era of NGOs.” In an influential 1997 essay in Foreign Affairs, Jessica Mathews argued that the end of the Cold War brought with it a “power shift”: global civil society, often formalized as NGOs, was wresting authority and influence from states. More and more often, Mathews contended, NGOs were taking over responsibilities for the delivery of development and humanitarian assistance, pushing governments around during international negotiations, and setting the policy agenda on issues such as environmental protection and human rights.

Today, however, the picture looks remarkably different. The population of international NGOs has stagnated: between 2010 and 2020, their numbers grew by less than five percent. Over the past two decades, public skepticism about the virtues and advantages of NGOs has deepened, governments have honed strategies to undermine NGO activities, and many of the revenue streams that keep NGOs operational—such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which officially closed this week—have begun to dry up. Overall, the NGO sector has less political opportunity and capacity than it once had. And in many cases, NGOs have not just lost power relative to previous decades. States have clawed that power back. The result is an end to the era of NGOs—a great loss for the people who have relied on these organizations' services, and a boon to autocratic governments that have seen their advocacy as a threat.

Our research over the past ten years has documented changes in the international NGO sector. In addition to collecting information from organizational directories and tax records to study trends in NGO founding, closures, and budgets, we spoke with senior staff from many different types of organizations—by fielding a large-scale survey, holding focus groups, and conducting qualitative interviews—to gather the perspectives of those that work in this sector.

What we found was a stark transformation. When NGOs first rose to prominence as international actors, their commitment to principled activity and their nonprofit character distinguished them from governments and private companies. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, for instance, earned plaudits for protecting vulnerable individuals and promoting stricter international standards for human rights. NGOs also gained legitimacy because they provided important input to global governance, channeling the voices of citizens and interests that otherwise were not well represented in international institutions. Those working within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, for example, brought perspectives from environmentalists and communities affected by climate change to high-level negotiations. Recognizing the value of such guidance, international organizations expanded NGOs' access significantly. The services NGOs provided directly to communities, moreover, brought them into closer cooperation with national governments. From the 1990s onward, governments increasingly relied on NGOs such as CARE International and Mercy Corps to deliver foreign aid. In this optimistic time, the rise of NGOs was seen by many as a chance for organized civil society to make the world a better place, providing better service delivery and influencing progressive policy change on the environment, human rights, and arms control.

By the early years of the twenty-first century, however, criticism of NGOs was mounting. Skeptics on both the right and the left raised questions about NGOs' effectiveness, accountability, and extensive political influence. Some NGOs made attempts at reform. They created transparency initiatives to share more information about their finances and decision-making processes. In the 2010s, many groups began to reorganize operations through localization initiatives, which were meant to devolve decision-making and spending power to partners in developing countries. But that has not stopped world leaders—including in Western countries that were key to NGOs' initial growth—from making vehement objections to NGO activities. Members of the European Parliament have accused environmental NGOs of corruption, opacity, and working against EU objectives, values, and interests. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has questioned the “political neutrality” of civil society groups that receive government funding, accusing several of partisan activity.



Some of the criticisms are grounded in real developments in the NGO sector. For one, as the number of NGOs rose, groups had to compete for resources. NGO staff frequently note that this competition for funding from donors, access to governments, and attention from the media and the public can distract from their service delivery and advocacy. For example, staff who work in disaster relief have described to us how, after a catastrophe, NGOs jockey to lead the response effort in order to secure funding and media attention. This impedes coordination among humanitarian groups, sometimes to the detriment of the people they are trying to help. The perception that NGOs are primarily focused on courting donors and the media—regardless of whether such behavior takes place—has weakened the notion that they are different from for-profit firms.

The NGO world has also been rocked by prominent cases of misconduct. For example, Oxfam Great Britain, a national affiliate of an international organization that aims to reduce poverty, was embroiled in a sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti in 2018, making it ineligible for British government funding for three years. The organization eventually had its funding access restored, only to face additional accusations of sexual abuse and fraud in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2021. Similar scandals have plagued humanitarian and development operations run by Plan International and the Red Cross. These cases of unethical behavior toward vulnerable aid recipients have had lasting harmful effects on the reputations not just of individual NGOs but of the whole sector.

Public trust in NGOs has suffered as a result. In 25 years of Edelman Trust Barometer polling across 28 countries, 2021 was the first year that respondents reported that they had more trust in businesses than in NGOs. In 2025, businesses were seen as nearly as ethical as NGOs and far more competent.

These critiques of NGOs come at a bad political moment for the sector. In the liberal order that dominated after the Cold War, donor states' and international organizations' support for NGOs spread to countries across the world. As countries became more democratic, especially in Africa and eastern Europe, they became more welcoming of such bodies. The number of nondemocracies that permitted NGOs to operate also expanded in the 1990s, with countries such as China and Zimbabwe attempting to bolster state capacity by allowing NGOs to deliver essential public goods. But this tolerance has eroded as challenges to democracy grow. Particularly since the late 2010s, democratic rights have declined globally, including in large countries such as India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey. This shift has gone hand in hand with greater scrutiny of and stricter restrictions on NGOs. International NGOs' ability to operate has contracted or disappeared altogether in nondemocracies, and the likelihood that domestic civil society groups will face repression for cooperating with international NGOs has increased.

Many authoritarian governments now fear that allowing NGOs to operate freely will create pressures that lead to democratization or even regime change, and so they have sought ways to undercut these organizations to protect their hold on power. In Russia, for example, President Vladimir Putin pushed through a law in 2006 that imposed broad restrictions on NGO activities, including by allowing the government to deny the registration and prohibit the programming of any NGO that the government deems a “threat to the Russian Federation.” The crackdown came amid worsening relations between Moscow and the West and was motivated, in part, by Putin's belief that Western-aligned NGOs had orchestrated the Color Revolutions—a series of protest movements against autocratic rule in former Soviet states and Serbia in the early twenty-first century—and could stir similar protest activity in Russia.

In 2012, Putin's government went even further, passing a law that requires all NGOs that engage in political activity and receive foreign funding to register as foreign agents, which subjects them to onerous financial reporting requirements and enables government monitoring of their activities. They also must identify themselves publicly as foreign agents, undermining their credibility with domestic audiences. The Russian foreign agents law became a prototype for similar legislation in many other countries, including Georgia, Hungary, and Kyrgyzstan.



According to research by the political scientist Suparna Chaudhry, more than 130 countries have adopted restrictions on international and foreign-funded NGOs in the past three decades. In addition to imposing burdensome administrative rules such as those in the Russian law, these restrictions can also create the conditions for legal sanctioning, imprisonment, or the violent repression of activists. Under such pressures, NGOs find it difficult to work on human rights, gender, anticorruption, democracy, environmental protection, and other politically sensitive issues.

In India, for example, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has revoked the registrations of thousands of foreign-funded NGOs since 2014. This crackdown targeted well-known organizations such as the environmental group Greenpeace India, which was barred from receiving foreign donations in 2015—and as a result had to shed staff and close two of its offices. Citing India's 2010 Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, the government charged that Greenpeace had “prejudicially affected the economic interest of the state” and concealed the receipt of foreign funds. The group claims that it was targeted for its efforts to organize communities to protest pollution and coal mining, and it has denied the allegation that it misreported its funds. To date, Indian court rulings have allowed Greenpeace to keep its offices open, but the organization has scaled back and reoriented many of its campaigns. In Ethiopia, meanwhile, the researchers Kendra Dupuy, James Ron, and Aseem Prakash have found that an NGO registration law introduced in 2009 forced nearly all human rights organizations there to close, and those that remained stopped their rights-based advocacy work and began to provide only general development services such as education and poverty-alleviation programs.

Undermining NGOs can take less direct forms, too. In some cases, governments have created NGO-like organizations that, while posing as citizens' groups, pursue the governments' own agendas. Low-quality or “zombie” international election monitors, for instance, now observe elections in countries such as Azerbaijan, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. These groups endorse contests that are neither free nor fair, providing autocratic leaders a way to dispute the assessments of more reliable election monitors, such as the Carter Center. Government-organized NGOs also submit written reports and make oral statements as part of the UN's Universal Periodic Review, a peer review of each UN member state's human rights record that takes place in four-year cycles, to praise repressive countries. These NGO impostors can muddy the waters of genuine advocacy by civil society and further erode the legitimacy of NGOs in the eyes of the public.

The growing influence of nondemocracies—especially China and Russia—in global politics has eased the way for a proliferation of government strategies to check the power of NGOs. The political scientists Christopher Adolph and Aseem Prakash have found that the more developing countries orient their exports toward China and away from the West, the more likely they are to repress NGOs—because Beijing, unlike Western governments, does not use trade sanctions to pressure other countries to protect human rights. One of us (Bush), together with the political scientists Christina Cottiero and Lauren Prather, has documented how Russia has consistently cast doubt on the legitimacy of Western election observers and denounced democracy promotion efforts as a violation of state sovereignty since the early 2000s. As a result of Moscow's efforts, countries are more likely to host low-quality election monitors when they have closer political and economic ties to Russia.

Even if they disapprove of NGOs' political activities, governments have often hesitated to place severe restrictions on such groups because NGOs fund and implement valuable development, health, and humanitarian aid programs. But this incentive is changing. As budget constraints tighten, competing priorities mount, and populist opposition intensifies, governments have begun to reduce their spending on foreign aid—a major source of funding for international NGOs. Overseas development assistance by top donor countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development fell by more than seven percent in 2024, with significant reductions likely still to come.

This change has been most abrupt in the United States, where President Donald Trump's administration has cut nearly all foreign aid programs since he entered office in January. But the trend precedes Trump and applies beyond the United States. Development budgets have also come under threat in Europe. In some cases, the pressure comes from right-wing parties, as in Norway and Sweden, but in others the impetus for retrenchment has come from the center and the left. Germany, the world's second-largest donor in terms of formal development assistance, made steep cuts to both humanitarian and development aid as part of an austerity drive led by the coalition government composed of progressive, green, and center-right parties in 2024. The new conservative chancellor, who faces demands to raise defense spending, is unlikely to reverse those steps. The United Kingdom has been slashing its foreign aid budget since 2020 amid a weak post-pandemic economic recovery, and the current Labour government expects to make further cuts as it, too, ramps up defense spending. France, facing decreased growth and a ballooning public deficit, also significantly reduced its budget for overseas development assistance in 2024.



The pool of resources available to NGOs is shrinking at the same time that skepticism grows at the highest levels of government about the wisdom of using these groups to deliver foreign aid. When the U.S. government officially shut down USAID, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that “the executives of the countless NGOs” the agency had supported were “the only ones living well . . . while those they purported to help fell further behind.” And in the Netherlands, right-wing Foreign Trade and Development Minister Reinette Klever has called for both reducing foreign aid and decreasing funding to civil society organizations as a proportion of government aid.

Some nongovernmental funders may step up in response to reductions in public spending. In the United States, over 70 foundations have signed a “meet the moment” pledge to fill gaps created by the Trump administration's cuts. A group of private donors has also created a “bridge fund” to help provide short-term support to programs whose funds were frozen as part of the administration's shutdown of USAID. Given the current global financial uncertainty, however, it is a difficult time for philanthropies and other private donors to make major investments. And ultimately, private capital cannot match the economic resources of states.

Many organizations worldwide have already begun to shed staff, and the loss of funding will further curtail humanitarian relief efforts, programs for migrants, vaccine administration, and other NGO activities. It also leaves NGOs vulnerable to repressive governments that allow these groups to operate only because they provide useful services. Such governments may, instead, turn instead to China, which offers an alternative source of development assistance via its Belt and Road Initiative. The Chinese model does not involve NGOs or expect recipient countries to meet any human rights or democracy standards. In effect, without the value that Western money affords them, NGOs in many parts of the world may become targets of governments that see their independent advocacy as more trouble than it's worth.

Growing popular skepticism of NGOs, active government efforts to undermine these organizations, and shrinking resources all reduce the power of NGOs in world politics. In many cases, states have reclaimed this power for themselves. A government that expels human rights monitors increases its ability to control information and suppress dissent. A government that restrains environmental NGOs has an easier time polluting and engaging in destructive economic activity. And without an active civil society at home, a government becomes more insulated from the pressure of international organizations and foreign governments when it fails to live up to treaty obligations or societal expectations. These developments enhance the power of the state and feed into the global decline of liberal norms.

If NGOs are to reverse these trends, they may now have to do much of the work themselves. It seems unlikely that governments will suddenly expand their foreign aid budgets or that growing illiberalism will soon give way to a friendlier international environment. NGOs can highlight their many good deeds and capacity to learn from past mistakes, but that will do only so much to restore their legitimacy. Organizations will also need to undertake overdue reforms to make their financial reporting more transparent and increase their accountability to their beneficiaries. And if they work together, NGOs may be able to resist repression: in Kenya in 2013 and Nigeria in 2017, civil society groups organized successful campaigns to prevent the adoption of legal restrictions on foreign-funded NGOs.



Where government funding is no longer available, NGOs will need to think creatively to either refocus their programming or seek alternative sources of support. Ultimately, however, many may fold under the financial strain. Other types of actors—including socially conscious businesses and direct-giving campaigns such as GiveWell—could step in to provide some of the services these NGOs once did. But NGOs' critical roles as advocates and watchdogs may simply be left unfilled.

After the Cold War, the dramatic growth of NGOs brought with it a transfer of power from states to civil society. This development benefited democratic governments whose interests were largely aligned with these organizations' objectives—in 2001, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell famously (and controversially) called NGOs a “force multiplier” for achieving U.S. foreign policy goals, including democracy promotion and human rights protection. By reducing the foreign aid budgets that support NGO activities, the United States and Europe are walking away from a key source of influence. They have little to gain from a weakened NGO sector; nondemocratic governments, on the other hand, see political advantages in the suppression of organizations that promote liberal values.

The post–Cold War power shift generated optimism that an active and well-resourced global civil society would change the world for the better. But the NGO sector was never impervious to political challenges or financial constraints. What the optimists did not foresee was that power could eventually shift back.

 William Hurst and Peter Trubowitz

Hope springs eternal in the world of great-power diplomacy. Even today, in the throes of a norm-busting trade war with China, there is talk of some kind of leader-to-leader grand bargain between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Trump says he “would love to get a deal with China.” Xi, who has responded to Trump's tariff broadside in a measured and targeted way, has left the door open for a negotiated settlement. Such a breakthrough in U.S.-Chinese relations might sound alluring at this particularly fraught moment, but the history of the strategic rivalry between China and the United States and each country's internal politics make the likelihood of reaching one remote.

Since 1950, China and the United States have pivoted from cooperation to confrontation and back again, several times. They have done so for geopolitical and domestic political reasons. As a rule, they have been able to cooperate on security only when facing a clear and present danger from a common enemy. U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in 1972, for example, led to a series of agreements aimed at containing the Soviet Union. And the two countries have managed economic cooperation only when both were governed by domestic coalitions that supported the expansion of international trade, as during the 1990s and early 2000s. Cooperation across both security and economic affairs, meanwhile, has always been elusive.

Today, there is nothing—internationally or domestically—that would suggest this is a propitious moment for China and the United States to transcend their differences in either the security or economic realm. Both countries are currently governed by strident nationalist coalitions, with an antiglobalization backlash dominating domestic politics. There is also no common security threat drawing the two countries together. Indeed, they are more likely to find themselves on opposite sides (or at least at orthogonal purposes) regarding international conflicts, such as those between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Iran. Only once in the past hundred years, at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s, did China and the United States find themselves completely at loggerheads on both dimensions of statecraft. With today's environment becoming more like that one, it is hard to imagine either leader meaningfully resetting relations or addressing any of the major issues dividing them.

Trump won't want to play the cards in his hand. If he were to push for a grand bargain, it would almost certainly be a Faustian one for the United States. For Washington to seal any sweeping, across-the-board deal, the United States would likely have to make concessions on Taiwan or on Beijing's claims in the South China Sea—thus potentially unraveling a security architecture that has underpinned regional stability for decades.

The strategic costs to the United States of conceding influence in the region to China far outweigh any potential economic benefits—including increased access to the Chinese market or even resurgent American manufacturing. Given the circumstances, American policymakers should focus on more manageable, critical goals, such as reducing the risk of inadvertent war, particularly in the South China Sea and other flash points. A small but real step back from the brink would be grand indeed.

History shows that relations between China and the United States sour when the countries do not share a common enemy and when inward-looking, nationalist economic interests are in ascendance in domestic politics. Following the Communist Party's victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, for instance, Americans from Wall Street to Main Street viewed the People's Republic of China as a key part of the widening global communist threat orchestrated from Moscow. This view crystallized during the Korean War, when the two countries faced off on the battlefield, and it hardened in the 1960s, when the U.S.-Chinese strategic rivalry spread across the developing world as part of the Cold War competition for “hearts and minds.”

Domestic political imperatives buttressed those geopolitical considerations and fueled hostility on both sides. In the 1950s and 1960s, globalization and trade liberalization were off the table in both countries, albeit for different reasons. The United States favored managed, not liberalized, trade, focusing almost exclusively on commercial ties with its Western allies. Meanwhile, Washington did everything it could to isolate and punish China economically by imposing a broad trade embargo. In Mao Zedong's China, this hardly mattered. During these years, China had little interest in trading with the outside world. Apart from the Soviet Union, North Korea, and a few other outposts such as Albania, China kept foreign economic ties to a minimum.

For the first two decades of the Cold War, China and the United States were not only bitter strategic rivals; they also served, as political scientist Tom Christensen has noted, as “useful adversaries” for each other domestically. Political leaders in both countries found advantage by pointing to an implacable foe at critical moments of domestic vulnerability. For Mao, this was to shore up power following the calamitous Great Leap Forward and amid the tumult of the Cultural Revolution. And for U.S. presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to Lyndon Johnson, pointing to a hostile China helped sell a foreign policy of deepening engagement in South Vietnam to a public that would not buy it on its own merits. This tactic, however, came at the price of strengthening hard-liners in both countries, which in turn deepened the rift between Beijing and Washington.

By the 1970s, Beijing viewed Moscow as an even greater threat than Washington. The two communist giants had border clashes in 1969, and Beijing's anxiety about facing off against both of the world's superpowers was palpable. Simultaneously, the United States was seeking to extricate itself from a deeply unpopular war in Southeast Asia and recalibrate its Cold War strategy in Asia and beyond. China and the Soviet Union were no longer universally seen in Washington as part of a monolithic communist bloc, and this convergence of strategic interests led to a thaw in U.S.-Chinese relations, beginning with Nixon's visit to China, which was facilitated by the secret diplomacy of his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger.



The visit marked the beginning of a “tacit alliance,” as Kissinger put it at the time, to counterbalance Soviet power. Although formal diplomatic relations were not established until 1979, the 1970s set the stage for a series of strategic initiatives from “Ping-Pong diplomacy” and other charm offensives to increasing trade and technical exchanges to the beginnings of actual defense cooperation that lasted throughout the 1980s. Although strategic cooperation flourished, economic cooperation between China and the United States remained limited during the 1970s. China's economy was still largely autarchic and disconnected from global markets. All industry remained state-owned, and agriculture was still collectivized. Mao's successor, Hua Guofeng, even doubled down on whatever his predecessor had been doing, replacing five-year central plans with a ten-year one.

It wasn't until the 1980s, when domestic coalitions favoring globalization took firmer root in both countries, that security and economic interests on both sides were briefly in sync. In China, the new paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, along with his deputies Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, pursued structural economic reforms, committing China to the twin goals of market reform and integration into the global economy. And in the United States, President Ronald Reagan championed globalization, promoting trade liberalization and open markets. Strategically, meanwhile, China and the United States continued to cooperate against the Soviet Union. The 1980s saw collaboration in arming Afghan resistance fighters (the mujahideen) during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which further strengthened the U.S.-Chinese security relationship. The emergence of pro-globalization coalitions in both countries, combined with a common enemy, created a conducive environment for economic as well as strategic cooperation that would last until the end of the Cold War.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 fundamentally altered the calculus. With the common enemy gone, the strategic rationale for security cooperation all but disappeared even as economic cooperation flourished. In Washington, Beijing's growing economic and military power raised questions about the credibility of the United States' forward presence in Asia, as did China's willingness to push back against perceived encroachments on its interests in the region. The 1995–96 crisis in the Taiwan Strait, when Beijing fired a series of missiles near Taiwan as a warning against movements toward independence, highlighted the issues and raised the stakes. In the face of Chinese assertiveness, the United States demonstrated its military commitment to Taiwan by deploying multiple aircraft carriers to the region.

With only economic interests in alignment, relations between Beijing and Washington were plagued by mixed motives, as leaders navigated conflicting pressures to cooperate and compete. U.S. President Bill Clinton, for instance, devised a rationale for doubling down on economic interests that he thought could one day lead to strategic alignment: using free trade and investment as a means to integrate China into the U.S.-led global order. With Deng's successor Jiang Zemin deepening reformist policies, China seemed willing to play ball. The net result was spectacular growth in U.S.-Chinese trade and the start of negotiations that led to China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. The U.S. and Chinese economies have been deeply intertwined ever since.

Last year, China and the United States traded over $580 billion in goods and services. China is the United States' third-largest trade partner. The United States, meanwhile, is China's largest single export market, not counting regional blocs such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or the EU. Beijing holds over $1 trillion in U.S. treasury securities. But this mutual economic dependence masks deeper centrifugal forces that have been gradually pulling the two countries apart. Domestically, both American and Chinese leaders are facing increasing political pressure to turn inward and away from global markets—and for roughly the same reason: the inequality and dislocation globalization is believed to have caused.

In the United States, economic dislocation precipitated and accelerated by globalization has led to a growing backlash against free trade and international institutions. Signs of trouble were evident as early as the 1990s in the battle over Clinton's North American Free Trade Agreement and the Seattle protests over the WTO. But it was not until the 2008 global financial crash and the Obama administration that domestic concerns about job losses and China's trade practices became hot-button electoral issues. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill increasingly linked the United States' economic troubles to China's emergence as an economic powerhouse. It was a short step from there to the anti-Chinese, “America first” neomercantilist agenda that Trump championed on the campaign trail and then from the Oval Office.

Parallel developments were afoot in China—first under the leadership of Hu Jintao in the first decade of this century and then more dramatically under Xi in the 2010s—as the country pivoted toward a more assertive nationalism and an inwardly focused policy agenda. Xi emphasized “common prosperity” and social equity, the green transition, and eventually, the “China Dream,” which promised rising living standards but also a better overall quality of life, a powerful and confident China, and a more consumer-oriented economy focused on leading-edge technologies. These moves entailed reducing its reliance on foreign technology and investment and increasing domestic demand, fostering domestic innovation, and favoring the state over the market. In the 2010s, amid its fears that the United States was winning the hearts and minds of young Chinese, Beijing increasingly blamed Washington for its economic and social problems.



With each side scapegoating the other and no common enemy to create incentives to cooperate, the political space for alignment over strategic-military matters narrowed. Attempts to find common ground over nontraditional security challenges such as terrorism, climate change, and global health foundered during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. For Washington, fighting a so-called global war on terror was paramount in the first decade of the century, while Beijing was much more focused on developments in East Asia. U.S.-Chinese efforts to cooperate over climate change became entangled in broader disputes over trade, technology, subsidies, and intellectual property.

By 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated confrontational tendencies. In the United States, political leaders lambasted China for its handling of the outbreak, with Trump pejoratively labeling the disease the “China virus.” China rejected these accusations and portrayed its pandemic response as superior, later using “vaccine diplomacy” to compete with the United States and bolster its global image. The pandemic also intensified economic nationalism: both countries moved to secure critical supply chains domestically and then, during Joe Biden's presidency, to restrict access to key materials and leading-edge technologies.

As strategic mistrust deepened during the Biden years, Washington and Beijing came to view the other's actions through a lens of great-power rivalry. Both countries increasingly sought to weaponize aspects of their interdependence (imposing export controls on microchips and rare earths, for instance) and rachet up threats over publicly held debt, state or state-directed investment flows, and more. Economic statecraft could not become the same kind of battleground it was in the 1950s and 1960s, when China and the United States operated in separate trading spheres. Their dependence on each other necessitated a subtler dance, but it also opened additional avenues of competition and angles of leverage that were unthinkable during the Cold War. Although both sides recognize the need to prevent rivalry from spiraling into open conflict, the relationship remains volatile and unstable.

Six months into the new Trump administration, relations have only become more precarious. Trump's over-the-top tariffs on China in April, jacked up to an eye-popping 145 percent, were intended to force Xi to the negotiating table and possibly pave the way for a grand bargain. But the Chinese leader's quick, forceful response—raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125 percent and imposing export restrictions on critical rare-earth minerals and magnets—suggests such blunt, coercive tactics are unlikely to work. Although both sides have since agreed to a temporary trade truce, it was Trump, not Xi, who blinked first. Short of major concessions by Trump on issues critical to Xi's geopolitical ambitions, the latter is extremely unlikely to cave to the former's demands on trade and economic matters. Herein lies the rub. 

Given the state of play, any grand bargain would require the United States to implicitly recognize much of East Asia and Southeast Asia as a de facto Chinese sphere of influence in exchange for similar recognition of a U.S. sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere, the Atlantic, the Pacific Islands, and Oceania. Such a deal, however, would seriously compromise the security of core U.S. allies including Japan and the Philippines and could very well drive Japan and others across Asia to consider drastic options to guarantee their security—including acquiring nuclear weapons. This is a recipe for what international relations scholars call a perilous security dilemma, in which each country's effort to increase its own security threatens the security of other countries, putting in motion a cycle of mistrust and potential conflict. It would also set a dangerous precedent for global alliance politics and nonproliferation norms. The erosion of trust in the United States among its allies would then make future coalition-building efforts more difficult, weakening the United States' strategic posture in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.

An oft-discussed economic angle of a grand bargain, meanwhile, would involve Trump rolling back U.S. tariffs, easing export controls on advanced technology, and allowing Chinese investments in key U.S. sectors in return for Xi agreeing to relax export restrictions on rare earths and curb China's anticompetitive policies—including subsidies and intellectual property theft—that have long disadvantaged American businesses. Such an agreement would offer each side something that key domestic economic sectors want, but it would do little to address the deeper issues whipsawing the two economies—namely, falling living standards, rising prices, and a poor job market. Any agreement that fails to deliver tangible and immediate economic gains is likely only to fuel stronger demands for protectionism, trepidation about globalization, and feelings of xenophobia and distrust.

To better serve U.S. interests, Trump would be wise to recalibrate his dealmaking ambitions to narrower yet strategically significant and winnable objectives. Chief among them should be preventing accidental conflict in the South China Sea through more reliable communication channels, military-to-military dialogues, and confidence-building measures such as prelaunch notification procedures for space launches and processes for dealing in real time with cyberwarfare and hacking. Such initiatives would not only reduce the likelihood of escalation but also reassure allies in Asia of the United States' commitment to regional peace and security. Through incremental agreements, for instance, Trump and Xi could address specific issues such as maritime security and freedom of navigation by agreeing to a code of conduct along with protocols for managing close-in naval encounters. The two leaders could also establish norms against cyber-espionage and state-sponsored commercial cybertheft.



Measured progress on economics, meanwhile, first requires some sort of shared framework to deliver predictability in the regulation and terms of trade: tariffs and other barriers rising and falling every week or month harms both U.S. and Chinese interests. More progress can then be made on aligning standards and practices regarding labor rights and environmental safeguards. China has shown significant willingness to move in such a direction, not least by dramatically tightening emissions standards—improving air quality in all Chinese cities over the past decade—and initiating markedly stronger enforcement, since at least 2010, of labor protections, including health and safety rules, minimum wages, and overtime. If Washington were able to cement a bilateral agreement on, say, baseline labor practices or greenhouse gas protocols, it would help, not harm, American workers and producers because it would blunt some of China's competitive advantages that U.S. labor unions and others have long decried as unfair.

The United States would also benefit greatly from any headway in making China's financial sector more transparent or more open, such as by pushing even noncore sections of state enterprises to disclose more information and allowing freer entry into the Chinese market for U.S. and other international banks, insurers, and financial firms. Some of these reforms were important components of the agreement that brought China into the WTO but have never been properly implemented. If Trump were to pursue even modest progress on them now, it could help provide better information and opportunities to American firms operating within the Chinese market.

By prioritizing these narrow and achievable outcomes, Trump has an opportunity to place the world's most important bilateral relationship on more solid footing. U.S. policy toward China must be based on a clear-eyed assessment of prevailing international and domestic conditions. This means recognizing that in the absence of a common enemy, any grand bargain Washington strikes is likely to be self-defeating, given that the enhanced security Beijing seeks in the region can only come from unilateral U.S. concessions. Meanwhile, the concessions China is apt to offer on trade in return for U.S. concessions on security are unlikely to deliver the relief that antiglobalization constituencies demand. With the political room for negotiation or compromise between China and the United States so narrow, small incremental steps in the right direction trump any promises of a grand bargain.

            The visitors who trek to America's national parks are already noticing the changes, just months after President Donald Trump took office.
    


            “I've been visiting national parks for 30 years and never has the presence of rangers been so absent,” one visitor to Zion National Park wrote in National Parks Service public feedback obtained by CNN.
    


            The visitor said they saw just one trail crew at the iconic Utah park. There were no educational programs offered at any of the five parks they visited on their trip.
    


            “Hire back park staff. We need them,” the visitor wrote.
    


            At Yosemite, another visitor said there were no rangers at the Hetch Hetchy reservoir entrance station, preventing visitors from picking up wilderness permits.
    


            “More staff would be a BIG and IMPORTANT improvement,” that visitor wrote.
    


            America's most treasured national parks are getting crunched by Trump's government-shrinking layoffs just as the summer travel season gets into full swing.
    


            Top officials vowed to hire thousands of seasonal employees to pick up the slack after the Trump administration fired around 1,000 NPS employees as part of wide-ranging federal firings known as the “Valentine's Day Massacre.” Department of Interior officials said in a February memo they would aim to hire 7,700 seasonal workers at NPS, and post listings for 9,000 jobs.
    


            But those numbers haven't materialized ahead July 4th — the parks' busiest time of the year. Internal National Park Service data provided to CNN by the National Parks Conservation Association shows that about 4,500 seasonal and temporary staff have been hired.
    


            Full-time staff numbers are down, too; as of June, the parks service had 12,600 full-time employees, which is 24% fewer staff than they had at the beginning of the year.
    


            That's the lowest staffing level in over 20 years, according to Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.
    


            Some parks, including Yellowstone, have increased their staff this year. But with low staffing levels at other parks unlikely to meaningfully improve this year, Kym Hall, a former NPS regional director and park superintendent, told CNN she worries park rangers and other staff could hit a breaking point later this summer.
    


            “By mid-August, you're going to have staff that is so burned out,” Hall said. “Somebody is going to make a mistake, somebody is going to get hurt. Or you're going to see visitors engaging with wildlife in a way that they shouldn't, because there aren't enough people out in the parks to say, ‘do not get that close to a grizzly bear that's on the side of the road; that's a terrible idea.'”
    


            The National Parks Service did not respond to CNN's request for comment on its staffing levels.
    


            Meanwhile, visitors are arriving in droves. Last year set a new record for recreation visits at nearly 332 million, smashing the previous record set in 2016.
    


            Hall said the process of hiring thousands of seasonal workers for the summer takes months, typically starting in the previous fall or winter to fully staff up.
    


            “Even if the parks had permission, and even if they had some funding, it takes months and months to get a crew of seasonal (workers) recruited, vetted, hired, boarded into their duty stations, trained and ready to serve the public by Memorial Day,” Hall said.
    


            Compounding the staffing issue is the fact that many park superintendents, some of whom oversee the most iconic parks like Yosemite, have retired or taken the Trump administration's deferred resignation offers. That leaves over 100 parks without their chief supervisor, Brengel said.
    


            And amid the staff losses, staffers normally assigned to park programming, construction, and trail maintenance, as well as a cadre of park scientists, have been reassigned to visitor services to keep up with the summer season.
    


            Questioned by both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill about the low staffing numbers, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has brushed off concerns, testifying in May that slightly less than half of permanent NPS employees work on the ground in the parks, while other staff work at regional offices or at DC headquarters.
    


            “I want more people in the parks,” Burgum said. “I want less overhead. There's an opportunity to have more people working in our parks … and have less people working for the National Park Service.”
    


            But internal NPS data tells a different story, Brengel said, showing that around 80% of National Park Service staff work in the parks. And regional offices play an important supporting staff role, with scientists on staff to help maintain fragile parks ecosystems, as well as specialists who monitor geohazard safety issues like landslides.
    


            Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska recently pressed Burgum to provide a full list of staff positions that have been cut at the National Parks Service, Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service since the Trump administration took over. The Interior Department has not provided the list, a Senate staffer said.
    


            The regional offices within the Parks Service are on edge, waiting to see how courts rule on a Trump administration reduction in force plan they fear could gut their ranks, a National Park Service employee in a Western state told CNN.
    


            “If they greenlight the RIF plan, then it's going to be a bloodbath,” the employee said.
    


            In addition to probationary workers that were fired in February, early retirements are also culling the agency's ranks, and the continued $1 spending limit on federal workers' credit cards is making it extremely difficult to do field work in the parks, with a simple overnight trip needing to be requested 10 days in advance, the employee added.
    


            The lack of superintendents and NPS supervisors creates more of a headache, they added.
    


            “These times, when it's all about fighting for scarce resources, you really need those upper-level people with clout working the system,” the employee said.
    


            Hall, the retired NPS regional director, said losing rangers, maintenance professionals and park superintendents could profoundly alter American landmarks.
    


            “What you've lost with all this attrition – you've lost all this knowledge that's going to take years to build back up,” Hall said.

Follow:


            The visages of presidents past were looking down upon Donald Trump as he made a fiery speech excoriating his political foes for waging what he called a “merciless campaign” against the traditional values, heroes, and culture that underpin American greatness.
    


            It was 2020, and there, in the shadow of Mount Rushmore, the then-45th president vowed to commission a monument “to the giants of our past” that would “feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live.”
    


            From there, the concept of the “National Garden of American Heroes” was born – a sculpture park of 250 life-size artworks that would pay homage to the likes of Kobe Bryant, Amelia Earhart, Abraham Lincoln, Muhammad Ali, Christopher Columbus, and Sally Ride, among others, and would stand as new monuments in the American landscape.
    


            Two election cycles, one ballot-box defeat, and a rescinded – and then reinstituted – executive order later, artists are finally sketching 3D models, various localities are vying to be the site for the sculpture garden, and Congress is looking at setting aside millions of taxpayer dollars for the project.
    


            In his second term, Trump is pushing forward on plans for his great American sculpture garden.
    


            But the project – a personal endeavor of the president's now five years in the making– is facing an uncertain future amid serious questions about the timeline, cost, location, and reception within the art community, threatening to sacrifice the quality and delivery of the project meant to debut at the nation's big 250th anniversary celebration in July of 2026.
    


            “No one wants an outdoor Madame Tussauds museum and it appears that the administration is taking the right steps to make sure that we get beautiful, inspiring works of art,” Justin Shubow, president of the National Civic Art Society, tells CNN.
    


            Mount Rushmore took over a decade to complete, and was not without controversy, but stands now as a hugely recognizable American monument. Can Trump's Garden of Heroes equal its renown?
    


            To be sure, the requirements for the project are serious and ambitious.
    


            In April, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), a federal agency that acts as the nation's largest funder of public humanities projects, began soliciting artist proposals for the garden.
    


            According to its solicitation announcement, proposals had to be sculptures in the classical style, lifelike, and created from marble, granite, bronze, copper or brass. Statues should be 1.2 times the historical height of the individual, so standing figures should be between 6.5 feet and 8.5 feet tall.
    


            Artists had until July 1st to submit their applications, which was to include two-dimensional or three-dimensional graphic representation of the preliminary concepts for up to three statues they would like to create, as well as the historical and scholarly sources that informed their design.
    


            The NEH estimated it would take artists 60 hours to complete just these  requirements.
    


            Artists were also asked to disclose any outstanding debts, including student loans, taxes and child support payments they currently have. If chosen, they would need to provide evidence that they have entered into a repayment agreement, the NEH said.
    


            Artists are required to be US citizens.
    


            The winning designs and artists are to be announced by September, though it is unclear how the artists will be chosen – the NEH did not get back to CNN's questions about the process for review and selection, nor to confirm if there is a selection committee.
    


            “They are thumbing their nose at both standard processes and historical expertise,” said James Grossman, executive director emeritus of the American Historical Association, describing the process as abnormal, apparently without a clearly communicated plan and time for peer review.
    


            Those commissioned have until June 2026 – just nine months to complete and deliver their work – on a budget of $200,000 per statue to cover the cost of materials, design, and transportation.
    


            The timeline and the budget – very modest for artworks of this size and ambition – may have been enough to put off some serious artists.
    


            It can take 10 years for a project like this to be done right, said Melissa Walker of Carolina Bronze Sculpture, a foundry. “People that are really serious about their art are just looking at this and saying that they don't really want any part of it.”
    


            “There's so many variables that go into a project like this, and it just doesn't seem like anybody has thought it – it's just not a well thought-out plan,” she said, adding: “If you just wanna have somebody sculpt these digitally and 3D print them and send them to China and have them done on the cheap, yeah, you might be able to get it done in in less than a year.”
    


            Paula Slater, a sculptor who has worked for 30 years in the industry, said that, on the other hand, it could spur lesser-known artists to apply.
    


            “There aren't 90 good portrait sculptors out there that have a body of work; I don't know where they're going to be getting all these sculptors,” she said.
    


            Slater herself decided to submit to the project, applying for three figures: Native American prima ballerina Maria Tallchief, author Herman Melville and actress Ingrid Bergman, who Slater has proposed to sculpt as Joan of Arc from her iconic movie role.
    


            Normally, each sculpture would take over a year individually, she said. In anticipation of possibly being chosen, she's already contacted sculptor friends who could help her in some of the preliminary work before she does the finishing work.
    


            Slater is not a supporter of the president or the quick timeline but said she is not going to let that stop her from participating in what could become an important piece of history.
    


            “I'm doing this in spite of the president being involved,” she said.
    


            That the project is Trump's vision has, perhaps unsurprisingly, given it controversy from the beginning.
    


            Plans for the sculpture garden have had many fits and starts. From the moment Trump signed the executive order for its creation, eyebrows were raised over the list of names included – a grab-bag of historical and contemporary figures that run the gamut from Billie Holiday and Susan B. Anthony to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barry Goldwater, Billy Graham, Shirley Temple and Alex Trebek, among others.
    


            “I don't really take it all that seriously,” Ken Lum, a sculptor and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said. “It has a kind of carnival quality to it.”
    


            Lum took issue with the Americans chosen to be immortalized in the statue, a list that has drawn controversy in the past.
    


            “There's a high degree of arbitrariness to it, which tells me that it's not all that serious,” he said.
    


            Then, there is the politics. Trump's original order was revoked when he was voted out and President Joe Biden took office. It was reinstituted again when Trump returned to the White House in January, and this time, he vowed to fund the project with a $40 million allocation from the Department of the Interior for land and construction.
    


            This week, that provision was included in the “big, beautiful bill” approved by the Republican-led Senate, and is likely to come to fruition when the legislation is reconciled through the House.
    


            This comes as the president has called for unprecedented gutting of federal support for arts and humanities, pulling money from NEH grants, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS), and redirecting federal funding towards cultural initiatives he backs – like the National Garden of Heroes.
    


            Aside from the $40 million in the budget bill, the NEH and NEA have jointly set aside $34 million to fund the art commissions.
    


            “Donald Trump has a track record of vanity projects and there is a real concern that the resources that were stripped from NEH, ILMS and similar are being put toward his self-serving purposes,” a former NEH official, who has served in multiple administrations,   told CNN.
    


            Beyond the timeline and the politics, the practicalities can weigh on artists.
    


            Sculpting lasting art of the size and scope being commissioned is expensive business.
    


            “The artist would have to go basically $100,000 into debt before they even get paid by the federal government,” said Micah Springut, CEO and Founder of Monumental Labs in New York, which produces marble sculptures.
    


            According to Springut, it costs as much as $25,000 to buy the quantity of marble needed for life-size sculptures, and shipping and installation could be some $20,000. There are enormous labor and facilities costs.
    


            “You have to have a huge risk tolerance or you have to be wealthy or ignorant or idealistic to even get into this,” he said.
    


            Bronze is slightly cheaper, but foundry space for bronze works can fill up a year in advance, experts say, making it hard for artists to get on the books.
    


            Moreover, detailed planning is required to properly devise sculptural designs. “You can't just plop sculpture down in the middle of a field. You have to have engineering done for the type of land that is going to be sitting on and the climate is going to be in,” said Walker, the project manager at Carolina Bronze Sculpture.
    


            How will people interact with the statues? Will children be dangling off arms or climbing onto pedestals? Artists need this kind of information at the start to fully realize their work, she said.
    


            Yet a chance to be a part of history can be enough of an enticement.
    


            “I see this as an opportunity to give back to our country to have an opportunity to have some great artwork in place by some of the greatest artists in America,” said Matt Glenn, an artist in Provo, Utah who specializes in bronze statues. “Presidents will come and go. History has been written and for us to be able to be a part of that and preserve that history and have that for generations to come.”
    


            Glenn has applied to sculpt Whitney Houston, Steve Jobs, and Chief Red Cloud, with a full war bonnet in his traditional clothing.
    


            He plans to carve the music star singing with her arms up to capture the essence of her motion, while the Apple founder is in a more stoic pose in his signature turtleneck. He and his team of ten artists are prepared to clear their plates and “put in the long days to make sure everything is done” should they be chosen, Glenn said.
    


            Artist John Belardo, based in New York, has applied to create two sculptures: architect Cass Gilbert, who designed the Woolworth Building, and Herman Melville, which he intends to carve from white marble to connect to the idea of Moby Dick as the white whale.
    


            “In 20, 50 years nobody will even remember that it was Trump who did it and it's beyond beside the point,” Belardo said. “It's more than just your lifetime; it's kind of this bigger idea – it could be there for thousands of years.”
    


            If he is chosen, Belardo plans to make his sculptures at Monumental Labs, the New York foundry run by Springut, who has said he will front up to $100,000 to help artists who are selected with start-up costs that can be paid back when they get their government checks.
    


            The foundry uses robotic fabrication in its workshop to cut the stone to scale, reducing the time it takes to complete a sculpture.
    


            “We have seven robots, we have 20 carvers who could work on this,” Springut said. “We could do the whole thing in a few years. On that shortened timeframe, we're just lucky to get a couple dozen out.”
    


            Amid a deluge of concerns, CNN has learned that Trump's plans are now being reworked.
    


            A source with knowledge of the project tells CNN that the Trump administration is now coming to terms that they will not be able to achieve their goal for all 250 statutes to be completed in a year. The new, informal goal is to try to get 25 to 50 statues completed by July 2026 so that the garden can open on time, with a smaller collection of statues that would serve as an early teaser of what the garden could become.
    


            The intention would be to add the rest of the statues in subsequent years as they are completed.
    


            This recalibration of Trump's original goal is a tacit admission by the administration, this source says, that the project was risking being a collection of rushed, mediocre art.
    


            The statues, whenever they are made, will likely end up in South Dakota, very near the spot where Trump stood to announce his vision in the first place.
    


            South Dakota has been pushing hard to bring the sculpture garden to their state.
    


            Governor Larry Rhoden and members of Congress have been on calls with the White House monthly, sources tell CNN, to lobby for the project to be brought to the Black Hills, in the shadow of Mount Rushmore.
    


            The governor has already identified the land for the proposed site – a 40-acre area of land in sight of Mount Rushmore. The Chuck Lien family, a four-generation South Dakota family, has offered to donate their strip of land.
    


            The mockups of the proposal, provided to CNN, show seven distinct areas of the garden, with seven groupings for the statues: “The Presidents,” “The Founders,” “The Brave,” “The Servants,” “The Visionaries,” “The Storytellers,” and “The Reformers” among landscapes of water, greenery and small footpath bridges.
    


            There is confidence in the inner circles of South Dakota government that Trump understands that vision and they are hopeful for a decision soon. Philadelphia and the National Mall are also being considered, but neither seems to have as detailed plans for the garden as South Dakota.
    


            Comparable mock-ups could not be found for other cities mentioned as possible sites. The National Park Service, the mayor's office in DC and the governor's office in Pennsylvania did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            “I'm incredibly optimistic that this is the right place for the Garden of Heroes and every conversation I have with the administration they let me know that they understand the benefits of this location,” Congressman Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told CNN. “The White House has a bias for action they understand the importance of making material progress before we get to America's 250th birthday.”
    


            “The Black Hills mark the perfect location to achieve your vision for the National Garden of American Heroes,” Governor Rhoden said in a letter to President Trump in March. “Together, we will make this project happen in a way that honors America's heroes, takes advantage of South Dakota's natural beauty, and incorporates the most iconic monument to our greatest leaders: Mount Rushmore National Memorial.”

Follow:


            A deferral on abortion. A major shift in turnout strategy. A reversal on early voting.
    


            President Donald Trump and his team made a series of political calculations steeped in cynicism months before the November 2024 election, according to a new book from a trio of reporters who chronicled the election – which ultimately laid the groundwork for his victory. It depicts a candidate more focused on winning than steadfast beliefs.
    


            CNN has exclusively obtained a passage from Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf's “2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America.” The chapter lays out how the then-candidate shifted his perspective on targeting male voters, dismissed pressure to back a nationwide abortion ban and was convinced to support early voting efforts – sharp pivots from his positions in 2020.
    


            The book details how Trump sorted through what the authors describe as “conflicting advice” on handling the issue of abortion. He was struggling to determine his campaign stance on an issue that was at the forefront of politics – thanks in part to decisions he made in his first term – for which “his own position had long been a moving target.”
    


            Trump was acutely aware of the political implications of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the authors report, telling his co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita: “Oh sh*t. This is going to be a problem,” when the June 2022 news alert came. And when Democrats made gains in the 2022 midterm elections, Trump reportedly told an anti-abortion activist, “I have to find a way out of this issue. It's killing us.”
    


            Trump fielded perspectives from a wide range of advisers – GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, evangelical leader Ralph Reed, and his 2016 campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, among others – as he weighed a position on a national ban on abortion after a certain number of weeks.
    


            Trump's team compiled a presentation, delivered by co-campaign manager Susie Wiles in March 2024, titled: “How a national abortion policy will cost Trump the election.” It showed the more moderate abortion policies in the so-called Blue Wall states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin – and argued, the book says, that “if Trump supported a national ban, he would be campaigning on a stricter rule than was currently in effect in the Midwest battlegrounds.”
    


            “Only electoral math matters,” said the presentation – obtained by the authors and reviewed by CNN. “Bottom line: Declaring any number of weeks would play directly into Joe Biden's hands on his simplest path to electoral victory.”
    


            Trump repeatedly waffled on abortion during the campaign, but ultimately he said in a recorded video that he was committed to leaving restrictions to the states and would veto a federal ban – a stance that proved popular with moderate voters.
    


            Trump's third and final pursuit of the presidency offered a dramatic departure in the way his team deployed its resources across the country, as well as the targets of those resources. Aides James Blair and Tim Saler dove into Trump campaign voter data from 2016 and 2020, Dawsey, Pager, and Arnsdorf write, and “made a startling discovery.”
    


            “The conventional wisdom was that Trump lost in 2020 because of his erosion among women, particularly suburbanites horrified by his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and tired of his taunts and insults. But Saler and Blair concluded Trump's problem in 2020 was that he slipped among men,” they write.
    


            Blair and Saler presented a memo to senior staff detailing the campaign's 2020 slippage with White men compared to 2016 – a copy of that memo obtained by the authors and reviewed by CNN said that marked “the single most significant factor” in Trump's 2020 loss (the memo described it as a “reported raw vote shortage” rather than a loss).
    


            The team proposed a shift away from targeting swing voters and toward motivating low-propensity voters who would vote for Trump if they showed up at the ballot box. That included rural White men, as well as young, male, and non-White men who “tended not follow politics closely or receive their news from traditional media,” Dawsey, Pager, and Arnsdorf write.
    


            That became the basis for Trump's untraditional strategy to target irregular voters. CNN reported one month before the election that the campaign internally acknowledged it was a gamble, but one that they insisted was built on data they collected over nearly a decade and tested in the months prior.
    


            And that strategy, which relied on grassroots networking and appearances by the candidate on male-oriented podcasts like “The Joe Rogan Experience” and “This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von” propelled Trump to a more diverse coalition – and an advantage with voters who didn't turn out in 2020.
    


            The most significant Trump turnabout between 2020 and 2024 came on the issue of early voting.
    


            Trump had falsely alleged massive fraud in the 2020 election due to mail-in ballots, which he cast as “dangerous” and “corrupt.” His campaign at the time filed lawsuits to stop changes made by states to make it easier to vote by mail. Altogether, the steps fomented mistrust among Republican constituents, inadvertently encouraging them not to vote before Election Day.
    


            The authors write that Trump was pushed by numerous advisers to get the president to stop disparaging early voting – from Sean Hannity to Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard to Conway. But, they write, the first person to break through on the issue was Rob Gleason, the former Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman.
    


            “Trump started going on again about how much he didn't like early and mail-in voting, and Gleason asked him to think of it this way: when a Trump supporter gets a mail ballot, he argued, they were so excited to vote for him they wanted to do so right away. Why wouldn't he want them to have that chance to show their enthusiasm for him?” the book says.
    


            Trump was urged by Wiles and others to use the “Too Big to Rig” tagline, actively promoting early and mail-in voting.
    


            At the same time, Trump allies were not copacetic with those who said former President Joe Biden's 2020 victory was legitimate. After Ronna McDaniel left her position as chair of the Republican National Committee, LaCivita was installed to run the party's day-to-day operations and oversaw a hiring purge as Trump aides asked RNC staffers if they believed the 2020 election was stolen, the reporters write.
    


            That was only paused, the book says, when an RNC official warned LaCivita that he “would trigger a mass layoff notice under DC labor laws.” Wiles later stepped in to remediate the dysfunction.
    


            “Wiles posted up at the RNC, taking phone calls and complaining about the mess she now had to fix. Some of the fired staff would be re-hired. LaCivita fired one staffer, John Seravalli, thinking he was someone else. He agreed to hire him back and gave him a raise. He renegotiated a consulting fee for Boris Epshteyn, thinking he had achieved a reduction, but it was actually an increase,” the book says.

Liverpool and Portugal star Diogo Jota has died in a car crash in Spain with his younger brother, prompting an outpouring of grief from fans, former teammates and the wider soccer community. He was 28.
    


            The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) confirmed the news on Thursday morning.
    


            Jota, who won the Premier League title with the Reds last season and played for Portugal's national team, got married to Rute Cardoso just two weeks ago. The couple have three children together.
    


            The crash occurred in Cernadilla, Zamora, in northwestern Spain. Jota's brother, André Silva, was also killed, according to the FPF. Silva, 25, played for Penafiel in the second tier of Portuguese soccer.
    


            Spain's Guardia Civil said in a statement that their investigation “points to a road accident due to a burst tire while overtaking,” which occurred at 00:30 a.m. local time.
    


            The police force added that the car, which Spanish media said was a Lamborghini, subsequently caught fire.
    


            “The Portuguese Football Federation and all the Portuguese football are completely devastated by the death of Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva this morning in Spain,” the federation said in a statement.
    


            “Much more than a fantastic player with nearly 50 caps for the national team, Diogo Joto was an extraordinary person, respected by colleagues and adversaries, someone with a contagious joy and a reference in his own community.”
    


            Jota earned 49 caps for the Portuguese national team, winning the UEFA Nations League in 2019 and 2025.
    


            Jota played an important role in Liverpool's recent title-winning season, scoring six goals and providing four assists in 26 appearances.
    


            He began his career at Portuguese club Paços de Ferreira before moving to Atlético Madrid in Spain. While at Atlético, Jota was loaned to Porto and then Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he helped guide the English club from the Championship into the Premier League.
    


            Jota's performances for Wolves earned him a move to Liverpool in 2020 and he went on to win the FA Cup and League Cup, in addition to the Premier League, while at the club.

            “Liverpool Football Club are devastated by the tragic passing of Diogo Jota,” the team said in a statement.
    


            “Liverpool FC will be making no further comment at this time and request the privacy of Diogo and Andre's family, friends, teammates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss.”
    


            Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, who played with Jota in the recent Nations League triumph, paid tribute to his former teammate in a post on X.
    


            “It does not make sense,” the soccer superstar wrote. “We were only just together in the national team, you had only just got married.
    


            “I send my condolences and all the strength in the world to your family, to your wife and to your children. I know that you will always be with them. Rest in peace, Diogo and André. We will all miss you.”
    


            Liverpool forward Darwin Núñez was one of the first of Jota's former teammates at Anfield to pay tribute to the Portugal striker and his brother.
    


            “There are no words of comfort for so much pain,” the Uruguayan wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of himself and Jota celebrating a goal together. “I will always remember you by your smile, as a good teammate on and off the pitch.
    


            “I send all my strength to his family, wherever he is I am sure he will always be with you, especially to his wife and three children. RIP Diogo and André.”
    


            Steven Gerrard, widely recognized as one of the best players ever to play for Liverpool, also offered a message of support on Instagram.
    


            “RIP Diogo,” he wrote alongside a broken heart emoji. “Condolences to his family and friends during this incredibly sad time.”

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — From suspended tables to underwater lounges, some 13,000 food and drink establishments in Dubai pull out all the stops to attract customers in one of the world's most saturated dining markets. 

They cater to all tastes and budgets. Some spots ladle out inexpensive biryani while others offer dishes dusted with edible gold. 

These are some of the ways the emirate is competing with its neighbors Saudi Arabia and Qatar for tourist dollars and, so far, it's beating them handily. Dubai has more restaurants per capita than any major city except Paris. 

But the city-state's booming restaurant scene is testing the limits of its growth-at-all-costs model, raising questions about how long Dubai can keep feeding its own ambitions. 

The competition is cutthroat, so presentation is key. 

“Gone are the days when it just tastes good,” said Kym Barter, the general manager of Atlantis The Palm, a resort perched on a manmade archipelago that boasts more Michelin stars than any other venue in the Middle East. 

But dazzling Dubai's food bloggers — the most popular of whom have millions of social media followers — isn't enough. Staying afloat means battling high rents and winning over a diverse and demanding group of consumers. 

Dubai has roughly nine expatriate residents for every Emirati citizen. Most of its private sector workers are migrants on temporary contracts, and only Vatican City has a higher share of foreign-born residents. 




Tourists, in turn, outnumber locals about five to one by some estimates, and they spend lavishly. Visitors to Dubai drop an average of over five times more than those traveling to nearby Saudi Arabia or even the U.S., according to global restaurant consultant Aaron Allen. 

Dubai is “on the right path” to becoming the world's food capital, said Torsten Vildgaard, executive chef at FZN by Björn Frantzén. The restaurant, which runs at more than $540 a head, was one of two in Dubai to nab three Michelin stars in May. 

“We're only seeing the tip of the iceberg of what's to come in terms of gastronomy here,” Vildgaard added. 

With each new set of illuminated high-rises and hotels, another crop of eateries emerge, vying for patrons. The legions of construction workers powering Dubai's progress also need affordable options. 

That growth, propped up in part by investor pressure on some of the world's biggest chains to expand in Dubai, has created what some analysts warn is a bubble. 

“If you're a publicly traded company like Americana, what are you supposed to do — just stop opening restaurants?” restaurant consultant Allen said, referring to the Gulf-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and other big franchises.

The frenetic expansion of Dubai's restaurant industry is part of a regional shift that has seen Gulf Arab states pour hundreds of billions of dollars into building out tourist destinations as they move away from hydrocarbons to diversify their economies. Saudi Arabia has a high-stakes, $500 billion project: a straight-line futuristic city called Neom. 

But, in a Muslim-majority region, the United Arab Emirates has gone to lengths that some consider too much of a compromise, including relaxing restrictions on alcohol that fuel its pubs and nightlife and other social reforms.

The rapid development comes at a price. Dubai's restaurants have a high failure rate, industry veterans say, though local authorities don't say what the rate of closures is. In the downtown district and other prime areas, annual rents for restaurants can top $100 per square foot. That's on a par with some of the world's most expensive cities. 

Still, the emirate issued almost 1,200 new restaurant licenses last year, according to Dubai's Department of Economy and Tourism. The department declined to respond to questions. 

Empty tables during peak hours are common, even in top locations. Part of the problem, managers say, is that traffic congestion is so severe that convincing diners to drive out can be a tall task.

“I sometimes go, ‘Do I go into the restaurant right now, because I'm going to get into traffic?''' said Waseem Abdul Hameed, operations manager at Ravi, a Pakistani family-owned eatery famous for its official Adidas shoe line and a 2010 TV feature from Anthony Bourdain. 

He knows restaurateurs who have had to shut up shop and others who are squeezed by slim margins and increasingly reliant on delivery apps, Hameed said. 

The demand sends fleets of migrant workers racing through gridlock on motorbikes, with few protections and tight delivery windows. Emirati newspaper Khaleej Times reported the accidental deaths of 17 Dubai food couriers last year. 

The math of Dubai's restaurant scene doesn't add up, delivery apps and wealthy tourists notwithstanding, restaurant consultant Allen said. He cited operating expenses that have more than doubled relative to sales since 2009, when a financial crisis almost hobbled the emirate.

Too many Dubai entrepreneurs, he put it simply, have “too much money, and they don't know what to do besides open restaurants.”

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — For Rida Abu Hadayed, summer adds a new layer of misery to a daily struggle to survive in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.

With temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), daybreak begins with the cries of Hadayed's seven children sweltering inside the displaced family's cramped nylon tent. Outside, the humidity is unbearable.

The only way the 32-year-old mother can offer her children relief is by fanning them with a tray or bits of paper — whatever she can find. If she has water, she pours it over them, but that is an increasingly scarce resource.

“There is no electricity. There is nothing,” she said, her face beaded with sweat. “They cannot sleep. They keep crying all day until the sun sets.”

The heat in Gaza has intensified hardships for its 2 million residents. Reduced water availability, crippled sanitation networks, and shrinking living spaces threaten to cause illnesses to cascade through communities, aid groups have long warned.

The scorching summer coincides with a lack of clean water for the majority of Gaza's population, most of whom are displaced in tented communities. Many Palestinians in the enclave must walk long distances to fetch water and ration each drop, limiting their ability to wash and keep cool.

“We are only at the beginning of summer,“ Hadayed's husband, Yousef, said. “And our situation is dire.”




Israel had blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for nearly three months. It began allowing limited aid in May, but fuel needed to pump water from wells or operate desalination plants is still not getting into the territory.

With fuel supplies short, only 40% of drinking water production facilities are functioning in the Gaza Strip, according to a recent report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. All face imminent collapse. Up to 93% of households face water shortages, the June report said.

The Hadayeds were displaced after evacuation orders forced them to leave eastern Khan Younis. 

“Our lives in the tent are miserable. We spend our days pouring water over their heads and their skin,” Yousef Hadayed said. “Water itself is scarce. It is very difficult to get that water.”

UNICEF's spokesperson recently said that if fuel supplies are not allowed to enter the enclave, children will die of thirst.

“Me and my children spend our days sweating,” said Reham Abu Hadayed, a 30-year-old relative of Rida Abu Hadayed who was also displaced from eastern Khan Younis. She worries about the health of her four children.

“I don't have enough money to buy them medicine,” she said. 

For Mohammed al-Awini, 23, the heat is not the worst part. It's the flies and mosquitoes that bombard his tent, especially at night. 

Without adequate sewage networks, garbage piles up on streets, attracting insects and illness. The stench of decomposing trash wafts in the air. 

“We are awake all night, dying from mosquito bites,” he said. “We are the most tired people in the world.”

Bobby Laurie joins ‘Fox & Friends First' to discuss how staff shortages will impact summer travel as Gen Z spurs a new destination trend. 

Most travelers hope for speedy security lines and simple layouts at airport — but some of America's travel hubs apparently soar above the rest.

A recent survey of over 2,300 people identified one airport in the Pacific Northwest as the best in the country — thanks in part to its decor plus its food and drink offerings. Therapy llamas are even available on occasion to help ease pre-flight jitters for those in need.

The analysis, done by The Washington Post, solicited responses from readers and looked at more than 450,000 Yelp reviews. Researchers collected data on gate capacity, parking and more for over 450 public airports and narrowed the list down to the top 50.

""The best airport is the one that fills your needs and gets you to your final destination with minimal interruptions,"" Sheldon Jacobson, an engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told Fox News Digital — noting that the country's most trafficked airports did not make the list. (He was not affiliated with the new survey.)

Counting down from 10 to 1, here are the airports that stood apart from the rest, according to the survey.

Michigan's DTW landed at No. 10 on the best U.S. airports list, with flyers marveling over its underground LED tunnel that shuttles them through concourses.

Another attraction is a 39-foot-wide fountain in DTW's McNamara Terminal, which shoots water in a pattern inspired by a flight map. 

Utah's SLC came in at No. 9. The facility was recently rebuilt – a factor many people appreciated.

Participants noted the airport's spacious design, natural light and mountain views.

The walk to DCA's gates is short, and it offers some of the best airport views in the country, including of landmarks like the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial — placing it at No. 3 on the list. 

Long Beach Airport in Los Angeles, California placed second on the list of the country's best airports. 

AIRPORT'S STRICT ‘QUIET POLICY' HAS FLIGHT PASSENGERS SOUNDING OFF

GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia discussed a measure she plans to introduce that will require a new census that only counts U.S. citizens and require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., plans to introduce a bill that would require a new census that only counts U.S. citizens, the results of which would be utilized in determining how many House seats each state is allotted. 

The upcoming measure, which is still being drafted, would also require proof of American citizenship to vote in federal elections, the lawmaker told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

Greene says she has spoken to President Donald Trump about her proposal and that he supports it. 

When the president was asked about the proposal this week, he said that he loved it.

The congresswoman called the issue a ""matter of national security,"" asserting that Democrats ""would love non-citizens to have the right to vote,"" would ""love amnesty for all,"" and would essentially allow for a ""world takeover"" of the country.

Currently, the U.S. Census Bureau notes that unauthorized immigrants are included in decennial census population counts used in determining how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives.

""Apportionment is the process of dividing the 435 memberships, or seats, in the U.S. House of Representatives among the 50 states based on the apportionment population counts from the decennial census,"" census.gov notes.

The 14th Amendment to the Constitution reads, in part, ""Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.""

Counting only citizens in the census would likely reshape the nation's political landscape, with some states getting fewer House seats than they currently have, and other states getting more seats.

That would impact presidential elections, because each state's number of Electoral College votes is determined by the total number of seats it holds in both chambers of Congress.

Michele Tafoya appears on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich"" to talk the latest controversy surrounding WNBA players and Caitlin Clark.

The Indiana Fever, fresh off the Commissioner's Cup final victory, will be again without guard Caitlin Clark for Thursday night's matchup against the Las Vegas Aces, as she remains sidelined for the fourth straight game with a lingering groin injury. 

The update comes just weeks before Clark is due to serve as a captain in the WNBA All-Star game.

Speaking to the media on Wednesday, just a day after the Fever defeated the Minnesota Lynx to win the league's in-season tournament, head coach Stephanie White spoke about Clark's extended absence and the precautions the team is taking with her long-term health in mind.

""I don't have anything in my head other than what I'm told. My goal has always been the same, I don't want this to be something that lingers – that we come back too soon,"" White said. ""We want to make sure that she is 100% ready to go and that we put her long-term health and wellness at the forefront.""

White added that with just a handful of games left before the league heads into the All-Star break, the timing of Clark's absence worked out well. She noted that Clark herself is eager to return.

""She wants to play, and she's working to play, and she has been working to play. I think after a few days, it's like, ‘Okay, we've got a little bit of time,' thinking – what, five games before All-Star break? We've got a little bit of time, so let's just ease her mind, even though she's ansty, and let's do this the right way and make sure that we're ready to go and 100% when she comes back."" 

CAITLIN CLARK SAYS WNBA IS 'SICK' OVER FEVER'S COMMISSIONER'S CUP TITLE

Clark never missed a game during her college career at Iowa or during her first season in the WNBA when she earned the Rookie of the Year award. However, her sophomore season has been plagued with missed games. 

Four games into the 2025 season, Clark was sidelined for five games with a quad injury. She returned and played in five games where she seemingly fell into a shooting slump before missing another stretch of time with her current injury.

Clark is averaging 18.2 points, 5.0 rebounds and 8.9 assists this season. The All-Star game will be hosted by Indiana on July 19.

Former FBI counterterrorism expert Brig Barker told Fox News Digital the military can bring unique skills and capabilities to border enforcement.

In a dramatic escalation of military involvement in immigration enforcement, the U.S. Air Force and Navy are taking over vast new swathes of federal land along the southern border, under a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

One 250-mile stretch, located in Texas' Cameron and Hidalgo counties, is being transferred to Air Force control and will fall under the jurisdiction of Joint Base San Antonio and be managed as part of a newly established National Defense Area (NDA).

The land is being transferred from the International Boundary and Water Commission, an agency traditionally responsible for handling water and boundary disputes between the U.S. and Mexico, marking a significant shift in the use and oversight of federal land at the border.

Another 140-mile stretch of land along the border near Yuma, Arizona, will be transferred to Navy jurisdiction.

These mark the third NDAs created under the Trump administration, following similar moves in New Mexico and near El Paso, Texas. The areas are designated as military zones to bolster border security operations amid a surge in illegal crossings under the Biden administration. 

Presidents since Richard Nixon have deployed active-duty troops and reservists to the border. But until Trump, they've largely been restricted to logistical support: surveillance, building roads, etc. U.S. troops stationed in the NDAs will now be authorized to apprehend, search and detain migrants until Customs and Border Protection agents arrive. Migrants entering these zones may also face trespassing charges for entering military property.

PENTAGON SETS UP NEW 250 MILE MILITARY BUFFER ZONE AT BORDER WITH CROSSINGS AT RECORD LOWS

The move is part of a broader mission managed by the Joint Task Force – Southern Border (JTF-SB), a joint effort between the Air Force and U.S. Northern Command to consolidate and strengthen military presence along the border.

To support these efforts, the military has deployed Stryker vehicles, ground-based radar systems, and even begun 3D-printing drones to enhance surveillance capacity and reduce costs.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the coordinated efforts between DoD and Customs and Border Patrol led to zero ""gotaways,"" or migrants that escape authorities, across the entire southern border from June 28-30.

Civil liberties groups have sounded the alarm, warning the policy blurs the lines between military and law enforcement roles and may violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of federal troops in domestic policing without congressional approval.

""Using the military purpose doctrine to justify direct military involvement in immigration enforcement is a transparent ruse to evade the Posse Comitatus Act,"" the Brennan Center for Justice said in a statement. ""The nominal justification is protecting the installation, but the installation itself was created to apprehend and detain migrants.""

Critics also warn the policy could set a dangerous precedent. ""If soldiers are allowed to take on domestic policing roles at the border, it may become easier to justify military deployments within the U.S. interior,"" the Center added.

Andy Gould, former Arizona supreme court justice, said he thought the move was ""extremely effective against the cartels and completely legal.""

""He's created No Trespassing zones on the border, and by taking federal land and declaring a national emergency and transferring it to the military, and then also using the military as an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act where he says, ‘This is a military purpose to deal with the emergency on the border.'""

""The idea that the President United States can use a military presence to defend an American border, I think that's going to be tough to challenge.""

Since President Donald Trump took office, the number of active-duty troops at the southern border has surged from under 2,000 to more than 8,000, with Hegseth authorizing up to 10,000 earlier this year.

This militarized approach has also prompted drug traffickers to shift tactics, turning to maritime smuggling routes in response to intensified land enforcement. The Pentagon has responded by deploying naval vessels with Coast Guard teams to interdict sea-based drug operations.

""We know terrorists are trying to get in through our border,"" said Brig Barker, former FBI advisor to U.S. Special Operations Command and counterterrorism expert. ""Swarming this with different inter-agencies is a good thing. … The military has a lot of refined skills and capabilities that civilian law enforcement doesn't have. 

He predicted that military counternarcotics missions would push further into Latin America, ""bringing that out to that fight farther out from our border, really kind of preempt before they can get closer to our border.""

'The Big Weekend Show' discusses Republicans' divided opinions on President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' as the Senate debates its provisions.

""$10 million?"" 

""$100 million?"" 

""No, you're crazy, it's got to be more than that, it's got to be like in the billions.""  

MAGA COUNTRY VOTERS SOUND ALARM OVER ‘RIDICULOUS' NATIONAL DEBT AMID DEBATE OVER TRUMP-BACKED BILL

""That much?"" 

""Maybe"" 

""No, no it must be even more than that. I bet you it's a trillion dollars.""  

SENATE WEIGHS TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS POLICY GROUP BACKS CBO, PROJECTS $3 TRILLION DEBT INCREASE

""A trillion dollars? No way it's that much."" 

I had just taught my high school seniors in U.S. government class about budgets and national debts and asked, ""How much money do you think we owe? How much is our national debt?""  

Their ridiculous responses, ranging from millions to billions to $1 trillion, are funny but also sad. Finally, I can't listen anymore and, feeling like the evil queen giving Snow White the poisoned apple, tell them: ""$37 trillion dollars."" 

INVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES

There's a stunned silence.  

I then walk around the room with my hand out and start shaking students' hands, each time saying, ""Thank you."" They look at me, confused. Eventually a boy asks, ""Why are you thanking us? 

The debt clock moves like the second hand on a watch. Here's the clock from Feb. 24, 2012, when the national debt was $22 trillion less. (AP)

""Because you're the ones who are going to be paying it."" 

More stunned silence.  

TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' NEEDS A 'FAT SHOT' TO END OUR DANGEROUS DEBT ADDICTION

Of course, many of them have heard, one way or another, about Washington's spending problems, deficits and debts. But it was not until this moment that they finally understood what it really meant – and what it will mean for them. Many of them are worried they'll incur student loan debt – they were unaware of the other debt they're inheriting. 

I put usdebtclock.org up, along with a photo of my granddaughter playing in our back yard, and ask, ""How much does she owe?""

It takes them a minute, but they find the ""Debt per citizen"" section – $108,010. She is 3 years old.  

Of more immediate interest for them is ""Debt per taxpayer,"" since some have already begun paying taxes, and most others will soon. That's $323,051.  

YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SOLUTION TO THE DEBT CRISIS, BUT HERE'S HOW TO FIX AMERICA'S SPENDING PROBLEM

I say, ""Look at that debt clock – what is the worst number on there? Not the highest, the worst."" 

After a couple minutes, I direct their attention to the section, ""Interest on the debt."" It's a little over a trillion dollars a year. 

Their ridiculous responses, ranging from millions to billions to $1 trillion, are funny but also sad. Finally, I can't listen anymore and, feeling like the evil queen giving Snow White the poisoned apple, tell them: ""$37 trillion dollars."" 

""What does that money buy?"" one of them asks. I take a piece of scrap paper off my desk, crumple it, hold it up, and say: ""To the taxpayer, it's worth exactly as much as this crumpled paper. That money doesn't build a single hospital or school or bridge. It doesn't build a single bomber or manufacture a single bullet.""  

I show them that in July of 2020 debt service was only $386 billion a year and the national debt was $26 trillion. I ask why would debt service be 2.6 times as high now when the national debt is ""only"" 1.4 times as high. The answer is that interest rates have gone up, greatly increasing the interest we pay on the debt.  

CLASS DISMISSED: COLLEGES EXPECTED TO CLOSE AS ENROLLMENT NUMBERS TANK

The students try to come up with solutions. ""Why not just pay it by printing more money?""  

I explain hyperinflation and pass around a couple 100 million Deutsche Mark bills from Germany in 1923. I tell the story of a German woman filling an old wheelbarrow with Deutsche Marks, going to the store, leaving it outside for a moment while she selected some bread and milk, then coming back to find the old wheelbarrow gone--and the worthless bills dumped out in the street. 

We watch the 2009 Onion satirical video ""U.S. Government Stages Fake Coup To Wipe Out National Debt"" in which a newscaster informs viewers: 

""The White House today enacted an emergency plan to eliminate all the United States' financial obligations to foreign nations by faking a violent coup of the American government …the fake coup began at 10 a.m. today, when fake rebel leader Octavius Del Monte stormed Congress, pretended to kill several congressmen … then said ‘Hear my words China, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. and all its vast debt, no longer exists. Henceforth, this land will be called Octavia. Do not even try to collect funds owed!'"" 

INVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES

The newscaster then explains that ""Representatives on both sides of the aisle said the plan was the best option left for lowering our debt after ideas like burning down the country for the insurance money and disguising the nation as Canada were deemed infeasible."" 

I ask the students why it seems almost comical how worried they were in 2009 about the national debt. There's a pause. Then one student raises his hand, and answers, ruefully, ""Because it was only $10 trillion back then."" 

U.S. Marines from Bravo Company of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines, walk in the town of Marjah in the Nad Ali district of Helmand province. The area was infested with roadside bombs, an obstacle which is bogging the company down, a spokesman said in 2010. (Reuters)

The students want to know how we--the allegedly responsible adults – could have done this to them. I list some of the reasons:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democrats cry wolf over Medicaid cuts","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3461544/democrats-cry-wolf-over-medicaid-cuts/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

I'll never forget the dentist appointment I had when I was 18. It was supposed to be a routine cleaning, the kind of thing you do every six months without a second thought. After my teeth were polished, the dental assistant took me to get X-rays. As I sat in the chair, I couldn't help feeling nervous. I'd had plenty of cavities before, and I knew what I'd be in for if I needed more fillings. I asked the assistant if everything looked OK. He glanced at the images on the screen and shrugged. “I don't see anything troubling,” he told me reassuringly.

A few minutes later, the dentist came in. He peered at the X-rays, did a quick exam, and then delivered the verdict: I had 19 cavities. I didn't even know it was possible to have that many cavities at once without your teeth crumbling out of your mouth. I sat there in stunned silence, feeling as though the floor had dropped out from under me. When the dentist left the room, I turned to the assistant. How could he have missed 19 cavities? How could I have that much tooth decay without any pain at all?

He didn't hesitate. He looked me straight in the eye and said, “You have Medicaid. That's a dollar sign on your forehead.”

That sentence has stuck with me ever since. In that moment, it explained exactly why so many Medicaid patients receive such subpar care. I walked out of that office and never went back. However, the reality was that I didn't have many options. Despite living in the middle of New York City, where you can find a dozen Thai restaurants on every block, I found it nearly impossible to find a dentist who accepted Medicaid and wasn't running some racket. When I searched for reviews of the practices that did take Medicaid, they were flooded with one-star horror stories: botched procedures, rude staff, endless upselling, and billing scams. It felt like the only dentists willing to participate were those who had graduated last in their class or kept their doors open by defrauding the system, such as the one I had just seen.

I was so put off that I didn't see a dentist again for three years until I finally got a job with private insurance. When I finally did go back, bracing myself for the inevitable discovery of those 19 cavities, something miraculous happened: They were gone. The new dentist reviewed my X-rays and couldn't find a single cavity that needed to be filled. All 19 cavities had apparently vanished, because they had never existed in the first place.

This experience wasn't an anomaly. It was a window into what happens when a massive government program is run with little accountability and plenty of perverse incentives. Medicaid was created with the best of intentions: to provide healthcare to Americans in need. But good intentions don't always lead to good outcomes, especially when government bureaucracies grow beyond their original purpose.

Medicaid is back in the news this week because of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Republicans' new budget and healthcare proposal, which aims to trim the program back to what it was intended to be. Originally, Medicaid was designed to serve low-income children, older people, and people with disabilities who couldn't work. Today, it has expanded so far beyond those groups that in many states, it functions like a single-payer healthcare system in all but name. Enrolled in Medicaid are millions of able-bodied, working-age adults, many of whom could obtain private insurance if they chose to. In some cases, states have opened the doors to illegal immigrants as well.

As expected, Democrats are howling that this is an attack on the most vulnerable Americans. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) shared the story of Claire, a disabled girl who relies on Medicaid for in-home care. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) posted about a meeting he had with a 14-year-old disabled boy named Ben, warning that Republican cuts would leave children like Ben and Claire without health insurance.

These stories are intended to do one thing: tug at the public's heartstrings. They are meant to paint Republicans as cartoon villains who wake up every morning, dreaming of ways to harm children and people with disabilities. But the reality is just the opposite. Children such as Claire and Ben are exactly the people Medicaid was created to help, and precisely the ones who suffer when the program is stretched to cover millions of people it was never designed to serve.

Right now, Medicaid has been diluted so thoroughly that people with disabilities are forced to compete for care with healthy, able-bodied adults. Resources are finite. When states spend billions covering people who can work or who entered the country illegally, there are fewer caregivers and dollars left for those who truly cannot survive without help. It's not compassion to pretend the program is sustainable in its current structure. It's cowardice.

This playbook from Democrats isn't new. For decades, Democrats have used the same tactic whenever Republicans propose even modest reforms. They declare that any attempt to rein in a bloated entitlement program will literally kill people. If you believe their rhetoric, Republicans have supposedly been killing Americans by the millions every year, whether by ending net neutrality, confirming a Supreme Court justice, passing tax cuts, or letting states set their own abortion laws. The hysteria has become so predictable that it has lost the power it once held.

Consider the failed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. In 2017, after nearly a decade of promising to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, Republicans finally had the votes in the House to pass a repeal bill. But multiple efforts in the Senate collapsed under the weight of coordinated Democratic messaging and a relentless media campaign declaring that millions would die if Obamacare were undone. Ultimately, only the individual mandate penalty was repealed, while the core of the law remained intact. Republicans learned the hard way that if you don't control the narrative, you will lose, even if your policy is right on the merits.

They aren't making that mistake again. This time, Republicans are prepared to defend their proposals and to call out the lies in real time. During a press conference earlier this week, President Donald Trump was asked whether 11.8 million Americans would lose their healthcare under the new plan. He didn't dodge.

“It's going to be a smaller number than that, and that number will be waste, fraud, and abuse,” he said. He reminded the press that Democrats have created a system so inefficient and overextended that it's already failing the people it was meant to help. “We are going to save it,” he continued. “Democrats are going to destroy Medicaid and Medicare, and they have to, because their numbers don't work. They have made it so bad already.”

Vice President JD Vance was equally blunt, responding to liberal pundit Matt Yglesias on social media: “This guy wants to bankrupt Medicaid by importing millions of illegal immigrants and giving them healthcare that ought by right go to his fellow citizens. Now he pretends to care about them. The dishonesty is off the charts.”

But perhaps the most powerful argument isn't from politicians but the people themselves. We have been subjected to so many apocalyptic warnings over the years that we no longer flinch when the next one arrives. The boy who cried wolf has cried himself hoarse. The public is starting to understand that real compassion isn't measured by how many people you can cram into a failing program. It's measured by whether the people who truly need help are actually able to get it.

If Republicans want to finish this argument once and for all, they shouldn't stop with trimming the Medicaid rolls. They should also address the aspects of the program that deter good doctors. Currently, Medicaid reimburses providers at rates often half of what private insurers pay. Most reputable physicians can't afford to keep their doors open at those rates, so they limit Medicaid patients to a handful of charity slots or opt out entirely.

MAKE MEDICAID GREAT AGAIN

That's why so many patients end up in practices such as the one I fled as a teenager, places that prey on desperation and profit from volume billing. Republicans have a chance to deliver a one-two punch: clean out the waste and fraud, and then raise reimbursement rates enough to attract quality doctors back into the system. If they do both, they won't just be known for cutting Medicaid; they'll be remembered for saving it.

That isn't cruelty. It's sanity. And if we're ever going to build a safety net that actually works, this is the long-overdue first step. Republicans can seize the moment to become the party that rescued Medicaid from collapse and returned it to its original purpose: caring for the truly vulnerable with dignity and respect.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Who are the four Republicans Johnson had to flip in favor of Trump's bill","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3461887/four-republicans-flip-big-beautiful-bill-house-vote/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:12:21 GMT","

Four Republican fiscal hawks flipped their votes in the early hours of Thursday morning to advance President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful” bill, allowing it to come to the House floor for a final vote in the lower chamber. 

Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY), Victoria Spartz (R-IN), Andrew Clyde (R-GA), and Keith Self (R-TX) backtracked after facing intense pressure from Trump, who worked the phones overnight, and from Johnson, who could be seen huddling with holdouts in the House chamber. Given his razor-thin majority, the speaker could afford to lose only three Republican votes, assuming all Democrats remained opposed.

The four lawmakers flipped their votes to “yes” around 3:20 a.m. after hours of the vote being open, with Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) being the sole GOP dissenter to vote against the bill. Their support means Trump's legislation will undergo a final vote later Thursday morning. 

Fitzpatrick, a centrist, provoked some surprise with his “no vote,” as he had given little indication he was prepared to block the bill. The Pennsylvania centrist bolted from the chamber after he bucked Johnson on the vote, as colleagues who tried to locate him reported the lawmaker had disappeared. 

Johnson later said he held nothing against Fitzpatrick for his action. 

“I talked with him at length. Brian is a very good and trusted friend, and he just has convictions about certain provisions of the bill — he's entitled to that,” Johnson said, according to Fox News. 

More surprising than Fitzpatrick's vote was Massie's stunning flip and the sudden change of heart of several other fiscal hawks. Massie first voted yes, then changed to a no, then concluded with a yea vote after saying he was confused about the difference between rule and final votes. The procedural rule vote overnight allowed the bill to advance to the floor for a final vote, where lawmakers will decide whether to get Trump's marquee legislation across the finish line. 

Massie had long railed against the bill over concerns it would raise the federal deficit, and reminded reporters on Wednesday of the “principled stand” he was taking. 

“I have raised $400,000 from 4,500 donors in the last 10 days for taking this principled stand. So my life hasn't been difficult at all,” the Kentucky maverick told NBC News in the Capitol, adding that he's “not concerned” that Trump and his allies might come after him politically.

“They're whipping this horse, because I'm out of the barn, to keep the other horses in the barn,” Massie said, predicting that while other holdouts such as Spartz, Clyde, and Self might “cut a deal for something,” he doubted there was “a deal that I would make.” 

Spartz, who had also expressed concern that the Senate-passed version of the bill affected the national debt negatively, flipped after saying Wednesday she planned to back the bill if it made it to the floor for final passage while promising not to vote in favor of the rule.

“I'll vote for the bill, since we need to make it happen for our economy & there are some good provisions in it. However, I will vote against the rule due to broken commitments by @SpeakerJohnson to his own members,”  she wrote on X.

Meanwhile, Self flipped after saying that “we made some progress on some fiscal issues,” in comments to Punchbowl early Thursday morning. 

The four holdouts reversed after Trump called them in the wee hours of Thursday morning, per the Hill, as the president worked the phones to crush even serial rebel Massie's opposition. 

When he wasn't making phone calls, Trump was shooting off fiery posts on Truth Social demanding that lawmakers cave. 

“Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!,” he wrote.

“FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!,” the president added in another post. 

Meanwhile, Johnson was seen huddling with the holdouts to try to flip their votes as he was observed holding animated discussions with lawmakers like Clyde.

The speaker said he had worked with Trump to get the bill pushed through, telling reporters he's talked to Trump “multiple times today, tonight, this morning.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) was pulled from camera view after she was caught snoozing in the background while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) gave an impassioned speech.

On Thursday, Jeffries gave his “magic minute” speech to delay the passage of President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill.” The speech began at 4:53 a.m. after an already lengthy day for the House, leaving many representatives sleep-deprived. Jeffries's passion wasn't enough to keep Kaptur awake, and she began dozing off.

Unfortunately for the House Democrats, she was positioned right behind Jeffries, within the C-SPAN camera shot.

She was asleep for slightly under five minutes before one of her staff members came to wake her up and take her away. She was replaced by a fully awake Rep. Sarah McBride (D-DE).

Kaptur's opponents were quick to seize on the viral moment, including Republican Ohio state Rep. Josh Williams, who is running to unseat her in 2026.

The Trump administration's decision to halt the delivery of some weapons to Ukraine, citing a Pentagon review of its dwindling stockpiles, was a long-held concern for Kyiv that finally became a reality.

The weapons the United States has provided have been critical for Ukraine's defense; however, concerns over the U.S.'s diminishing stockpiles, reduced by giving equipment and weapons to Ukraine throughout the conflict, predate the Trump administration.

It's unclear how expansive the pause is or whether this will be the beginning of the end of U.S. military support for Ukraine entirely. Outside of the Pentagon, it's also unknown just how low current Department of Defense stockpiles have gotten, though officials maintain that the military still has the means to deter adversaries and carry out operations as it did in Iran last month.

On Wednesday, Pentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell told reporters that the department would not publicly divulge which munitions or systems were provided to Ukraine or the timelines associated with these possible transfers.

The decision, while in line with the administration's overarching strategy toward Russia and Ukraine, is somewhat surprising, given that last week, President Donald Trump said, “We're going to see if we can make some available,” regarding Ukraine's desire for additional U.S. air defenses.

While the previous administration shared the concern, they viewed Ukraine's victory on the battlefield as a vital U.S. interest. In contrast, the current administration has prioritized securing a diplomatic solution, with little success so far, to end Russia's war, even if it comes at Ukraine's expense.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told senators in June that the U.S. “is committed to peace in that conflict ” when asked directly which party in the war he “wants to win.”

His sentiment, which the administration has widely shared, makes the current announcement unsurprising, even as their efforts to negotiate an end to the war have fallen flat due to Russia's demands.

The U.S. military's air defenses have been stretched thin in recent years, and Parnell blamed the previous administration for the current situation.

“I think that for a long time, four years under the Biden administration, we were giving away weapons and munitions without really thinking about how many we have,” he said Wednesday.

In addition to its aid to Ukraine, the department surged military assistance to Israel, helping them thwart multiple barrages of Iranian missiles in April and October of 2024 and again in June 2025 during the Israel-Iran war, and the U.S. military has carried out nearly two months of operations against the Houthis in Yemen.

The military also recently defended the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar against a telegraphed Iranian retaliatory attack. Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Staff, called it the “largest single Patriot engagement in the U.S. military.”

The crews manning the Patriot two patriot batteries involved in defending the air base were deployed from South Korea and Japan, Caine said, emphasizing the department's frequent shuffling of air defense systems across the globe.

Adm. Samuel Paparo, the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told lawmakers in April that it took 73 C-17 cargo planes to transfer one Patriot system from the region to the Middle East.

It came on the heels of the nearly two-month-long U.S. military operation against the Houthis to restore Freedom of Navigation in the Red Sea.

Adm. James Kilby, the acting chief of naval operations, told lawmakers last month that the Navy is using the standard missile interceptor, known as an SM-3, at “an alarming rate,” amid the conflict in the Middle East.

Paparo said in November 2024 that it would be “dishonest” to claim the diversion of U.S. aid to Ukraine and Israel wasn't impacting stockpiles.

“With some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it's now eating into stocks, and to say otherwise would be dishonest,” Paparo said, according to Reuters. “Inherently, it imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because the PRC [People's Republic of China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world.”

The Pentagon has sought and continues to work with defense contractors to pick up production from the defense industrial base, but it doesn't happen overnight.

“For our interests, and to stop Putin from taking a sovereign country in Europe, Congress needs to lead the effort to rebuild our defense industrial base here at home. It creates good-paying American jobs, including in Michigan, and makes us safer and more secure,” Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink told the Washington Examiner. “This is how we continue to lead the free world.”

Russia is celebrating the news of the halted shipments and believes the decision could prompt its victory.

“As far as we understand, the reason for the decision was empty warehouses, but the fewer weapons supplied to Ukraine, the closer the end of the ‘special military operation,'” Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.

Russian officials have long believed that they could outlast U.S. and Western support for Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin's “theory of victory is that he can outlast any sort of significant western support for Ukraine, and that, therefore, that will kneecap the Ukrainians' ability to reverse Russian gains on the battlefield,” George Barros, an expert with the Institute for Study of War, told the Washington Examiner. “So long as the Russians have patience and the willingness to be able to outlast fickle Western support, then Putin thinks he can win.”

The decision to halt this aid ultimately benefits Russia, weakening Ukraine's defenses on the battlefield. However, it may take some time for the effects to show, as in previous instances when the U.S. temporarily stopped various aspects of its support.

The U.S. temporarily stopped sharing intelligence with Ukraine in the aftermath of the Trump-Zelensky blowup in the Oval Office, which resulted in delayed consequences on the front lines.

Based on what happened then, Barros predicts Russia's attacks “will accelerate,” while Ukraine's “ability to defend themselves will become more difficult, and more Ukrainian service members and civilians are likely going to be killed.”

Brink said the administration's decision “won't end Russia's war,” rather it will “result in more civilians and children being killed.”

Earlier this week, Russia hit Ukraine with what is believed to be its largest drone and missile attack of the conflict. Ukraine's air force said the bombardment included a total of 477 drones and 60 missiles.

Caine told lawmakers in the same hearing that Hegseth declined to specify if he wanted Ukraine to prevail and that he didn't “believe” Putin would stop at Ukraine if they had continued battlefield success.

The Trump administration has held several iterations of talks with Russia to discuss ending the war diplomatically, but those efforts have not yet produced results.

Russian officials have maintained hardline stances in negotiations, which guarantee them the victories they seek that are unattainable to them on the battlefield.

PENTAGON HALTS SOME WEAPONS SHIPMENTS TO UKRAINE, CITING LOW US STOCKPILES

Conversely, Ukrainian leaders have entered into the critical minerals agreement with the U.S. as a roundabout way to repay the U.S. for the aid already provided, and they have sought to purchase U.S. weapons instead of simply accepting them free of charge.

Pulling U.S. support for Ukraine will only hurt the administration's efforts to end the war, according to experts, because it reinforces Putin's belief he can outlast the West.

“My initial thought was not surprised but disappointed in the sense that I expected the opposite,” Charles Kupchan, a fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Washington Examiner. “I saw Trump getting frustrated with Putin, feeling that Putin was playing him and not negotiating in good faith to end the war and that, as a consequence, Trump would understand that he needs to increase the coercive pressure on the Kremlin by making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself.”

A conversation with the Dropkick Murphys front man about punk, politics, and Donald Trump

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.

Ken Casey, the founder and front man of the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys, is the physical, attitudinal, and linguistic personification of Boston. Proof of this can be found in the way he pronounces MAGA. To wit: “Magger,” as in, “This Magger guy in the audience was waving his fucking Trump hat in people's faces, and I could just tell he wanted to enter into discourse with me.” A second proof is that “enter into discourse” is a thing Ben Affleck would say in a movie about South Boston right before punching someone in the face. The third is Casey's articulation of what I took to be a personal code: “I'm not going to shut up, just out of spite.”

The aforementioned discourse took place at a show in Florida in March. Video of the incident has moved across the internet, and it has provoked at least some Dropkick Murphy fans—white, male, and not particularly predisposed to the Democratic Party in its current form—to abandon the band. Casey accepts this as the price for preserving his soul. “I think everything we've been doing for the past 30 years was a kind of warm-up for the moment we're in,” he told me. The band is most famous for its furious, frenzied anthem “I'm Shipping Up to Boston,” but it is also known, among certain high-information voters and union activists, as a last repository of working-class values. As white men have lurched to the right, the band is on a mission to convince them that they're being played by a grifter. “Thirty years ago, the Reagan era, everyone was in lockstep with what we were saying,” he said. “Now people say our message is outdated or elite or we're part of some machine.”

Casey and I were talking on a sunny day this spring at Fenway Park (inevitably), where he was filming a promotional video for the Red Sox's Dropkick Murphy Bobblehead Night (July 11, in case you were wondering). Casey, who is tattooed up to the neck and carries himself like a bartender, is amused by the idea that anyone would consider him an elitist. He is, after all, a writer of both “Kiss Me, I'm Shitfaced” and “Smash Shit Up.”

“They take the fact that we don't support Trump as us being shills for the Democrats,” he said. “They love to call us cucks, which I find ironic because there's a good portion of MAGA that would probably step aside and let Donald Trump have their way with their significant other if he asked.”

There's also a bit of grace to be found in the culture war, as Casey discovered at the now-famous Florida show.

“These two guys had their MAGA shirts and hats and a cardboard blowup of Trump's head, and they're in the front row, so they're definitely trolling,” Casey said. “We've had this before, guys with MAGA hats just shoving it in people's faces.”

Casey addressed the audience, first with an accusation: “Where the fuck are all the other punk bands?”

The answer is that the bands are scared, just like so many others. Punk bands are no exception, which is a small irony, given the oppositional iconoclasm of so much of punk, and the movement's anti-authoritarian roots.

It's striking that few singers, bands, and movie stars—so many of them reliably progressive when the stakes are trivial—seem willing to address the country's perilous political moment. (Casey's friend Bruce Springsteen is a noteworthy exception.) Intimidation works, and complicity is the norm, not the exception. “You've got the biggest bands running scared,” Casey said.

The latest Dropkick Murphys album, For the People, is compensation for the silence of other quarters. Only a minority of the songs on the album address the political moment directly, but those that do were written in anger. The first single, “Who'll Stand for Us,” addresses the betrayal of working Americans: “Through crime and crusade / Our labor, it's been stolen / We've been robbed of our freedom / We've been held down and beholden.” Fury runs like a red streak through For the People.

“The reason we speak out is we don't care if we lose fans,” Casey said from the stage in Florida. “When history is said and done, we want it known that Dropkick Murphys stood with the people and stood with the workers. And it's all a fucking scam, guys.”

He then addressed the Trumpists in the front row. “I want to propose, in the name of decency and fairness—I'd like to propose a friendly wager. Do you support American workers? Of course you do. Do you support American business? Obviously. I don't know if you are aware, because we don't go around bragging about it, but Dropkick Murphys only sells American-made merchandise.”

The wager was simple: He'd give the man in the Trump shirt $100 and a Dropkick Murphys T-shirt if his Trump shirt had been made in America. If the fan lost, he'd still get the Dropkick Murphy shirt.

Casey knows a safe bet. The shirt, of course, had been made in Nicaragua. But Casey felt no need to humiliate the Trumpist. “He's a good sport!” Casey told the cheering crowd. “He's taking the shirt off! We're taking crime off the street! God bless your fucking heart!”

After the show, Casey, as is his practice, left the stage through the audience, and talked to the Trump supporters. “There was him and his son, and they were the nicest two guys. It made me think, I have to get past the shirt and the hat, because they were almost doing it for a laugh, like it was their form of silent protest. This guy said, ‘I've been coming to see you for 20 years. I consider you family, and I don't let politics come between family.' And I was like, Wow. It was a good lesson. But how many families out there in America have politics come between them, you know?”

Casey says that identity politics—and especially the exploitation of identity politics by Trump-aligned Republicans—alienate from the Democrats the sort of people he grew up with. Recently, the band performed at an anti-Trump protest at Boston's City Hall Plaza. Afterward, Casey told me, “even people I know said, ‘Oh, you were at that rally? I always knew you were gay.'”

He continued, “This is why people in labor and the left want us to be involved in some of this protest. MAGA, they use this male-masculinity issue the way they use trans and woke to divide. They're teaching the young males that this is the soft party.”

Although Casey personally leans Bernie philosophically, he's realistic about the left and about the Democratic Party's dysfunction. “If I think about all the people I know in my life that have shifted over to Trump voters—AOC ain't bringing them back. I actually like her, but it ain't happening.”

Who else does he like? Someone who can speak to people outside the progressive bubble. He likes Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a successful Democratic governor of a red state. “I'm not against going full-on progressive,” he said, “but if it's not going to be that, you got to find a centrist. It can't be mush. It's got to be someone who can speak the language of that working-class-male group that they seem to have lost. That's why I love the idea of a veteran, whether it's Wes Moore or Ruben Gallego, or even Adam Kinzinger, who's talking about running as a Democrat.”

He'd rather not have to think about electoral politics this much, he said at Fenway. But he is still shocked that so many people in his life fell for Trumpism. “My father died when I was young, and I was raised by my grandfather, who was basically like, ‘If I ever see you bullying someone, I'll kick the shit out of you. And if I ever see you back down from a bully, I'll kick the shit out of you.'”

“I've just never liked bullies,” he continued, “and I don't understand people who do. It's really not that hard. I wish more people would see that it's not hard to stand up.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Set off fireworks.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

My father dislikes firework shows, for all the reasons that a man who passed his youth squeezing a trigger in the name of God and country dislikes firework shows. He loves fireworks, however, if he's the one lighting them, a psychological loophole that he and I have availed ourselves of at a number of East Coast tourist-trap locales over the years. Our most recent adventure was an excursion to South Carolina when I was in my 20s: We loaded up a rented golf cart with an immoderate amount of fireworks and a moderate amount of Miller Lite and set off for the beach to enjoy both. The golf cart was road-legal, but whether the fireworks were beach-legal was a question I didn't think to ask. I was living in New York City at the time, besotted with its buzzy restaurants and rooftop bars, and that trip, with its unpretentious excitement, is when I started to appreciate my dad's quiet enthusiasm for simple fun. It was also when I began to suspect that I might one day run out of zeal for New York's inexhaustible supply of novel experiences.

That was about a decade ago, when I was unencumbered and not especially concerned with following local fireworks ordinances. Now, however, I am a father and a husband, have decamped to Maine, and am an ostensibly respectable member of the nation's citizenry. So when I set out this week with the goal of re-creating the fireworks-on-the-beach experience I'd had with my father, I wanted to do it by the book.

I thought this would be straightforward. Fireworks, like sports gambling, weed, and other common vices, have been on a slow march toward legalization in recent decades. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, fireworks injuries in America have risen as legalization has spread. A report released in June estimated that the number of fireworks-related ER visits in 2024 was 40 percent higher than in 2014.) The only state that still bans all consumer fireworks outright is Massachusetts, which means that the one place where you can't celebrate American freedom with a bang is where the fight for American freedom began with a bang. Maine, by contrast, has some of the most permissive fireworks laws in the country. I assumed that all I would need to do was drive to the gas station for beer, the fireworks store for supplies, and a local beach for kaboom. I had no idea I'd end up on a days-long odyssey with the un-Homeric goal of finding a stretch of oceanfront on which to legally deploy several hundred dollars' worth of consumer-grade pyrotechnics.

Read: Fireworks: A poem

I was right about one thing: Procuring fireworks legally was easy. (Though it was not cheap—prices this year are considerably higher than I remember, the result of inflation and tariffs.) I walked into my local Phantom Fireworks store on Monday, showed my ID to an employee—who apparently forgot to give me the safety spiel that I later heard him rattle off for other customers—and walked up and down the aisles, surveying the merchandise. I was at once overwhelmed by the panorama of distinctly American excess and moved by the great variety of American life to which it attested.

I discovered recreational explosives for every sort of person residing within this country's borders, befitting every kind of enthusiasm and ideological commitment: castle-doctrine “STAND YOUR GROUND” fireworks for the Second Amendment fanatic ($349.99), Rosie the Riveter fireworks for the feminist ($120.00), Illuminati-triangle fireworks for the conspiracist ($49.99), “SINGULARITY” fireworks for the AI enthusiast ($135.00), lobster-festooned “Wicked Pissah” fireworks for the New Englander ($49.99), Battle of Yorktown fireworks for history buffs ($179.99), “Shagadellic Mojo” fireworks for the horny customer ($44.99), suggestively silhouetted “Mega Mojo!” fireworks for the very horny customer ($149.99), and, my personal favorite, Boyz II Men fireworks for those who love soulful harmonies ($199.99). Of the available ways that an adult can spend hundreds of dollars on 20-odd seconds of pleasure, the Boyz II Men “End of the Road”–themed Phantom Fireworks special is certainly among the more virtuous.

The store also offered an abundance of firework types: bombettes, mortars, ground-bound fountains that emit a volcanic torrent of sparks. I was nearly seduced by a Komodo-dragon-themed fountain, but I believe that a true firework should go up and go boom, and a man must stand on principle. After half a dozen laps through the aisles, I marched up to the cash register with five offerings, all in the aerial “cake” style that fires flaming balls from a series of concealed mortar tubes: one that seemed inspired by Jaws and one by Jurassic Park (my favorite Spielberg movies); one “Wicked Pissah” (which seemed obligatory); one “Bait a Hook” box, catering to fishermen (in keeping with my angling obsession); and a generic rah-rah-patriotism package with the overwrought name “'Neath the Red, White and Blue.”

Later, seized with irrational panic that I lacked a real showstopper, I returned to the store and asked the first purple-shirted Phantom employee I saw for something under $200 that would make a real impression. He wordlessly shuffled to the farthest wall, pulled a package labeled “Geomagnetic Storm” ($129.99) from a high display, and gave the box a hearty slap on its side, as you might burp a baby. “They like this one,” he reported. I do not know who “they” are, but I trusted their taste implicitly. I left the store considerably poorer and with the unshakable conviction that although the American project may not yet endure, no one can say we don't have fun.

Read: The Fourth of July has always been political

Where to have that fun was another matter. The ease with which I legally purchased the fireworks lulled me into overoptimism about the ease with which I could legally deploy them. As I soon found out, although Maine takes a rather laissez-faire approach to fireworks at the state level, many of the state's local municipalities enforce their own restrictions. Some areas designate specific dates and times when fireworks can be set off (most commonly, July Fourth and New Year's Eve); others ban them year-round. On top of this, my desire to launch fireworks from a beach was a problem: Maine allows consumer fireworks to be used only on private property, and I do not, alas, have a house with its own beach.

I was curious if I might be able to finagle a maritime workaround. I contacted some local fire departments to ask about the permissibility, and wisdom, of deploying small fireworks from a boat. (I do not have a boat, but I do have a friend with a boat and poor judgment.) At first, no one I spoke with was able to definitively say whether this option was safe or legal, but one recommended that I call a Coast Guard information line. My Coast Guard query yielded no answers, but it did lead to the suggestion that I contact Maine's fire-marshal office, where at last a diligent and helpful public servant told me that launching fireworks from a personal watercraft is absolutely illegal. But they also added—perhaps wink-winkingly, definitely humorously—that the fire marshal “issued zero citations for this in 2024.”

My many phone calls, one in-person visit to the fire department, and hours of scrutinizing local fireworks laws led me to realize that my modest goal of legally setting off fireworks on a beach in observation of this country's birthday was far too ambitious. I was forced to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and to compromise. The specifics of that compromise I leave up to the reader's imagination, but the upshot is that $300.60 of civilian-market explosives eventually met their logical end in an extravagant and all-too-brief flurry of detonations. To my slight disappointment, the fireworks I had bought, including the fabled Geomagnetic Storm, were largely indistinguishable from one another. Regardless of price or theme, they did about the same thing after I lit them: shot up into the sky with a hiss, exploded in a cacophony, and issued a last burst of light and color. But they still had their evergreen capacity to elicit an involuntary squeal of delight from a grown man. In the end, fun was had, 10 fingers were retained, the holiday was celebrated, and the resulting video was texted to my father, who immediately asked the only question that matters: “What else do you have? Any mortars?” God bless America.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Casey Johnston's new book, A Physical Education, considers how weight lifting can help you unlearn diet culture.

You see it everywhere: A narrative of progress in two snapshots—before and after—that leaves the viewer to imagine what came in between. On the left, a body whose inhabitant is unhappy with it in some way. On the right, the same body but different, and—you're meant to understand—better.

On diet culture's greatest-hits album, the “before and after” is the lead single, an earworm that's hard to get out of your mind. Even when it's not being used explicitly to sell something (a meal regimen, a workout program), this diptych carries a promise that through the application of effort, you too can chisel yourself into a (supposedly) more appealing shape, which usually, but not always, means a smaller one.

Casey Johnston's new book, A Physical Education, tells a before-and-after story, too—one not of shrinkage but of growth, physical and otherwise. Johnston traces her journey from a life of joyless distance running, which she saw as “taking out bigger and bigger cardio loans to buy myself more calories,” to the revelation of weight lifting. Her book incorporates memoir, science writing, and cultural critique, offering a technical breakdown of the effects of Johnston's time in the gym, as well as condemnations of diet culture's scams and hucksters. The book is not a how-to, but more of a why-to: Strength training, in Johnston's telling, reframes both body and mind. Before lifting, “I knew all the contours of treating myself like a deceitful degenerate, against whom I must maintain constant vigilance,” she writes. After lifting, “all of the parts of myself that had been fighting each other” had become “united in the holy cause of getting strong as hell.”

Johnston has been evangelizing and explaining weight lifting online for years, first with her “Ask a Swole Woman” online column and then with her independent newsletter, She's a Beast, along with a beginner's lifting-training guide, Liftoff: Couch to Barbell. Like any hobby, weight lifting generates plenty of online material, but much of it is aimed at an audience that already knows its way around a squat rack. Johnston stands out for her attunement to the needs and anxieties of true beginners—particularly those who are women, for whom pumping iron often requires a certain amount of unlearning.

Even after the rise of body positivity, women are still frequently confronted with unsolicited promotion for crash diets, told that “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels,” and sold what Johnston calls “busywork bullshit” exercises—“Target love handles with these 10 moves”; “20 minutes to tone your arms”; etc.—designed to spot-treat so-called problem areas. Social media has supercharged the delivery of these messages; though there are plenty of supportive communities online, for every body-positive influencer, there seems to be another pushing food restriction and punishing workouts. The TikTok trend of “girl dinner” suggests that eating nothing but a plate of cheese cubes and almonds is an adorably feminine quirk rather than a repackaged eating disorder.

Read: The body-positivity movement is over

Johnston writes that since the age of 12, she'd been worrying about her weight, having internalized the message that “either I was small enough (and always getting smaller), or I was a disappointment.”

This is the message that fueled my workouts for the longest time, too—that the point of exercise was weight loss or, at the very least, staving off weight gain. Working out was a chore or—even worse—torturous penance for failing to become the impossible ever-shrinking woman. It wasn't supposed to feel good; it definitely wasn't fun. After berating myself to go to the gym in the first place, I would pedal away on the elliptical for 30 to 40 minutes until I tasted blood in the back of my throat (seems fine and normal), and then perform a grab bag of whatever calisthenics might plausibly target my core, hating every second of it. None of this changed the fact that I would get winded walking up a flight of stairs, or nearly buckle under the weight of my carry-on while hoisting it into an airplane's overhead bin.

Eventually, seeking a less resentful relationship with exercise and my body, I dove into martial arts for several years, then decided to give weight lifting a try. Johnston's writing was a guide for me; I loosely followed her Liftoff program when I was getting started, and have been a regular reader of her newsletter. It turned out that picking up something heavy for a few sets of five reps, sitting down half the workout, and then going home and eating a big sloppy burger did far more to make me feel comfortable in my body than gasping my way through endless burpees and rewarding myself with a salad ever did.

Johnston's assertion that lifting “completely changed how I think and feel about the world and myself and everything” sounds like another of the fitness industry's wild overpromises. But I know what she means. I, too, have found that lifting can transform the way you relate to your body.

First and foremost, Johnston explains, it inverts what women are still too-often told about the goal of exercise. It builds up instead of whittling away; it favors function over aesthetics. Weight lifting makes you better at more than just lifting weights. Johnston writes about struggling with a 40-pound bag of cat litter before she began lifting; now she simply picks it up and carries it into her apartment. As I added weight to the barbell, I felt my muscles stabilize; the neck and back pain from my butt-sitting job faded; I stopped needing help with my overstuffed suitcases; and I even started walking differently—no longer flinging my skeleton around, but smoothly engaging actual muscles. When I do cardio, running is easier too.

Read: The protein madness is just getting started

Here's another thing: You gotta eat. It won't work if you don't. When Johnston crunched the numbers on how many calories her body would need to build muscle, she discovered that the 1,200-calorie diet she'd been living on for years was not going to cut it. For the lifting to do anything, she'd need to eat more. Like, a lot more. Protein, especially.

Going from a mindset of restriction to making sure that she was eating enough shifted how Johnston felt in her body. She had more energy; she was no longer constantly cold. She felt like “a big, beautiful horse.” As for me, before lifting, I had never so viscerally felt the obvious truth that food is fuel, that what and how much I eat shapes what my body can do and how it feels.

Yet even these discoveries cannot always overcome the influence of diet culture. When Johnston starts to allow herself more calories, at first she fears “the worst fate that could befall a woman who bravely ate more: gaining three, or even five, pounds.” The most heartbreaking scene in the book illustrates how difficult it can be to put your weapons down after a lifetime of treating your body like the enemy. Johnston tries to spread the good word of weight lifting to her mother, whom she describes as a perpetual dieter and a practiced commentator on any fluctuations in Johnston's weight. It doesn't go well. After they take a frustrating trip to the gym together, Johnston asks, “What is it you're so afraid of?” Her mom replies that she doesn't want to become “one of those fat old women” whom “no one likes.”

“I can think of lots of fat old women that many people love,” Johnston tries.

“But they wouldn't love me.”

That's the well I think so many of us are still trying to climb out of: the belief that a woman's worth always lies in her desirability, that desirability takes only one shape, and that if she doesn't live up to the impossible standard, she should at least be working apologetically toward correcting that.

Even if you think you've made it out, the foot soldiers of diet culture are always looking to pull you back in. I've followed some lifting-related accounts on Instagram; the algorithm seems to have interpreted that as free rein to bombard me with reels of “weight-loss journeys,” “bodyweight exercises for hot girlies,” and the like. Every other celebrity seems to be on Ozempic now, and apparently, “thin is in” again. I admit I spiraled a little when I went up a size in all my clothes, even though I'd gotten bigger on purpose.

Rebecca Johns: A diet writer's regrets

Lifting culture, too, has its trapdoors back into disordered thinking. As Lauren Michele Jackson points out in her review of A Physical Education for The New Yorker, the idea that focusing on strength frees you from being preoccupied with looks is naive. Weight lifting can come with its own set of metrics and obsessions: Eating enough protein and hitting your macros can replace calorie restriction; instead of fixating on thinness, perhaps now you want a juicy ass or rippling biceps. The practice can be fraught in a different way for men, who are told that maximal swoleness is their optimal form. The same activity can be a key or a cage, depending on your point of view.

But weight lifting has stuck, for me and I think for Johnston, because it can also change the way one thinks about achievement. It serves as a pretty good metaphor for a balanced approach to striving that eschews both the Lean In–girlboss hustle and its “I don't dream of labor” anti-ambition backlash. Not running until your tank is empty and then running some more, but rather fueling yourself enough to push just a bit further than you have before. Letting the gains accumulate slowly, a little more weight at a time. And most important, learning that rest is part of the rhythm of progress. You punctuate your workouts with full days off. You do your reps, and then you just sit there for a couple of minutes. You work, and then you recover.

While I'm resting, I often eat sour candies out of a fanny pack. I saw some powerlifters on Instagram eating candy before tackling a big lift—the idea being that the quick-metabolizing sugary carbs give you a little boost of energy. I don't care if this is scientifically sound. (I'm serious, don't email me.) I'm more excited to work out when I know that it's also my candy time. The gym has morphed from a torture chamber to a place of challenge, effort, rest, and pleasure, all of which, it turns out, can coexist.

And failure is part of the mix, too. As Johnston writes, “Building strength is about pressing steadily upward on one's current limits”; if you're doing it right, your attempts will sometimes exceed your ability. That's how you know you're challenging yourself enough.

Sometimes failure involves gassing out on an attempt to squat heavier than you have ever squatted, and sometimes it's more like slipping on the banana peel of an old, unhealthy thought pattern. Both will knock you on your ass for a bit. But that's part of it. “Progress could be about going backward, letting go,” Johnston writes. “Before and after” images are only snapshots. Outside the frame, the body, and the self, keep evolving.

I do a lot of public speaking for business leaders about how using the science of happiness can improve their organization and make life easier for everyone. But there's one question I get very frequently: “What about when I have to do hard things that make people unhappy?” For example: having to fire someone, or asking people to make sacrifices. How do I think about this common scenario?

This quandary is as old as time, and no one addressed it better than Marcus Tullius Cicero, the Roman philosopher and statesman who lived more than two millennia ago. For much of his career, Cicero lived a comfortable, uncontentious life of the mind, respected by all. But after Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 B.C.E., he felt a civic duty to speak out about a threat to the republic in the person of Mark Antony, who was vying for power. Cicero denounced Antony as a tyrant in a series of speeches called the Philippics. It was a risky move, one that made a powerful enemy, but Cicero honestly believed that by doing the right thing as he understood it, he was making no sacrifice at all.

In a book written around the same time as the Philippics, titled De Officiis (“On Duties”), Cicero explained exactly why he believed that doing what is difficult but morally correct is also what most reliably and enduringly brings the rewards we seek in life. Despite our flawed instinct to take the path of least resistance, he reasoned, we will always be better served by choosing to do the right thing. In this masterwork, Cicero created a guide for how to have a successful life through honorable behavior. Take that to heart, and you have a guide for living a happier life as well.

From the September 1865 issue: Life and times of Marcus Tullius Cicero

De Officiis was written in the form of a very long public letter to Cicero's son, Cicero Minor, who was a philosophy student in Athens at the time. College life then being not so different from what it is today, he appears to have sorely needed advice on his duties. According to what the philosopher Seneca wrote some years later, the young man “was not gifted with a good memory, and drunkenness was gradually destroying any that he had.”

Cicero's book is in three parts, beginning with a study of what is honorable in life. He asserts that “all that is morally right rises from some one of four sources,” which he lists as truth, justice, nobility, and moderation. These are, essentially, a variation of Plato's four cardinal virtues of wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance, and Cicero argues that these traits are the foundation for a life of integrity and rectitude.

His letter offers limited encouragement to people who write advice columns. Modern research demonstrates that virtues are indeed most effectively transmitted by parents and peers, whereas outside interventions to teach virtue show only modest effectiveness. But as far as paternal influence goes, the book perhaps had some effect: Though Cicero Minor did not enjoy the illustrious career that his father did, he went on to hold a series of official positions in the Roman Republic.

The second part of De Officiis discusses the worldly rewards people naturally want. Cicero focuses on honor, wealth, and power—prizes bound up with a desire for status that is encoded in our genes. As evolutionary biologists have long argued, these rewards correlate with both reproductive success and resource acquisition. Our ancestors' drive to succeed has surely passed on to us a craving to be superior to others in money, power, and prestige. Cicero acknowledges this reality, but notes that there are morally better and worse ways to acquire these rewards. Less honorable ways include disloyalty toward others and dishonesty in our dealings. The morally superior means for doing so include generosity, courtesy, and excellence—the virtues from part one, above.

Part three of De Officiis is the most important because he argues that the honorable route to worldly rewards is also the most expedient and effective way to get them and keep them. In other words, there is no conflict between doing well and doing good. Back in part two, he realizes that people tend not to believe this, because they operate on the zero-sum assumption that someone must “take something from his neighbour” and so “profit by his neighbour's loss.” But in part three, Cicero rejects this completely. “For a man to take something from his neighbour and to profit by his neighbour's loss is more contrary to Nature than is death or poverty or pain or anything else that can affect either our person or our property.”

Cicero makes three arguments to bolster his claim that virtue is more profitable than vice. First, using Stoic reasoning, to behave unethically degrades your character, making any success that you realize not worth having. Second, any short-term gain by taking advantage of others will harm your reputation and therefore your long-term worldly success. Third, to use a not very Roman word, karma. Bad behavior, Cicero believed, disrupts the universe's natural harmony, with negative consequences for the perpetrator.

Arthur C. Brooks: How my struggle with Wittgenstein can make you happier

Cicero's argument—that lasting worldly success is not possible without virtue—can apply to happiness as well. In an effort to raise their well-being, at least temporarily, people constantly engage in behaviors they may not be proud of. People may cheat on their spouse for a thrill or to feel romantic love again. They may steal for an easy gain or lie for personal advantage. They may act selfishly by looking after their own interests and ignoring other people's.

Few of us would brag about being disloyal, dishonest, or selfish. As Cicero notes, people act in these ways because they evidently believe that happiness in life “will assuredly clash with moral rectitude.” People think that you can't always feel good by being good, so you may have to sacrifice the former for the latter. Predictably, Cicero says this is bunk—a “sorry state of servitude” and mere “pandering to sensual pleasure.”

By the same logic that the exercise of virtue ultimately delivers worldly success, Cicero believed it also brings true happiness. Modern social science shows that he was spot-on. For example, a happy marriage is not simply linked to conjugal fidelity; that loyalty is itself a central ingredient in marital contentment. Similarly, honesty in one's personal dealings reliably raises life satisfaction. And generous behavior has been found again and again to increase happiness. In the long run, then, the best way to feel good is to do good, despite any temptation to cut corners.

This dictum offers a reassuringly simple formula for a happier life. That doesn't mean it will always be easy to follow, but instead of asking, “What will make me happy right now?,” consider how to answer the question, “What is the virtuous path in this situation?” That correct path may involve tough decisions, but it will ultimately lead you to the greatest happiness in life.

Arthur C. Brooks: The key to critical self-awareness

To return to the leader's quandary I began with: How should we think about a situation when, in acting properly, we inflict unhappiness? Cicero's answer was unambiguous: Do your duty—even when doing so may harm your own and others' short-term happiness.

In Cicero's case, this was not hypothetical. Mark Antony came to power in a three-man dictatorship and sought to eliminate all of the dictators' opponents, starting with Cicero. With a warrant out for his execution, Cicero attempted to flee his villa for Macedonia, but was captured by Roman soldiers. As legend has it, seeing that the arrestee was the famous, noble Cicero, a tribune named Popillius hesitated in carrying out the execution. Cicero, the man of honor, did not plead for his life, but rather schooled the centurion on his duty: “Approach, veteran soldier,” he said, “and, if you can at least do so much properly, sever this neck.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

California Democrats finally stopped outsourcing their policy judgment to their favorite lobbies.

California just demolished a major obstacle to housing construction within its borders — and provided Democrats with a blueprint for better governance nationwide.

On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a pair of housing bills into law. One exempts almost all urban, multifamily housing developments from California's environmental review procedures. The second makes it easier for cities to change their zoning laws to allow for more homebuilding. 

Both these measures entail restricting the reach of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law that requires state and local governments to research and publicize the ecological impacts of any approved construction project. Individuals and groups can then sue to block these developments on the grounds that the government underestimated the project's true environmental harms. 

At first glance, these events might seem irrelevant to anyone who is neither a Californian nor a massive nerd. But behind the Golden State's esoteric arguments over regulatory exemptions lie much larger questions — ones that concern the fundamental aims and methods of Democratic policymaking. Namely:

In making it easier to build urban housing — despite the furious objections of some environmental groups and labor unions — California Democrats put material plenty above status quo bias, and the public's interests above their party's internal harmony. 

Too often in recent decades, Democrats have embraced the opposite priorities. And this has led blue cities and states to suffer from exceptionally large housing shortages while struggling to build public infrastructure on time and on budget. As a result, Democratic states have been bleeding population — and thus, electoral clout — to Republican ones while the public sector has fallen into disrepute.

California just demonstrated that Democrats don't need to accept these failures. Acquiescing to scarcity — for the sake of avoiding change or intraparty tension — is a choice. Democrats can make a different one. 

Critics of California's CEQA reforms didn't deny their state needs more housing. It might therefore seem fair to cast the debate over those reforms as a referendum on the importance of building more homes. 

But the regulatory regime that the opponents of CEQA reform sought to preserve is the byproduct of an explicitly anti-development strain of progressivism, one that reoriented Democratic politics in the 1970s.

The postwar decades' rapid economic progress yielded widespread affluence, ecological degradation, and disruptive population growth. Taken together, these forces spurred a backlash to building: Affluence led liberal reformers to see economic development as less of a priority, environmental decay prompted fears that humanity was swiftly exhausting nature's bounty, and the swift growth of booming localities led some longtime residents to fear cultural alienation or displacement.

California was ground zero for this anti-growth backlash, as historian Yoni Appelbaum notes in his recent book Stuck. The state's population quintupled between 1920 and 1970. And construction had largely kept pace, with California adding nearly 2 million units in the 1950s alone. As a result, in 1970, the median house in California cost only $197,000 in today's dollars.

But millions of new people and buildings proved socially disruptive and ecologically costly. Many Californians wished to exclude newcomers from their towns or neighborhoods, so as to preserve their access to parking, the aesthetic character of their area, or the socioeconomic composition of their schools, among other concerns. And anti-growth progressivism provided both a high-minded rationalization for such exclusion and legal tools with which to advance it.

In 1973, consumer advocate Ralph Nader and his team of researchers prepared a report on land-use policy in California. Its overriding recommendation was that the state needed to make it easier for ordinary Californians to block housing construction. As one of the report's authors explained at a California Assembly hearing, lawmakers needed to guard against both “the overdevelopment of the central cities” and “the sprawl around the cities,” while preserving open land. As Appelbaum notes, this reasoning effectively forbids building any housing, anywhere. 

The California Environmental Quality Act emerged out of this intellectual environment. And green groups animated by anti-developed fervor quickly leveraged CEQA to obstruct all manner of housing construction, thereby setting judicial precedents that expanded the law's reach. The effect has been to greatly increase the amount of time and money necessary for producing a housing unit in California. Local agencies take an average of 2.5 years to approve housing projects that require an Environmental Impact Report. Lawsuits can then tie up those projects in court for years longer. Over the past decade, CEQA litigation has delayed or blocked myriad condo towers in urban centers, the construction of new dormitories at the University of California Berkeley (on the grounds that the state's environmental impact statement failed to account for noise pollution), and even a bike lane in San Francisco. 

CEQA is by no means the primary — let alone, the only — reason why the median price of a California home exceeded $900,000 in 2023. But it is unquestionably a contributor to such scarcity-induced unaffordability. Refusing to amend the law in the face of a devastating housing shortage is a choice, one that reflects tepid concern for facilitating material abundance. 

Anti-growth politics left an especially large mark on California. But its influence is felt nationwide. CEQA is modeled after the National Environmental Policy Act, which enables the litigious to obstruct housing projects across the United States. And many blue states — including Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York — have their own state-level environmental review laws, which have also deterred housing development. 

In sum, California Democrats' decision to pare back the state's environmental review procedures, so as to facilitate more urban housing, represents a shift in the party's governing philosophy — away from a preoccupation with the harms of development and toward a greater sensitivity to the perils of stasis. Indeed, Newsom made this explicit in his remarks on the legislation, saying, “It really is about abundance.”

Democrats elsewhere should make a similar ideological adjustment.

If anti-growth progressivism helped birth CEQA's excesses, Democrats' limited appetite for intraparty conflict sustained the law's defects.

In recent years, the Yes in My Backyard (YIMBY) movement has built an activist infrastructure for pro-development reform. And their cause has been buttressed by the energetic advocacy of myriad policy wonks and commentators. One of this year's best-selling books, Abundance by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, is dedicated in no small part to making the case against California's housing policies.

Nevertheless, environmental organizations and labor unions have long boasted far greater scale and influence than “pro-abundance” groups. 

And past efforts to curtail CEQA's reach have attracted vigorous opposition from some greens and unions. Democrats typically responded by scaling back their reform ambitions to better appease those constituencies.

The hostility of green groups and the building trades to CEQA reform is as much instrumental as ideological. Some environmentalists retain the de-growth impulses that characterized the 1970s left. But environmental review lawsuits are also the stock and trade of many green organizations. CEQA litigation provides these groups with a key source of leverage over ecologically irresponsible developers and — for environmental law firms — a vital source of billings.

The building trades unions, meanwhile, see CEQA as a tool for extracting contracts from housing developers. Such groups have made a practice of pursuing CEQA lawsuits against projects until the builders behind them commit to using union labor.

For these reasons, many environmentalists and labor leaders fiercely condemned this week's CEQA reforms. At a hearing in late June, a representative of Sacramento-Sierra's Building and Construction Trades Council told lawmakers that their bill “will compel our workers to be shackled and start singing chain gang songs.”

Roughly 60 green groups published a letter condemning the legislation as a “backroom Budget Trailer Bill deal that would kill community and environmental protections, even as the people of California are faced with unprecedented federal attacks to their lives and livelihoods.”

The opposition of these organizations was understandable. But it was also misguided, even from the standpoint of protecting California's environment and aiding its construction workers.

The recently passed CEQA bills did not weaken environmental review for the development of open land, only for multifamily housing in dense urban areas. And facilitating higher rates of housing development in cities is vital for both combating climate change and conserving untouched ecosystems. All else equal, people who live in apartment buildings by mass transit have far smaller carbon footprints than those who live in suburban single-family homes. And increasing the availability of housing in urban centers reduces demand for new exurban housing development that eats into open land. 

Meanwhile, eroding regulatory obstacles to housing construction is in the interest of skilled tradespeople as a whole. A world where more housing projects are economically viable is one where there is higher demand for construction labor. This makes CEQA reform unambiguously good for the 87 percent of California construction workers who do not belong to a union (and thus, derive little direct benefit from the building trades CEQA lawsuits). But policies that grow California's construction labor force also provide its building trades unions with more opportunities to recruit new members. Recognition of that reality led California's carpenters' union to back the reforms. 

Therefore, if Democrats judged those reforms on the basis of their actual consequences — whether for labor, the environment, or the housing supply — they would conclude that the policies advanced progressive goals. On the other hand, if they judged the legislation by whether it attracted opposition from left-coded interest groups, then they might deem it a regressive challenge to liberal ideals. Too often, Democrats in California and elsewhere have taken the latter approach, effectively outsourcing their policy judgment to their favorite lobbies. But this time, the party opted to prioritize the public interest over coalitional deference.

Importantly, in doing so, California Democrats appeared to demonstrate that their party has more capacity to guide its stakeholders than many realized. In recent years, Democratic legislators have sometimes credited their questionable strategic and substantive decisions to “the groups” — as though the party were helplessly in thrall to its advocacy organizations. 

But these groups typically lack significant political leverage. Swing voters do not take their marching orders from environmental organizations. And in an era of low union density and education polarization, the leaders of individual unions often can't deliver very many votes. 

This does not mean that Democrats should turn their backs on environmentalism or organized labor. To the contrary, the party should seek to expand collective bargaining rights, reduce pollution, and promote abundant low-carbon energy. But it should do those things because they are in the interests of ordinary Americans writ large, not because the electoral influence of green groups or building trades unions politically compel them to do so. Of course, all else equal, the party should seek to deliver victories to organizations that support it. But providing such favors should not take precedence over advancing the general public's welfare. 

And pushing back on a group's demands will rarely cause it to abandon your party entirely. After seeing that Democrats would not abandon CEQA reform, California's Building Trades Council switched its position on the legislation to “neutral,” in exchange for trivial concessions. 

It is important not to overstate what California Democrats have accomplished. Housing construction in the Golden State is still constrained by restrictive zoning laws, various other land-use regulations, elevated interest rates, scarce construction labor, and a president who is hellbent on increasing the cost of lumber and steel. Combine these constraints on housing supply with the grotesque income inequalities of cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, and you get a recipe for a sustained housing crunch. CEQA reform should reduce the cost and timelines of urban homebuilding. But it will not, by itself, render California affordable.

Democrats cannot choose to eliminate all of blue America's scarcities overnight. What they can do is prize the pursuit of material abundance over the avoidance of disruptive development and intraparty strife. And California just provided the party with a model for doing precisely that.

The public tends to dislike big budget bills, and the way they're passed.

President Donald Trump is about to achieve his biggest legislative victory yet: His “big, beautiful bill” — the massive tax- and Medicaid-cutting, immigration and border spending bill passed the Senate on Tuesday — is on the verge of passing the House of Representatives.

It's a massive piece of legislation, likely to increase the national debt by at least $3 trillion, mostly through tax cuts, and leave 17 million Americans without health coverage — and it's really unpopular. Majorities in nearly every reputable poll taken this month disapprove of the bill, ranging from 42 percent who oppose the bill in an Ipsos poll (compared to 23 percent who support) to 64 percent who oppose it in a KFF poll.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

And if history is any indication, it's not going to get any better for Trump and the Republicans from here on out. 

In modern American politics, few things are more unpopular with the public than big, messy bills forged under a bright spotlight. That's especially true of bills passed through a Senate mechanism called “budget reconciliation,” a Senate procedure that allows the governing party to bypass filibuster rules with a simple majority vote. They tend to have a negative effect on presidents and their political parties in the following months as policies are implemented and campaign seasons begin.

Part of that effect is due to the public's general tendency to dislike any kind of legislation as it gets more publicity and becomes better understood. But reconciliation bills in the modern era seem to create a self-fulfilling prophecy: forcing presidents to be maximally ambitious at the outset, before they lose popular support for the legislation and eventually lose the congressional majorities that delivered passage.

The budget reconciliation process, created in 1974, has gradually been used to accomplish broader and bigger policy goals. Because it offers a workaround for a Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to break, it has become the primary way that presidents and their parties implement their economic and social welfare visions.

The public, however, doesn't tend to reward the governing party after these bills are passed. As political writer and analyst Ron Brownstein recently pointed out, presidents who successfully pass a major reconciliation bill in the first year of their presidency lose control of Congress, usually the House, the following year.

In 1982, Ronald Reagan lost his governing majority in the House after using reconciliation to pass large spending cuts as part of his Reaganomics vision (the original “big, beautiful” bill). And the pattern would repeat itself for George H.W. Bush (whose reconciliation bill contradicted his campaign promise not to raise taxes), for Bill Clinton in 1994 (deficit reductions and tax reform), for Barack Obama in 2010 (after the passage of the Affordable Care Act), for Trump in 2018 (tax cuts), and for Biden in 2022 (the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act).

The exception in this list of modern presidents is George W. Bush, who did pass a set of tax cuts in a reconciliation bill, but whose approval rating rose after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Increasing polarization, and the general anti-incumbent party energy that tends to run through midterm elections, of course, explains part of this overall popular and electoral backlash. But reconciliation bills themselves seem to intensify this effect.

First, there's the actual substance of these bills, which has been growing in scope over time.

Because they tend to be the first, and likely only, major piece of domestic legislation that can execute a president's agenda, they are often highly ideological, partisan projects that try to implement as much of a governing party's vision as possible. 

These highly ideological pieces of legislation, Matt Grossman, the director of Michigan State University's Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, and his partners have found, tend to kick into gear a “thermostatic” response from the public — that is, that public opinion moves in the opposite direction of policymaking when the public perceives one side is going too far to the right or left. 

Because these bills have actually been growing in reach, from mere tax code adjustments to massive tax-and-spend, program-creating bills, and becoming more ideological projects, the public, in turn, seems to be reacting more harshly.

These big reconciliation bills also run into an issue that afflicts all kinds of legislation: It has a PR problem. Media coverage of proposed legislation tends to emphasize its partisanship, portraying the party in power as pursuing its domestic agenda at all costs and emphasizing that parties are fighting against each other. This elevates process over policy substance. Political scientist Mary Layton Atkinson has found that just like campaign reporting is inclined to focus on the horse race, coverage of legislation in Congress and policy debates often focuses on conflict and procedure, adding to a sense in the public mind that Congress is extreme, dysfunctional, and hyperpartisan.

Adding to this dynamic is a quirk of public opinion toward legislation and referenda: Proposals tend to get less popular, and lose public support, between proposal and passage, as the public learns more about the actual content of initiatives and as they hear more about the political negotiations and struggles taking place behind the scenes as these bills are ironed out.

Lawmakers and key political figures also “tend to highlight the benefits less than the things that they are upset about in the course of negotiations,” Grossman told me. “That [also] occurs when a bill passes: You have the people who are against it saying all the terrible things about it, and actually the people who are for it are often saying, ‘I didn't get all that I wanted, I would have liked it to be slightly different.' So the message that comes out of it is actually pretty negative on the whole, because no one is out there saying this is the greatest thing and exactly what they wanted.”

Even with the current One Big Beautiful Bill, polling analysis shows that the public tends not to be very knowledgeable about what is in the legislative package, but gets even more hostile to it once they learn or are provided more information about specific policy details.

Big reconciliation bills exist at the intersection of all three of these public image problems: They tend to be the first major legislative challenge a new president and Congress take on, they suck up all the media's attention, they direct the public's attention to one major piece of legislation, and they take a pretty long time to iron out — further extending the timeline in which the bill can get more unpopular.

This worsening perception over time, the public's frustration with how the sausage is made, and the growing ideological stakes of these bills, all create a kind of feedback loop: Governing parties know that they have limited time and a single shot to implement their vision before experiencing some form of backlash in future elections, so they rush to pass the biggest and boldest bill possible. The cycle repeats itself, worsening public views in the process and increasing polarization. For now, Trump has set a July 4 deadline for signing this bill into law. He looks likely to hit that goal, or at least come close. But all signs are pointing to this “beautiful” bill delivering him and his party a big disappointment next year. He's already unpopular, and when he focuses his and the public's attention on his actual agenda, it tends not to go well.

Despite the Democratic nominee for NYC mayor being labeled a communist, his agenda actually promises something much more ideologically modest.

Last week, New York State Assembly member Zohran Mamdani sent shockwaves through the political establishment after he clinched the Democratic nomination for New York City mayor. Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, defeated a crowded field, which included former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, by double digits. Turnout was higher than usual, especially among younger voters, indicating that Mamdani's campaign energized New York City residents in ways few people expected.

Throughout his campaign, and especially since the stunning upset, Mamdani has faced attacks from both Republicans and centrist Democrats that paint him as far too extreme for New York City, let alone America. Part of that caricature is clearly fueled by racism — Mamdani is a Muslim immigrant born to Indian parents in Uganda — with Republicans sharing photos of the Statue of Liberty dressed in a burqa, saying Mamdani is uncivilized for eating with his hands, and calling for the 33-year-old candidate to be denaturalized and subsequently deported. It's also part of the backlash to Mamdani's support for Palestinian rights, as even members of his own party baselessly accuse him of peddling antisemitism.

But much of the criticism has also centered on Mamdani's campaign promises, which pledge to make New York City more affordable in small but meaningful ways with rent freezes, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses. Some of that criticism is very heated: Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, for example, called Mamdani's rent stabilization proposal “the second-best way to destroy a city, after bombing.”

Many argue that Mamdani is only offering pie-in-the-sky proposals — nice policies in an ideal world, but unachievable in our not-so-ideal reality. But Mamdani's splashy policies aren't exactly foreign ideas, nor is he the first to try to implement them. They've been tried before, often with promising results.

Let's take three of his policies that have gotten some of the most attention:

Mamdani has proposed to impose a rent freeze. That means that landlords would be unable to raise the rents on roughly 1 million rent-stabilized apartments across the city. This mostly falls within the mayor's jurisdiction: Rent hikes (or freezes) are decided by the Rent Guidelines Board, whose nine members are appointed by the mayor. And if elected mayor in November, Mamdani can appoint members to the board who pledge to freeze the rent.

As dramatic as the negative response has been, this isn't exactly a novel idea. In just the past decade — during Bill de Blasio's tenure as the city's mayor — the board froze the rent on three occasions: in 2015, 2016, and in 2020. (Those freezes, it should be noted, are hardly, if ever, blamed for worsening the city's housing problems.) Mamdani's proposal also doesn't mean that a rent freeze will be permanent. The idea is to hold rents where they are to give tenants a chance to catch up to the rising cost of living. (In Mayor Eric Adams's first three years in office, for example, the board raised the rents by a combined 9 percent.)

Opponents to this plan often point to the piles of literature that show the pitfalls of rent control in the long run — that it disincentivizes landlords to provide services and ultimately leaves apartments in disrepair. But those arguments conveniently leave out some key parts of this debate. Under New York's rent stabilization laws, landlords who invest in meaningfully improving their apartments are allowed to increase rents beyond the guidelines set by the board, meaning that landlords can't really use a rent freeze as an excuse to leave their apartments in bad conditions.

More than that, Mamdani's plan for a rent freeze doesn't exist in a vacuum; it's part of a broader plan to spur investment in housing and improve renters' lives, which include changing zoning laws, cutting red tape to get more housing built more quickly across the city, and cracking down on crooked landlords by more strictly and efficiently enforcing New York's housing codes.

Put another way, Mamdani's rent freeze is not presented as the solution to New York's housing crisis. It's just one part of a bigger toolkit that can help tenants in the near term while the other tools finally put housing costs under control in the long run.

Mamdani's suggestion of city-owned grocery stores has irked some entrepreneurs to the point that one supermarket mogul threatened to close down all of his stores if Mamdani becomes mayor. The rationale behind this proposal is that a publicly owned grocery store would make food more affordable. The store wouldn't have to worry about making a profit or paying rent, and those savings would be passed onto consumers by lowering the price of goods. 

Realistically, this is unlikely to have a significant impact on grocery prices across the city — after all, grocery stores famously run on very slim profit margins to begin with. But Mamdani's plan is also a means to address some of the city's food deserts, where there aren't enough grocery stores to serve residents. (While some argue that New York City doesn't really have food deserts, the reality is that it's hard to argue that residents have equal access to healthy and fresh foods across the city.)

Some of Mamdani's critics have seized on this plan to call him a communist who would put private businesses and consumer choice at risk. The government, they argue, shouldn't be operating businesses because governments are an inefficient alternative to the private market. The reality is that public-owned stores aren't exactly new, let alone a threat. Several states, from Alabama to Virginia, have publicly owned liquor stores — a product of the post-prohibition period where states took more control over the sale and distribution of alcohol — and boast of their success. (Virginia's government website, for example, notes its state-owned liquor stores' “history of giving back to Virginians” and highlights that it has generated more than $1 billion in revenue for six consecutive years.) 

Other cities across the country are also trying their hand at publicly owned grocery stores. In St. Paul, Kansas, for example, the municipality-owned grocery store helped end the city's nearly two-decade run without a grocery store. In Madison, Wisconsin, a municipally owned grocery store is set to open later this summer, and other cities, including Chicago and Atlanta, are planning to dabble in this experiment as well.

Mamdani's proposal for publicly owned grocery stores is also far more rational and modest than the state-monopoly model of liquor stores: He's merely proposing a pilot program of just five city-owned grocery stores — one in each borough — in a sea of some 15,000 privately owned grocery stores. If the pilot program succeeds and satisfies New Yorkers' needs, then it could be expanded.

One of Mamdani's signature wins as a New York State Assembly member was his push for a fare-free bus pilot on five lines in New York City. As mayor, he promises to expand fare-free buses across the city to make public transit more accessible. It's also good environmental policy that helps alleviate traffic because it encourages people to ditch their cars and ride the bus instead. 

Fare-free transit experiments in various cities have already shown promising results. In Boston, a fare-free bus pilot after the pandemic found that bus lines without fares recovered ridership much faster than the rest of the transit system. A year-and-a-half after the initial Covid lockdowns — when transit ridership cratered across the country — one fare-free bus line in Boston saw ridership bounce back to 92 percent of pre-pandemic levels, while the rest of the city's transit system was stuck near 50 percent.

According to an article by Mamdani and his colleague in the state legislature, in New York City, the lines included in the fare-free bus pilot showed an increase in ridership across the board, and of the new riders those lines lured, the highest share was among people making less than $28,000 a year. 

Of course, fare-free transit should be a secondary goal. After all, what good is a free fare if the buses won't get you to where you need to go, let alone get you there in time? But Mamdani's plan makes clear that he's not just interested in making transit free, but fast and reliable as well. 

His fare-free proposal is packaged with a commitment to invest in improving infrastructure — like building more dedicated lanes — to make bus trips more efficient. There are plenty of avenues to raise revenue for that kind of investment, from imposing a new tax to introducing schemes like congestion pricing, as New York already has. Plus, if making buses free makes people more likely to get out of cars and ride public transit instead, then that is a worthwhile investment.

Ultimately, Mamdani's policies also proved to be good politics, at least good enough for a Democratic primary. Part of the reason Mamdani's policies might have resonated with so many voters is that they are, in many ways, a promise to reshape government — not into a communist haven on the Hudson, but into a government that owns up to its responsibility to provide all of its people with a dignified life. 

That's why ideas like fare-free transit aren't solely about saving $2.90 on a bus ride. It's true that there are plenty of reasonable arguments against fare-free transit: Eliminating fares would get rid of a reliable source of revenue for transit agencies. Solely relying on taxes to fund public transportation potentially makes transit systems more volatile and susceptible to politics, where they can be used as a bargaining chip in the legislature's tax bills. And there are other ways to make transit affordable to those in need, including existing subsidies that reduce fares for low-income commuters. 

But these arguments miss the broader appeal of agendas like Mamdani's, which are a commitment to expand the government's role in our daily lives in positive ways. Despite the depiction of Mamdani as a radical socialist, his agenda, at its core, actually promises something much more ideologically modest: making government more likable by making it work well. So his overarching goal as mayor, it seems, would be to make people believe that effective governance is possible — that local government can tangibly improve the quality of life in a city by being more present and, not to mention, pleasant to deal with. 

This is not to say that Mamdani's primary win will reshape American politics — or even Democratic primaries in other cities. But Mamdani is onto something, and Democrats might be well-served by looking at his not-so-radical agenda and understanding that people want more from their own governments. Mamdani's ideas, like publicly owned grocery stores, might not always be the answer voters are looking for, but the dignity underlying his whole agenda is.

July Fourth is a cacophony of dietary chaos.

Eating a hot dog on July Fourth isn't just traditional. It's patriotic. 

From iconic red, white, and blue rocket pops (hello, Red Dye 40!) to nitrate-loaded hot dogs and the all-day parade of sugary drinks and alcohol, this quintessential American holiday is a celebration of freedom — and, often, dietary chaos.

And yet these days, many of us seem to be having second thoughts about the American diet. Our food is too processed, too loaded with dyes and preservatives. The country's obesity and diabetes epidemics, which have led to an explosion in the diagnoses of related chronic health conditions, have put the issue front and center, with much of the blame being placed on what we eat and all of the additives and preservatives it contains. About half of US adults believe food additives and chemicals are a large or moderate risk to their health — higher than the perceived risks of infectious disease outbreaks or climate change, according to a recent poll from Ipsos, a global market research firm.

We all worry about microplastics, nitrates, food dyes, and ultra-processed foods. And US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made improving Americans' diets and our food supply a top priority. It's a policy emphasis that's popular with the public: Two-thirds of US adults believe artificial dyes and pesticides make our foods unsafe to eat — and these are opinions that transcend political leanings, according to Ipsos.

And regardless of our entrenched food system, people are trying to make healthier decisions in their daily lives: 64 percent of US adults say they pay more attention to food labels than they did five years ago, according to the public health nonprofit NSF International. But we are frustrated: Only 16 percent of Americans say they find claims on food labels trustworthy. 

It may sound unbelievable on a holiday when Americans will gladly stuff their faces with ultra-processed junk while wearing flag-laden paraphernalia, but these days, many of us actually wish the products in our grocery stores looked a little more like the ones across the Atlantic. Just 37 percent of American adults said in the NSF International survey that our food labeling was better than in other countries. Most Americans say they want changes to how foods at our grocery stores are labeled. 

American food really is different from what can be found in Europe, both in its substance and in its packaging. 

But while we're probably not doing any favors to our health by consuming ultra-processed foods loaded with artificial ingredients that are banned elsewhere, the biggest source of our health woes isn't necessarily these artificial dyes and preservatives. It's the cholesterol and saturated fat in that hot dog, the sugar in that lemonade, and those ultra-processed potato chips. Americans consume about twice as much sugar as other rich countries do on average, eat more ultra-processed foods, and consume more trans and saturated fats than Europeans. We also eat enormous portions, and calories, no matter where they come from, are a big part of the problem.

Americans are generally in poorer health than our peers in Europe, and US life expectancy continues to trail behind other wealthy countries. Rich Americans actually fare worse than poor Europeans, according to one study. 

A new era of American greatness starts at the picnic table this July Fourth. Yes, we ostensibly rebelled against an English monarchy in order to be able to do whatever we want, even eat whatever we want. But if we want to catch up to our European rivals again in how healthy we feel, how productive we are, and how long we live — we need to take a closer look at the stuff we're putting in our bodies.

Doctors widely agree that ultra-processed foods and food additives are bad for children's health. Yet they have become more and more readily available over the decades: One 2023 study found 60 percent of the food that Americans buy has additives, a 10 percent increase since 2001. 

Kennedy, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, the country's top health agency, has made overhauling US food production a top priority. His department's recent Make America Healthy Again report highlights steps taken by other countries, including France and the Nordic countries, to discourage people through their dietary guidelines from eating ultra-processed foods. The report lists several additives and artificial ingredients that are permitted in American food but are banned or heavily restricted across the pond. Kennedy suggests that the US should follow suit.

So where might we begin?

Let's start with Red Dye 40, the color additive found in foods such as Froot Loops and M&Ms that has been linked to hyperactivity in children and, according to some animal studies, has been shown to accelerate tumor growth in mice. The US has not placed any special requirements on Red Dye 40, aside from its listing alongside other ingredients. But the European Union has required a clear warning label on any food with the dye, and some countries (including Germany, France, and Denmark) have banned it outright. A similar warning could be adopted here.

There are other additives casually lurking in American foods that have been restricted in other countries. Here are a few:

There are some artificial sweeteners, too — aspartame, sucralose, and saccharin — that are permitted in the US and the EU, but generally, Europe puts many more restrictions on unhealthy artificial ingredients than the US does.

Kennedy is pledging he'll do something about it. His biggest win so far is securing voluntary commitments from food manufacturers to remove a variety of artificial dyes — yes, including Red Dye 40 — from their products before the end of 2026. If they fail to comply, he has suggested new regulations to put a limit on or outright prohibit certain substances of concern.

But are these ingredients the most important problem with our July Fourth cookouts? They are part of the issue. But there's more to it.

Here's a revealing comparison: In 2018, the United States banned trans fats, an artificial ingredient derived from oils that has been linked to heart disease and diabetes — 15 years after Denmark did the same thing. For more than a decade, Americans kept eating a ton of trans fat — something that is so bad for you that it can simultaneously increase bad cholesterol while lowering good cholesterol. 

While that is probably not the entire reason that the US has double the obesity and diabetes rates as Denmark does, it is a telling example. A fatty and highly processed ingredient that is linked to two of the biggest health problems in the United States persisted for years in American food, long after the Europeans had wised up.

It's a pattern that, across the decades, explains the enormous gulf between the typical American's diet and the Mediterranean diet that dominates much of Europe. During the 20th century, amid an explosion in market-driven consumerism, convenience became one of the most important factors for grocery shoppers. Americans wanted more meals that could be quickly prepared inside the microwave and dry goods that could last for weeks and months on a pantry shelf, and so these products gained more and more of a market share. But that meant that more American food products were laced with more of the preservatives and additives that are now drawing so much concern. 

Americans have also always eaten more meat, cheese, and butter, animal products high in saturated fats as opposed to the unsaturated fats that come from oils like olive oil and are more common in European diets, for years. Our meat obsession was turbocharged by a meat industry that tapped into patriotic sentiments about pioneering farms making their living off the frontier. Eating a diet with more animal products is associated with a long list of health problems, particularly the cardiovascular conditions that remain the biggest killers of Americans.

We should push our policymakers to pass regulations that get rid of artificial additives, but that alone is insufficient. You can find too much fat and too much sugar around the picnic table. Some of it is unnatural, but plenty of it is natural. America has to figure out how to encourage people to eat low-fat, low-sugar, whole-food diets. That's the real path to better health.

MAHA has some good ideas. Its emphasis on whole foods, not processed ones, is a step in the right direction. But Kennedy's prescriptions are contradictory: He wants to make it easier for people to find whole foods at their nearby store, while Republicans in Congress propose massive cuts to food stamps. Kennedy's MAHA report rails against the overuse of pesticides, but Trump's Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back restrictions on their use. 

Those contradictions are a reminder that, though Kennedy has shone a light on a worthwhile issue, we can't and we shouldn't expect the government to fix our food problems all on its own. This is America, after all, where we pride ourselves on individualism.

The occasional indulgence is not a big deal. It's what we do on July 5 that really matters.

It's okay to hate AI's encroachment into work. Learn to use it anyway.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

ChatGPT's most advanced models recently served me a surprising statistic: US productivity grew faster in 2024 than in any year since the 1960s. Half that jump can be linked to generative AI tools that most workers hadn't even heard of two years earlier. 

The only problem is that it's not true. The AI made it up.

Despite its much-documented fallibility, generative AI has become a huge part of many people's jobs, including my own. The numbers vary from survey to survey, but a June Gallup poll found that 42 percent of American employees are using AI a few times a year, while 19 percent report deploying it several times a week. The technology is especially popular with white-collar workers. While just 9 percent of manufacturing and front-line workers use AI on a regular basis, 27 percent of white-collar workers do. 

Even as many people integrate AI into their daily lives, it's causing mass job anxiety: A February Pew survey found that more than half of US employees worried about their fate at work. 

Unfortunately, there is no magic trick to keep your job for the foreseeable future, especially if you're a white-collar worker. Nobody knows what's going to happen with AI, and leadership at many companies is responding to this uncertainty by firing workers it may or may not need in an AI-forward future. 

“If AI really is this era's steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it.”

After laying off over 6,000 workers in May and June, Microsoft is laying off 9,000 more workers this month, reportedly so the company can reduce the number of middle managers as it reorganizes itself around AI. In a note on Tuesday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that the company would “roll out more generative AI and agents” and reduce its workforce in the next few years. This was all after Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned AI would wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the same timespan, a prediction so grim that Axios coined a new term for AI's imminent takeover: “a white-collar bloodbath.”

This is particularly frustrating because, as my recent encounter with ChatGPT's tendency to hallucinate makes clear, the generative AI of today, while useful for a growing number of people, needs humans to work well. So does agentic AI, the next era of this technology that involves AI agents using computers and performing tasks on your behalf rather than simply generating content. For now, AI is augmenting white-collar jobs, not automating them, although your company's CEO is probably planning for the latter scenario. 

Maybe one day AI will fulfill its promise of getting rid of grunt work and creating endless abundance, but getting from here to there is a harrowing proposition.

“With every other form of innovation, we ended up with more jobs in the end,” Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor and author of the newsletter One Useful Thing, told me. “But living through the Industrial Revolution still kind of sucked, right? There were still anarchists in the street and mass displacement from cities and towns.”

We don't know if the transition to the AI future will be quite as calamitous. What we do know is that just as jobs transformed due to past technological leaps, like the introduction of the personal computer or the internet, your day-to-day at work will change in the months and years to come. If AI really is this era's steam engine, a force so transformative that it will power a new Industrial Revolution, you only stand to gain by getting good at it. 

At the same time, becoming an AI whiz will not necessarily save you if your company decides it's time to go all in on AI and do mass, scattershot layoffs in order to give its shareholders the impression of some efficiency gains. If you're impacted, that's just bad luck. Still, having the skills can't hurt.

It's okay to be scared of AI, but it's more reasonable to be confused by it. For two years after ChatGPT's explosive release, I couldn't quite figure out how a chatbot could make my life better. After some urging from Mollick late last year, I forced myself to start using it for menial chores. Upgrading to more advanced models of ChatGPT and Claude turned these tools into indispensable research partners that I use every day — not just to do my job faster but also better. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.) 

But when it comes to generative AI tools and the burgeoning class of AI agents, what works for one person might not be helpful to the next.

“Workers obviously need to try to ascertain as much as they can — the skills that are most flexible and most useful,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. “They need to be familiar with the technology because it is going to be pervasive.” 

For most white-collar workers, I recommend Mollick's 10-hour rule: Spend 10 hours using AI for work and see what you learn. Mollick also recently published an updated guide to the latest AI tools that's worth reading in full. The big takeaways are that the best of these tools (ChatGPT from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, and Google Gemini) can become tireless assistants with limitless knowledge that can save you hours of labor. You should try different models within the different AI tools, and you should experiment with the voice features, including the ability to use your phone's camera to share what you're seeing with the AI. You should also, unfortunately, shell out $20 a month to get access to the most advanced models. In Mollick's words, “The free versions are demos, not tools.”

“If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that's being done repetitively, that's where the most risk comes in.”

You can imagine similar advice coming from your geeky uncle at Thanksgiving circa 1984, when personal computers were on the brink of taking over the world. That was the year roughly the same percentage of white-collar workers were regularly using PCs at work as are using AI today. But the coming AI transition will look different than the PC transition we've already lived through. While earlier digital technologies hit frontline workers hardest, “AI excels at supporting or carrying out the highly cognitive, nonroutine tasks that better-educated, better-paid office workers do,” according to a February Brookings report co-authored by Muro. 

This means AI can do a lot of the tasks that software engineers, architects, lawyers, and journalists do, but it doesn't mean that AI can do their jobs — a key distinction. This is why you hear more experts talking about AI augmentation rather than AI automation. As a journalist, I can confidently say that AI is great at streamlining my research process, saving me time, and sometimes even stirring up new ideas. AI is terrible at interviewing sources, although that might not always be the case. And clearly, it's touch-and-go when it comes to writing factually accurate copy, which is kind of a fundamental part of the job.

That proposition looks different for other kinds of white-collar work, namely administrative and operational support jobs. A Brookings report last year found that 100 percent of the tasks that bookkeepers and clerks do were likely to be automated. Those of travel agents, tax preparers, and administrative assistants were close to 100 percent. If AI really did make these workers redundant, it would add up to millions of jobs lost. 

“The thing I'd be most worried about is if my task and job are very similar to each other,” Mollick, the Wharton professor, explained. “If I have a very narrow job around a very narrow task that's being done repetitively, that's where the most risk comes in.”

It's hard to AI-proof your job or career altogether given so much uncertainty. We don't know if companies will take advantage of this transition in ways that produce better products and happier workers or just use it as an excuse to fire people, squandering what some believe is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform work and productivity. It sucks to feel like you have little agency in steering the future toward one outcome or the other.

At the risk of sounding like your geeky uncle, I say give AI a try. The worst-case scenario is you spend 10 hours talking to an artificially intelligent chatbot rather than scrolling through Instagram or Reddit. The best-case scenario is you develop a new skill set, one that could very well set you up to do an entirely new kind of job, one that didn't even exist before the AI era. You might even have a little fun along the way.

President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is the centerpiece of his legislative agenda, and the stakes are high.

The bill has four major pillars: renewing his 2017 tax cuts, implementing new tax cuts, spending billions on a border wall, US Customs and Border Protection, and the military, and increasing the debt ceiling. The bill itself is a smorgasbord of policy and could also affect clean energy programs, student loans, and food assistance, but perhaps the most consequential changes will be to Medicaid.

The bill was approved by the House in May and passed a key Senate vote on Saturday. Republicans are divided over competing priorities; some want to extend Trump's tax cuts and boost immigration and defense spending, while others worry about the $2.6 trillion cost and cuts to Medicaid. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the bill by Friday using budget reconciliation, but it's unclear if all 53 Republican senators will agree.

This is a developing story. Follow along here for the latest news, explainers, and analysis.

Christian Paz

President Donald Trump is about to achieve his biggest legislative victory yet: His “big, beautiful bill” — the massive tax- and Medicaid-cutting, immigration and border spending bill passed the Senate on Tuesday — is on the verge of passing the House of Representatives.

It's a massive piece of legislation, likely to increase the national debt by at least $3 trillion, mostly through tax cuts, and leave 17 million Americans without health coverage — and it's really unpopular. Majorities in nearly every reputable poll taken this month disapprove of the bill, ranging from 42 percent who oppose the bill in an Ipsos poll (compared to 23 percent who support) to 64 percent who oppose it in a KFF poll.

The first solar cell ever made was built in the United States. Tesla, based in the US, was once the largest EV manufacturer in the world. The lithium-ion battery was codeveloped in the US.

But today, China — not the US — is the largest manufacturer of solar cells and batteries. China's BYD — not Tesla — is the largest EV manufacturer in the world. And China is starting to outrun the US on research and development investment. 

Dylan Matthews

To hear many smart AI observers tell it, the day of Wednesday, June 25, 2025, represented the moment when Congress started to take the possibility of advanced AI seriously.

The occasion was a hearing of Congress's “we're worried about China” committee (or, more formally, the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party) focused on the US-China AI competition. Members of both parties used the event to express concern that was surprisingly strident and detailed about the near-term risks posed by artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even artificial superintelligence (ASI).

Dylan Scott

Senate Republicans have passed President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” a move that will make major changes to Medicaid through establishing a work requirement for the first time and restricting states' ability to finance their share of the program's costs. If the bill ultimately becomes law after passing the House and receiving Trump's signature — which could all happen before Friday — American health care is never going to be the same.

The consequences will be dire. 

Andrew Prokop

Republicans are barreling ahead to try to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” — legislation that somehow manages to combine massive fiscal irresponsibility with devastating spending cuts.

The bill would keep the “Trump tax cuts” originally passed in 2017 in place, while adding some new tax breaks and new spending on immigration enforcement and the military.

Nicole Narea

Three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republicans in Congress are poised to further erode access to abortion and reproductive care.

President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” would not only directly threaten reproductive care by defunding Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, it would also incentivize insurers for Affordable Care Act plans in some states to drop abortion coverage or make it significantly more expensive.

Eric Levitz

The Republican Party's saving grace is supposed to be its commitment to economic growth and consumer abundance. 

Sure, the GOP may see unemployed cancer patients as shiftless mooches — and the Lorax as literature's greatest villain — but for precisely those reasons, Republicans are allegedly able stewards of industrial development: Unconstrained by concerns about inequality, the environment, or social justice, the GOP will unleash the private sector's productive potential. Republicans won't balance Americans' hunger for cheap gasoline against their enlightened interest in cleaner air or a cooler planet — they'll get you the cheap fuel now. And they won't weigh America's stake in technological supremacy against the risks of unregulated innovation — they'll give cutting-edge companies whatever they need to achieve global dominance. 

Dylan Scott

While public attention has largely been focused on the Middle East and on President Donald Trump's immigration policy, Republicans in Congress are on the verge of passing massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance benefits and, according to one recent estimate, thousands of unnecessary deaths every year.

While the GOP's so-called “big, beautiful” bill is a smorgasbord of policy — potentially including everything from blocking AI regulation to restricting the power of the federal courts — perhaps the most consequential changes would be to Medicaid. The program, which covers low-income Americans of all ages, is now the country's single largest insurer, covering more than 70 million people. The legislation approved by House Republicans, which is now being debated and amended by the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. The upshot is that 10.3 million fewer people would be enrolled in the program by 2034.

Sean Illing

For more than half a century, the American right has preached the virtues of free markets and low taxes and deregulation. But a new wave of conservative thinkers are now arguing that Republicans have been wrong — or at the very least misguided — about the economy. 

This new economic thinking represents a break from what we've come to expect from the American right. Its proponents argue for a new strain of economic populism, one that departs from the GOP's past allegiance to big business and focuses instead on the working class. 

Nicole Narea

The fight over President Donald Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill is turning ugly.

After passing the GOP-controlled House, the bill has moved to the Senate, where Republicans are facing a bitter divide over how to balance their competing priorities.

Abdallah Fayyad

If the “big, beautiful bill,” President Donald Trump's signature legislative priority, eventually becomes law, it would gut some social programs that many people rely on. As my colleague Dylan Scott wrote in a thorough explainer, the package, which House Republicans passed last month, could result in millions of people losing their health care because of proposed work requirements on Medicaid.

There's also another part of the bill that really stands out when it comes to how Trump's domestic policy package will hurt low-income families: its overhaul of student loan programs. From changing eligibility requirements for Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college, to capping how much money students can borrow to cover the cost of tuition, the legislation would put a college education further out of reach for many Americans.

To pass a law in the United States, you need to jump through a lot of hurdles. 

A bill has to first clear a committee in the House or Senate. (In the case of Republicans' tax legislation this year, its components had to clear 11 different committees.) The House Rules Committee has to agree for it to come to the floor for a vote. It has to pass that vote. In the Senate, it has to get 60 votes to beat a potential filibuster, or else obey a set of byzantine rules allowing it to pass with a simple majority.

Welcome to The Logoff: President Donald Trump is one step closer to getting his “big, beautiful bill” after it passed the House in a close vote early this morning.

Andrew Prokop

Editor's note, May 22, 8:30 am ET: The House passed a version of Trump's bill early Thursday morning. It now goes to the Senate, where Republicans say they want more changes to the bill. This story was originally published on Monday.

President Donald Trump's second term has so far been dominated by his aggressive use of executive power — but now, he's finally trying to get something through Congress.

Li Zhou

With President Donald Trump's second administration just weeks away, congressional Republicans are gearing up to execute on a wide-ranging legislative agenda touching on everything from taxes to immigration to fossil fuels. In a Monday interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump noted that his preference for doing so was “one big, beautiful bill,” but said he'd be open to two. 

To accomplish that, Republicans intend to use a process known as budget reconciliation, which allows them to approve budget-related legislation with a simple majority in the Senate. Doing so enables them to bypass filibuster rules, which would otherwise require a bill to garner 60 votes to advance in the upper chamber. (In this case, with the Senate divided 53-47 in favor of Republicans, passing a bill through normal order would also require Democratic votes.)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Microsoft plans to replace many of the salespeople it laid off with more technical roles to compete with OpenAI, Google","https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-plans-to-replace-laid-off-salespeople-with-technical-roles-2025-7","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Microsoft's latest round of layoffs come as the company revises its strategy for selling artificial intelligence tools amid increasing competition from OpenAI and Google, according to sources familiar with the plans and internal documents.

The company's recent job cuts included thousands of salespeople, the people said, and largely targeted traditional salespeople that the company intends to replace with more technical salespeople to better sell AI tools.

Microsoft on July 2 said it plans to lay off less than 4% of its workforce, which would be around 9,000 people. The company typically makes changes to its workforce around this time of year as July 1 marks a new fiscal year, but this year's layoffs are significant as the company cuts costs to make up for massive spending on AI.

Microsoft plans to replace many traditional salespeople, often called ""specialists"" internally, with ""solutions engineers"" who can show customers actual demos earlier on in the sales process, the people said.

Microsoft confirmed the company is replacing some specialist roles with solutions engineers to increase the technical and industry understanding among its salesforce, and plans to hire more salespeople outside its headquarters to get more sellers out in the field.

The company has received feedback from customers that they had to engage with too many salespeople before getting down to the technical details and demos. ""The customer wants Microsoft to bring their technical people in front of them quickly,"" one of the people said. ""We need someone who is more technical, much earlier in the cycle.""

The changes come as Microsoft faces increasing competition for enterprise customers in AI. Microsoft has an advantage in that many large companies already use its other tools, but many of those companies' employees want the more well-known ChatGPT.

The sales cuts are tied to a plan to simplify how Microsoft sells AI, detailed internally earlier this year.

In a memo to the sales organization the day before the layoffs were announced, Microsoft sales chief Judson Althoff laid out a vision to revamp the organization.

Althoff called for ""continued agility"" and ""reinventing Microsoft and MCAPS"" to become ""the Frontier AI Firm,"" and outlined the five priorities of the sales organization, including to ""establish a Copilot on every device and across every role.""

Althoff also internally unveiled plans in April to slash the number of the sales team's ""solutions areas"" by half during the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. BI obtained copies of slides from his presentation.

Microsoft previously had six solutions areas: Modern work, Business Applications, Digital & App Innovation, Data & AI, Azure Infrastructure, and Security. Beginning July 1, these areas were set to be combined into three: AI Business Solutions, Cloud & AI Platforms, and Security, according to those slides.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Leaked docs show how Meta is training its chatbots to message you first, remember your chats, and keep you talking","https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-studio-chatbot-training-proactive-leaked-documents-alignerr-2025-7","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 05:22:00 GMT","

It's the AI equivalent of a double text.

Business Insider has learned Meta is training customizable chatbots to be more proactive and message users unprompted to follow up on past conversations.

It may not cure what Mark Zuckerberg calls the ""loneliness epidemic,"" but Meta hopes it will help keep users coming back to its AI Studio platform, documents obtained by BI reveal.

The goal of the training project, known internally to data labeling firm Alignerr as ""Project Omni,"" is to ""provide value for users and ultimately help to improve re-engagement and user retention,"" the guidelines say.

Meta told BI that the proactive feature is intended for bots made on Meta's AI Studio, which can be accessed on its own standalone platform or through Instagram. AI Studio first rolled out in summer 2024 as a no-code platform where anyone can build custom chatbots and digital personas with unique personalities and memories.

The guidelines from Alignerr lay out how one example persona, dubbed ""The Maestro of Movie Magic,"" would send a proactive message:

""I hope you're having a harmonious day! I wanted to check in and see if you've discovered any new favorite soundtracks or composers recently. Or perhaps you'd like some recommendations for your next movie night? Let me know, and I'll be happy to help!""

""Like many companies, we're testing follow-up messaging with AIs in Meta's AI Studio,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to BI. ""After you initiate a conversation, AIs in Meta AI Studio can follow up with you to share ideas or ask additional questions. This allows you to continue exploring topics of interest and engage in more meaningful conversations with the AIs across our apps.""

Alignerr did not respond to a request for comment.

Users can create highly personal chatbots, like a chef that suggests recipes or an interior designer that gives decor advice. For creators and influencers, the bots can handle fan interactions and respond to messages across Meta's platforms.

Meta's spokesperson added that the AI will only send a follow-up message after a user initiates a conversation, and it will not continue to contact the user if there's no response to that first follow-up. The window for any follow-up message is capped at 14 days after the initial user message. To be eligible for proactive follow-up, a user must have sent at least five messages to the chatbot in the last 14 days.

The bots made on AI Studio can be kept private for personal use or shared through stories, direct links, and even displayed on a user's Facebook or Instagram profile, the Meta AI Studio website says.

Making the bots more proactive aligns with Zuckerberg's ambitions for AI at Meta. On recent podcasts, the Meta CEO has said the average American now has fewer than three close friends and that digital agents could help fill the gap.

There's also a business reason for friendlier, proactive bots. Retention is key for generative AI companies with user-facing chatbots, and the longer users spend with a chatbot, the more valuable those interactions become, similar to engagement on social media. According to court documents that were unsealed in April, Meta predicted that its generative AI products would rake in $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue in 2025.

Some features described in Alignerr's training guidelines are already being quietly tested, while others appear to be in early rollout or pilot stages. Meta did not specify which features are live to BI.

The proactive features are similar to those of Character.AI, a startup that launched a service in 2022 that lets users create and interact with their favorite AI-powered characters or celebrities.

Using an internal Meta review tool called SRT, freelancers simulate extended conversations with the bots, rate proactive follow-up messages, and sometimes rewrite text that falls short of Meta's guidelines, two Alignerr contractors told BI.

A freelancer based in India who worked on Omni told BI it's “a long-term project” with a focus on making Meta's AI feel more personal and context-aware. “They're very focused on personalizing information — how the AI chatbot interacts based on conversation history,” the contractor said.

“Each agent had a specific description, so you had to tailor each task to fit that persona. Again, it's all about attention to detail,” the freelancer said. Personas could range from a doctor to a Gen Z hip-hop commentator.

Bots are expected to reference details from earlier chats, maintain their assigned persona, and keep the interaction on-topic.

Each message should align with the AI's personality, match the previous context of the conversation, and ""provide positive experiences,"" while explicitly avoiding anything Meta deems sensitive or harmful content.

The best messages, according to the training document, reference something concrete from the user's past conversations.

According to the training documents, all proactive messages must comply with Meta's broader Content and Responsibility Standards, avoiding controversy, misinformation, or emotionally heavy topics — unless the user brings them up first.

Meta may be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to lure top AI talent from rivals. But how much is it paying its broader workforce of software engineers, product managers, and user experience researchers?

Thanks to data from federal filings, we now have a window into the company's salary ranges during a heated moment in Silicon Valley's talent wars.

Software engineers at Meta can make up to $480,000. Machine learning roles go as high as $440,000. Even product designers and researchers routinely top $200,000.

The numbers come from filings that companies must submit to the Labor Department when hiring foreign workers through the H-1B visa program, which allows them to bring in 85,000 specialized workers annually through a lottery system. Because tech companies typically guard their compensation details closely, these government-mandated disclosures provide a peek into actual pay scales.

The numbers reflect only annual salaries, excluding the stock options, signing bonuses, and other perks that can often double or triple total compensation packages.

The data comes amid intense competition for AI talent in Silicon Valley. Meta is reported to be offering some AI researchers compensation packages worth up to $300 million over four years as it builds out a new Superintelligence lab.A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.

The frenzy extends beyond tech giants. Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI's former chief technology officer, Mira Murati, is paying technical staff base salaries of up to $500,000 before the company has launched a single product, Business Insider reported earlier this week.

The battle has gotten personal. After Meta lured away seven OpenAI researchers, including Trapit Bansal, a cocreator of the company's o1 reasoning model, OpenAI's chief research officer, Mark Chen, said in an internal memo that it felt like ""someone has broken into our home.""

Here's what Meta is paying across key roles, based on H-1B filings from the first quarter of 2025.

From taxes to student loan forgiveness, provisions in President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" are one step closer to affecting Americans' wallets.

Earlier this week, the Senate narrowly passed its version of Trump's expansive domestic agenda that would extend the president's 2017 tax cuts and make key changes to the tax system, along with implementing significant changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Now, House Republicans have to plot a way forward. They could accept the Senate's changes to the legislation and send it to Trump's desk, or make additional tweaks of their own. Trump has pressured Congress to pass the bill by the Fourth of July, adding a deadline to the debate.

Beyond the effects on Americans' wallets, the legislation provides roughly $150 billion to ramp up immigration enforcement.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the bill would add at least $3.3 trillion to the US deficit. In May, Moody's Analytics downgraded the US's credit rating, citing rising federal debt. It said an extension of Trump's 2017 taxes could add $4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. This could lead to higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, and more down the road.

Here are four other key ways the tax bill could affect Americans' finances.

Many of Trump's campaign promises are included in the tax bill.

The legislation would eliminate taxes on tips and overtime wages. About two-thirds of tipped workers earn enough to owe federal income tax. After a final bill is signed, the Trump administration is expected to release a list of qualifying occupations.

The Senate bill includes a $6,000 tax deduction for older people making less than $75,000 a year ($150,000 for couples). Seniors making above that threshold would see a decreasing deduction until hitting a cap of $175,000 ($250,000 for couples). Lower-income seniors are unlikely to benefit from the deduction. The provision is how lawmakers are trying to fulfill Trump's promise to end taxes on Social Security payments. The deduction would run through 2028.

Another provision would permanently raise the child tax credit to $2,200. Additionally, it would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits after September. It also proposes ending tax credits for homeowners to install solar panels or energy-efficient heat pumps and incentives for new energy-efficient homes and home weatherization projects by the end of this year.

The bill would also make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and increase the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, to $40,000 from $10,000 in 2025, increase it to $40,400 in 2026, and increase it an additional 1% every year through 2029 before reverting to $10,000 in 2030. Lifting the SALT cap allows wealthy taxpayers in states and cities with high taxes to claim a bigger federal deduction, and the cap is something some Republican lawmakers have sought to raise or eliminate.

Under the Senate bill, millions of student loan borrowers would see their repayment options change. The legislation proposes eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two options: the Repayment Assistance Plan and a standard repayment plan.

The Repayment Assistance Plan would allow for loan forgiveness after 360 qualifying payments based on the borrowers' income, while the standard repayment plan would require a fixed monthly payment over a period set by the servicer.

The bill also would repeal President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, an income-driven repayment plan that promised cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline for debt relief. The plan is blocked in court pending a final legal decision.

If the bill passes, parents could get extra money for their kids down the line. The tax bill includes a ""Trump account,"" previously called a ""money account for growth and advancement,"" or MAGA account. The government would put $1,000 into accounts for babies born after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2029. The baby would be required to have been born in the US and have a Social Security number to receive the cash. The money would need to be invested in a qualified index fund and can't be touched until the child turns 18. Parents and others could contribute up to $5,000 a year to each account.

The accounts would have tax incentives; earnings would be tax-deferred, meaning taxes on the accounts would not need to be paid right away. Withdrawals from the accounts would also be taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate, which is dependent on income and typically lower than the regular income tax rate.

Lower-income Americans could face bigger healthcare costs or lose federal assistance benefits. The tax bill would mean significant changes for the millions who rely on Medicaid and SNAP. The legislation would mandate that states implement an 80-hour-a-month work requirement by the end of 2026 for childless adults on Medicaid without a disability.

The Congressional Budget Office previously estimated that work requirements on Medicaid could strip coverage from over 8 million Americans over the next decade.

Additionally, the bill would extend the age range of adults subject to work requirements to receive SNAP to include adults ages 55 to 64. Currently, adults ages 18 to 54 without children can receive SNAP benefits only if they work at least 20 hours a week.

Trump's Tariffs:

Vietnam's trade deal with the US is a wake-up call for Asian governments grappling with the reality that higher tariffs are here to stay.

US President Donald Trump announced a 20% tariff on imports from Vietnam, and a 40% rate for goods transshipped through the country — a move mostly targeted at curbing Vietnam's trade with China. In return, Vietnam is slashing import taxes on US goods to zero.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Trump's Tariffs:

President Donald Trump's new trade deal with Vietnam sends a clear signal about where US tariffs on Chinese goods might ultimately land, as talks between Washington and Beijing continue following their recent truce. 

Chinese goods currently face tariffs of around 55%, a level expected to remain through August. But under the latest Vietnam agreement, the US will slap a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports to the US and a steeper 40% levy on goods deemed to be transshipped — the latter targeting a well-worn backdoor used by Chinese exporters since the first China-US trade war to dodge American tariffs.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Cleveland Guardians right-hander Luis Ortiz was placed on non-disciplinary paid leave through the end of the All-Star break due to an ongoing investigation, Major League Baseball announced Thursday.

Ortiz, 26, had been slated to start against the host Chicago Cubs on Thursday.

""The Guardians have been notified that Luis Ortiz has been placed on leave per an agreement with the Players Association due to an ongoing league investigation,"" the team said in a statement. ""The Guardians are not permitted to comment further at this time and will respect the league's confidential investigative process.""

Ortiz is 4-9 with a 4.36 ERA in 16 starts this season. The native of the Dominican Republic was acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates as part a three-team trade that included the Toronto Blue Jays on Dec. 10.

Ortiz owns a 16-22 record with a 4.05 ERA in 75 career games (50 starts) with the Pirates (2022-24) and Guardians.

Left-hander Joey Cantillo (1-0, 3.81 ERA) will get the nod in place of Ortiz and make his first start of the season on Thursday. Cantillo, 25, has yet to face the Cubs in his career.

President Donald Trump said he will speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.

The call, announced by Trump in a Truth Social post, comes two days after the U.S. said it would halt some missile and ammunitions shipments to Ukraine, which continues to fight off invading Russian forces.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the pause weeks after ordering a review of America's munitions stockpile, sources told NBC News.

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC that the ""decision was made to put America's interests first"" following the Pentagon's review of U.S. military support for other countries.

""The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned — just ask Iran,"" Kelly said.

The decision fueled further concerns from those skeptical of Trump's commitment to providing U.S. assistance to Ukraine in the fourth year of its war with Russia.  

""Ukraine has never asked America to send in the 82nd airborne; they've asked for the weapons to defend their homeland and people from Russia attacks,"" said Mike Pompeo, who served as secretary of State during Trump's first presidential term, in an X post Wednesday. 

""Letting Russia win this war would be a unmitigated disaster for the American people and our security around the world,"" Pompeo wrote.

On Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the department ""continues to provide the President with robust options regard regarding military aid to Ukraine, consistent with his goal of bringing this tragic war to an end.""

At the same time, he said, the Pentagon is ""rigorously examining and adapting its approach towards achieving this objective while also preserving U.S. military readiness and defense priorities that support the president's America first agenda,"" Parnell said.

""This capability review, and that's exactly what it is, going forward, we see this as a common sense pragmatic step towards having a framework to evaluate what munitions are sent and where,"" he said.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Washington and Kyiv are ""clarifying all the details of defense support, including air defense.""

""One way or another, we must ensure protection for our people,"" Zelenskyy said.

The pause comes as Russia has ramped up its attacks all around Ukraine. Kyiv's foreign affairs minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia launched more than 5,000 combat drones and hundreds of missiles, including nearly 80 ballistic missiles, in June alone.

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it stressed to a U.S. official on Wednesday that ""any delay or slowing down in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities would only encourage the aggressor to continue war and terror, rather than seek peace.""

Young Americans will play a significant role in shaping workplaces in the decades ahead, and a new study conducted by Generation Lab for CNBC takes a look at how they feel about work-life balance and corporate culture.

One finding of note: younger employees are back at job sites, and they're okay with it.

Just over half (52%) of those polled say they're at work now ""every day.""  

The majority of in-office numbers rise to a combined 86% when including those in four days a week (21% of respondents), and those in three days (15%).

For the majority of younger workers, the shift away from remote flexibility is not being made in resignation — they say being in the office three to four days a week seems fair to them.

Seventy-six percent of respondents said ""ideally"" they want to be at work at least three days a week.

The survey was conducted from April 2-May 2 by Generation Lab via email, and includes close to 18,000 Americans between the ages of 18 to 34 who are either currently enrolled in higher education (two-year, four-year and technical colleges) or graduated within the past four years. Generation Lab is a data intelligence firm specializing in the study of trends among young people.

Only 9% of those polled said the ability to work remotely was the second most important issue (after money) when deciding on where to work. Thirty-six percent cited ""career/skill development"" as their top priority after money, while 27% said ""company and team culture"" ranked second to compensation.

While they are happy to be back at the workplace, the loyalty of younger workers will have to be earned by employers. Only 7% say they are ""committed to staying at a company for the long haul,"" while just 16% say they want to invest long-term in a company's success. But given the right career advancement opportunities, they will stay, with 46% of respondents saying they ""want to grow within the company but may consider external opportunities.""

Younger generations are willing to work long hours to get ahead, but they have their limits. When asked about willingness to work ""outside the bounds of your standard responsibilities"" nearly one-third (32%) said it is ""the best way to distinguish"" themselves on the job. But over half (56%) said they'd do it, ""but grudgingly,"" and that they ""value work-life balance."" 

While much has been made in recent years of the autonomy younger workers desire, they expect their managers to invest the time in helping them to advance in their careers. The majority (64%) say they want regular feedback from their supervisors:

Only 12% of poll respondents said they want to hear from their supervisors once or twice a year. 

Young employees want the feedback in person (62% said they ""best receive feedback face-to-face""), double those who said email, text or Slack. And many want the feedback from more than one source — 39% say they want to hear from ""multiple people and perspectives.""

Generation Lab also polled respondents to see which major companies they ""associate with unethical behavior or negative impact.""

Several big tech companies fared poorly on this question, with Tesla (68%), Meta (64%), and Amazon (61%) all being perceived negatively by over 60% of respondents.

Boeing, at 61%, was the only other major company to be viewed negatively by more than 60% of the survey audience.

The three big tech firms have worse reputations among young Americans than Exxon Mobil (51% view the oil and gas company negatively).

Some of the hottest tech companies in the newest generation of Silicon Valley also had relatively low reputational scores compared to many companies: OpenAI (43% view it negatively) and Palantir (49% view it negatively).

""A few years ago, Tesla, Meta, Boeing and Amazon all would have been on the most favored list,"" said Cyrus Beschloss, CEO of Generation Lab. ""This may show these companies' communication mechanisms have failed to stop a leak of perceived bad news."" 

The case of Tesla may be the most unique. ""Tesla has a great story to tell about its product but perceptions of Elon Musk's involvement in politics have not been a positive for the brand,"" Beschloss said. ""But he can probably turn that around by focusing on the good of the mission, if Musk decides to do so.""

A major issue since the start of the second Trump administration has been the administration's targeting of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and a subsequent retreat among companies supporting recently stated DEI goals. That doesn't fly with most young workers, and the survey indicates they will not support corporate employers that retreat on the issue.

A majority (67%) say they ""strongly support"" companies continuing at least some DEI initiatives, while 15% said they either ""prefer to eliminate"" DEI or ""prefer to scale it back.""

But a majority of respondents (58%) also indicated that when it comes to ""discussing politics in the workplace,"" they prefer to avoid it.

Trump administration tariffs, and the threat of more tariffs, have many economists and investors worried about a slowdown in economic growth and the potential for increasing layoffs. Greater use of artificial intelligence by employers is also weighing on entry-level worker job opportunities and level of professional confidence. While the latest national employment data remains solid, these fears are reflected among younger workers.

Close to three-quarters (72%) of those surveyed said they are either ""somewhat concerned"" or ""very concerned"" about a recession that could impact their job prospects. 

""A lot of smart young people are following what business leaders say ... casting doubt on the strength of the economy, and that's had an impact,"" Beschloss said. ""This age group also grew up during the Covid economy and in some cases the Great Recession in 2007. They're legitimately nervous,"" he said.

""Right now, young people are seeing symptoms of a struggling economy in their everyday lives — through difficulties finding a job, higher prices, and constant conversation about tariffs. Fittingly, there's no surprise that these recent difficulties and uncertainty had led to a growing sense that a recession could be on the horizon,"" added Jira Smith, research director at Generation Lab.

When it comes to finding a job, most respondents use LinkedIn (63%), with Indeed.com ranked second (58%), followed by Handshake (37%). 

As far as where younger workers look for career advice, they keep it close to home: 81% said they start with mom or dad.

The U.S. House of Representatives early Thursday morning began a final debate on President Donald Trump's megabill ahead of casting votes on it, after Republican holdouts relented overnight and backed the spending package, allowing it to move ahead.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson spent all night corralling House rebels to pass the legislation, aided by Trump, who worked the phones for much of the night.

The motion to begin a final debate, which passed around 3:30 a.m. ET, marked a major win for Republican leaders after hours of maneuvering and backroom deals to break a stubborn impasse.

The measure to move forward with debate finally passed 219-213. Only moderate Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted with Democrats against the motion.

At various points overnight, Trump's frustration with the stalemate was palpable.

""FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!"" he wrote after 1 a.m. ET.

The bill has traveled a rocky road to date, with the the package just squeaking by in the Senate on Tuesday, when Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote.

A final debate is underway and one last vote is expected later Thursday morning. If cleared, the bill will be transferred to Trump's desk to be signed into law.

The president has been pushing for the legislation to reach his desk by July 4.

The Trump-styled ""big beautiful"" bill extends sweeping tax cuts instituted during his first presidency, but also slashes the social safety net and reshapes how the renewable energy industry accesses tax credits.

Democrats are aligned in opposition to the legislation, and railed against the cuts, which disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

""The top 1% are salivating over getting an extra $300,000 per year because of this dangerous bill,"" Rep. Gabe Amo, D-R.I., said on the floor during the early part of the debate. ""Billionaires win. 17 million Americans will lose their health insurance.""

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., took to the floor for hours during the final debate, reading out the stories of people nationwide who depend on the health insurance program Medicaid.

Deeper cuts to Medicaid were part of the Senate's substantial revisions to its version of the megabill, along with a $5 trillion debt limit hike, which exceeds the $4 trillion increase that the House passed in a previous version.

The independent Congressional Budget Office warns that the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 billion of the world's largest economy's existing debt over the next decade. The White House has contested the CBO's estimates and labeled the agency as ""partisan.""

The megabill push has been taking place at a time of broader economic volatility, as Trump presses ahead with a protectionist trade policy that could see the return of so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs on most major U.S. trade partners on July 9.

LONDON — ElevenLabs, a London-based startup that specializes in generating synthetic voices through artificial intelligence, has revealed plans to be IPO-ready within five years.

The company told CNBC it is targeting major global expansion as it prepares for an initial public offering.

""We expect to build more hubs in Europe, Asia and South America, and just keep scaling,"" Mati Staniszewski, ElevenLabs' CEO and co-founder, told CNBC in an interview at the firm's London office.

He identified Paris, Singapore, Brazil and Mexico as potential new locations. London is currently ElevenLabs' biggest office, followed by New York, Warsaw, San Francisco, Japan, India and Bangalore.

Staniszewski said the eventual aim is to get the company ready for an IPO in the next five years.

""From a commercial standpoint, we would like to be ready for an IPO in that time,"" he said. ""If the market is right, we would like to create a public company … that's going to be here for the next generation.""

Founded in 2022 by Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski, ElevenLabs is an AI voice generation startup that competes with the likes of Speechmatics and Hume AI.

The company divides its business into three main camps: consumer-facing voice assistants, integrations with corporates such as Cisco, and tailor-made applications for specific industries like health care.

Staniszewski said the firm hasn't yet decided where it could list, but that this decision will largely rest on where most of its users are located at the time.

""If the U.K. is able to start accelerating,"" ElevenLabs will consider London as a listing destination, Staniszewski said.

The city has faced criticisms from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists that its stock market is unfavorable toward high-growth tech firms.

For example, Deliveroo, whose shares tanked nearly 30% when the company went public, was recently acquired by U.S. food delivery rival DoorDash for close to $4 billion.

Meanwhile, British money transfer firm Wise last month said it plans to move its primary listing location to the U.S.,

ElevenLabs was valued at $3.3 billion following a recent $180 million funding round. The company is backed by the likes of Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and ICONIQ Growth, as well as corporate names like Salesforce and Deutsche Telekom.

Staniszewski said his startup was open to raising more money from VCs, but it would depend on whether it sees a valid business need, like scaling further in other markets. ""The way we try to raise is very much like, if there's a bet we want to take, to accelerate that bet [we will] take the money,"" he said.

Global attention turned to Vietnam on Thursday, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Hanoi just days before Washington's reciprocal tariffs come back in full force.

Under the agreement, the U.S. will apply a 20% duty on Vietnamese imports — sharply below the 46% rate Trump had imposed in early April. U.S. imports to Vietnam will meanwhile not be subject to tariffs.

Trump also said that Vietnam had agreed to a 40% duty on any products that originally came from another country, but were sent to Vietnam for final shipment to the U.S. China has reportedly repeatedly relied on this practice, known as transshipping, to avoid trade barriers.

Vietnam is one of the few countries that has struck a trade deal with the White House, while the clock ticks down on Trump's 90-day temporary reprieve. Many nations have been left wondering how the future of their trade relationship with the world's largest economy could shape up.

""What we learned from the Vietnam deal is, if anything, the tariffs are going to go up from here, not down,"" Sebastian Raedler, head of European equity strategy at BofA, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

But other countries might also now have an easier time negotiating, Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC.

""Other countries will feel they should be able to lock in a lower tariff rate than the 20% that President Trump says Vietnam has agreed to,"" he said, noting that ""Vietnam had an unusually weak negotiating hand"" due to its strong dependency on trade with the U.S.

The deal could be cause for concern for other emerging market economies like Vietnam, economists and strategists at Citi said in a note Thursday.

""On balance, we believe there is more for EM Asia to worry about than expect gains if this deal reflects what is to come soon,"" they noted.

While the development removes uncertainty and suggests other agreements could emerge in the coming days, the 20% tariff rate is higher than the expected 10% levy on goods, according to Citi's experts. They add that the separate 40% rate on transshipped goods suggests other countries may also need to agree to such a duty.

""Thailand followed by Malaysia might be more exposed than other EM Asia peers (apart from Vietnam). A separate and more punitive tariff on transshipped goods was least expected by the market,"" the note said.

""Additionally, there may be spillovers to other exporters that have set up factories in Vietnam in past years,"" for example Korea, it added.

But experts speaking to CNBC spoke are expecting several more trade agreements to emerge in the coming days, with Williams noting that the U.S. appears open to making these ""rough"" frameworks rather than ""full"" deals.

One of the countries tapped as potentially being next to strike a deal is India, says Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia at Natixis CIB. The agriculture sector could emerge as an obstacle, as India ""will find it hard to allow US market access without domestic backlash,"" she suggested.

While the Vietnam-U.S. deal suggests more deals likely lie ahead for other Asian countries, it does not necessarily mean that the same is true for the European Union, Lavanya Venkateswaran, senior ASEAN economist at OCBC Bank, told CNBC.

""The Vietnamese authorities have been clear about their intent to negotiate with the US, even before the reciprocal announcements were made in April,"" she said by email, adding that the same was true for other regional economies like Indonesia and Malaysia.

""Compared to these economies, the case with [the] EU has not always been smooth sailing and the US has been more public in its criticism of the EU at different times in the past few months,"" Venkateswaran said.

Natixis CIB's Nguyen meanwhile added that ""Vietnam shows that it is very difficult for Europe to get what it wants — which is tariff-free.""

Some duties are likely to be imposed, she said, and while the EU could retaliate by applying equal tariffs on the U.S., Nguyen expects the EU to agree to a 10% tariff and ""try to take wins on the sectoral side.""

Trade negotiations between the EU and U.S. have been challenging and slow to develop, with sources telling CNBC that a bare-bones ""political"" deal with scant initial details may be the the EU's best hope at this point. Analysts and economists have also expressed uncertainty about the likelihood of a trade agreement, given key sticking points like big tech regulation, taxation, and broadly mismatched world views.

Trump has called for tariffs as high as 50% on the EU, while the bloc has threatened wide-ranging countermeasures, which have also been paused until next week.

If I had to choose between having a job and paying less for Nike shoes, you'd see me running barefoot to the office. Wednesday's market moves, however, suggested that Wall Street preferred the cheaper shoes.  

The U.S. economy lost private sector jobs in June, the first time hiring had contracted since March 2023, according to payrolls processing firm ADP. It's even more startling because a Dow Jones survey of economists had pegged job numbers to expand by 100,000.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on his social media site Truth Social that the country had made a trade deal with Vietnam, in which the Southeast Asian nation will face a 20% duty on imports to America. That means companies that rely heavily on Vietnam for manufacturing, such as Nike, Crocs and Lululemon, will face less onerous costs and might not hike prices as much, compared with the original tariff rate of 46%.

After weighing both pieces of news, investors decided the good news was more important and lifted the S&P 500 to a new closing high. Granted, the ADP report has had a spotty track record in predicting the official job figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But it's still worth thinking about how that's a sign financial markets could be slightly disconnected from the real economy: Who can afford to buy shoes and pump up stocks if they don't have jobs?

Vietnam strikes a deal with America. Imports from the Southeast Asian nation to the U.S. will be subject to a 20% tariff, while the U.S. gets tariff-free access to Vietnam's market, Trump announced Wednesday.

The S&P 500 rises to close at a fresh record. On Tuesday, the index also scored an intra-day high, while the Nasdaq Composite notched a record close. The Vietnam Index on Wednesday rose to its highest level since April 2022, following news of the country's deal with America.

The White House lifts chip software curbs on China. Semiconductor software companies Synopsys and Cadence announced Thursday that they are restoring access to their products after the U.S. government reversed export restrictions.

U.S. private sector jobs shrank in June. Job losses amounted to 33,000, reported ADP on Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones had expected an increase of 100,000 jobs for the month.

New listing volumes on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange jumped around eight times to $14 billion in the first half of this year, from just $1.8 billion in the same period in 2024, according to Dealogic.

That puts the city on track to become the world's largest listing destination this year, surpassing the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. PwC projected up to 100 IPOs in Hong Kong this year, with total fundraising to exceed $25.5 billion.

The U.S. government has rescinded its export restrictions on chip-design software to China, three of the largest players in the space announced on Thursday. 

In separate statements, semiconductor software designers Siemens AG, Synopsys, and Cadence all said they received letters from the U.S. Department of Commerce informing them that the controls had been lifted.

While Siemens is based in Germany, its chip design software subsidiary, Siemens EDA, is based in Oregon, U.S.

As a result of export control reversal, Siemens said it had ""restored full access"" to the recently restricted software and technology and had resumed sales and support to Chinese customers. ​

Synopsys and Cadence both said that they were working on doing the same. The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

The U.S. had informed the chip design software companies on May 23 that they were required to obtain licenses before exporting software and other technology for semiconductors to China. It followed an earlier tightening of export controls on other semiconductor products, which restricted the sales of advanced AI processors from Nvidia and AMD to China.

Shares of Synopsys and Cadence each climbed about 5% Thursday.

The three firms are considered part of the U.S.-dominated electronic design automation (EDA) market, which encompasses software, hardware, and essential services for designing chips and semiconductor devices.

Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi said in a conference call with analysts in May that the company saw a slowdown in China during its fiscal second quarter, which ended on April 30. Customers in China made up around 10% of Synopsys' $1.6 billion in quarterly revenue.

China has also introduced policies to prop up its domestic chip-design software makers and develop independent chip design know-how, Synopsys said.

According to TrendForce, Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA held a global market share of 31%, 30%, and 13%, respectively, in 2024.

The news comes after China signaled last week that they are making progress on a trade truce with the U.S. and confirmed conditional agreements to resume some exchanges of rare earths and advanced technology.

Tripadvisor stock jumped 17% Thursday after Starboard Value revealed a more than 9% stake in the online travel company, according to a securities filing.

The position was valued at about $160 million as of Wednesday's close.

Tripadvisor shares have been flat since the start of the year after plummeting more than 30% in 2024. Last year, the travel review and booking company said it created a special committee to explore potential options.

Starboard Value has gained a reputation for pushing for changes such as new CEOs and cost cuts by acquiring significant shares in companies.

Most recently, the firm settled a proxy fight with Autodesk, where it gained two board seats. It has previously pushed for changes at Tinder parent Match Group, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Salesforce.

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news late Wednesday.

Tripadvisor did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Starboard declined to comment on the news.

 The absence of new buyers and FOMO-driven greed are key factors that could keep Bitcoin price pinned below $112,000 longer than many think. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price taps $110,000, but low spot buying demand suggests the upside could be limited.

High retail FOMO and a near-overbought RSI signal a potential BTC price correction.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows in the 1-hour time frame since reaching a three-week high of $110,300 on Wednesday. 

As the end of the week approaches, BTC price has failed to break above the all-time high at $112,000.

Bitcoin's price has rallied 5% over the last 48 hours, reaching an intraday high of $110,392 on Thursday, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. 

Despite this performance, the ability to push above the all-time highs at $112,000 is currently limited due to the absence of buyers.

Bitcoin's spot volume delta metric, an indicator that measures the net difference between buying and selling trade volumes, reveals that net spot buying on exchanges remains negative even as BTC price attempts to break out.

This suggests a lack of momentum, potentially leading to a pullback or consolidation if derivative-driven pumps dominate without spot market support.

“BTC is breaking out, but where's the spot demand?” said market data resource Swissblock Technologies in its latest post on X, adding:

Looking ahead, K33 Research points out that spot volumes tend to be far lower from June through October compared with the remainder of the year, with July historically being one of the quietest months, accounting for only 6.1% of the annual volume. This could stop BTC's attempt to hit fresh record highs over the next few weeks.

K33 Research wrote:

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin price needs fresh demand from spot buyers to break out of the current range into price discovery. 

Bitcoin's surge to $110,000 has sparked intense FOMO, with retail traders fueling calls for even higher prices, according to onchain data provider Santiment.

“Crypto crowd has officially flipped from FUD to FOMO following Bitcoin's rise to $109.8K,” the firm said in a Thursday post on X. 

However, crypto market sentiment, currently in “greed” territory at 73, often signals a contrarian move. 

Historically, when retail traders exhibit excessive optimism, markets tend to reverse or pause as pro investors capitalize on overbought conditions. 

If accompanied by high trading volumes and speculative bets, this greed-driven sentiment can inflate prices temporarily, resulting in a pullback. 

Bitcoin's relative strength index, or RSI, displays near overbought conditions in four out of six timeframes. This suggests that the price is entering the exhaustion zone, hinting at a potential correction in the shorter term.

While Bitcoin attempts to break $110,000, the current euphoria suggests a brief halt or consolidation is likely as the market “resets” retail exuberance, potentially stabilizing before resuming the uptrend.

 BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF is earning more in annual fees than the firm's signature S&P 500 fund, despite having an expense ratio almost nine times higher. 

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is now earning more in annual fees from its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund than its flagship S&P 500 fund, according to a recent report.

“IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure,” NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci told Bloomberg on Wednesday. 

With an expense ratio of 0.25% and around $75 billion in assets under management (AUM), BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (IBIT) has generated $187.2 million in annual fees, approximately $100,000 more than its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). 

The IVV, which launched in 2000, is over eight times larger than the IBIT, with approximately $624 billion in assets, but charges almost nine times less, at just 0.03%.

Several crypto executives were quick to comment on the findings. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said in an X post, “Bitcoin has Wall Street's full, undivided attention now.” Strive Funds chief financial officer Ben Pham said Bitcoin will be “the death” of active management and passive indexation portfolios. 

Crypto trader Cade O'Neill said it “says everything about where capital is headed. Institutions aren't just curious anymore, they're committed.” 

Meanwhile, McKay Research founder James McKay said the news was bullish and “Probably something.”

Since its January 2024 launch, BlackRock's IBIT has recorded $52.4 billion in inflows, the highest of any US spot Bitcoin ETF, according to Farside data. 

The IBIT closed the trading day on Wednesday at $62.41, up 4.31% across the day, according to Google Finance data. The uptick comes as Bitcoin's price spiked 2.82% over the same period, which is now trading at $108,660.

Meanwhile, the IVV closed the day at $623.42, up 0.44% over the day.

US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs marked their first net outflow day on Wednesday after 15 consecutive trading days of inflows.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Why Doesn't the U.S. Have a Bitcoin Reserve, Yet?","https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/07/02/why-doesn-t-the-u-s-have-a-bitcoin-reserve-yet","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:01:12 GMT","

President Donald Trump sent a rush of excitement through the crypto industry when he ordered his administration to get to work on setting aside cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment for the U.S. government. But there's been little to see from that effort, so far, and the officials behind the work seem to be suggesting the wait could be considerable.



Trump's March directive to get started on the stockpile carried a now-expired deadline for the Treasury Department to figure out how to actually set up the reserves for the bitcoin and other crypto assets the government has at its disposal. By now, the administration is supposed to have a plan for the ""accounts in which the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile should be located and the need for any legislation to operationalize any aspect of this order,"" according to the president's directive, which called for two separate heaps of crypto — one for bitcoin only and the other for all other digital assets. 

Such a plan hasn't yet been revealed by Trump's chief crypto advisers, including Bo Hines, who pointed out last week that ""there's nothing in the [executive order] that mandates that report becomes public,"" Hines said of the document that was due in early May, though he added that the administration could ""choose to make it public at some point.""



But Hines offered some update of the government-wide audit that aimed to figure out what assets the various federal agencies — including the U.S. Marshals Service — had gathered from civil and criminal seizures.



""They have received the numbers from the different entities inside the government,"" he told reporters at an event on Capitol Hill, referring to Trump's requirement that federal agencies report their crypto holdings to the Treasury by early April. ""Now the process begins in terms of establishing the reserve, the actual infrastructure behind it.""



The executive order from Trump had affixed another federal stamp of approval on cryptocurrency after years of resistance from the previous administration and its regulators that viewed the field as prone to risk and recklessness that could endanger investors. The price of BTC has risen 25% since he issued the order.



“President Trump's proclamations have laid a powerful foundation, but now it's time to move from vision to execution,"" said Hailey Miller, director of government relations at the Digital Chamber's Digital Power Network, in an email suggesting industry folks are standing by to help. ""The momentum is real. What we need now is coordinated follow-through.”



With the administration playing its cards close to the vest, the clearest view is on the legislators who are trying to get bills done to ""operationalize"" the order, as directed by Trump. Senator Cynthia Lummis has taken a lead in the Senate with her Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act aimed at ""transforming the president's visionary executive action into enduring law.""



Turning the U.S. into an outsized bitcoin investor has been a project of the Wyoming Republican for a while now, and she thinks it's the answer to the nation's fiscal worries. But Lummis, who chairs a digital assets subcommittee in the Senate, and others in favor of the reserves understand that there are more urgent priorities in crypto legislation.

Representative Nick Begich, an Alaska Republican pushing matching legislation in the House of Representatives, granted that the other crypto efforts to set up rules for the markets and stablecoins have to come first. 

""But I'm very hopeful that after those are completed, we can turn the focus toward the BITCOIN Act and start having a serious discussion about why it's important for the United States to have a diversified reserves balance sheet that includes bitcoin,"" he said at a recent event in Washington.

Because the market structure and stablecoin bills are on uncertain timelines, despite Trump's earlier ambition to get both done before Congress' lengthy August break, it's unclear how soon the lawmakers will have a window to consider the reserves. Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, put a new September 30 goal on his chamber's potential passage of the crypto market structure bill, but much depends on a House strategy for the two bills that hasn't yet emerged.



Begich spoke of his House efforts as if he's still trying to get them off the ground, asking crypto insiders to help convince their members of Congress to co-sponsor the bill.

Getting more sponsors ""sends a signal to committee leadership that this is something that has the potential to pass into law,"" he said. 



""Having the support of the president is extremely important,"" Senator Lummis noted. ""So I'm hoping we can convince more in Congress to understand the fundamentals of Bitcoin.""



While the president was clear that he doesn't want new taxpayer money spent to build crypto reserves, Trump's order called on the administration to find other ways to purchase digital assets. Hines said federal officials are already working on multiple ideas to rake in ""digital gold.""



""We are certainly keen on the idea of accumulation,"" he said. ""I think we'll begin moving very quickly on that.""



The government has routinely been estimated to have about 200,000 bitcoin on-hand, though no further public accounting has yet emerged. The BITCOIN Act pushed by both Lummis and Begich would seek to buy about 5% of the global bitcoin supply — a million coins — over a five-year period, ""mirroring the size and scope of gold reserves held by the United States."" To do so, it would try to unlock some novel funding approaches to avoid hitting taxpayers.



""There are several mechanisms available for the acquisition of bitcoin,"" Begich said, including rewriting the rules of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to be able to acquire bitcoin and updating the modern market value of Federal Reserve gold certificates to leverage into bitcoin purchases.



Begich maintained that the leading digital asset is not just a niche financial instrument but something the government needs to embrace as a mainstay.



""We like to talk about bitcoin as though it's somehow separate from the rest of the economy,"" he said. ""Bitcoin really is becoming an asset class that represents the economy.""



One of the conceptual challenges of this digital ""strategic reserve"" is that the underlying idea for a buy-and-hold government investment means this stockpile isn't actually meant to be a strategic reserve in the traditional sense. Other nationally reserved commodities, such as oil, can be released when the nation has a special need. That's not the plan for bitcoin in the minds of Trump and his lawmaker allies.



But as enthusiastic as they are, state lawmakers have jumped ahead of their federal counterparts in setting up state-based reserves. Trump's order seemed to act as a starting gun for efforts across the country to devote public money to crypto investing. As the federal government continues its work, states such as Texas are already building their stockpiles.

 Ethereum core developer Zak Cole has launched the Ethereum Community Foundation to “do what the [Ethereum Foundation] won't.” 

An Ethereum core developer has set up a new organization called the Ethereum Community Foundation, with one of its aims to bring the price of Ether to $10,000.

ECF was spearheaded by Ethereum core developer Zak Cole, who explained his rationale for setting up ECF at the eighth Ethereum Community Conference held in Cannes, France, on Tuesday.

According to Cole, the Ethereum Foundation has been neglecting ETH as an asset class.

The new organization is set to fund infrastructure projects that grow the Ethereum ecosystem, while simultaneously increasing the price of ETH, according to Cole. 

“We are the Ethereum Community Foundation. We say what the [Ethereum Foundation] can't, we do what the [Ethereum Foundation] won't. We serve ETH holders because you deserve better.” Cole said.

In an X post, Cole said ETH's price is a “direct function of security.” He went on to state that ETH needs to head toward the $10,000 mark for this reason.

The project has no ties to the Ethereum Foundation.

The ECF says it will provide grants to projects that increase “ETH burn, contribute to the public goods, advance core infrastructure, and scale Ethereum.”

In order to receive grants, projects must use Ethereum as the settlement layer, which will lead to ETH burns due to the transactions being processed on the Ethereum mainnet. 

Additionally, the projects must be tokenless and immutable in nature, according to the ECF website.

During his presentation, Cole called out Uniswap, Ethereum Name Service and Optimism for receiving support from the Ethereum Foundation, but later on launching their own tokens backed by venture capital funding.

“Publicly funded projects should remain public and benefit those who have paid for them,” Cole said.

Cole also lambasted the Ethereum Foundation for neglecting ETH as a valuable asset.

Cointelegraph reached out to the Ethereum Foundation but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

Ethereum Validator Association (EVA) was announced as the first recipient to receive a grant from the ECF.

Cole says that with the EVA, validators will now have a say in how Ethereum's monetary policy is shaped by prioritizing EIP road maps and choosing Ethereum's client priorities.

“The EVA introduces validator representation,” Cole said.

Cole said that the EVA will empower clients based on their performance. 

Additionally, Cole highlighted a potential conflict of interest as Offchain Labs, the team behind layer-2 network Arbitrum, has an ownership stake in Prysmatic Labs. 

Notably, Prysm is the second-largest consensus layer client of the Ethereum network, according to Ethernodes. Prysmatic Labs operates the Prysm client.

SharpLink's Ethereum treasury adoption represents a pioneering institutional embrace of crypto assets that could reshape corporate finance practices.

SharpLink Gaming's decision to adopt Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset marks a significant milestone in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This strategic move positions SharpLink as the world's largest publicly traded company to integrate ETH into its treasury operations, demonstrating a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance in the digital age.

The symbolism of ringing the Nasdaq closing bell extends beyond mere ceremony—it represents mainstream financial markets acknowledging cryptocurrency's legitimacy as a treasury strategy. With Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin serving as SharpLink's Chairman, the company benefits from direct leadership connection to the blockchain ecosystem, lending credibility to this treasury transformation.

This treasury strategy demonstrates an intriguing convergence between traditional public market structures and decentralized finance principles. By embracing ETH as a ""resilient and transparent store of value,"" SharpLink is effectively placing a strategic bet on the future prominence of blockchain-based assets in corporate finance.

The decision signals confidence in Ethereum's long-term value proposition beyond simple speculation. Rather than viewing cryptocurrency merely as a speculative investment, SharpLink appears to be treating it as a fundamental treasury component—a philosophy that could influence other public companies considering similar strategies.

While the announcement lacks specific details about the percentage of treasury allocated to Ethereum or the governance frameworks established to manage volatility risks, the mere adoption represents a noteworthy evolution in how public companies approach digital asset integration into traditional financial operations.

(Nasdaq: SBET) (“SharpLink” or the “Company”), the world's largest publicly traded company to adopt Ethereum (ETH) as its primary treasury reserve asset, today announced that it will ring the Nasdaq Stock Market closing bell on Monday, July 7, 2025, in celebration of a groundbreaking milestone in its corporate evolution.

In doing so, the Company has aligned itself with the emerging future of decentralized finance (“DeFi”), redefining traditional treasury management with a bold and forward-thinking digital capital strategy.

“We believe Ethereum is integral to the next wave of financial innovation,” stated Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink and Co-Founder of Ethereum. “By integrating ETH into our treasury operations, we are embracing a resilient and transparent store of value that embodies technological progress and promotes institutional trust. This move represents a natural extension of SharpLink's innovative DNA and our commitment to staying at the forefront of industry transformation.”

Ethereum (ETH) has surged 7.5% in the daily timeframe to break above a key resistance level for the first time in weeks. Following its breakout, some analysts forecasted that a retest of the range highs could be around the corner.

Ethereum Reclaims Crucial Area

On Wednesday, Ethereum jumped over 7% from its local low to the $2,550 mark, setting the stage to reclaim another crucial resistance. The King of Altcoins climbed from the $2,380 support to the $2,585 area, hitting a two-week high.

The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $2,400-$2,800 price range since the early May breakout, but briefly lost this area after failing to hold the $2,550 support two weeks ago.

After recovering its local range, ETH struggled to break past the $2,500 barrier, trading between the range low and this resistance for a week. Nonetheless, today's market recovery, which also saw Bitcoin jump to the $109,600 mark, has sparked bullish sentiment among investors.

Amid today's performance, Daan Crypto Trades called ETH's price action a “nice move out of the local range.” However, he suggested that bulls must hold the $2,520 area to confirm it isn't another deviation or liquidity grab in a “bigger chop.”

To the trader, failing to hold this area would send the cryptocurrency to the range lows again. As a result, the major levels to watch remain the $2,310 support and $2,735 resistance.

Market watcher Merlijn The Trader noted that Ethereum has “respected support every single time,” forming “one of the cleanest breakouts we've ever seen.”

He highlighted a three-month ascending triangle in ETH's chart, pointing out that the King of Altcoins bounced from the rising support line during the recent price deviation and now targets the next key resistance around the $2,700 mark.

Ethereum is charging up. Higher lows, strong base, bullish MACD crossover. A clean break of $2,700… and ETH will fly. $3,000 is just the beginning. The real move comes after that.

ETH To Repeat ATH Set Up?

Merlijn also affirmed that ETH's two-year setup is repeating, which could signal that a massive breakout is coming. According to the chart, the Ethereum price has moved in stages that last about two years since 2018.

During the first stage, the cryptocurrency's price forms a base, which later leads to the second stage, where the price rejects and retests the base lows. Lastly, Ethereum experiences the liftoff phase, where the price breaks out to new highs.

The last liftoff phase, between 2020 and 2022, saw ETH surge from the $100 mark to its $4,878 all-time high (ATH). To the trader, “This time we start from $1,500. Not a dip. A launchpad.”

Similarly, analyst Kaleo pointed out the structural resemblance between ETH's performance this cycle and last cycle. He noted that, while BTC hit a new ATH in December 2020, Ethereum was 60% down from its previous cycle highs, leading many investors to suggest it was “dead.”

Nonetheless, ETH climbed over 800% from there, outperforming Bitcoin's 250% increase in the following months. This time, the cryptocurrency has also seen up to a 68% retrace from its previous ATH, while BTC soared to new highs. If history repeats, “The bottom for ETH is in. Up only from here,” the analyst concluded.

As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,568, a 6.1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Crypto analyst Capo of Crypto, who is currently one of the most recognizeable names in crypto spaces on social media, has sounded a warning for the market. The analyst has completely dismissed the current trajectory of the Bitcoin price and, by extension, the altcoin market, calling for only a short-lived rally. His analysis points to a Bitcoin price crash, but the most impact is expected to be felt by the altcoin market as they tumble further.

Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $100,000

In the post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Capo of Crypto shares a rather bearish thesis that suggests that the current strength in Bitcoin won't last. He points out that the Bitcoin price hasn't bottomed yet and that the capitulation event is yet to happen.

A capitulation event is a time in the market when prices are falling, triggering panic among investors. This panic leads to further selling as investors become scared that prices will keep crashing, and this leads to deeper losses in the market. An example of a capitulation event is the FTX market crash, when the Bitcoin price fell by more than 60% in a matter of months.

The crypto analyst predicts that the Bitcoin price will actually fall further, first below $100,000. Once this psychological level is broken, he sees the price heading for the $92,000 to $93,000 territory. However, he doesn't expect the crash to end there as capitulation events often lead to deeper losses. He explains that if Bitcoin does fall below the $92,000-$93,000 support, then the market should expect to see prices as low as $60,000-$70,000.

Altcoins To Get Decimated

With the Bitcoin price expected to crash so hard, the effect on the altcoin market will be even more profound. Over the last few months, 10% dips in the Bitcoin price have translated to around 20-30% dips in altcoin prices. Therefore, a nearly 50% crash in the Bitcoin price would be disastrous for altcoins.

Capo of Crypto actually expects altcoins to crash harder, predicting that they will fall another 50-80% if his idea of the market does play out. This could put the altcoin market on a path to new lows not seen in the last five years, and could be the worst bear market in recent history.

This is not the first time that Capo has warned the community of an impending crash. Back in May, when the Bitcoin price was hitting new all-time highs, the analyst had warned that the market could reverse its gains. On May 15, he posted a picture of a Black Swan, suggesting that prices could crash. Since then, most altcoins have reversed their gains, with only Bitcoin managing to maintain most of its gains from that time period.

A crypto analyst has issued a strong warning for Bitcoin (BTC), forecasting a potential crash to new lows as negative sentiment mounts. The analyst has also highlighted the possibility of an even more delayed altcoin season as the broader market flips bearish. 

With the Bitcoin price still consolidating above $100,000 after experiencing major losses in the last month, concerns have been rising about the flagship cryptocurrency's near-term outlook. Dr. Cat, a crypto analyst on the X social media platform, has forecasted that a crash to $98,200 is growing increasingly possible for Bitcoin, especially with negative sentiment piling up.

The $98,200 level has been highlighted as a critical support level, which, if breached, could lead to even stronger downside risks for Bitcoin. Based on key Ichimoku indicators like the 3-week Kijun Sen and Weekly SSB, this downward potential could see Bitcoin crashing into the $70,000 range, which the analyst describes as the “7 handle”.

Notably, Dr. Cat's chart, which features Ichimoku Cloud patterns, shows Bitcoin trading slightly above mid-range indicators with price action hovering above the Kijun Sen and within proximity to the cloud. Despite mild bullish positioning, he stresses that the daily and 2-day time frames remain structurally bearish, reducing the strength of any upward momentum. 

Adding weight to this pessimistic scenario, the analyst points out that while a short-term upside for Bitcoin is still in the cards, it is not guaranteed. Alternative wave counts also indicate that a local top may already be in place, signaling early stages of a more severe price correction. 

Dr. Cat further compares Bitcoin's current market conditions to April 2024, when a similar setup led to a notable crash. As such, even if BTC pushes slightly higher in the short term, the broader trend, according to the analyst, suggests a looming reversal. 

In addition to Dr Cat's bearish Bitcoin forecast his analysis also extends a stark warning to altcoin holders about the long-anticipated altseason. According to the market expert, many altcoins are once again approaching key resistance levels against Bitcoin, mirroring last week's setup that led to significant declines. 

Although a slight recovery against BTC is not ruled out, the broader market structure hints at a harsh environment for altcoins in the next 1-2 weeks. The future Kijun Sen angle on the weekly Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart also signals an extended period where the flagship cryptocurrency may outperform altcoins decisively. However, this outperformance is not expected to result from BTC's strength, but rather from its comparatively slower decline as the market turns bearish. 

In such a case, altcoins could see accelerated losses while BTC experienced a more controlled correction. This market dynamic suggests that the true altcoin season is unlikely to emerge anytime soon.

The altcoin market took a backseat on Thursday as crypto majors bitcoin and ether attempted to rally to new highs. 

As billions of dollars worth of liquidity flowed into shorting bitcoin on the brink of record highs, altcoins like ATOM consolidated, finding support at the $4.20 level.

Typically when bitcoin rallies altcoin price action is muted and the inverse is true when bitcoin consolidates, so ATOM could be primed for a rally once bitcoin begins to cool off.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Exclusive: Telegram blockchain startup TOP raises $28.5 million as messaging platform expands crypto footprint","https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/03/telegram-blockchain-the-open-platform-top-ribbit-pantera-capital/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

Crypto has a new unicorn. The Open Platform, one of the main app developers on the blockchain chosen by the messaging app Telegram, announced Thursday that it had raised a $28.5 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation. 

The fintech specialist Ribbit Capital led the round, with participation from the crypto VC Pantera Capital. The raise was for about 5% of equity and did not include allocations of cryptocurrency, The Open Platform founder and CEO Andrew Rogozov told Fortune. The Open Platform, which also refers to itself as TOP, has raised a total of over $70 million across multiple funding rounds, he added.





TOP is one of the key companies working on apps for the blockchain called The Open Network, or TON. And that blockchain is closely associated with Telegram, one of the world's most popular messaging apps. It's a complicated mishmash of entities, but the upshot is that TOP is helping spearhead the integration of crypto into an app that boasts more than one billion users, according to Telegram founder Pavel Durov.





That reach has VCs salivating. Investors at Ribbit Capital and Pantera pointed to Telegram's large user base in statements included in a press release for TOP's raise. “The opportunity to support groundbreaking tech and financial products that reach one billion people is inspiring,” said Ryan Barney, a partner at Pantera.





And they're not the only ones who are excited. In March, the TON Foundation, another entity tied to the blockchain, said VCs like Sequoia Capital, Benchmark Ventures, Draper Associates, and, of course, Ribbit had accumulated $400 million of TON's cryptocurrency.




Just like the mishmash of entities involved in Telegram's chosen blockchain, the origins of TOP, TON, and Toncoin are far from simple.





In 2018, Durov raised $1.7 billion after he and Telegram sold a cryptocurrency to support the development of a blockchain called Telegram Open Network, or TON. In 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commision filed to stop what it alleged was an illegal securities offering, and, in 2020, the regulator and Telegram came to a settlement. The messaging app agreed to return more than $1.2 billion to investors and pay an $18.5 million fine.





While Telegram seemed to distance itself from crypto, other developers continued to work on the discarded tech behind the scenes, including Rogozov.





And in 2023, Telegram anointed a new version of TON as its exclusive blockchain of choice. That same year, Rogozov incorporated TOP, according to a business registry in Abu Dhabi, where the company is based.





TOP is the main developer behind TON's most prominent crypto wallet, aptly called Wallet in Telegram. Outside of the U.S. and Europe, Telegram, the app, has integrated the wallet into its main menu and is available to users in Russia, Asia, and other geographies.




Rogozov plans to use the new injection of capital to expand the wallet into the U.S. and Europe. “We need to support everything related to compliance, operations and stuff, right?” he said. “That's very expensive to build.”





He and his team also plan to use the money to incubate other TON-based projects, including blockchain games and AI applications.





In TOP's Series A, Ribbit acquired about 4% of the company, and Pantera netted around 1%, Rogozov said. The company's early backers are Dubai investment firm Vy Capital and Dmitry Eremeev, a Russia-born investor. Kingsway Capital and Brevan Howard's Kevin Hu are also backers, according to the Abu Dhabi business registry.





Clarification, July 3, 2025: Updated article to clarify that Kevin Hu, not Brevan Howard, is backing TOP.

An apartment building with fire damage. A home without heat or smoke detectors. Multiple properties with broken windows.

Over on the east side, a Detroiter living in her home without running water for two months, forcing her to survive off of bottles of water. Another tenant living upstairs in the same apartment complex with no hot water in her kitchen, electrical sockets that don't work and gaps in her windows. Outside of their home, a backyard door that appears boarded shut.

These are among the properties, and living conditions, at the center of a sprawling lawsuit filed by the city of Detroit on July 2 against Real Token, a Florida-based blockchain real estate company; its co-founders, brothers Remy Jacobson and Jean-Marc Jacobson, and 165 affiliates, for public nuisance violations involving more than 400 residential properties in Detroit.

""This is the largest nuisance abatement lawsuit ever filed by the city of Detroit,"" said Conrad Mallett, corporation counsel for the city of Detroit, speaking at a news conference on the city's west side near one of the many properties cited in the suit.

At issue: Real Token, or RealT, is operating a cryptocurrency venture in Detroit, involving dozens of limited liability companies and related entities, by offering international investors ""fractional ownership of Detroit properties represented as digital tokens,"" according to the suit. The city of Detroit, in its complaint, alleges that its tenants — Detroit residents — are paying the price with poorly maintained rental properties and unsanitary and unsafe conditions. The city's lawsuit follows an Outlier Media investigation published earlier this year about the company.

""Behind the high tech language lies a deeply familiar problem in this city, and that is neglected properties ... unresponsive management, and Detroit families, many of them single mothers, left to live in unsafe and unhealthy conditions. Tenants have reported persistent mold, broken plumbing, caved-in ceilings and a total lack of basic maintenance, yet their rent is still being collected,"" said District 2 Council Member Angela Whitfield-Calloway.

On its website, Real Token says ""for the first time, investors around the globe can buy into the US real estate market through fully-compliant, fractional, tokenized ownership."" Since 2019, the company says it has garnered more than 65,000 registered investors. Ownership of property is spread out across ""representative tokens"" and owners ""can collect revenue from rent, and vote on property decisions,"" according to the company's website. Each property has a management company that ""sources tenants, collects rent, and manages repairs, so the diverse group of RealToken owners don't have to.""

In a statement, RealToken, laid the blame on management companies it hired for the properties.

""Since RealToken has entered the Detroit market, we have been committed to the goal of providing safe, affordable housing for our tenants, and playing a supporting role in revitalizing Detroit's neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we have been one of many victims in Detroit of several unscrupulous property management companies. These companies were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to oversee RealToken's properties, address tenant complaints and make repairs, and maintain each of our properties in accordance with City of Detroit municipal codes. As it turns out, there are many instances where these goals were not achieved, and each management company, in its own way, stole these funds to the detriment of RealToken and more importantly, the tenants we serve,"" according to a statement from the company provided to the Free Press on July 3 issued through Cadence, a Detroit-based communications firm.

The statement went on to say: ""We took over all the properties at once and started addressing blight violations, administrative filings, servicing maintenance calls and conducting full rehabs. We have made complete repairs to over several dozens of properties, addressed hundreds of blight tickets, and have contractor teams in the field every day addressing each disgruntled tenant and city citation in turn. This process cannot happen overnight. It takes time. But we are committed to addressing every issue, and finally execute on our original mission.""

Real Token has not been served a lawsuit, according to the company, and reserved further comment.

Brenda Davis has lived in her apartment on the city's east side for 16 years and has only ever been late on her rent once, she said. But on April 29, after she paid the month's rent, her water was cut off. She said she wrote a letter to her property manager a day after explaining her situation.

""They didn't seem to care because if they did, they would have had the water turned back on,"" 68-year-old Davis said.

When she lifted the knob to her bathroom faucet on July 2, nothing came out. She's forced to buy water and rely on family and a neighbor. Davis, who uses a walker, can't take a bath with epsom salt to relieve pain in her knees and hip. She must pour water into her toilet to flush it.

""That's what hurts the most. After being here 16 years and this is what you're going to do to an elderly person? It makes no sense. And they should not be able to keep doing this and getting away with it,"" she said.

Davis, who hasn't paid rent since her water was turned off, received an eviction notice directing her to move out by July 14 or her landlord may take her to court to evict her, according to paperwork she showed the Free Press.

""They don't repair anything. All they want to do is collect the money,"" she said.

Upstairs at 63-year-old Minnie Pearl Pratt's place, the bathroom sink doesn't work either, but the tub does. The kitchen sink runs cold water. She boils the water. There's a large crack in a back window and a board holds a door closed.

""It's too much stress on me,"" she said.

Pratt, who has had three strokes and is no longer able to work, is frustrated and said she feels unheard and pushed out as a senior.

The apartment the pair live in is owned by Michigan Real Token II LLC, among the defendants in the suit. The property does not have a certificate of compliance, as required by the city to indicate it is up to code, and is behind more than $8,500 in property taxes, according to city and county records.

Detroit City Council members expressed their outrage over the conditions renters were living in and the negligent landlords.

""They feel that they can do this to folks in the most vulnerable situation,"" said Pro Tem James Tate.

At-Large Council Member Mary Waters said bad landlords have gotten away with too much.

""For years, we've seen a pattern that must end. Slumlord and scam artists exploiting Detroit renters, unsafe housing, unreturned security deposits, illegal evictions. These are not just individual cases. They are systemic failures,"" Waters said.

The city of Detroit's suit, filed in Wayne County Circuit Court, alleges that the cited properties repeatedly violated local building, health and safety codes; the company uses a web of LLCs and shell companies to evade responsibility, and the negligence has led to rodents, structural decay, fire hazards and criminal activity, according to a news release.

None of the 408 properties — occupied or vacant — at the center of the litigation have a certificate of compliance, according to the 31-page complaint, which also alleges hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid blight violations. The defendants owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding property taxes, too, the suit says.

""We want our $500,000 in tickets. We want to be paid that which they owe,"" Mallett said.

The city of Detroit wants all of the properties to pass a compliance inspection, leading to a certificate of compliance, he said. Until then, the city is asking the judge to order the defendants to notify tenants that rent must be paid into an escrow account, according to the suit.

""We're requesting the court to order, as well, that no evictions take place while this process is going on,"" Mallett said.

Their system – known as EQAS – replaces vulnerable maths-based encryption with a signature tool that's more secure

Blockchain technology – which provides a shared, decentralised digital ledger that stores tamper-proof records – has shown revolutionary potential in areas like financial services and supply chain management.

Usually, blockchains use specialised encryption algorithms to verify each transaction, ensure the ledger's security, and provide transparent access to data.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July  02, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (TSX-V: DMGI) (OTCQB: DMGGF) (FRANKFURT: 6AX) (""DMG"" or the ""Company""), a vertically integrated blockchain and data center technology company, today announces its preliminary operational results for June 2025:

During June 2025, DMG's realized hashrate was 1.56 EH/s, down 18% from the 1.89 EH/s reported in May, as the Company experienced an unscheduled electrical outage of nearly two days at its Christina Lake facility and faced continued challenges operating its hydro infrastructure.

In particular, a regional lightning storm resulted in the tripping of a main substation breaker that required extensive servicing. In addition, DMG's hydro infrastructure has been experiencing downtime related to contamination due to manufacturer quality control issues. This problem has been actively addressed over the past several weeks. The Company believes that with additional servicing and close monitoring, it can bring the hashrate of its current hydro mining capacity closer to its 0.4 EH/s potential, even as the summer heat sets in. The hydro miners are designed to operate in ambient temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius, albeit at lower efficiencies.

Based on experience gained from its initial 6-megawatt hydro mining container build-out, DMG now plans to source new hydro infrastructure from alternative manufacturers; for its planned Christina Lake building hydro deployment, the Company will utilize its existing electrical distribution and shelving, while sourcing key hydro infrastructure components from best-of-breed vendors. This should simplify the transition from air-cooled to direct liquid-cooled mining, while giving DMG improved quality control over its supply chain and infrastructure component integration. DMG intends to build a pilot system in its Christina Lake building this summer ahead of its planned expansion to grow to 3 EH/s by the end of calendar 2025.

DMG's bitcoin balance was 341 BTC at the end of June. The Company sold bitcoin during the month to fund operating expenses and further reduce its loan balance with Sygnum Bank, in line with prior guidance.

Agreement for a New Bitcoin Mining Site in Canada outside of British Columbia

DMG announces it has executed a binding agreement following its May 2023 announcement to develop a new data processing center with access to low-cost renewable energy located in a Canadian province outside of British Columbia. The agreement supports DMG's longer-term strategy to identify pockets of low-cost energy, based on which it intends to eventually operate the majority of its Bitcoin mining fleet. Once fully operational, DMG expects to initially add approximately 1 EH/s of Bitcoin mining capacity, depending on the selected equipment and the commissioning timeframe, currently projected for the second half of calendar 2026.

DMG's CEO, Sheldon Bennett, commented, ""In June, we encountered several unforeseen issues with our Bitcoin mining infrastructure, but we also advanced our longer-term objective to migrate our Bitcoin mining to where energy is less expensive. We continue to make progress in our discussions with Canadian governmental agencies, with a focus on the Department of National Defence, as Canada has pledged to increase its military spending, with AI as a key pillar of that growth. Regarding Systemic Trust, we remain encouraged regarding custody clients onboarding to the platform as well as expanding the platform capability beyond custody.""

Grant of Stock Options and RSUs

DMG announces the granting of stock options and RSUs to employees and directors of the Company. A total of 201,607 stock options (""Options"") and 1,275,000 restricted stock units (""RSUs"") have been granted. The Options are exercisable over five years at a price of $0.285 per share, with vesting in 25% increments on the six-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month anniversaries of the grant date. The RSUs vest in one year; these grants are designed to create an incentive structure that aligns longer-term performance with the Company's growth.

A new player is rapidly gaining traction in the Web3 space, promising a comprehensive and user-friendly experience that aims to redefine how we interact with digital assets.

Best Wallet (BEST), a burgeoning Web3 wallet, has already made significant waves, raising an impressive $13.6 million in its ongoing presale.

Source – Cryptonews YouTube Channel

Summary

More big investors are adding crypto to their portfolios this year, and more everyday users are joining the space. Because of this, secure crypto wallets are now in high demand.

Best Wallet stands out by offering strong security and an easy-to-use design. It's non-custodial and already has over 250,000 monthly users, making it one of the top choices.

Best Wallet keeps private keys safe with features like MPC-CMP architecture and biometric login. Since users stay in full control of their assets, it's a strong option during a time when exchange hacks are still a major concern.

The wallet supports over 60 blockchains from the start. Users can connect to Ethereum, Bitcoin, BSC, and more without switching apps.

Thanks to partnerships with Alchemy Pay and MoonPay, users can easily convert fiat into crypto. Its built-in swap tool also helps users get the best rates across 330+ DEXs and 30 bridges for cross-chain trades.

Alpha doesn't wait. Neither should you. 🎯Upcoming Tokens in Best Wallet puts early-stage projects in your hands. 🌐1️⃣ See what's trending before the crowd2️⃣ Learn about each project with in-app info3️⃣ Buy and track your tokens all in one placeDownload Best Wallet today!… pic.twitter.com/SQofs9A6Na

A standout feature called “Upcoming Tokens” gives early access to new presale tokens before they hit big exchanges. This helps users discover hidden gems early, keeping them ahead of market trends.

Holding $BEST, the wallet's native token, reduces transaction fees and will soon allow gas-free transactions. Best Wallet also plans to launch the Best Card, a debit card that lets users spend their crypto in real life. Those who hold $BEST will get exclusive cashback rewards.

The wallet makes it easy to move or merge other wallets by letting users import them with a few taps. Future updates include tools like limit orders, MEV protection, and even derivatives trading.

Since these premium tools will need $BEST to access, demand for the token may rise. Many top crypto analysts already see $BEST as one of the best wallet tokens to watch.

The $BEST token gives users full access to everything Best Wallet offers, including lower fees, voting rights, and upcoming features. As the token's uses continue to grow, top crypto influencers expect its value to rise after it gets listed on exchanges.

The ongoing Best Wallet presale offers a smart entry point, especially with more big investors moving into crypto. So far, the presale has raised over $13.6 million.

Erebor, a new digital bank with a focus on crypto and emerging technologies, has made progress in entering the US financial system.

The bank has applied for a national bank charter, and it intends to cater to technology firms and investors in areas such as artificial intelligence, defence, manufacturing, and digital assets.

The initiative is being backed by a group of high-profile tech investors, including Founders Fund and a group of entrepreneurs with prior links to defence tech and venture capital. Erebor is structured as a digital-only institution and plans to operate from a main office in Columbus, Ohio, with a secondary location in New York.

According to its application, the bank intends to hold stablecoins on its balance sheet. These digital tokens are designed to mirror the value of government-issued currencies and are typically backed by reserves. Erebor's stated goal is to provide financial infrastructure to sectors that have struggled to find consistent banking partners in the traditional system.

The move follows the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, which had served as a primary financial partner for early-stage tech firms and venture capital investors. Following SVB's failure, many startups experienced difficulty accessing funds and meeting operational needs such as payroll, as larger banks were often unwilling to serve riskier, non-traditional clients.

Officials from Erebor noted the intent to support companies and individuals often underserved by existing institutions, particularly those working in innovative or highly specialised industries. According to Yahoo Finance, leadership will include representatives with previous experience in fintech and stablecoin development.

With Donald Trump's presidential victory marked by Bitcoin's price reaching an all-time high and the president launching his own coins ($TRUMP and USD1), the current administration is far more entangled with cryptocurrency than its predecessor. But as the cryptocurrency market becomes increasingly aligned with US political power, it calls for a discussion about what this era means for democracy more broadly.

While American dominance over the global cryptocurrency market has been the norm, other recent trends are increasingly at odds with the values upon which cryptocurrency was founded. Most notable has been a change in who shapes the narratives of cryptocurrency, as the tech elite has taken over from the tech enthusiasts. Figures like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, JD Vance, and David Sacks are becoming the mainstream faces of cryptocurrency. This influx of the tech elite is bringing with it specific interpretations of what financial as well as democratic systems should look like. In this new context, the growing influence of cryptocurrency raises pressing questions about how it will shape—or undermine—democracies, especially those of the European Union.

While cryptocurrency is commonly dated back to Bitcoin's software launch in 2009, its origins stretch back to the 1980s, when discussions around ‘digital cash' sought to tackle political concerns relevant to democracy. David Chaum's papers on untraceable payments and transaction anonymity were rooted in the belief that, as credit card transactions became the norm, privacy had to be protected from government surveillance. These early ideas envisioned a decentralized digital currency, cryptocurrency, that could serve as an alternative source of finance that would empower people by helping to protect democratic principles such as freedom of expression and participation, public elections, and independent public opinion.

With the emergence of blockchain technology, a distributed public database/ledger, these ideas could be leveraged to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions in a manner that supported democratic values like transparency and accountability. Rooted in Silicon Valley's techno-utopianism of the 1990s, cryptocurrencies promised a better society where money and value could flow between actors without the intermediation of banks.

Today, however, cryptocurrencies are being re-envisioned according to less utopian futures, as they seem increasingly focused on surviving crises rather than improving society. Bitcoin's launch during the 2008 Financial Crisis highlights this historical connection between cryptocurrency and crisis, while announcements of an American strategic cryptocurrency reserve can be tied to fears of US monetary default. Such fears of default are fueled by growing concerns that the US national debt will hit its debt ceiling, alongside apprehension about corporate debt and student loans. If a US default were to occur, the value of the dollar would experience a sudden decrease as confidence in the American economy would shrink. Hence, in spite of cryptocurrency's price fluctuations, some view a strategic reserve of an inflation-proof currency like Bitcoin as a potential financial safety net against the shocks of a collapsing fiat currency and the likely rush to alternative currencies.

It should, therefore, be of no surprise that cryptocurrencies have gained the attention of those who believe in (or desire) destructive crises where the entire banking system would collapse, attracting the ‘survivalist right' and an apocalypse-fearing tech elite. But as this post-apocalypse currency becomes another tool in the tech elite's survival kit (and in its investment portfolios), its original utopian and democratically oriented objectives are fading.

With the ethos of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain being decentralization and freedom from government supervision, the notion that someone may ‘rule over' a cryptocurrency or even exert the same level of centralized authority as with a fiat currency appears redundant. Yet, cryptocurrencies still hold political significance. As Finn Brunton explains: “Coins symbolize access to and control over tangible forms of value, physical manifestations of new sovereign orders.”

Cryptocurrencies manifest a particular order in the same way that the American Dollar, the Euro, the Chinese Yuan, and the British Pound uphold the interests of specific actors. On paper, a cryptocurrency-based order empowers the public, returning sovereignty to all those partaking in the market. But current events seem to indicate that cryptocurrencies are becoming dominated by the interests of the few. Beyond scandals ranging from accusations of celebrity-endorsed cryptocurrency rug pulls to FTX's embezzlement case, the widening reach of the tech elite questions whether cryptocurrencies are as democratic and decentralized as promised.

The most notable example of this elite takeover is Elon Musk's relationship to Dogecoin, whose price has at times been tied to Musk's actions. Notable instances include price bumps during Musk's purchase of Twitter, a spike following the announcement of Musk's Department of Governmental Efficiency, and even fluctuations due to Musk's 2021 appearance on Saturday Night Live. Albeit defending his public statements about Dogecoin as ‘jokes,' Musk holds a form of authority over the currency, which, considering that he may have holdings in Dogecoin, relates to his own interests. While it can be argued that its ‘meme' coin status makes it a unique case, Dogecoin currently holds the ninth greatest market cap on Forbes' daily list of cryptocurrency prices, highlighting the power a single individual can have in promoting what was initially an obscure coin.

This individual authority is taken further with the 2025 establishment of World Liberty Financial by President Donald Trump and his sons. Aiming to be a cryptocurrency bank, the firm offers the president the dual position of being a major industry player while dictating what is allowed in the industry. Moreover, the tech elite is investing in World Liberty, including Ondo Finance, a start-up supported by Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, as well as crypto-entrepreneurs who faced criminal investigations like Justin Sun or Arthur Hayes.

The resulting potential for price and market manipulation, as well as conflicts of interest, such as the ability of top $TRUMP buyers to win a dinner with the president, pose a clear threat to democracy. But just as worrying is the potential for power to be concentrated among the tech elite in a way that increasingly allows for operations like a 51% attack. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or colluding group gains control of over 50% of the cryptocurrency blockchain's hash rate (i.e., computing power). These actors can then block the confirmation of new transactions, rewrite part of the blockchain, and double-spend coins (i.e., use the same money twice). By obstructing cryptocurrency certifications and enabling corrupt actions, these attacks erode democratic principles such as accountability and transparency.

More broadly, without transaction verification and certification, a democracy cannot retain healthy levels of trust. If a group can manipulate the blockchain and double-spend as they please, users risk losing the trust they placed in the cryptocurrency itself as well as their trust in the rule of law and in democratic institutions. Moreover, these attacks challenge the ‘one person, one vote' principle that not only defines democracy but also shapes the consensus mechanisms behind cryptocurrencies. By opposing the decentralized features of cryptocurrencies, 51% attacks erase their democratic potential.

At this time, due to their complexity and cost, 51% attacks have focused on small cryptocurrencies. Since the attacking actor requires large levels of computational power, which requires running costly mining rigs, the risk is minimized. But as the world's wealthiest tech entrepreneurs venture into a market where Bitcoin mining is centralized (six mining pools produce over 80% of the blocks), there is a vulnerability for them to exploit, given the weakness of crypto-regulation.

As such, the American cryptocurrency market is shaping into a potential source of unregulated centralized power; authority at a scale previously inaccessible in traditional financial markets.

With the US being the leading Western country in cryptocurrency adoption, ranking 4th globally in 2024, the elite takeover of cryptocurrencies can seem American-centric. Yet, actors like the EU face added challenges, most notably the emergence of a cryptocurrency-based order that does not reflect its values of democracy, along with the threat of foreign interference.

The EU's current crypto-ecosystem is not only in its infancy but is also dominated by American cryptocurrencies. According to a report by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), USD-based stablecoins represented “nearly 90% of the total market capitalization of stablecoins” and “over 70% of the total volume of crypto-assets traded”. Meanwhile, on the user side, European cryptocurrency penetration remains low; the EBA-ESMA report found that 1.6% of the total EU population used Decentralized Finance (DeFi) compared to 2.2% of Americans. The gap widens for cryptocurrency ownership, where, in 2024, 15.5% of Americans owned cryptocurrency, while the closest EU Member State was Slovenia with 9.9%.

This low adoption rate and the absence of European-designed crypto-solutions present a challenge in ensuring that the EU's democratic values are represented in the global cryptocurrency order. European DeFi projects are being developed, but undertakings like European cryptocurrency reserves are lacking and face reticence from the European Central Bank. The closest example would be the digital euro, which has been in its preparation phase since 2023 and would still be issued by central banks, forgoing cryptocurrency's decentralized nature.

The main concern regarding the EU's slow adoption of cryptocurrency is that, as it lags behind, other countries and organizations are already shaping the global cryptocurrency market according to their own, often American and Trumpian, visions. For example, World Liberty Financial signed a letter of intent with Pakistan's Crypto Council (a government-backed initiative), and an Abu Dhabi investment firm used 2 billion USD worth of USD1 to invest in the crypto-platform Binance, highlighting how World Liberty is positioning itself as a vehicle for global political influence. Simultaneously, the EU's lagging status is creating internal fragmentation as Member States like Malta and Luxembourg grant American cryptocurrency platforms licenses to operate in a bid to keep up with the evolving financial trends. The disagreements resulting from these decisions risk weakening the EU's position, leaving the global crypto-based sovereign order to be influenced by an American tech elite whose visions of the future differ from European interpretations of equality, the rule of law, and economic growth.

Additionally, the EU faces heightened concern regarding the aforementioned challenge of blockchain manipulation. Although European blockchain companies are emerging, nearly 48% of all blockchain start-ups are based in the US alongside major blockchain developers (e.g., IBM, Microsoft, Coinbase). As such, a European crypto-ecosystem would currently be reliant on non-European technologies, exposing it to 51% attacks by foreign actors but also to hackable blockchains. Blockchain vulnerabilities have been mistakenly baked into the code, such as ZCash's counterfeiting flaw, or through software client vulnerabilities - for instance, Bitcoin's main client, Bitcoin Core, had a bug capable of crashing Bitcoin's blockchain nodes. Not only do these vulnerabilities weaken European financial sovereignty, but as the EU explores blockchain applications in election verification, they also create a threat of foreign interference in direct democratic processes as well.

However, with the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), a divergence is emerging as the EU's role as crypto-regulator opposes the deregulated, free market approach taken by the US. Aimed at reducing the risks of crypto-asset purchases, MiCAR targets issues ranging from market integrity and manipulation to terrorism, money laundering, and the safeguarding of the blockchain. Consequently, it is setting guardrails against the exploitation of cryptocurrency by private interests. Beyond the potential clash with actors such as World Liberty, MiCAR is already being used to raise questions about Elon Musk's relationship with Dogecoin and the related lack of regulation in the US. Encouraging accountability and the rule of law, MiCAR demonstrates an attempt by the EU to defend its democratic principles in the cryptocurrency market but requires additional legislative support and the accelerated development of the EU's crypto-ecosystem.

As it stands, the low levels of European crypto-adoption are arguably working in the EU's favor by reducing the risk posed by American technological dominance in the cryptocurrency sector. But with cryptocurrency gaining in popularity and governance frameworks remaining underdeveloped, the EU must urgently look beyond regulation and towards building resilient financial systems that address the risks of cryptocurrencies if it hopes to uphold its democratic values in an increasingly crypto-influenced world.","{'href': 'https://www.techpolicy.press', 'title': 'Tech Policy Press'}","cryptocurrency"

As more crypto firms make inroads into mainstream finance, Ripple is applying for a banking license with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

Although the company is best known for its XRP cryptocurrency and ledger, Ripple launched a stablecoin, RLUSD, last year. If the banking license is approved, the firm would be subject to federal and state oversight, and the New York Department of Financial Services would regulate RLUSD.

Ripple's application comes just days after Circle submitted its own request for a bank charter. If approved, Circle would establish a new entity—the First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A. With charters in place, Circle and Ripple could potentially offer tailored services to institutional clients in the future, including tokenization of real-world assets.

Ripple's leadership also confirmed the company has applied for a Master Account with the Federal Reserve. If granted, this would allow Ripple to hold RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed, providing its stablecoin with an added layer of security.

Both Circle and Ripple are moving quickly to capitalize on the recent passage of the GENIUS act, which establishes a regulatory framework for U.S. stablecoins.

The legislation has driven a surge in stablecoin interest in recent months. Major retailers like Walmart and Amazon, along with tech giant Meta, are among the many players considering the launch of their own brand-specific stablecoins.

Financial services provider Fiserv has also unveiled plans to launch a compliance-geared stablecoin designed for use by its network of financial institutions.

As more traditional players explore stablecoins, crypto companies are expanding into mainstream financial services. For example, crypto exchange Kraken announced it is launching a P2P payments app that could potentially compete with fintechs like PayPal and Venmo.

Meanwhile, new platforms are emerging to bridge the gap between checking and crypto accounts. Ripple unveiled plans to develop a cross-border payments solution in Europe through a partnership with OpenPayd, which provides the infrastructure to move certain regional fiat currencies into RLUSD—and vice versa.

Similarly, Circle plans to roll out Circle Payment Network, a cross-border system designed to facilitate bank transfers between USDC and fiat.

These launches underscore the continued push of crypto companies into the heart of traditional financial services—a trend likely to accelerate as regulatory clarity improves in the U.S.

Erebor, a new digital bank with a focus on crypto and emerging technologies, has made progress in entering the US financial system.

The bank has applied for a national bank charter, and it intends to cater to technology firms and investors in areas such as artificial intelligence, defence, manufacturing, and digital assets.

The initiative is being backed by a group of high-profile tech investors, including Founders Fund and a group of entrepreneurs with prior links to defence tech and venture capital. Erebor is structured as a digital-only institution and plans to operate from a main office in Columbus, Ohio, with a secondary location in New York.

According to its application, the bank intends to hold stablecoins on its balance sheet. These digital tokens are designed to mirror the value of government-issued currencies and are typically backed by reserves. Erebor's stated goal is to provide financial infrastructure to sectors that have struggled to find consistent banking partners in the traditional system.

The move follows the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, which had served as a primary financial partner for early-stage tech firms and venture capital investors. Following SVB's failure, many startups experienced difficulty accessing funds and meeting operational needs such as payroll, as larger banks were often unwilling to serve riskier, non-traditional clients.

Officials from Erebor noted the intent to support companies and individuals often underserved by existing institutions, particularly those working in innovative or highly specialised industries. According to Yahoo Finance, leadership will include representatives with previous experience in fintech and stablecoin development.

Bitcoin BTC$109,203.92 topped the $110,000 mark for the first time since June 11 after more than $407.78 million flowed into U.S.-listed bitcoin spot ETFs on Wednesday and before a key U.S. jobs report due later in the day.

The ETF inflow boosted the lifetime tally to $49.04 billion, according to data source SoSoValue. 

BTC's upswing brought cheer to the broader market, lifting major tokens such as XRP XRP$2.2492, ether ETH$2,573.04, SOL SOL$150.28 and ADA ADA$0.5902. Standout gainers were memecoins BONK and FARTCOIN, which boasted 24-hour gains of over 20%, a sign of increased investor willingness to take risk. The CoinDesk Memecoin Index gained 12.6% while the CoindDesk 20 Index of the largest tokens rose 4.3%.

Traders are looking toward the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due for release later Thursday while maintaining the constructive outlook.

""The historical high of around $112K, set at the end of May, may be tested for strength or updated before the end of this week, given the fairly high risk appetite in global markets. However, it is worth remembering that the monthly U.S. employment report, due later Thursday, could serve as both a catalyst and an insurmountable obstacle,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at the FxPro said in an email.

The U.S. employment picture was far stronger than forecast in June, furthering Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's insistence on remaining patient with respect to easing monetary policy.

Nonfarm payrolls grew 147,000 last month, according to a report Thursday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economist forecasts had been for job growth of 110,000. That's also modestly up from May job growth of 144,000 (revised from an originally reported 139,000).

The unemployment rate for June was 4.1% versus an expected 4.3% and 4.2% in May.

The price of bitcoin BTC$109,203.92 dipped modestly in the minutes following the report's release to just under $109,000. Bitcoin had been on a steady climb higher in the days ahead of the report, topping $110,000 for the first time in about one month just hours ago.

U.S. stock index futures rose modestly after the data, with the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 each ahead by about 0.3%. The 10-year Treasury yield spiked nine basis points to 4.36%.

Market participants are closely monitoring economic data for signals about the Federal Reserve's next move. While there's been some chatter from at least a couple of Fed officials about a July rate cut, Chairman Jerome Powell has remained insistent that the economy is in a good spot and the central bank can thus stay patient as it considers the need for monetary ease.

This stance has put him directly at odds with President Trump, who has been equally insistent that the Fed needs to cut now and in a sizable way.

Prior to the Thursday morning data, traders had placed 75% odds that the Fed would hold steady at its next meeting in late July, according to CME FedWatch. At the subsequent meeting in September, however, traders are pricing in a 95% chance of one or more 25 basis point rate cuts.

Fifteen minutes following the news, the odds for holding steady in July had soared to 95% and the chances of a September move had declined to 78%.

Checking other report details, average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in June versus expectations for 0.3% and May's 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 3.7% against forecasts for 3.9% and May's 3.8%.

Today's employment report was released a day early due to the July 4 holiday weekend, with the NYSE and Nasdaq closing at 1 p.m. ET and bond markets at 2 p.m. ET Thursday, while all U.S. markets will remain shut on Friday.

Weekly initial jobless claims were released as well on Thursday and are also showing strength, dipping to 233,000 from last week's 237,000 and forecasts for 240,000.

Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$2.2492 has risen by over 3.5% in the past 24 hours, with volume in the Deribit-listed options market suggesting bullish expectations.

Since July 1, higher-level July 25 call options at strikes of $3.00 and $4.00 and the Sept. 28 expiry call at the $2.80 strike have emerged as the most traded bets, according to data source Amberdata.

A call option gives the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price at a later date. The option represents a bullish view on the market. For instance, the $3 strike call buyer is betting that XRP's spot price will top that level by July 25. On Deribit, one options contract represents one XRP.

A closer look at the flows reveals that the higher volume ranking for the $3 calls primarily stems from buy trades. In the past 24 hours, the $3 strike call has seen 2 million contracts change hands in investor buy trades (market makers on the opposite side). Conversely, investors have been mostly sellers or writers in the $2.8 call.

The $3 call is also the most popular bet in terms of the increase in open interest, or the number of active or open contracts, in the past seven days.

The increased activity in the higher strike calls follows strengthening expectations for a spot ETF debut in the U.S. According to Bloomberg's analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the probability that the U.S. SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF now stands at 95% – almost a done deal.

On Wednesday, fintech firm Ripple, which utilizes XRP to facilitate cross-border transactions, announced that it has applied for a national banking license at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

""If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market,"" Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on X.

XRP's bitcoin-denominated price, represented by the Binance-listed XRP/BTC pair, may be headed higher, having broken out of a falling wedge pattern.

The falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern, characterized by two converging trendlines that indicate a narrowing range of price movement. The converging nature of trendlines suggests that sellers are slowly losing steam. Hence, a subsequent move above the upper trendline is said to confirm renewed bull dominance.

XRP/BTC has risen above the upper trendline, confirming the bullish breakout. The pattern indicates that the correction from the April highs has ended and the broader XRP bullish trend has resumed.

While the wedge breakout indicates that the path of least resistance is on the higher side, popular averages, 50-day, 100-day and 200-day SMAs disagree.

Both the 50- and 100-day SMAs are trending south, having recently crossed bearishly below the 200-day SMA. Note, however, that moving averages are lagging indicators and take backseat to the bullish wedge breakout.

 Gaming industry veteran John Smedley is making his first foray into Web3 gaming with a new AAA shooter featuring Tezos layer-2 blockchain Etherlink. 

John Smedley, a gaming industry veteran and former CEO of Daybreak Game Company (formerly Sony Online Entertainment), is making his first foray into Web3 gaming with a new AAA shooter featuring Tezos layer-2 (L2) blockchain Etherlink.

The Smedley-led Distinct Possibility Studios (DPS) has raised $30.5 million in a funding round led by the gaming-focused venture capital firm Bitkraft and the European hedge fund management company Brevan Howard, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph on Thursday.

The funds will be used to develop its new open-world massively multiplayer online first-person shooter (MMOFPS), Reaper Actual, which it says will integrate Etherlink to enable tradeable Web3 components like characters, bases, skins and more.

“The Tezos Foundation and the development team behind Etherlink share our vision about the game being the most important thing,” Smedley told Cointelegraph. “The developers have prioritized building a chain that reflects this; it's right there in their tagline: Play, Own, Trade.”

Smedley is most famous in the gaming industry for co-creating EverQuest, a 3D fantasy-themed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released by Sony Online Entertainment in March 1999.

He also co-developed a free-to-play MMOFPS, PlanetSide 2, which featured large-scale battles supporting up to 2,000 concurrent players across massive areas of continents.

The latest funding round supports the accelerated development of Reaper Actual, a new AAA shooter that will be available on Steam, the Epic Games Store and via reaperactual.com upon launch.

Smedley teased the new game in an X post in March, showing a photo next to Planetside 2 creative director Matt Higby and Fallout artist Tramell Ray Isaac.

The DPS team will be announcing its “Foundation” Alpha release in the coming weeks, which will include access to the game and onchain tradeable assets.

Smedley's choice of Tezos and Etherlink for his latest MMOFPS game aims to support substantial transaction volumes, energy-efficient protocols and secure smart contracts, DPS said in the announcement.

Tezos and Etherlink's vision also aligns with Smedley's strategy of bringing traditional gamers into Web3 by making it optional, focusing on making it easy to access, he said.

“Certainly, the low fees are really good for our players, but it's also the general approach to community first development,” Smedley said, adding:

According to Alex Chong, chief operating officer of GameFi at Everest Ventures Group, the DPS' Etherlink announcement “might mark a renewed ambition, but also brings déjà vu.”

“Had this news dropped during the 2021-2022 cycle, I wouldn't have batted an eye,” Chong told Cointelegraph, referring to repeated headlines of major gaming firms moving into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or Web3.

“But we've seen a two-year drought since then — less fanfare, more fallout,” he said, adding:

According to Chong, the drop in NFT and Web3 adoption in gaming in the past few years highlights the core issue, which is that Web3 gaming “hasn't yet matured its player base.”

In traditional gaming, players invest time because the game is fun, competitive, or emotionally resonant, while in Web3, too many players are just chasing the next airdrop, Chong observed.

“The second token prices dip or NFT floors fall, they're gone. This pattern — purely profit-driven engagement — makes it difficult for even AAA titles to sustain daily active users or meaningful retention,” he said.

 Bitcoin's rally above $109,000 was backed by strong onchain and technical signals. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin rallied above $109,000 as the global money supply reached new highs.

BTC open interest rose by 10% amid a strong Coinbase Premium and stable funding rate, pointing to spot demand.

Multiple technical indicators suggest a major breakout is underway, with analysts eyeing a $137,000 Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped on Wednesday, rising by 3.6% and reaching $109,730 for the first time since June 12. The recovery occurred at the back of the global money supply (M2), reaching a new all-time high above $55 trillion. 

If Bitcoin closes the daily candle above $108,500, it will confirm a strong bullish engulfing pattern, increasing the likelihood of new highs sooner rather than later. 

Bitcoin's recent price jump to $109,500 from $105,200 was outlined by a sharp rise in derivatives activity, pointing to renewed momentum. Open interest (OI) across major futures exchanges surged by 10%, or approximately $3.2 billion, signaling a substantial influx of capital into the market. The increase was primarily driven by long positions, suggesting confidence in further upside.

Despite the uptick in price and OI, funding rates remained stable across perpetual futures markets. This indicates a balanced sentiment between long and short traders, and more importantly, that the rally was not driven by excessive leverage. From a bullish standpoint, stable funding during a price increase implies that the uptrend may be more sustainable.

A notable short squeeze accompanied the move, with over $196 million in short positions liquidated within the past 12 hours. This liquidation cascade likely accelerated Bitcoin's push past key resistance levels.

Further validating the buy-side strength, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index stayed elevated throughout the move. This metric, which tracks the price difference between Coinbase and other major exchanges, suggests consistent spot buying pressure from US-based institutional and retail investors, adding weight to the bullish case.

With Bitcoin decisively breaking out of its recent sideways range, market analysts are increasingly confident that a new all-time high is imminent. According to trader Rekt Capital, a record weekly close above $109,300 this Sunday could place BTC above its final major resistance zone, effectively “unlocking” price discovery and paving the way for new highs.

Adding to the bullish narrative, analyst Jackis highlighted that Bitcoin recently reached its lowest volatility levels since 2023, a rare occurrence seen only seven times in its history. “Every time we've hit these levels, a major volatility spike followed within five weeks, often sooner,” Jackis noted, suggesting a significant move is on the horizon.

Meanwhile, technical analyst Titan of Crypto pointed to a confirmed bullish MACD crossover on the daily chart as a key momentum signal. The analyst added that BTC is attempting a breakout from a bullish flag pattern, with a successful push likely triggering a “magnet effect” toward the $137,000 region.

 BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF is earning more in annual fees than the firm's signature S&P 500 fund, despite having an expense ratio almost nine times higher. 

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is now earning more in annual fees from its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund than its flagship S&P 500 fund, according to a recent report.

“IBIT overtaking IVV in annual fee revenue is reflective of both the surging investor demand for Bitcoin and the significant fee compression in core equity exposure,” NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci told Bloomberg on Wednesday. 

With an expense ratio of 0.25% and around $75 billion in assets under management (AUM), BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin (BTC) ETF (IBIT) has generated $187.2 million in annual fees, approximately $100,000 more than its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV). 

The IVV, which launched in 2000, is over eight times larger than the IBIT, with approximately $624 billion in assets, but charges almost nine times less, at just 0.03%.

Several crypto executives were quick to comment on the findings. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said in an X post, “Bitcoin has Wall Street's full, undivided attention now.” Strive Funds chief financial officer Ben Pham said Bitcoin will be “the death” of active management and passive indexation portfolios. 

Crypto trader Cade O'Neill said it “says everything about where capital is headed. Institutions aren't just curious anymore, they're committed.” 

Meanwhile, McKay Research founder James McKay said the news was bullish and “Probably something.”

Since its January 2024 launch, BlackRock's IBIT has recorded $52.4 billion in inflows, the highest of any US spot Bitcoin ETF, according to Farside data. 

The IBIT closed the trading day on Wednesday at $62.41, up 4.31% across the day, according to Google Finance data. The uptick comes as Bitcoin's price spiked 2.82% over the same period, which is now trading at $108,660.

Meanwhile, the IVV closed the day at $623.42, up 0.44% over the day.

US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs marked their first net outflow day on Wednesday after 15 consecutive trading days of inflows.

U.S. Budget Cuts Are Robbing Early-Career Scientists of Their Future

Canceled grants and slashed budgets are disproportionately affecting junior health researchers, dealing a major blow to the future of science and society in the U.S.

By Rachel Nuwer edited by Lauren J. Young

People rally during a ""Kill the Cuts"" protest against U.S. President Donald Trump's funding cuts on research, health and higher education in Detroit, Michigan, on April 8, 2025.

As a young doctoral researcher at a university in the southern U.S., Camilo felt like he was finally closing in on his dream of becoming a leader in the next generation of HIV scholars. His recent work has helped hundreds of LGBTQ+ Latino people access HIV prevention programs and preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a medication that reduces HIV infection risk. But these lifesaving efforts—and Camilo's hopes of a career focused on directly helping people in his community—came to a screeching halt one recent Friday afternoon: he opened an e-mail that said a National Institutes of Health grant, vital to his work, had been terminated.

“I saw an image of a floating pair of scissors clipping my future,” says Camilo, who asked to use a pseudonym, citing fear of retaliation.

Since researchers first began receiving grant termination letters in late February, massive chunks of federal funding for science and health have been canceled on a near-weekly basis. The Trump administration has framed these cuts as a way to reduce wasteful spending, refocus research priorities and eliminate ideological bias. Grants have been flagged for containing keywords such as “women,” “diverse,” “minority” and “racially.” Camilo's research checked all the boxes for the administration's crackdown on so-called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) research. He had been expecting the bad news, but when it came, it was still crushing. “You're losing everything,” he says.

Grant Watch, a project tracking Trump's scientific funding cancellations, has tallied more than 2,482 terminated NIH grants worth $8.7 billion and 1,669 terminated National Science Foundation grants worth $1.5 billion as of mid-June. An NSF spokesperson declined an interview request from Scientific American but wrote in an e-mail that “we remain committed to awarding grants and funding all areas of science and engineering.” The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to direct requests for an interview for this article. An NIH representative did not respond to a list of written questions but said the agency “is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.”

“I saw an image of a floating pair of scissors clipping my future.” —Camilo, doctoral researcher 

On June 16 Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled against cuts to hundreds of grants for projects through the NIH, calling these cuts “void and illegal” and indicating that funding must be reinstated. Experts expect the Trump administration will appeal the ruling, which does not apply to all of the terminated grants compiled by Grant Watch.

Virtually every research sector has been disrupted in some way since Trump took office and issued a slew of executive orders affecting science and health care. Tens of thousands of federal employees at the HHS, NIH and other science- and health-related agencies have been laid off. Universities are bracing for major federal funding cuts by freezing new hiring and cutting graduate student positions. Private research companies and industries have also seen some federal support severed—including support for the development of new vaccines and cancer treatments.

“When you cut fellowships and grants, you're cutting the people that are doing the work.” —Andrew Pekosz, virologist, Johns Hopkins University

Of the many thousands of researchers grappling with the fallout, one group is being disproportionately affected: early-career scientists. Senior researchers often have a diversity of funding streams, but for those starting out in the field, “grants serve as the foundation for an entire career of work,” says Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. With the cuts, “there are some [early-career researchers] who we will undoubtedly lose from the scientific and health enterprises.”

Scientific American posted on a Reddit space for scientists, researchers and lab workers to ask people how they are grappling with the professional and personal whiplash of these interruptions. More than 50 people responded with public comments; dozens more sent private messages expressing fears, frustrations and concerns. We interviewed several of them—and other junior researchers—about how the cuts are affecting their current and future work and what the long-term consequences may be for the U.S.

Students and postdoctoral researchers perform the vast majority of research at academic institutions, so in addition to disrupting individual lives, the cuts have thrown whole laboratories into disarray. “When you cut fellowships and grants, you're cutting the people that are doing the work,” says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist who leads a lab at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Pekosz's lab had recently lost a COVID-related grant that was supposed to run until September, which forced him to dismiss a postdoc and a research associate because he lacked funding for their salaries. He was able to cobble together support for a Ph.D. student on the project but had to shorten the timeline for the research. Although the lab's grant is among those that Judge Young ordered the NIH to restore, much damage has already been done.

“There's just an overwhelming sense of insecurity.” —Sierra Wilson, Ph.D. student, University of Pittsburgh

Labs that still have funding are also working under high pressure and low morale. “We're constantly asking our PI [principal investigator], ‘Is everything going to be okay? Are we going to be safe?'” says R.K., an undergraduate student at a lab in the Midwest that's investigating treatments for a genetic disease. (R.K. asked to be identified by his initials, citing fear that speaking out could harm his future career.) At weekly meetings, he says, the lab's principal investigator has been pushing the team to publish more papers “in order to show our progress to donor organizations.” If the researchers' NIH funding shrinks, he says, “we would need to persuade our other donors for more money to make up the gap.”

Applied across thousands of U.S. labs, these losses—both tangible and psychological—will add up, Pekosz says. “We're going to see a massive downsizing of biomedical research efforts because there simply is not going to be the funding available to maintain the current level,” he says.

Recent data suggest this is likely to prove correct. For example, according to a 2023 JAMA Health Forum paper, of the 356 drugs that gained Food and Drug Administration approval between 2010 and 2019, more than 84 percent received research funding from the NIH before approval. This research was powered by early-career workers: billions of dollars in NIH funding supported graduate students, postdocs and research staff who conducted the work. Under the current budget cuts, however, “all of this is at risk,” says Fred Ledley, a co-author of the 2023 paper and a professor of natural and applied sciences at Bentley University.

The termination letter for Calimo's grant, which is not affected by Judge Young's ruling, said that it “no longer [effectuated] agency priorities” and that “research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life or reduce illness.” Not only did these claims completely contradict the original score that NIH grant reviewers gave Camilo's application, reading the letter made him feel like he was being “attacked,” he says.

Early-career grants are both crucial stepping stones to larger grants and recognition of a rising researcher's potential. The way the Trump administration's termination letters are worded “delegitimates the scientists and the work they do,” Ranney says. “There's often a deeply personal aspect.”

“I just feel very let down and betrayed by my country.” —Alex, postdoc, University of Colorado

Sometimes, that personal aspect is literally about the researchers themselves. Sierra Wilson, a Ph.D. student at the University of Pittsburgh, assumed her liver-regeneration research would be safe from the cuts. But because Wilson is a first-generation college student from a low-income household, her funding came from a program that aimed to increase diversity in biomedical research, and according to the NIH spokesperson, that program is now “expired.”

When Wilson read her termination letter in late April, she suspected it must be related not to her research but to her classification as an underrepresented scholar. In her case, she says, the federal cuts appear to be targeting “people themselves—which feels more discriminatory.” The NIH spokesperson did not respond to Scientific American's question about the allegation that the termination of grants in the now expired program appeared to be based on researchers' identity or background. According to the spokesperson, “Grantees may appeal terminations for nonalignment with agency priorities.” Wilson sent an appeal request in May, but she does not expect a timely resolution, and to her knowledge, her grant is not affected by Judge Young's decision. University personnel who helped her with the appeals process told her that they expect she will have graduated by the time the NIH gets back to her.

A number of junior researchers say all these blows are taking a heavy toll on their mental health. One of them is Alex, a postdoc at the University of Colorado, whose last name has been withheld for privacy at her request. Alex, who says she comes from a low socioeconomic background and served in the military before pursuing research developing flu vaccines, reports recurring nightmares about losing her postdoctoral job. She “spirals” each time she sees bad news about science at stake, she says, and has recently developed blood pressure issues. “I just feel very let down and betrayed by my country,” she says. “I feel ashamed I even served it.”

Scientists who are just entering their field can spark fresh ideas and bring an appetite for change. But dwindling funding and opportunities threaten to “choke off” this influx of new talent—further constraining the already competitive job market—Pekosz says. He has even seen signs of the scientist-hiring drought spilling over into industry. His graduating Ph.D. students are struggling to secure jobs, he says, adding that his inbox is full of e-mails from prospective students as well as laid-off federal scientists seeking positions in his lab.

Wilson has fading hopes for securing a job in academia when she graduates this fall. “With all these grant and job terminations, the market is flooded, and people aren't hiring because [they don't know] how things will work out,” Wilson says. “There's just an overwhelming sense of insecurity.”

Many scientists, including early-career ones, are contemplating leaving the U.S. to find better support for their research. R.K., who plans to pursue a dual medical degree and Ph.D., is now considering applying to programs in Asia and Europe. Alex, likewise, is strongly thinking about leaving the country. “I would love to be a PI,” she says. “But there's no hope left here.”

If available scientific talent continues to decline in the U.S., experts anticipate a potential domino effect on the economy. In 2024 every dollar invested in NIH research generated a $2.56 return, so the U.S. economy will likely feel the aftershocks of the recent cuts relatively quickly, Ranney says. In the longer term, scientific discoveries “will start to stagnate,” she says.

“We need to recognize that we have a tremendous amount of power.” —Tyler Yasaka, medical and Ph.D. student, University of Pittsburgh

There's also a likelihood that science fields will become a less appealing choice for incoming college students. “I worry that we're going to see a loss of basic scientific skill and knowledge as fewer people go into science,” Ranney says. If the pipeline of new talent slows, the nation's position as a global leader in science will be difficult to maintain—or to recover once it's gone, she says.

It's going to be impossible to replace all the lost federal funding, Ranney says. The remaining hope, then, is that “we can reverse course,” she says.

Some scientists are uniting and pushing back. Tyler Yasaka, a dual medical and Ph.D. student at the University of Pittsburgh, is part of an informal committee at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Hillman Cancer Center that's brainstorming actions researchers and students can take, such as advocating for science in front of elected officials at Capitol Hill. He is also independently launching a podcast to share scientists' experiences with funding. “I think most scientists aren't comfortable speaking out publicly, but if we value democracy, we have an obligation to use our voices,” Yasaka says. “We need to recognize that we have a tremendous amount of power.”

Fortunately for Camilo, his university has found institutional funds to support the remainder of his Ph.D. But he no longer sees a clear path forward after graduation to continue his research on HIV and LGBTQ+ health among Latinos in the U.S.—public health issues that are personally important to him. “It's sad and upsetting,” he says. “I do not want to give up on my community.”

Record-Breaking Results Bring Fusion Power Closer to Reality

Breakthroughs from two rival experiments, Germany's Wendelstein 7-X and the Joint European Torus, suggest the elusive dream of controlled nuclear fusion may be within reach

A twisting ribbon of hydrogen gas, many times hotter than the surface of the sun, has given scientists a tentative glimpse of the future of controlled nuclear fusion—a so-far theoretical source of relatively “clean” and abundant energy that would be effectively fueled by seawater.

The ribbon was a plasma inside Germany's Wendelstein 7-X, an advanced fusion reactor that set a record last May by magnetically “bottling up” the superheated plasma for a whopping 43 seconds. That's many times longer than the device had achieved before.

It's often joked that fusion is only 30 years away—and always will be. But the latest results indicate that scientists and engineers are finally gaining on that prediction. “I think it's probably now about 15 to 20 years [away],” says University of Cambridge nuclear engineer Tony Roulstone, who wasn't involved in the Wendelstein experiments. “The superconducting magnets [that the researchers are using to contain the plasma] are making the difference.”

And the latest Wendelstein result, while promising, has now been countered by British researchers. They say the large Joint European Torus (JET) fusion reactor near Oxford, England, achieved even longer containment times of up to 60 seconds in final experiments before its retirement in December 2023. These results have been kept quiet until now but are due to be published in a scientific journal soon.

According to a press release from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, the as yet unpublished data make the Wendelstein and JET reactors “joint leaders” in the scientific quest to continually operate a fusion reactor at extremely high temperatures. Even so, the press release notes that JET's plasma volume was three times larger than that of the Wendelstein reactor, which would have given JET an advantage—a not-so-subtle insinuation that, all other things being equal, the German project should be considered the true leader.

This friendly rivalry highlights a long-standing competition between devices called stellarators, such as the Wendelstein 7-X, and others called tokamaks, such as JET. Both use different approaches to achieve a promising form of nuclear fusion called magnetic confinement, which aims to ignite a fusion reaction in a plasma of the neutron-heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium.

The latest results come after the successful fusion ignition in 2022 at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) near San Francisco, which used a very different method of fusion called inertial confinement. Researchers there applied giant lasers to a pea-sized pellet of deuterium and tritium, triggering a fusion reaction that gave off more energy than it consumed. (Replications of the experiment have since yielded even more energy.)

The U.S. Department of Energy began constructing the NIF in the late 1990s, with the goal to develop inertial confinement as an alternative to testing thermonuclear bombs, and research for the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal still makes up most of the facility's work. But the ignition was an important milestone on the path toward controlled nuclear fusion—a “holy grail” of science and engineering.

“The 2022 achievement of fusion ignition marks the first time humans have been able to demonstrate a controlled self-sustained burning fusion reaction in the laboratory—akin to lighting a match and that turning into a bonfire,” says plasma physicist Tammy Ma of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which operates the NIF. “With every other fusion attempt prior, the lit match had fizzled.”

The inertial confinement method used by the NIF—the largest and most powerful laser system in the world—may not be best suited for generating electricity, however (although it seems unparalleled for simulating thermonuclear bombs). The ignition in the fuel pellet did give off more energy than put into it by the NIF's 192 giant lasers. But the lasers themselves took more than 12 hours to charge before the experiment and consumed roughly 100 times the energy released by the fusing pellet.

In contrast, calculations suggest a fusion power plant would have to ignite about 10 fuel pellets every second, continuously, for 24 hours a day to deliver utility-scale service. That's an immense engineering challenge but one accepted by several inertial fusion energy startups, such as Marvel Fusion in Germany; other start-ups, such as Xcimer Energy in the U.S., meanwhile, propose using a similar system to ignite just one fuel pellet every two seconds.

Ma admits that the NIF approach faces difficulties, but she points out it's still the only fusion method on Earth to have demonstrated a net energy gain: “Fusion energy, and particularly the inertial confinement approach to fusion, has huge potential, and it is imperative that we pursue it,” she says.

Instead of igniting fuel pellets with lasers, most fusion power projects—like the Wendelstein 7-X and the JET reactor—have chosen a different path to nuclear fusion. Some of the most sophisticated, such as the giant ITER project being built in France, are tokamaks. These devices were first invented in the former Soviet Union and get their name from a Russian acronym for the doughnut-shaped rings of plasma they contain. They work by inducing a powerful electric current inside the superheated plasma doughnut to make it more magnetic and prevent it from striking and damaging the walls of the reactor chamber—the main challenge for the technology.

The Wendelstein 7-X reactor, however, is a stellarator—it uses a related, albeit more complicated, design that doesn't induce an electric current in the plasma but instead tries to control it with powerful external magnets alone. The result is that the plasmas in stellarators are more stable within their magnetic bottles. Reactors like the Wendelstein 7-X aim to operate for a longer period of time than tokamaks can without damaging the reactor chamber.

The Wendelstein researchers plan to soon exceed a minute and eventually to run the reactor continuously for more than half an hour. “There's really nothing in the way to make it longer,” explains physicist Thomas Klinger, who leads the project at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics. “And then we are in an area where nobody has ever been before.”

The overlooked results from the JET reactor reinforce the magnetic confinement approach, although it's still not certain if tokamaks or stellarators will be the ultimate winner in the race for controlled nuclear fusion. Plasma physicist Robert Wolf, who heads the optimization of the Wendelstein reactor, thinks future fusion reactors might somehow combine the stability of stellarators with the relative simplicity of tokamaks, but it's not clear how: “From a scientific view, it is still a bit early to say.”

Several private companies have joined the fusion race. One of the most advanced projects is from the Canadian firm General Fusion, which is based near Vancouver in British Columbia. The company hopes its unorthodox fusion reactor, which uses a hybrid technology called magnetized target fusion, or MTF, will be the first to feed electric power to the grid by the “early to mid-2030s,” according to its chief strategy officer Megan Wilson. “MTF is the fusion equivalent of a diesel engine: practical, durable and cost-effective,” she says.

University of California, San Diego, nuclear engineer George Tynan says private money is flooding the field: “The private sector is now putting in much more money than governments, so that might change things,"" he says. “In these ‘hard tech' problems, like space travel and so on, the private sector seems to be more willing to take more risk.”

Tynan also cites Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology spin-off that plans to build a fusion power plant called ARC in Virginia. The proposed ARC reactor is a type of compact tokamak that intends to start producing up to 400 megawatts of electricity—enough to power about 150,000 homes—in the “early 2030s,” according to a MIT News article.

Roulstone thinks the superconducting electromagnets increasingly used in magnetic confinement reactors will prove to be a key technology. Such magnets are cooled with liquid helium to a few degrees above absolute zero so that they have no electrical resistance. The magnetic fields they create in that state are many times more powerful than those created by regular electromagnets, so they give researchers greater control over superheated hydrogen plasmas. In contrast, Roulstone fears the NIF's laser approach to fusion may be too complicated: “I am a skeptic about whether inertial confinement will work,” he says.

Tynan, too, is cautious about inertial confinement fusion, although he recognizes that NIF's fusion ignition was a scientific breakthrough: “it demonstrates that one can produce net energy gain from a fusion reaction.”

He sees “viable physics” in both the magnet and laser approaches to nuclear fusion but warns that both ideas still face many years of experimentation and testing before they can be used to generate electricity. “Both approaches still have significant engineering challenges,” Tynan says. “I think it is plausible that both can work, but they both have a long way to go.”

Sedna will reach its closest approach to the Sun in 2076, providing a remarkable space-faring opportunity that won't come again for another 11,400 years.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The story of the past 35 years in astronomy has been discovering just how massive our Solar System really is. In 1992, astronomers spotted the minor planet 15760 Albion, the first object ever spotted beyond Pluto and the first official member of the Kuiper Belt. Later, at the turn of the century, astronomers (especially Mike Brown at Caltech) made a string of discoveries, including Quaoar, Maki, Makemake, Eris, and Sedna. Although these discoveries in aggregate is what eventually doomed Pluto to a planetary demotion (Eris is just a sliver smaller than pluto), Sedna was particularly eye-catching. 

Roughly three times smaller than our Moon, Sedna has an extremely narrow and elliptical orbit, making its closest approach to the sun (perihelion) at roughly 76 AU—some 12.3 times closer than its aphelion at 937 AU. This makes Sedna a kind of planetary emissary to the far-flung Oort cloud. Oh, and astronomers discovered another interesting aspect about Sedna: Its closest approach was just one human lifetime away. 

Fast-forward 22 years from its initial discovery and astronomers are debating how to best study this astronomical event that hasn't occurred since humans first developed agriculture during the tail end of the Stone Age. A new study, published in the online preprint server arXiv, scientists from the U.S. and Italy analyze a hypothetical mission using two distinct approaches—solar sails and direct fusion drives (DFD). 

While conventional propulsion systems could require up to 30 years to perform a flyby maneuver, both solar sails and DFDs could pull off the feat in about one-third of the time. However, the outcomes of those twin missions would be vastly different because a DFD drive could actually perform an orbital insertion maneuver whereas a solar sail would be a strictly flyby mission, much like New Horizons swinging by Pluto in 2015. 

“Due to the limitations of traditional methods, innovative propulsion systems are crucial to reach distant targets like Sedna,” the authors write. “Chemical propulsion, while providing high thrust for launches, suffers  from low efficiency and high fuel mass requirements for long-duration missions. Electric propulsion, including ion and Hall effect thrusters, offers much higher efficiency and finds many applications nowadays but produces insufficient thrust for rapid deep-space travel.”

A DFD, like the Princeton Field-Reversed Configuration (PFRC), would by and large be the preferred method. By the study's estimates, a fusion drive would reduce the mission time compared to conventional rockets by 50 percent while also delivering a 1500 kg payload, which is 1,000 times more than the solar sail alternative. However, this is far from a fool-proof plan. For one, fusion drives have yet to prove plasma stability and reliability during deep-space missions and that's not even beginning to consider things like communication. Secondly,  while Sedna is making its “closest” approach in 2076, it's still more than double the distance from the Sun to Pluto, meaning one-way-light-time (OWLT) would be about 13 hours—not exactly an easy environment for reliable communication.

Sending a spacecraft to Sedna would be one of the greatest challenges in the history of spaceflight, but a rewarding one. Due to its extremely strange orbit, Sedna could provide an unprecedented opportunity to learn about some of the farthest reaches of our own Solar System. Luckily, we still have a few more years to perfect a mission (especially if we go the DFD route), but scientists would need to get working sooner rather than later so that this once-in-140-lifetimes opportunity doesn't slip through our orbital grasp.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists May Have Found the Blueprint of the Human Body at the Bottom of the Ocean","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a65269592/sea-anemone-bilaterian/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

We know that some animals are bilaterian—meaning they display bilateral symmetry—while others are not, but nature is rarely so black-and-white.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Make a list of complex animals as distantly related to humans as possible, and sea anemones would likely be near the top of the list. Of course, one lives in the water and the other doesn't, but the differences are more biologically fundamental than that—sea anemones don't even have brains.

So it's surprising that this species in the phylum Cnidarians (along with jellyfish, corals, and other sea creatures) contains an ancient blueprint for bilaterians, of which Homo sapiens are a card-carrying member. A new study by a team of scientists at the University of Vienne discovered that sea anemones, whose Cnidarian status means they grow radially around a central point (after all, what is the “face” of a jellyfish), use a technique commonly associated with bilaterians, known as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) shuttling, to build their bodies. This complicates the picture of exactly when this technique evolved or if it possibly evolved independently of bilaterians. The results of the study were published last month in the journal Science Advances.



“Not all Bilateria use Chordin-mediated BMP shuttling, for example, frogs do, but fish don't, however, shuttling seems to pop up over and over again in very distantly related animals making it a good candidate for an ancestral patterning mechanism,” University of Vienna's David Mörsdorf, a lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “The fact that not only bilaterians but also sea anemones use shuttling to shape their body axes, tells us that this mechanism is incredibly ancient.”

To put it simply, BMPs are a kind of molecular messenger that signals to embryonic cells where they are in the body and what kind of tissue they should form. Local inhibition from an inhibitor named Chordin (which can also act as a shuttle) along with BMP shuttling creates gradients of BMP in the body. When these levels are their lowest, for example, the body knows to form the central nervous system. Moderate levels signal kidney development, and maximum levels signal the formation of the skin of the belly. This is how bilaterians form the body's layout from back to body. 

Mörsdorf and his colleagues found that Chordin also acts as a BMP shuttle—just as displayed in bilaterians like flies and frogs.  Thi signals that this particular evolutionary trait likely developed before Cnidarians and bilaterians diverged. Seeing as these two phylums of the animal kingdom have vastly different biological structures, that divergence occurred long ago, likely 600 to 700 million years ago. 

“We might never be able to exclude the possibility that bilaterians and bilaterally symmetric cnidarians evolved their bilateral body plans independently,” University of Vienna's Grigory Genikhovich, a senior author of the study, said in a press statement. “However, if the last common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria was a bilaterally symmetric animal, chances are that it used Chordin to shuttle BMPs to make its back-to-belly axis.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The fatal mutation that lets cancer outsmart the human immune system","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250702214136.htm","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 03:17:03 GMT","

New research from UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center has uncovered an evolutionary change that may explain why certain immune cells in humans are less effective at fighting solid tumors compared to non-human primates. This insight could lead to more powerful cancer treatments.

The study was published in Nature Communications. It revealed a tiny genetic difference in an immune protein called Fas Ligand (FasL) between humans and non-human primates. This genetic mutation makes the FasL protein vulnerable to being disabled by plasmin, a tumor-associated enzyme. This vulnerability seems unique to humans and is not found in non-human primates, such as chimpanzees.

""The evolutionary mutation in FasL may have contributed to the larger brain size in humans,"" said Jogender Tushir-Singh, senior author for the study and an associate professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology. ""But in the context of cancer, it was an unfavorable tradeoff because the mutation gives certain tumors a way to disarm parts of our immune system.""

Tumor environment neutralizes key immune protein

FasL is an immune cell membrane protein that triggers a programmed cell death called apoptosis. Activated immune cells, including CAR-T cells made from a patient's immune system, use apoptosis to kill cancer cells.

The UC Davis team discovered that in human genes, a single evolutionary amino acid change -- serine instead of proline at position 153 -- makes FasL more susceptible to being cut and inactivated by plasmin.

Plasmin is a protease enzyme that is often elevated in aggressive solid tumors like triple negative breast cancer, colon cancer and ovarian cancer.

This means that even when human immune cells are activated and ready to attack the tumor cells, one of their key death weapons -- FasL -- can be neutralized by the tumor environment, reducing the effectiveness of immunotherapies.

The findings may help explain why CAR-T and T-cell-based therapies can be effective in blood cancers but often fall short in solid tumors. Blood cancers often do not rely on plasmin to metastasize, whereas tumors like ovarian cancer rely heavily on plasmin to spread the cancer.

Plasmin inhibitors may enhance immunotherapy

Significantly, the study also showed that blocking plasmin or shielding FasL from cleavage can restore its cancer-killing power. That finding may open new doors for improving cancer immunotherapy.

By combining current treatments with plasmin inhibitors or specially designed antibodies that protect FasL, scientists may be able to boost immune responses in patients with solid tumors.

""Humans have a significantly higher rate of cancer than chimpanzees and other primates. There is a lot that we do not know and can still learn from primates and apply to improve human cancer immunotherapies,"" said Tushir-Singh. ""Regardless, this is a major step toward personalizing and enhancing immunotherapy for the plasmin-positive cancers that have been difficult to treat.""

For the first time, astronomers have obtained visual evidence that a star met its end by detonating twice. By studying the centuries-old remains of supernova SNR 0509-67.5 with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT), they have found patterns that confirm its star suffered a pair of explosive blasts. Published today, this discovery shows some of the most important explosions in the Universe in a new light.

Most supernovae are the explosive deaths of massive stars, but one important variety comes from an unassuming source. White dwarfs, the small, inactive cores left over after stars like our Sun burn out their nuclear fuel, can produce what astronomers call a Type Ia supernova.

""The explosions of white dwarfs play a crucial role in astronomy,"" says Priyam Das, a PhD student at the University of New South Wales Canberra, Australia, who led the study on SNR 0509-67.5 published today in Nature Astronomy. Much of our knowledge of how the Universe expands rests on Type Ia supernovae, and they are also the primary source of iron on our planet, including the iron in our blood. ""Yet, despite their importance, the long-standing puzzle of the exact mechanism triggering their explosion remains unsolved,"" he adds.

All models that explain Type Ia supernovae begin with a white dwarf in a pair of stars. If it orbits close enough to the other star in this pair, the dwarf can steal material from its partner. In the most established theory behind Type Ia supernovae, the white dwarf accumulates matter from its companion until it reaches a critical mass, at which point it undergoes a single explosion. However, recent studies have hinted that at least some Type Ia supernovae could be better explained by a double explosion triggered before the star reached this critical mass.

Now, astronomers have captured a new image that proves their hunch was right: at least some Type Ia supernovae explode through a 'double-detonation' mechanism instead. In this alternative model, the white dwarf forms a blanket of stolen helium around itself, which can become unstable and ignite. This first explosion generates a shockwave that travels around the white dwarf and inwards, triggering a second detonation in the core of the star -- ultimately creating the supernova.

Until now, there had been no clear, visual evidence of a white dwarf undergoing a double detonation. Recently, astronomers have predicted that this process would create a distinctive pattern or fingerprint in the supernova's still-glowing remains, visible long after the initial explosion. Research suggests that remnants of such a supernova would contain two separate shells of calcium.

Astronomers have now found this fingerprint in a supernova's remains. Ivo Seitenzahl, who led the observations and was at Germany's Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies when the study was conducted, says these results show ""a clear indication that white dwarfs can explode well before they reach the famous Chandrasekhar mass limit, and that the 'double-detonation' mechanism does indeed occur in nature."" The team were able to detect these calcium layers (in blue in the image) in the supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5 by observing it with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on ESO's VLT. This provides strong evidence that a Type Ia supernova can occur before its parent white dwarf reaches a critical mass.

Type Ia supernovae are key to our understanding of the Universe. They behave in very consistent ways, and their predictable brightness -- no matter how far away they are -- helps astronomers to measure distances in space. Using them as a cosmic measuring tape, astronomers discovered the accelerating expansion of the Universe, a discovery that won the Physics Nobel Prize in 2011. Studying how they explode helps us to understand why they have such a predictable brightness.

Das also has another motivation to study these explosions. ""This tangible evidence of a double-detonation not only contributes towards solving a long-standing mystery, but also offers a visual spectacle,"" he says, describing the ""beautifully layered structure"" that a supernova creates. For him, ""revealing the inner workings of such a spectacular cosmic explosion is incredibly rewarding.""

This research was presented in a paper to appear in Nature Astronomy titled ""Calcium in a supernova remnant shows the fingerprint of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosion.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just mapped platinum atoms — and it could transform catalysis forever","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250702214154.htm","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:01:37 GMT","

Using nuclear magnetic resonance, researchers at ETH Zurich have studied the atomic environments of single platinum atoms in solid supports as well as their spatial orientation. In the future, this method can be used to optimize the production of single-atom catalysts.

Catalysis -- the acceleration of a chemical reaction by adding a particular substance -- is extremely important in industry as well as in everyday life. Around 80 % of all chemical products are produced with the help of catalysis, and technologies like exhaust catalysts or fuel cells are also based on this principle. One particularly effective and versatile catalyst is platinum. However, because platinum is a very rare and expensive precious metal whose production causes a lot of CO2 emissions, it is important to use as little of it as possible while maximizing its efficiency.

Catalysts with single atoms

In recent years, scientists have tried to develop so-called single-atom catalysts, in which each atom contributes to the chemical reaction. These catalysts are made by depositing single platinum atoms on the surface of a porous host material, for instance carbon doped with nitrogen atoms. The nitrogen atoms act as anchoring points which the platinum atoms can latch on to.

A team of researchers led by Javier Pérez-Ramírez and Christophe Copéret at the Department of Chemistry and Applied Life Sciences of ETH Zurich, together with colleagues at the Universities of Lyon and Aarhus, have now shown that such single-atom catalysts are more complex than previously thought. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, they were able to show that the individual platinum atoms in such a catalyst can have very different atomic environments, which influence their catalytic action. In the future, this discovery will make it possible to develop more efficient catalytic materials. The researchers recently published their findings in the scientific journal Nature.

Chance encounters lead to breakthrough

""Until now individual platinum atoms could only be observed through the 'lens' of an electron microscope -- which looks impressive but doesn't tell us much about their catalytic properties,"" says Pérez-Ramírez. Together with Copéret he thought about how one might characterize the individual platinum atoms more precisely. The collaboration began with a chance encounter during a meeting in the framework of the NCCR Catalysis program.

After the meeting, the two researchers developed the idea to try nuclear magnetic resonance. This method, on which the MRI in a hospital is based and which is typically used for investigating molecules in laboratories, the spins of atomic nuclei in a strong static magnetic field react to oscillating magnetic fields of a certain resonant frequency. In molecules, this resonant frequency depends on how the different atoms are arranged inside the molecule. ""Likewise, the resonant frequencies of the single platinum atoms are influenced by their atomic neighbours -- for instance, carbon, nitrogen or oxygen -- and their orientation relative to the static magnetic field,"" Copéret explains.

This leads to many different resonant frequencies, much like the different tones in an orchestra. Finding out which instrument is producing a particular tone isn't easy. ""As luck would have it, during a visit to Lyon one of us met a simulation expert from Aarhus who was visiting there at the same time,"" says Copéret. Such encounters, and the collaborations resulting from them, are essential for scientific progress, he adds. Together with the ETH-collaborator, the simulation expert developed a computer code that made it possible to filter out the many different ""tones"" of the individual platinum atoms from the muddle.

Mapping the atomic environment

Ultimately, this led to a breakthrough in the description of single-atom catalysts: the research team were now able to compile a kind of map showing the type and position of atoms surrounding the platinum atoms. ""This analytical method sets a new benchmark in the field,"" says Pérez-Ramírez.

With this method, which is broadly accessible, production protocols for single-atom catalysts can be optimized in such a way that all platinum atoms have tailored environments. This is the next challenge for the team. ""Our method is also important from an intellectual property standpoint,"" says Copéret: ""Being able to precisely describe catalysts at the atomic level enables us to protect them through patents.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This sun-powered sponge pulls drinking water straight from the ocean","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250702214145.htm","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 07:01:27 GMT","

Most of Earth's water is in the oceans and too salty to drink. Desalination plants can make seawater drinkable, but they require large amounts of energy. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Energy Letters have developed a sponge-like material with long, microscopic air pockets that uses sunlight and a simple plastic cover to turn saltwater into freshwater. A proof-of-concept test outdoors successfully produced potable water in natural sunlight in a step toward low-energy, sustainable desalination.

This isn't the first time scientists have created spongy materials that use sunlight as a sustainable energy source for cleaning or desalinating water. For example, a loofah-inspired hydrogel with polymers inside its pores was tested on chromium-contaminated water and, when heated by the sun, the hydrogel quickly released a collectible, clean water vapor through evaporation. But while hydrogels are squishy and liquid-filled, aerogels are more rigid, containing solid pores that can transport liquid water or water vapor. Aerogels have been tested as a means of desalination, but they are limited by their evaporation performance, which declines as the size of the material increases. So, Xi Shen and colleagues wanted to design a porous desalination aerogel that maintained its efficiency at different sizes.

The researchers made a paste containing carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanofibers and then 3D-printed it onto a frozen surface, allowing each layer to solidify before the next was added. This process formed a sponge-like material with evenly distributed tiny vertical holes, each around 20 micrometers wide. They tested square pieces of the material, ranging in size from 0.4 inches wide (1 centimeter) to about 3 inches wide (8 centimeters), and found that the larger pieces released water through evaporation at rates as efficient as the smaller ones.

In an outdoor test, the researchers placed the material in a cup containing seawater, and it was covered by a curved, transparent plastic cover. Sunlight heated the top of the spongy material, evaporating just the water, not the salt, into water vapor. The vapor collected on the plastic cover as liquid, moving the now clean water to the edges, where it dripped into a funnel and container below the cup. After 6 hours in natural sunlight, the system generated about 3 tablespoons of potable water.

""Our aerogel allows full-capacity desalination at any size,"" Shen says, ""which provides a simple, scalable solution for energy-free desalination to produce clean water.""

Cancer cells have the capacity to multiply rapidly. The aggressive cancer cells undergo conversion from their tightly connected epithelial state into a mesenchymal state, which lacks contact restrictions and spreads easily to other parts of the body. Such epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity also makes the cancer cells resistant to elimination by anticancer therapies.

The search is ongoing for newer anticancer agents that can overcome this acquired resistance to therapy and destroy the 'rogue' cancer cells. A group of researchers led by Dr. Hideyuki Saya, Director of the Oncology Innovation Center, Fujita Health University, Japan, has uncovered the mechanism of the anticancer activity of benzaldehyde, a compound responsible for the aroma of almonds, apricots, and figs.

Giving insights into their motivation for this study, Dr. Saya explains, ""In the 1980s, researchers demonstrated the anticancer activity of benzaldehyde and its derivatives. The first author of our study, Dr. Jun Saito, is the daughter of one of the researchers involved in those early studies, and she was driven by a strong desire to uncover the mechanism behind benzaldehyde's anticancer effects."" This study, published online in the British Journal of Cancer on May 02, 2025, shows the impact of benzaldehyde on key signaling protein interactions within the cancer cells and the resulting cytotoxicity.

Early studies reported the ability of benzaldehyde to inhibit the progressive development of mouse embryonic cells, indicating its potential in preventing rapid cell proliferation. Here, the anticancer effects of benzaldehyde were studied by using a mouse model grafted to have a growing pancreatic cancer.

In cell culture studies, benzaldehyde inhibited the growth of cancer cells resistant to radiation therapy and also those resistant to treatment with osimertinib, an agent blocking tyrosine kinases in growth factor signaling. Benzaldehyde synergized with radiation to eliminate previously radiation-resistant cancer cells.

The study findings revealed that benzaldehyde exerted its anticancer effects by preventing interactions of the signaling protein 14-3-3ζ with the Ser28-phosphorylated form of histone H3 (H3S28ph). This interaction, key to cancer cell survival, was also responsible for treatment resistance and the expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity.

Here, benzaldehyde prevented 14-3-3ζ-dependent phosphorylation of the serine28 amino acid of histone H3. Consequently, benzaldehyde treatment reduced the expression of genes responsible for treatment resistance. Treatment of mice with a benzaldehyde derivative inhibited the growth of pancreatic tumors and suppressed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity, thus preventing the spread of cancer to distant organs like the lungs.

By blocking an interaction key to cancer cell survival, benzaldehyde overcomes therapy resistance and prevents metastasis. Sharing the implications of their findings, Dr. Saya concludes, ""The 14-3-3ζ protein has long been considered a target for cancer therapy, but its direct inhibition is not feasible due to its important functions in normal cells. Our results suggest that inhibition of the interaction between 14-3-3ζ and its client proteins by benzaldehyde has the potential to overcome the problem.""

The present study shows benzaldehyde is effective against cancer cells that have acquired resistance to radiation and tyrosine kinase inhibitors commonly used in cancer treatment. In the long term, this study suggests its potential as a combinatorial anticancer agent, alongside molecular-targeted therapies.

Dr. Jun Saito is a researcher in the laboratory of Dr. Hideyuki Saya, Oncology Innovation Center, Fujita Health University. She obtained her Ph.D. from the Nihon University Graduate School of Medicine. Continuing the legacy of one of her parents, who pioneered the breakthrough research on the anticancer activity of benzaldehyde in the 1980s, Dr. Saito has uncovered the underlying mechanism of benzaldehyde's anticancer effects. Her expertise includes oncology, pathophysiology, immunology, applied physics, and chemistry.

A new AI model is much better than doctors at identifying patients likely to experience cardiac arrest.

The linchpin is the system's ability to analyze long-underused heart imaging, alongside a full spectrum of medical records, to reveal previously hidden information about a patient's heart health.

The federally-funded work, led by Johns Hopkins University researchers, could save many lives and also spare many people unnecessary medical interventions, including the implantation of unneeded defibrillators.

""Currently we have patients dying in the prime of their life because they aren't protected and others who are putting up with defibrillators for the rest of their lives with no benefit,"" said senior author Natalia Trayanova, a researcher focused on using artificial intelligence in cardiology. ""We have the ability to predict with very high accuracy whether a patient is at very high risk for sudden cardiac death or not.""

The findings are published today in Nature Cardiovascular Research.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common inherited heart diseases, affecting one in every 200 to 500 individuals worldwide, and is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes.

Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will live normal lives, but a percentage are at significant increased risk for sudden cardiac death. It's been nearly impossible for doctors to determine who those patients are.

Current clinical guidelines used by doctors across the United States and Europe to identify the patients most at risk for fatal heart attacks have about a 50% chance of identifying the right patients, ""not much better than throwing dice,"" Trayanova says.

The team's model significantly outperformed clinical guidelines across all demographics.

Multimodal AI for ventricular Arrhythmia Risk Stratification (MAARS), predicts individual patients' risk for sudden cardiac death by analyzing a variety of medical data and records, and, for the first time, exploring all the information contained in the contrast-enhanced MRI images of the patient's heart.

People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develop fibrosis, or scarring, across their heart and it's the scarring that elevates their risk of sudden cardiac death. While doctors haven't been able to make sense of the raw MRI images, the AI model zeroed right in on the critical scarring patterns.

""People have not used deep learning on those images,"" Trayanova said. ""We are able to extract this hidden information in the images that is not usually accounted for.""

The team tested the model against real patients treated with the traditional clinical guidelines at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute in North Carolina.

Compared to the clinical guidelines that were accurate about half the time, the AI model was 89% accurate across all patients and, critically, 93% accurate for people 40 to 60 years old, the population among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients most at-risk for sudden cardiac death.

The AI model also can describe why patients are high risk so that doctors can tailor a medical plan to fit their specific needs.

""Our study demonstrates that the AI model significantly enhances our ability to predict those at highest risk compared to our current algorithms and thus has the power to transform clinical care,"" says co-author Jonathan Crispin, a Johns Hopkins cardiologist.

In 2022, Trayanova's team created a different multi-modal AI model that offered personalized survival assessment for patients with infarcts, predicting if and when someone would die of cardiac arrest.

The team plans to further test the new model on more patients and expand the new algorithm to use with other types of heart diseases, including cardiac sarcoidosis and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Authors include Changxin Lai, Minglang Yin, Eugene G. Kholmovski, Dan M. Popescu, Edem Binka, Stefan L. Zimmerman, Allison G. Hays, all of Johns Hopkins; Dai-Yin Luand M. Roselle Abrahamof the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center of Excellence at University of California San Francisco; and Erica Schererand Dermot M. Phelanof Atrium Health.

As the world's population continues to age, the ability to slow human aging pharmacologically would bring enormous health and medical benefits. It would also offer extraordinary financial rewards to any enterprise that was capable of delivering longevity in a pill. Because the major causes of mortality worldwide are age-related diseases (such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders), delaying the onset of aging and age-related diseases is a dream as old as time. The discovery that aging can be delayed in animal models (including in mice) using genetic, dietary and pharmacological interventions has given rise to a growing longevity biotechnology industry1, which is keen to translate these preclinical discoveries into human applications.

The longevity biotechnology sector has been expanding rapidly in recent years and attracting high-profile investors. Approaches range from decades-old antioxidants to more recent approaches, such as those pursued by Altos Labs (which focuses on partial reprogramming and cellular rejuvenation). One of the major anti-aging strategies involves targeting senescent cells. In the 1960s, Hayflick and Moorhead discovered that human cells in culture have a limited proliferative potential before becoming senescent owing to telomere shortening. In addition, cellular senescence can be triggered by oncogenes or various forms of stress2. This state is marked by irreversible growth arrest as well as other markers, including expression of cell cycle inhibitors (such as p21 and p16) and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). For decades, researchers have hypothesized that although cellular senescence can act as an anti-tumor mechanism, it may also contribute to aging and age-related degeneration. Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate in some aged tissues in both mice and humans, and their role in driving aging has been long and widely debated. Following earlier promising work on cellular senescence in prematurely aged mice, a groundbreaking 2016 study in the laboratory of van Deursen at the Mayo Clinic showed that genetic ablation of p16-expressing senescent cells in normal mice extends both lifespan (by 24–27%) and healthspan3. It demonstrated that eliminating senescent cells could have therapeutic benefits in normally aged mammals, which sparked interest in pharmacologically targeting senescent cells — especially with senolytic compounds that aim to selectively eliminate them.

A preprint version of the article is available at bioRxiv.

SNAP-tag is a powerful tool for labeling proteins with synthetic fluorophores in bioimaging. However, its utility in live-cell applications can be constrained by its relatively slow labeling kinetics and the limited cell permeability of its substrates. Here, we introduce improved labeling substrates and an engineered SNAP-tag for faster labeling in vitro and in live cells. SNAP-tag2 presents a second-order rate constant with rhodamine substrates that approaches 107 s−1 M−1, a 100-fold improvement over the corresponding SNAP-tag–substrate pairs. When labeled with highly fluorogenic dyes, SNAP-tag2 also shows a fivefold increase in fluorescence brightness relative to currently used SNAP-tag. The increased labeling kinetics and brightness of SNAP-tag2 translate into greatly improved performance in various live-cell (super-resolution) imaging applications.

Self-labeling protein tags (SLPs) can be specifically and covalently labeled with synthetic probes in vitro and in live cells1,2. Popular examples of such tags are SNAP-tag3,4, HaloTag7 (ref. 5) and, to a lesser extent, CLIP-tag6. Their main field of use has been in bioimaging, where these tags offer the opportunity to attach bright and photostable synthetic fluorophores7 to proteins of interest. The development of fluorogenic probes for protein labeling (that is, probes that only become highly fluorescent upon binding to the protein of interest) has further facilitated the use of SLPs in live-cell bioimaging as it decreases background signal from unbound dye8,9.

HaloTag7 is at present the most popular SLP for live-cell imaging. HaloTag7 was engineered to react fast and efficiently with chloroalkane (CA)–rhodamine substrates10 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Rhodamines are well-suited synthetic fluorophores for live-cell imaging as they cover a broad spectral range, possess excellent spectroscopic properties11, can be fluorogenic8,12 and are permeable in live cells13,14. The fluorogenicity and permeability of rhodamines can probably be attributed to the reversible spirocyclization of the zwitterionic, fluorescent rhodamine to a nonpolar and nonfluorescent spirolactone9,14,15. For selected CA–rhodamines, labeling kinetics of HaloTag7 are close to the diffusion limit. The high reactivity of HaloTag7 toward CA–rhodamines is at least partially because of specific interactions of the protein surface with the rhodamine dye16. The combination of the high labeling velocity of HaloTag7 with CA–rhodamines, their relatively good permeability and the excellent performance of these dyes in various microscopy applications have made the approach a powerful tool in bioimaging17.

SNAP-tag undergoes a nucleophilic substitution reaction with O6-benzylguanine (BG) or chloropyrimidine (CP) derivatives, in which the benzyl group of the substrate is irreversibly transferred to an active site reactive cysteine residue (Fig. 1a). SNAP-tag is a highly engineered human O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (hAGT) that was optimized for reaction with BG derivatives3,18,19,20. While BG derivatives show faster labeling kinetics with SNAP-tag than the corresponding CP derivatives16, the less polar CP derivatives generally perform better in live-cell imaging21. However, compared to HaloTag7, SNAP-tag labeling kinetics with rhodamine-based substrates are in general at least two orders of magnitude slower16. Additionally, HaloTag7 shows higher fluorogenicity with rhodamines than SNAP-tag9,22. This is presumably because of specific interactions between the fluorophore and the HaloTag7 surface, which promote an equilibrium shift from the nonfluorescent spirolactone to the fluorescent zwitterionic state23. No such specific interactions between SNAP-tag and rhodamine-based fluorophores have been identified16.

R represents the functional moiety to be linked to SNAP-tag. b, Chemical structures of modified SNAP-tag substrates divided into two groups: leaving group modification and linker modification. Modified leaving groups were linked to TMR over linker R1. Modified linkers coupled to TMR were tested on the CP (R2) scaffold. c,d, Comparison of substrates 1–17 (c) and substrates 18–29 (d) relative to SNAP(f)-tag labeling with CP–TMR regarding their in vitro labeling kinetics and performance in live-cell labeling. In vitro labeling kinetics of SNAPf-tag with different substrates were measured recording FP traces over time. The kapp was calculated (Supplementary Table 1) and normalized to the kapp of SNAPf-tag with CP–TMR. Live-cell performance of developed substrates was tested by labeling of U2OS cells stably expressing an mEGFP–SNAP-tag fusion protein with TMR substrates at 100 nM for 2 h. Cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Fluorescence intensity ratios of TMR to mEGFP were calculated (Supplementary Table 1) and normalized to the ratio obtained for SNAP-tag with CP–TMR. Leaving group substrate 4 and linker substrates 22, 23 and 24 showed the most promising results relative to CP–TMR. e, Reactivity of selected SNAP-tag substrates with hAGT and CLIP(f)-tag compared to SNAP(f)-tag labeling with CP–TMR. Experiments were conducted as previously described. f, Chemical structure of TF–TMR (30) found through the combination of leaving group 4 and linker 22. The kapp of SNAPf-tag labeling with TF–TMR is depicted below.

The limited cell permeability of the SNAP-tag substrate and the reduced labeling kinetics and fluorogenicity of the SNAP-tag can impede its use in certain live-cell imaging applications. Here, we present SNAP-tag2, a highly engineered SNAP-tag mutant that rapidly reacts with optimized pyrimidine-based substrates for live-cell applications, and demonstrate the effectiveness of SNAP-tag2 and its substrates in a range of bioimaging applications.

To improve the performance of SNAP-tag in live-cell imaging, we decided to first develop different substrate scaffolds for higher intrinsic reactivity in vitro and improved live-cell compatibility, followed by engineering of SNAP-tag for faster reaction kinetics and enhanced fluorescence brightness with these substrates. SNAP-tag substrates can be divided into two parts: the leaving group and the linker that connects the synthetic probe to the reactive cysteine (Fig. 1b). We synthesized 17 different heterocycles connected through a benzyl linker to tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) and measured their labeling kinetics in vitro with SNAPf-tag, a single-point mutant of SNAP-tag with increased labeling kinetics16,24, as well as their performance of labeling SNAP-tag in a cellular assay (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Table 1). The selection of heterocycles was based on previous observations that pyrimidines can be good substrates for SNAP-tag21,25 but also comprised pyrazines, triazines and a pyrrolotriazine. Of these compounds, the trifluoromethyl-substituted pyrimidine 4 (CF3P) showed the best results (Fig. 1c), with a roughly 3-fold increase in labeling kinetics in vitro and 1.5-fold higher fluorescence labeling in live cells. Additionally, we investigated 12 different linkers connecting CP as the leaving group and TMR as the fluorescent probe. The fluoro and chloro derivatives 22 and 23 showed 2-fold increased fluorescence labeling in the cellular assay (Fig. 1d). However, the chloro analog 23 showed increased reactivity against parental hAGT (Fig. 1e). Therefore, to reduce the risk of unwanted background reactions, it was excluded. We furthermore computed the octanol–water partition coefficient (QP logP o/w), aqueous solubility (QP logS) and apparent MDCK permeability (QP PMDCK) of the various substrates as their nonfluorescent N-acetylated derivatives (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). The substrates with the highest predicted permeability and logP o/w, which additionally showed fast labeling of SNAPf-tag in vitro when coupled to TMR, also performed best in live-cell fluorescence labeling experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1). An exception was compound 7, for which high permeability was predicted but low efficiency for labeling of SNAP-tag in live cells was observed (Fig. 1c). Combining the features of the best-performing substrates 4 (CF3P) and 22 (CF) yielded trifluoromethyl fluorobenzyl pyrimidine 30 (TF), which, as a TMR derivative (Fig. 1f), showed an apparent second-order rate constant (kapp) of 5.87 (±0.02) × 105 M−1 s−1 for the labeling of SNAPf-tag (Supplementary Fig. 2), corresponding to 3.9-fold faster labeling kinetics than its reaction with CP–TMR (kapp = 1.51 (±0.01) × 105 M−1 s−1)16. Moreover, TF–TMR showed ~1.7-fold higher fluorescence labeling than CP–TMR in live cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). We further demonstrated that the optimized substrates do not significantly influence cell viability, even at substrate concentrations higher than used in labeling (Extended Data Fig. 2).

In addition to substrate optimization, we used protein engineering to increase the reactivity of SNAP-tag toward pyrimidine-based substrates and its brightness when labeled with fluorogenic rhodamines such as MaP618 (ref. 9). Specifically, we used mutagenesis of selected residues, computational design and directed evolution to identify mutants with increased reactivity and fluorogenicity (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). The engineering was guided by the available X-ray structures of SNAP-tag in its apo (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 3KZY), benzylated (PDB 3L00), BG-bound (PDB 3KZZ)4 and TMR-labeled (PDB 6Y8P)16 states and by past engineering efforts3,18,19,24 (Fig. 2a). We modified S135 to arginine, assuming it might favorably interact with the carboxylate of rhodamine substrates. We also used the computational method PROSS26 to identify amino acid substitutions that could increase the thermal stability of SNAP-tag (Fig. 2a). Additionally, the N-terminal domain of SNAP-tag comprises a long, unstructured region (residues 37–54; Fig. 2a–c), which might compromise the protein's stability. To address this, we used RosettaRemodel27 to design a short eight-residue loop as a replacement for this unstructured region (Fig. 2b,c). For directed evolution experiments, protein libraries of two distinct regions in close proximity to the substrate-binding site were created by saturation mutagenesis (Fig. 2a): the β-strand proximal to the active site (residues 29–36) and the active site loop (residues 155–161). Lastly, a synthetic deep mutational scanning library (sDMSL)28 was screened, in which each residue in SNAP-tag was individually replaced by all other 19 amino acids, excluding cysteines but including deletions. Deep mutational scanning allows systematically studying the impact of individual variations in the context of SNAP-tag and identifying the best amino acids at each position. Libraries were screened for enhanced labeling kinetics with the developed TMR substrates and/or increased fluorescence intensity of MaP618 derivatives (Supplementary Fig. 1) using yeast surface display (YSD) combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Supplementary Fig. 4). These engineering efforts led to the identification of SNAP-tag2, which carries 11 substitutions and a replacement of 18 amino acids (residues 37–54) by a peptide of eight amino acids (Fig. 2b,c), without destabilizing the protein (melting temperature (Tm) of around 65 °C; Supplementary Fig. 5). The kapp for its reaction with TF–TMR was 8.22 (±0.79) × 106 M−1 s−1 (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), which was about 100-fold faster than the reaction of SNAP-tag with CP–TMR (Fig. 2d) and close to that for the reaction of HaloTag7 with CA–TMR (kapp = 1.88 (±0.01) × 107 M−1 s−1)16. SNAP-tag2 also showed increased reaction kinetics with CP-based and CF-based substrates and reached its fastest labeling reaction with TF–CPY in vitro with a kapp of 1.04 (±0.12) × 107 M−1 s−1 (Table 1, Supplementary Figs. 7–9 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Furthermore, SNAP-tag2 showed increased reactivity toward nonfluorescent probes (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 5). The in vitro labeling kinetics of SNAP-tag2 with BG substrates were determined to be very similar to those of SNAP-tag with these substrates (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). The extinction coefficients and quantum yields (QYs) of SNAP-tag2 labeled with different rhodamines were similar to those of its predecessor, except for very fluorogenic MaP618 substrates (Supplementary Table 6). For these, SNAP-tag2 showed a significantly higher absorbance than SNAPf-tag, (Fig. 2e), indicating that SNAP-tag2 might have a higher capacity to shift the dye toward its zwitterionic, fluorescent state.

We then tested the performance of SNAP-tag2 and its improved substrates in live-cell imaging applications. We first compared the labeling kinetics of SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag with different fluorescent probes (that is, TMR, carbopyronine (CPY) and silicon rhodamine (SiR)) in live U2OS cells. The fluorophores were coupled to CP, CF or TF (Supplementary Fig. 1) to identify the best substrate–fluorophore pair for each fluorophore individually to use in live-cell labeling. We used U2OS cells stably coexpressing nuclear-localized HaloTag7–SNAP-tag2 or HaloTag7–SNAPf-tag fusions together with mTurquoise2, which was used for normalization of the protein expression level. Cells were incubated with the respective fluorescent probes and the fluorescence intensity changes were recorded as a function of time. For all tested fluorescent substrates, SNAP-tag2 showed significantly faster labeling than SNAPf-tag with CP substrates (Fig. 3a–d and Supplementary Fig. 12). Among the various fluorophores, the differences between SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag were most pronounced for the labeling with SiR derivatives (Fig. 3c,d). The half-labeling time (t1/2) for reaching saturation of the fluorescence signal was around 20 min for SNAP-tag2 labeled with CF–SiR, whereas SNAPf-tag showed only relatively weak labeling with CP–SiR under the same experimental conditions, not reaching a plateau within 90 min (Fig. 3c,d). For all CPY substrates, SNAP-tag2 showed around 4-fold faster labeling than SNAPf-tag. The t1/2 values for SNAP-tag2 labeling with different CPY substrates were similar (t1/2 = 10–12 min), highlighting a small influence of the substrate core for live-cell labeling with this fluorophore. For TMR substrates, the differences between SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag were less pronounced (1.6–2.2-fold). This suggests that live-cell labeling with TMR substrates is limited by the entry of the substrate into the cell.

Experiments were conducted in live U2OS cells stably coexpressing HaloTag7–SNAPf-tag or HaloTag7–SNAP-tag2 together with mTurquoise2 (expression marker) in the nucleus. a–c, Kinetic traces of SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag fluorescence labeling in live cells with TMR (a), CPY (b) and SiR (c) substrates. U2OS cells were labeled with TF–fluorophore, CF–fluorophore and CP–fluorophore substrates (50 nM for TMR and CPY, 100 nM for SiR) and the labeling reaction was followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence intensity changes of the substrates were normalized to the mTurquoise2 fluorescence over time. Data were fitted to a sigmoidal curve (n (TMR) ≥ 66 cells, n (CPY) ≥ 105 cells, n (SiR) ≥ 27 cells). Data are presented as the mean values ± 95% CI.

Similar results were obtained in a flow cytometry-based assay for the labeling of mEGFP–SNAP-tag2 and mEGFP–SNAPf-tag fusion proteins in U2OS cells. All tested substrates led to a more efficient labeling of SNAP-tag2 than SNAPf-tag, with the most pronounced differences observed for SiR and MaP618 substrates (Extended Data Fig. 3). BG substrates, however, showed reduced labeling in live cells in general (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Moreover, we compared the fluorescence brightness of labeled SNAP-tag2 in live cells to that of SNAPf-tag and HaloTag7. Previously described U2OS cells stably coexpressing nuclear-localized HaloTag7–SNAP-tag2 or HaloTag7–SNAPf-tag fusions together with mTurquoise2 were labeled overnight with CA–TMR, CA-MaP618, TF–TMR or TF–MaP618 to achieve full labeling (Fig. 3e). Quantification of the SLP fluorescence signal normalized to mTurquoise2 expression showed smaller differences among all three SLPs for TMR labeling (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Similar results were obtained for SiR substrates (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b,f) and CPY substrates (Extended Data Fig. 4d), for which differences in the fluorescence intensities among all SLPs, including HaloTag7, remained below twofold. For labeling with TF–MaP618, SNAP-tag2 showed a 5.2-fold higher fluorescence intensity than SNAPf-tag in cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 4e), which is in line with the measured absorbance difference in vitro (Fig. 2e). However, the brightness of MaP618-labeled SNAP-tag2 remained 2.7-fold dimmer than that of MaP618-labeled HaloTag7. Thus, SNAP-tag2 probably shifts the equilibrium of spirocyclization of very closed rhodamine dyes more toward the zwitterionic form than SNAPf-tag but less than HaloTag7.

We further tested the performance of SNAP-tag2 in super-resolution stimulated emission–depletion (STED)29 microscopy. HeLa cells stably coexpressing HaloTag7, SNAP-tag2 or SNAPf-tag fused to the Cox8a presequence (mitochondrial matrix localization) and mEGFP as an expression marker (no specific localization) were labeled with their respective CA–SiR or TF–SiR substrates (Fig. 4a). SNAP-tag2 showed much stronger fluorescence labeling inside mitochondria, both in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and STED microscopy than observed for SNAPf-tag under the same experimental conditions, even though a cell with stronger mEGFP fluorescence (≙ higher expression level) was chosen for SNAPf-tag. Detection of the dim SNAPf-tag labeling required a significant increase in laser power (Extended Data Fig. 5). The observed fluorescence signal for SNAP-tag2 was comparable to the signal obtained for the corresponding HaloTag7 labeling at similar expression levels. Similar differences in fluorescence intensities were observed for SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag labeling of intermediate filaments (vimentin (Vim) fusion) (Fig. 4b). Because of the increased photon count, SNAP-tag2 showed improved STED resolution, as highlighted by the reduced full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of Vim filaments (108 ± 23 nm) compared to SNAPf-tag (146 ± 7.0 nm). We also tested the STED performance of SNAP-tag2 with other fusion proteins such as CalR–KDEL (endoplasmic reticulum lumen; Fig. 4c) and TOMM20 (outer mitochondrial membrane; Fig. 4d) and observed bright and specific labeling of SNAP-tag2 with CF–SiR. Furthermore, we performed dual-color live-cell STED imaging in U2OS cells expressing Vim–SNAP-tag2 and LifeAct–HaloTag7 (F-actin) using CF–SiR and CA–MaP618, respectively (Fig. 4e). These results demonstrate the superiority of SNAP-tag2 over previous SNAP-tag versions in live-cell imaging experiments.

HeLa cells stably coexpressing HaloTag7, SNAP-tag2 or SNAPf-tag in the mitochondria (Cox8a localization sequence) together with mEGFP (no specific localization) were labeled with CA–SiR or TF–SiR (100 nM) for 1 h and washed afterward. SNAP-tag2 and HaloTag7 show comparable performance in STED imaging, while SNAPf-tag shows insufficient signal under the same imaging conditions. This experiment was performed three times with similar results. Scale bars, 10 µm.

The experiment was repeated twice with similar results. The FWHM of single intermediate filament fibers highlighted in b was determined to be 108 (±23) nm and 146 (±7.0) nm, underlining the higher resolution achieved with SNAP-tag2 compared to SNAPf-tag (15 individual filaments from three individual images per condition).

Cells were washed before imaging. Scale bars, 5 µm (overview) and 1 µm (magnification). e, Dual-color CLSM and STED images of U2OS cells expressing Vim–SNAP-tag2 and LifeAct–HaloTag7.

Lookup tables: cyan (SNAP-tag2–SiR) and orange-hot (HaloTag7–MaP618).

We then investigated whether the improved SNAP-tag2 system translates to more efficient fluorescence labeling in yeast. Chemical labeling in yeast is challenging, presumably because of the presence of its cell wall, an additional permeability barrier and the expression of various multidrug efflux pumps30. The peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3 has a key role in peroxisomal biogenesis, inheritance and degradation in yeast31. To study the precise localization, dynamics and distribution of Pex3 and its binding partners, live-cell STED nanoscopy is a suitable technique because it enables the quantification of the exact number and size of peroxisomes in live yeast32. Thus, we expressed either Pex3–SNAP-tag2 or Pex3–SNAPf-tag in the methylotrophic yeast species Hansenula polymorpha and tested different SiR substrates for labeling of peroxisomes in live cells (Fig. 5a). H. polymorpha expressing Pex3–SNAP-tag2 showed homogenous and highly efficient labeling of peroxisomes, whereas the fluorescence signal was much weaker for yeast cells expressing Pex3–SNAPf-tag (Fig. 5a,b). The correct localization of Pex3–SNAP-tag2 was furthermore confirmed through STED microscopy (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). Similar results were obtained for labeling with MaP555 (ref. 9) substrates, for which SNAP-tag2 worked best in combination with CP–MaP555 (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 13c,d). These results demonstrate that SNAP-tag2 enables more efficient labeling in H. polymorpha yeast than its predecessor.

Source data

In this work we used a combination of substrate optimization and protein engineering to develop SNAP-tag2, an improved version of the SNAP-tag labeling system. SNAP-tag2 reacts faster with an improved set of pyrimidine-based substrates. An increased labeling speed is observed for a large variety of probes, including rhodamines as well as different reactive biorthogonal groups. The kapp for the reaction of SNAP-tag2 with the substrate TF–TMR in vitro approaches 107 M−1 s−1, which is ~100-fold faster than the labeling reaction of SNAP-tag with CP–TMR and is close to that of HaloTag7 with CA–TMR. SNAP-tag2 remained a very stable protein with a melting temperature of ~65 °C, which might facilitate further engineering attempts such as circular permutations and the generation of split versions of SNAP-tag2. The creation of such cpSNAP-tag2 and split-SNAP-tag2 systems could enable the development of biosensors and recorders for studying biological activities in cells and/or in vivo33. Its size of 172 aa is slightly below that of its predecessor and substantially below that of HaloTag7 with 297 aa. SNAP-tag2 displaces the spirocyclization equilibrium of bound rhodamines more toward the open form compared to SNAPf-tag, a property for which we directly screened in the directed evolution experiments. We assume that a possible interaction of SNAP-tag2 with the zwitterionic, fluorescent configuration of rhodamines results in higher brightness of SNAP-tag2 when labeled with the very fluorogenic dye MaP618. Nevertheless, SNAP-tag2 displaces the spirocyclization equilibrium to a lower degree than HaloTag7. Since very closed rhodamine derivatives tend to show reduced labeling performance in cellular experiments15 and in vivo34, we believe that this is not a major limitation of SNAP-tag2 relative to HaloTag7. Owing to the lack of structural information on labeled SNAP-tag2, the role of individual amino acid substitutions in tuning the interactions of SNAP-tag2 with rhodamines remains unclear.

Most importantly, the increased reactivity of SNAP-tag2 toward its improved substrates translates into a more efficient fluorescence labeling in live cells. This observation was most pronounced for fluorescence labeling with the far-red SiR substrates, which enabled efficient fluorescence labeling at substrate concentrations that only resulted in weak labeling of SNAPf-tag. The relatively weak SiR labeling observed for SNAPf-tag is in line with a previous report on differences of SNAP-tag and HaloTag7 labeling with SiR substrates22. In live-cell imaging, the different fluorophores showed some preferences among the different SNAP-tag substrates. For SiR, CF–SiR showed faster labeling in U2OS cells than TF–SiR and CP–SiR, even though all reached the same brightness after longer incubation periods. The labeling of SNAP-tag2 in live cells with TMR substrates and CPY substrates showed less dependency on the nature of the substrate (TF, CF and CP). The kapp values of CPY substrates for labeling SNAP-tag2 in vitro are all >106–107 M−1 s−1 with TF–CPY being ~2-fold faster in comparison to CF–CPY and CP–CPY. The fact that the t1/2 values of all CPY substrates for labeling in cells are rather similar suggests that the lower reactivity of CP–CPY and CF–CPY is offset by higher intracellular concentration of these substrates. This might be because of higher permeability and/or reduced binding to other cellular components. Thus, for the preparation of any new probes for live-cell applications with SNAP-tag2 or for new applications of the here-described probes, we recommend to first test the CF-based probes. The greater performance of SNAP-tag2 for fluorescence labeling in live cells also extends to super-resolution microscopy imaging techniques such as STED microscopy and to other cell types known to be refractory to chemical labeling such as yeast cells. As SNAP-tag2 together with its improved substrates is superior to the previously used SNAP-tag versions in every application we tested, we expect that it will also excel in in vivo applications. Lastly, implementation of the superior SNAP-tag2 system to already existing SNAP-tag-based biosensors such as Snifits35 should enhance their performance.

In summary, the improvements introduced in SNAP-tag2 are expected to advance the utility of this already widely adopted tool for live-cell imaging and other applications in life sciences.

Detailed procedures for the synthesis and chemical characterization of all compounds are given in the Supplementary Methods. Buffer, media and reagent compositions can be found in Supplementary Table 13.

Molecular structures were prepared using the Schrödinger Maestro 12.3 interface to ensure suitability for QikProp calculations. The preparation included adding hydrogens, assigning bond orders and generating three-dimensional geometries. QikProp calculations were conducted using the Schrödinger suite. For each structure, key pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties were calculated using default settings and according to the official protocol (https://www.schrodinger.com/platform/products/qikprop/). Calculated parameters were exported and are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

A pET51b(+) vector (Novagen) was used for protein production in Escherichia coli. Proteins were N-terminally Strep-tagged and C-terminally 10xHis-tagged for affinity purification. pcDNA5/FRT or pcDNA5/FRT/TO vectors (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for protein expression in mammalian cells by transient transfection or for stable cell line generation. Cloning was performed with Gibson assembly37 or point mutations were introduced using the Q5-site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer protocol. Plasmid sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics or Microsynth) and plasmids were stored at −20 °C.

pET51b(+) plasmids were transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS (Novagen) cells. Luria–Bertani (LB) ampicillin expression cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6–0.8 and protein expression was subsequently induced at 16 °C by addition of IPTG (0.5 mM). After overnight expression, cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000g, 4 °C, 15 min), resuspended in His-tag extraction buffer (20–30 ml) and lysed by sonication (50% duty, 70% power, 7 min) on wet ice. All proteins were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using either a gravity column or an ÄktaPure fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) instrument (Cytiva) equipped with a HisTrap FF crude column (Cytiva). Buffer was exchanged to activity buffer (50 mM HEPES and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.3) either using Zeba spin desalting columns (7-kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO), 0.5 ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns (Cytiva) on an FPLC system. Purified proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (10-kDa MWCO). The purity and correct size of the proteins were assessed by SDS–PAGE and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Purified proteins were aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

For protein expression on the yeast surface, either a pCTcon2 vector (Addgene, 73152) with SNAP-tag proteins fused in between Aga2p–HA-tag (N-terminal) and MYC-tag (C-terminal) or a pJYDNg vector (Addgene, 162452) with a C-terminal fusion to Aga2p–HA-tag–MYC-tag–eUnaG2 was used. Epitope HA-tags and MYC-tags were used for immunostaining and the fluorescent reporter protein eUnaG2 was labeled with bilirubin for monitoring the protein expression level.

Libraries were created either using pCTcon2-SNAP-tag1.1 (SNAP-E30R-S135R-L153G) through one-pot saturation mutagenesis38 or using pJYDNg-SNAP-tag1.5 (SNAP-E30R-I32Y-L34V-K36N-50GHPEPQ-S135R-L153G-G161P) combining site-directed saturation mutagenesis with assembly PCR39.

Library generation was initially performed by obtaining circular library plasmids from E. coli, which were then used for transformation into EBY100 yeast cells for YSD. For libraries generated through one-pot saturation mutagenesis, a mixture of degenerate primers was used, in which one or four NNKs covered the target regions for randomization (amino acids H29–K36 and 156–161; Supplementary Tables 15–17). Library DNA was transformed into E. coli cells and cells were recovered in 2 ml of SOC medium (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C. Serial dilutions were spread on selective LB agar plates containing kanamycin (50 µg ml−1) to determine the library size. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight and isolated plasmids from ten single-picked colonies were sequenced to control the library diversity. Cells transformed with the libraries were grown in 3 ml of LB kanamycin medium at 37 °C overnight and plasmids were extracted using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen).

Libraries were later generated as linear DNA fragments used for homologous recombination (HR) in yeast. Libraries on the active site loop of pJYDNg-SNAP-tag1.5 were generated using degenerated primers with three NNKs at different positions throughout the targeted region (156-GGYEGP-161). The N-terminal and C-terminal parts of SNAP-tag1.5 were PCR-amplified and used for assembly PCR in a mixture of primers carrying randomized positions surrounded by overlapping regions with the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (Supplementary Table 18). This assembly PCR enabled the reconstitution of full-length SNAP-tag1.5 library genes, whose extremities overlapped with the plasmid by 50–80 bp to enable HR in yeast. The protocol for assembly PCR was adjusted from Routh et al.39. Library inserts were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

An sDMSL designed on the SNAP-tag1.5 scaffold was purchased from Twist Bioscience. The library consisted of single-point variants, having each amino acid along the SNAP-tag1.5 sequence substituted to all other 19 amino acids, excluding cysteines and including deletions. The sDMSL was designed with a 50-bp overlap of the flanking regions to the pJYDNg expression vector for direct HR into yeast cells.

Single colonies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EBY100 (American Type Culture Collection) spread on a YPD agar plate were used for inoculation of YPD liquid cultures. YPD expression cultures were grown at 250 rpm and 30 °C until an OD600 of 1.3–1.5. Afterward, Tris–DTT buffer (800 µl) and Tris–lithium acetate buffer (2 ml) were added and the culture was incubated at 250 rpm and 30 °C for 15 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,500g, 4 °C, 3 min) and washed with ice-cold electroporation buffer (25 ml), followed by cell harvesting (2,500g, 4 °C, 3 min). Cells were resuspended in electroporation buffer to a total volume of 300 µl. Cells were aliquoted (50 µl) and directly used for transformation by electroporation.

For circular plasmid DNA transformation, DNA (1–3 µg) was diluted in double-distilled (dd)H2O (<10 µl) and kept on ice. For HR, amplified vector (1 µg) and insert DNA (2–3 µg) were mixed to a final volume of 100 µl. The DNA was concentrated using alcohol precipitation (100 µl of isopropanol 100 µl, 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate and 0.5 µg µl−1 glycogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific), incubated at −20 °C overnight). The mixture was centrifuged (10,000g, 20 min) and the DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol (200 µl) followed by centrifugation (10,000g, 20 min). The supernatant was removed and the pellet was air-dried. Electrocompetent EBY100 yeast cells (50 µl) were used to resuspend the DNA and transformation was conducted by electroporation. Electroporation cuvettes (GenePulser cuvette, 0.2-cm electrode gap; Bio-Rad Laboratories) were prechilled on ice. The cell–DNA mix was transferred to the prechilled electroporation cuvette and electroporation was conducted using a Bio-Rad GenePulser Xcell device (0.54 kV, 25 µF, infinite resistance with exponential decay). After electroporation, prewarmed YPDS medium (1 ml) was immediately added to the cuvette and the cell suspension was transferred to culture tubes (15 ml). The cuvette was washed with 1 ml of YPDS medium and added to the culture. The culture was incubated at 250 rpm and 30 °C for 1 h. Yeast cells were collected by centrifugation (2,500g, 5 min) and resuspended in SDCAA selective medium (1 ml). Serial dilutions were plated on SDCAA agar plates to determine the transformation efficiency. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. The remaining cell suspension was used to inoculate SDCAA culture (100 ml) and grown at 30 °C for 2 days. The culture was directly used for YSD screening and aliquots were frozen in a 1:1 mixture of culture and 50% glycerol in Tris buffer (pH 8).

SDCAA medium (5 ml final volume) was inoculated either using a single colony from a SDCAA plate or by addition of fully grown yeast liquid culture (0.5 ml) after transformation. The culture was incubated at 250 rpm and 30 °C overnight. This preculture (0.5 ml) was used to inoculate 4.5 ml of SGCAA medium for protein expression on the yeast surface. Protein expression was conducted for at least 20 h at 250 rpm and 30 °C.

For fluorescence labeling, 107 cells were obtained by centrifugation (14,000g, 1 min). The concentration of the yeast culture expressing the protein(s) of interest on the surface was determined by accounting that an OD600 = 1 corresponds to about 107 cells per ml (ref. 40). For antibody-based expression staining of yeast cells transformed with pCTcon2 plasmids, yeast cells were resuspended in 1:10-diluted primary mouse anti-MYC antibody (OP10, EMD Millipore) in PBS (50 μl) and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were pelleted (14,000g, 1 min) and washed twice with PBS (125 μl) with centrifugation in between (14,000g, 1 min). The cell pellet was resuspended in 1:50-diluted secondary goat anti-mouse–Alexa647 antibody (A-21236, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS (50 μl) and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS (125 μl) before labeling with SNAP-tag substrates.

For protein libraries encoded by the pJYDNg expression vector, expression control was monitored over labeling of eUnaG2 with bilirubin. Yeast cells were resuspended in PBS (50 μl) containing bilirubin (10 μM) and BSA (1 mg ml−1), gently vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were pelleted and washed twice with PBS (150 μl) interspaced by centrifugation steps (14,000g, 1 min) before SNAP-tag labeling. Cells expressing SNAP-tag variants were labeled in PBS (50 μl) using different substrates (CF3P–TMR, CF3P–MaP618, TF–TMR or TF–MaP618) with varying concentrations (10–500 nM) and incubation times (10–60 min) to adjust the screening stringency. Labeling was performed at room temperature on a rotating wheel. Cells were washed with PBS (125 μl), resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and filtered through 5-ml round-bottom polystyrene test tubes with cell strainer snap caps (352235, Falcon) for FACS.

Labeled yeast libraries were analyzed and subsequently sorted on a BD FACSMelody cell sorter (BD Biosciences) using the appropriate filter settings for each fluorophore (Supplementary Table 7). For yeast cell sorting, a 100-μm sorting nozzle and a 1.5 neutral density filter was used. Photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector voltages were optimized on the basis of single-labeled and double-labeled samples and negative control samples. The range for positive signal was set to be approximately 103–104, while negative and background staining was set to ≤102. Gating strategies are depicted in Supplementary Fig. 15. Cells were gated for live and single-cell events on the basis of their size in the forward scatter (FCS) and side scatter (SSC). The single-cell population was then gated for the double-positive labeling signal and the top 0.5–1% of double-labeled cells (104 cells) were sorted in bulk. After sorting, yeast cells were grown in SDCAA medium (5 ml) supplement with penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco; 5,000 U per ml, 1:100 dilution) for 2 days. Plasmids were isolated from fully grown cultures (1 ml) using a Zymoprep yeast plasmid miniprep II kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's protocol and the remaining culture was propagated to start the next screening round.

To redesign the unstructured loop (residues 37–54), the TMR-labeled SNAP-tag structure (PDB 6Y8P)16 was used as input. The covalent benzyl-TMR ligand was parameterized and a Rosetta constraint file was set up to fix the covalent bond between the ligand the protein analogous to published procedures33. Point substitutions E30R, I32Y, L34V, K36N, S135R, L153G and G161P were modeled and the structure was minimized using a RosettaScripts41 protocol. The top-scoring structure was used as input for the loop design using the RosettaRemodel27 application. Blueprint files for 7-aa, 8-aa and 9-aa loops were set up, allowing any amino acids except cysteine in the designed regions. For energy minimization, the Rosetta FastRelax method was applied using the ‘ref2015' Rosetta score function and the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm with Armijo inexact line search conditions (‘lbfgs_armijo_nonmonotone'). Example scripts can be found in the Supplementary Information. The top five scoring sequences for each loop length were tested experimentally.

Randomized regions from isolated plasmids were amplified with next-generation sequencing (NGS) primers (Supplementary Table 19) using standard PCR conditions and purified (Qiagen PCR purification kit). NGS was performed using adaptor ligation Illumina sequencing at Eurofins Genomics. The NGS package for each sample included 10 million total reads comprising of 2× 150-bp paired-end reads (5 million read pairs). NGS amplicon sizes varied from 150 to 300 bp and were pooled in equivalent quantities. The NGS primers' unique adaptor sequences enabled later reattribution of sequences to sorted libraries. NGS samples comprised 2 μg of DNA in 100 μl of ddH2O.

Illumina sequencing results were first split into separate files on the basis of their experiment-specific and selection-round-specific sequence barcodes using ‘je demultiplex' (ref. 42). Forward and reverse reads were combined into a single file for each barcode. Primer and adaptor sequences were trimmed to match the translation frame of the template sequence using cutadapt43. Trimmed reads were then aligned to the template sequence with bowtie2 (ref. 44). The resulting SAM file was converted to a BAM file using SAMtools45. The alignments were then analyzed with a custom R script to calculate amino acid frequencies for randomized positions (for saturation mutagenesis libraries) or point mutation frequencies (for sDMSL). Reads containing deletions, insertions relative to the template sequence or ambiguous bases were removed. The remaining reads were translated into amino acid sequences. For saturation mutagenesis libraries, amino acid frequencies at the positions of interest were calculated by dividing the number of reads featuring a specific amino acid at a particular position by the total number of reads. For DMSLs, mutation frequencies were calculated by dividing the number of reads featuring a specific mutation by the number of reads that cover the corresponding position. The script used for NGS data analysis can be found in the Supplementary Information.

Thermal stabilities of final protein variants were measured on a Prometheus NT48 nanoscale differential scanning fluorimeter (NanoDSF). Protein samples were prepared in activity buffer (0.8 mg ml−1) and changes in tryptophan fluorescence at 330 nm were followed over a temperature range of 20–95 °C with a temperature increase of 1 °C min−1. Measurements were performed in technical triplicates. The inflection point of the first derivative corresponds to the proteins' melting temperature.

Labeling kinetics were measured in black nonbinding flat-bottom 96-well plates (200-μl final reaction volume) or in black nonbinding low-volume 384-well plates (20-μl final reaction volume) (Corning) on a microplate reader (Spark 20M, Tecan) by recording fluorescence polarization (FP) traces at 37 °C over time. All measurements were performed in technical triplicates in FP buffer. Labeling reactions were started by either addition of substrate to the protein using a multichannel pipette or using the injector module of the plate reader for fast reaction conditions. Filter settings were chosen according to the fluorophore substrate (Supplementary Table 8). The G factors were calculated using a buffer only (blank) and free fluorophore substrate (reference) control. The optical gain, an amplification factor for the photomultiplier tube, was adjusted to 50%. Baselines were determined by recording FP kinetic traces of the free fluorophore substrates.

For screening purposes, labeling kinetics were recorded using 50 nM protein and 20 nM fluorophore substrate. For fast labeling kinetics, FP kinetics were conducted with 10 nM protein and 2 nM substrate in 384-well plates. A one-phase association (Eq. (2)) was fitted to the data using GraphPad Prism and kapp was calculated using Eq. (1).

where Y is the FP (mP), Ymax is the FP plateau (mP), Y0 is the y-intercept (mP), k is the labeling rate constant (s−1) and x is time (s).

For more accurate determination of kapp, a global fit approach to kinetic models was used as published in Wilhelm et al.16. In brief, kinetics were measured at fixed fluorophore substrate concentration (20 nM) and various protein concentrations (0 and 4.60–900 nM). Fast kinetics were measured at fluorophore substrate concentrations of 2 nM and protein concentrations of 0 and 0.78–50 nM. Kinetic data were preprocessed using a custom R script46,47; subsequently, kinetic model 1 (Eq. (3)), described by the differential equations (Eqs. (4)–(6)), was fitted to the data using DynaFit48. The FP baseline value and protein concentration were fixed parameters, while the fluorophore substrate concentration was adjustable to account for potential quantification errors. Including limiting protein concentration into the experimental conditions enabled accurate concentration fitting by impacting the final FP value (decreasing plateau). The s.d. and confidence interval (CI) were obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation49 with standard settings (n = 1,000, 5% worst fits excluded). Exemplified DynaFit scripts can be found in the Supplementary Information. Representative graphics were generated using a custom R script (Supplementary Fig. 2).

where P is the SNAP-tag2 protein, S is the fluorophore substrate and PS is the fluorescently labeled SNAP-tag2.

Labeling kinetics of nonfluorescent substrates were determined in a competition assay as described in Wilhelm et al.16. In brief, competition kinetics were measured by mixing varying concentrations of nonfluorescent substrates (0 and 0.1– 1 µM) and BG–Alexa488 (100 nM) followed by addition of protein (200 nM) using an electronic 96-channel pipettor (Integra Bioscience). FP changes were recorded over time. Kinetic data were preprocessed using a custom R script46,47; subsequently, a competition kinetic model (Eq. (7)), described by the differential equations (Eqs. (8)–(12)), was fitted to the data using DynaFit48. The s.d. and CI were obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation49 with standard settings (n = 1,000, 5% worst fits excluded). Exemplified DynaFit scripts can be found in the Supplementary Information. Representative graphics were generated using a custom R script (Supplementary Fig. 10).

where P is the SNAP-tag2 protein, S is the nonfluorescent substrate, PS is the nonfluorescently labeled SNAP-tag2 protein, I is the fluorescent competitor substrate and PI is the fluorescently labeled SNAP-tag2 protein.

Labeling kinetics of SNAP-tag2 with TF–TMR, CF–TMR, CP–TMR, TF–CPY, CF–CPY and CP–CPY substrates were measured by recording fluorescence anisotropy changes over time using a BioLogic SFM-400 stopped-flow instrument (BioLogic Science Instruments) in a single-mixing configuration at 37 °C as described in Wilhelm et al.16. The final substrate concentration was fixed to 0.5 or 1 μM and the protein concentration was varied from 0.25 to 3.13 μM in activity buffer (50 mM HEPES and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mg ml−1 BSA. The anisotropy of the free substrate was measured to obtain a baseline. The sampling time was set to 1 ms for a total recording time of 2 s or varied from 200 µs for 0.2 s followed by 2 ms to a total duration of 3 s. For each condition, 15 technical replicates were recorded. Kinetic data were preprocessed using a custom R script46,47, in which replicate values were averaged, pretrigger timer points were removed and times were adjusted to start at zero. Kinetic model 2 (Eq. (13)), described by differential equations (Eqs. (14)–(17)) was fitted to the data using DynaFit48 as described in Wilhelm et al.16. The delay time, anisotropy baseline value and protein concentration were fixed parameters, while the fluorophore substrate concentration was adjustable to account for potential quantification errors. Including limiting protein concentration into the experimental conditions enabled accurate concentration fitting by impacting the final anisotropy value (decreasing plateau). The s.d. and CI were obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation49 with standard settings (n = 1,000, 5% worst fits excluded). Exemplified DynaFit scripts can be found in the Supplementary Information. Representative graphics were generated using a custom-made R script (Supplementary Figs. 6–9 and 11).

where P is the SNAP-tag2 protein, S is the fluorophore substrate, PS* is the substrate-bound protein complex and PS is the fluorescently labeled SNAP-tag2.

The individual kinetic parameters for the dissociation constant (Kd) defining the protein affinity toward the substrate and the kapp defining the overall labeling speed were derived from Eqs. (18) and (19), respectively.

Multiple replicates of the experiment were conducted for TF–TMR (four replicates), CF–TMR (eight replicates) and CP–TMR (three replicates) and their corresponding CPY analogs (two replicates each). Results of the individual kinetic measurements are depicted in Supplementary Table 3. Replicates were averaged and the s.d. was calculated (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4).

For determination of the extinction coefficients (ε) of labeled SNAP-tag proteins, recombinant SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag (30 µM) were labeled with fluorophore substrates (7.5 µM) in FP buffer overnight. For measurements, a serial dilution of the labeling reaction was performed, targeting final substrate concentrations of 7.5–2.22 µM. Absorbance spectra were recorded on a V-770 spectrophotometer (Jasco) in a quartz cuvette (3 mm). All measurements were performed in technical triplicates and absorbance values were baseline-corrected by setting the absorbance at 800 nm to zero using SpectraGryph version 1.2. For all fluorophores, the maximal absorbance value at each concentration was fitted to a linear function (Eq. (20)) and extinction coefficients were calculated from the slope b (Eq. (21)).

Absolute QYs of fluorescently labeled SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag were measured on a Quantaurs-QY spectrometer (model C11347, Hamamatsu). Measurements were carried out with diluted samples from the same reaction solution used for ε measurements (A = 0.03–0.08).

All media were filtered before using sterile Nalgene Rapid-Flow filter units (0.22-μm pore size, 500 ml; Thermo Fisher Scientific). All experimental steps were performed under sterile conditions. Mammalian U2OS Flp In T-REx cells50 (U2OS cells) or Hela Kyoto Flp In cells33 (HeLa cells) were cultured in cell growth medium (DMEM + GlutaMAX supplemented with phenol red, high glucose (4.5 g l−1), pyruvate (Gibco Life Technologies, 31966-021) and 10% FBS (Gibco Life Technologies)) in either T-25 or T-75 culture flasks (Sarstedt). The cells were cultivated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and passaged when reaching 80–90% confluency. Cell handling involved washing with PBS (1×, pH 7.4; Gibco Life Technologies, 10010-015), detachment (trypsin 0.05% + EDTA; TrypLE Express, Gibco Life Technologies, 12604-013), resuspension in DMEM + 10% FBS and transfer into fresh flasks. For imaging experiments, cells were handled in DMEM without phenol red, referred to as imaging medium (Gibco Life Technologies, 31053-028) supplemented with GlutaMAX (Gibco Life Technologies, 35050-038), pyruvate (Gibco Life Technologies, 11360-070) and 10% FBS (Gibco Life Technologies). For seeding cells at desired densities, cells were counted using a fluidlab R-300 cell counter (Anvajo) with Acella 100 chambers (20-μl sample volume; Anvajo). Cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (TPP, 92096) or 8-well or 96-well microplates with a glass bottom (Ibidi, 80827 and 89627, respectively) in a total volume of 100–150 μl of medium.

Stable cell lines were generated using the Flp In T-REx system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with U2OS or HeLa cells. Cells were grown to ~80% confluency in T-25 flasks. Lipofectamine 3000 (8 μl; Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000008) was diluted in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium + GlutaMAX (200 μl; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 51985026) in a 1.5-ml reaction tube and thoroughly mixed. In a separate tube, the plasmid DNA encoding the gene of interest on a pcDNA/FRT or pcDNA/FRT/TO vector (440 ng) and pOG44 (3,560 ng; encoding the Flp In recombinase) were diluted in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium + GlutaMAX (200 μl). P3000 (8.0 μl) was added to the DNA mix. After thorough mixing, the DNA–P3000 mix incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Subsequently, the DNA–P3000 mix was combined with the diluted Lipofectamine 3000, mixed and left to incubate at room temperature for an additional 15 min. The resulting DNA–P3000–Lipofectamine 3000 mix was added to the T-25 flask and incubated overnight. The following day, the medium was exchanged with cell growth medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 hygromycin B (Gibco Life Technologies), selecting cells for plasmid integration. Selection was performed for 48–72 h. Survived cells were recovered in cell growth medium to reach confluency. Cells were sorted using FACS for high expression levels according to a positive fluorescent protein signal (mEGFP, FITC filter) or SLP labeling (SiR, APC filter). Generated stable cell lines can be found in Supplementary Table 14.

For dual-color STED imaging, recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) were generated as described previously51. In brief, the AAV plasmid containing the CAG-Lifeact-HT7 expression cassette flanked by AAV2 packaging signals (inverted terminal repeats) were cotransfected with plasmids pRV1 (AAV2 Rep and Cap sequences), pH21 (AAV1 Rep and Cap sequences) and pFD6 (Adenovirus helper plasmid) using Lipofectamine 3000 into HEK293 cells. Then, 5 days after transfection, the cells were collected and lysed using TNT extraction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 10 mM MgCl2) for 10 min. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (3,000g, 5 min, 4 °C), the cell supernatant was treated with Benzonase (4.5 µl, 30 min, 37 °C) and the rAAVs were purified by FPLC using HiTrap AVB Sepharose HP columns (Cytiva, 28411211). Purified rAAVs were concentrated using Amicon Ultra 15-ml (100-kDa MWCO) centrifugal filters (Merck) with buffer exchange to PBS pH 7.3.

U2OS Flp In T-REx cells stably expressing Vim–SNAP-tag2 were transduced with rAVVs 18 h before STED imaging by adding 0.5 μl of purified rAAVs (~109–1010 rAAV particles) into 200 μl of imaging medium (DMEM GlutaMAX and 10% FBS, phenol red free; Gibco).

Flow cytometry was conducted on a BD Fortessa X-20 cell analyzer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a high-throughput screening (HTS) module for 96-well plates. Cells were seeded on transparent 96-well cell culture plates and treated according to desired experiment in a reaction volume of 100 µl. After treatment, labeling reaction was stopped by addition of recombinant SNAP-tag2 (2 µM, 100 µl, 10-min incubation), cells were washed twice with PBS (150 μl, 10-min incubation), trypsinized (50 μl of trypsin, 10-min incubation) and resuspended in FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS) to a final volume of 200 μl. The cell suspension was transferred to nonbinding U-bottom 96-well plates (Falcon) and analyzed on a flow cytometer using the HTS module. Flow rates were set to 3 μl s−1 with three mixing steps and a subsequent washing volume of 400 μl. Cells were gated for live cells (SSC-A/FSC-A) and single cells (FSC-H/FSC-A) as exemplified in Supplementary Fig. 16. Excitation laser and emission filter settings were adjusted according to the fluorophore properties (Supplementary Table 9). PMT settings were adjusted to positive and negative controls. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).

U2OS Flp In T-REx (Thermo Fisher Scientific) cells stably expressing mEGFP–SNAP-tag or mEGFP–CLIP-tag fusion proteins were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates (10,000 cells per well) 1 day before the experiment. The cells were then incubated with substrates 1–30, CP or BC (100 nM) for 2 h at 37 °C. All substrates were tested in technical triplicates. Cells were washed twice with cell growth medium for 150min incubation at 37 °C and once with sterile PBS pH 7.4 before detachment with trypsin (50 µl, 10 min, 37 °C). Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer to a final volume of 200 µl. The cell suspension was transferred to nonbinding U-bottom 96-well plates (Falcon) and analyzed on a flow cytometer using the HTS module, as previously described. Cells were gated for live-cell (SSC-A/FSC-A) and single-cell events (FSC-H/FSC-A) and for mEGFP expression signal (FITC channel) ≥ 103. Gated cells were analyzed for their SLP labeling signal (TMR, PE channel) over expression level (mEGFP) and the medians of the ratios were derived using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).

U2OS cells were seeded on transparent 96-well cell culture plates 1 day before the experiment. Cells were incubated with TF–fluorophore, CF–fluorophore and CA–fluorophore substrates (1 µM) or DMSO (1% (v/v)) or remained untreated for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was collected into nonbinding U-bottom 96-well plates (Falcon) and detached cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000g, 5 min). The supernatant was removed. Additionally, adherent cells were detached with trypsin (30 µl, 10 min, 37 °C), resuspended in FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS) to a final volume of 100 μl and added to the same wells to collect all dead and live cells. SYTOX blue dead cell stain (100 µl, 2 µM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the cells to a final concentration of 1 µM and cells were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry (10,000 cells per well; laser: 405 nm, BP filter: 450/50). The experiment was performed in technical triplicates. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).

Confocal fluorescence microscopy of U2OS cells stably expressing HaloTag7–P30–SNAP-tag2/SNAPf-tag–NLS–P2A–NLS–mTurquoise2 was conducted on a Stellaris 5 microscope (Leica Microsystems). Live-cell imaging was performed in 8-well or 96-well glass bottom dishes (Ibidi) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Images were acquired with a ×40 (HC PL APO CS2 ×40/1.10) water objective, a scan speed of 600 Hz, line average of 2, optical zoom of 1–1.3, image size 1,024 × 1,024 μm and 12-bit pixel depth. Z stacks were recorded with a step size of 2–5 μm. HaloTag7 and SNAPf-tag/SNAP-tag2 were labeled with their respective TF–fluorophore or CA–fluorophore substrates at 100 nM overnight. Cells were washed twice with PBS before imaging in imaging medium. Laser settings are described in Supplementary Table 10. Image analysis was performed using Fiji software52. For visualization purposes, maximum intensity projections of z-stacked images were calculated. For quantification, intensities of multiplane images were summed and regions of interest (ROIs) were defined manually. Mean fluorescence intensities of the ROI's fluorescence channels were calculated (multi-ROI measurement) and ratios calculated from fluorescent labels to respective expression signals were compared. Ratiometric projections were generated using the BRET-analyzer plugin53.

In-cell kinetic measurements of SNAP-tag2 and SNAPf-tag labeling with TF–fluorophore, CF–fluorophore and CP–fluorophore substrates were performed in U2OS cells stably expressing HaloTag7–P30–SNAP-tag2/SNAPf-tag–NLS–P2A–NLS–mTurquoise2 on a Stellaris 5 microscope as previously described. Fluorophore substrates were added at a final concentration of 50 nM (for TMR and CPY) or 100 nM (for SiR) to the cells and images with three z stacks were acquired every 30 s over time. For quantification, fluorescence intensities of multiplane images were summed and the ratios of fluorophore substrate signals normalized to mTurquoise2 expression signals were analyzed using CellProfiler54. Additional image acquisition parameters were as follows: ×20 water objective (HC PL APO CS2 ×20/0.75 IMM), ×1.28 optical zoom, image size 1,024 × 1,024 μm, scan speed of 400 Hz and line average of 2. Laser settings are described in Supplementary Table 11. Kinetic data were analyzed by fitting a sigmoidal curve (Eq. (22)) in GraphPad Prism 10.2.3.

where Y is the fluorescence intensity ratio (signal/mTurquoise2), Ymax is the plateau of the fluorescence intensity ratio, Y0 is the y-intercept, H is the Hill slope and x is time (min).

The experiment was conducted in biological duplicates and the average t1/2 of both replicates was calculated. Respective CIs were propagated by Eqs. (23–26) as follows:

Calculate the mean t1/2 of both replicates:

Compute the standard error (SE) for each t1/2 of a replicate:

Calculate the s.e.m.:

Compute the 95% CI for the average t1/2:

where \(\overline{{t}_{1/2}}\) is the t1/2 of the duplicate, CIhigh is the higher 95% CI and CIlow is the lower 95% CI.

HeLa cells stably expressing Cox8a–SLP fusion proteins together with mEGFP were labeled with respective CA–SiR or TF–SiR (100 nM) substrates for 1 h and washed twice with imaging medium before microscopy. U2OS cells stably expressing Vim–SNAPf-tag, Vim–SNAP-tag2, TOMM20–SNAP-tag2 or CalR–SNAP-tag2-KDEL or coexpressing Vim–SNAP-tag2 and LifeAct–HaloTag7 (rAAV) were labeled with CF–SiR and CA–MaP618 (100 nM), respectively, for 1 h and washed twice with imaging medium before microscopy. Live-cell STED nanoscopy was performed using an Abberior STED Expert Line 595/775/RESOLFT QUAD scanning microscope (Abberior Instruments). SiR was excited using a 640-nm excitation line and depleted using a 775-nm STED line. For dual-color imaging, MaP618 was excited with a 561-nm excitation line and depleted with the same STED line. The microscope was equipped with a UPlanSApo ×100/1.4 oil immersion objective lens (Olympus) and the fluorescence signal was detected using avalanche photodiodes. The pinhole was set to 0.9 Airy units, a gating of 0.75–8 ns was applied and dwell times of 7–10 µs and a pixel size of 25 nm were used. For STED images, each line was scanned 4–8 times and the signal was accumulated. Imaging settings are further detailed in Supplementary Table 12. Lookup tables used for image representation in Fig. 4a–e were as follows: green, mEGFP; red-hot, SiR; cyan, SNAP-tag2–SiR; orange-hot, HaloTag7–MaP618. For image representation, a Gaussian blur filter with a 2σ radius was applied.

The FWHM of single-intermediate filaments (Vim–SNAPf-tag/SNAP-tag2 fusion) was determined by extracting fluorescence intensity profiles perpendicular to single filaments using Fiji software (ImageJ 1.53t)52. Mean filament diameters were calculated from 15 individual fibrils and from three individual images (n = 3) by fitting a Gaussian function (Eq. (27)), yielding the FWHM from Eq. (28).

where y is the normalized fluorescence intensity, x is the x coordinate (μm), y0 is the offset, A is the area, ω is the width and xc is the center.

where ω is the Gauss width.

STED microscopy images in Fig. 4a are snapshots of three independent experiments (eight images in total) with similar outcome. Additionally, five individual experiments (12 images in total) with labeling substrate concentrations ranging from 25 to 250 nM and incubation times ranging from 1 h to overnight labeling in two different cell types (U2OS and HeLa cells) yielded similar brightness differences. Images shown in Fig. 4b are snapshots of two individual experiments (seven images in total). FWHM quantification was conducted for one individual experiment (15 filaments, three images). STED images in Fig. 4c–e were acquired in one individual experiment.

H. polymorpha ku80 yeast cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). For fluorescence microscopy studies, the cultures were grown in mineral medium (MM)55 containing 30 µg ml−1 leucine, 1× vitamin solution, 0.25% ammonium sulfate and 0.5% methanol.

The SNAPf-tag DNA sequence was synthesized by Genscript and SNAP-tag2 was PCR-amplified from pET51b-SNAP-tag2 using primers Fw_BglII_SNAP-tag2 (GATGCTAGATCTGATAAAGACTGCGAAATGAAACG) and Rv_SalI_SNAP-tag2 (CTCTAGAGTCGACCTAGCCCAGGCCTGGTTTACCC). Both SNAP-tag inserts were cloned into the pUC57 plasmid vector. pHIPZ_Pex3_mGFP56 and pUC57_SNAPf-tag/SNAP-tag2 were restricted using SalI and BglII according to the supplier protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ligated to generate pHIPZ_Pex3_SNAPf-tag or pHIPZ_Pex3_SNAP-tag2 plasmids for peroxisome targeting in yeast. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells selected on LB with ampicillin. Positive colonies were checked using XhoI restriction. The plasmids were linearized with EcoRI or MluI and transformed into H. polymorpha yku80 cells by electroporation as described in Faber et al.57. Positive integrations in yeast were tested with colony PCR using primers Ppex3_Fw (CCTGTTGCGGCAAGATATAG) and Seq_SNAP_Rv (CGTAGGAAGGCTGGATGTC). Plasmids were confirmed by LightRun sequencing (Eurofins Genomics) and compared using Clone Manager 9 (Scientific and Educational Software). Correct yeast integration was checked by colony PCR with DreamTaq enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific) of zymolyase-treated cells and imaged using the Gel Doc XR+ System (Bio-Rad).

H. polymorpha cells were grown until stationary phase in MM supplemented with 0.5% glucose at 37 °C shaking (200 rpm). The culture was diluted to OD660 = 0.1 and grown until OD660 > 1.6. This culture was again diluted to OD660 = 0.1 in MM and methanol and the cells were simultaneously stained using TF–SiR, CP–SiR, BG–SiR, TF–MaP555, CP–MaP555 or BG–MaP555 at a final concentration of 250 nM for 18 h at 37 °C shaking, reaching a final OD660 of ~3.0. To stain the yeast cell walls, cells were incubated with 25 µg ml−1 Calcofluor white (Fluorescent Brightner 28; Sigma-Aldrich, 910090) for 15 min at 37 °C shaking. Cells were washed three times with PBS and immediately used for live-cell imaging in MM and methanol.

STED nanoscopy was conducted on a commercial microscope (Abberior Instruments) equipped with a STED depletion laser (775 nm), four excitation lasers (640, 561, 488 and 405 nm), a CoolLED pE-2 excitation system and a ×100 oil immersion objective (Olympus UPLSAPO/1.40). Confocal overview images (80 × 80 µm) were taken using a pixel size of 180 nm, dwell time of 20 µs and 6% laser power using the 561-nm excitation laser with 570–680-nm detection for MaP555 substrates or 0.5% laser power using the 640-nm excitation laser with 650–730-nm detection for SiR substrates. STED images were taken with a pixel size of 25 nm, dwell time of 20 µs and 30% laser power using the 561-nm excitation laser with 570–680-nm detection for MaP555 substrates or 2% laser power using the 640-nm excitation laser with 650–730-nm detection for SiR substrates. A depletion laser power of 50% or 10% at 775 nm was applied for 561-nm or 640-nm excitation, respectively. Calcofluor white was imaged using 3% laser power with the 405-nm excitation laser and 410–480-nm detection. Image acquisition was carried out using Imspector software (version 16.3, Abberior Instruments). Analysis was performed using Fiji software (ImageJ 2.14.014)52. To compare the fluorescence intensities of SNAPf-tag and SNAP-tag2 labeled with different fluorophore substrates, the mean and maximum fluorescence intensity of 125 cells (rectangles of 3 × 3 µm as the ROI) were measured in biological triplicates. Line profile measurements were performed for one cell per condition.

All in vitro measurements were performed at least in technical triplicates. Flow cytometry-based experiments were performed at least in technical duplicates. Live-cell kinetic measurements were performed as biological duplicates (that is, on two different days 1 week apart). STED images aiming to compare differences in labeling brightness or resolution in mammalian cells were repeated at least two times to ensure similar outcomes. Quantification of fluorescence intensities in yeast cells were performed in biological triplicates. Unless otherwise stated, STED images originated from single experiments. Statistical significance of a sample group over a reference group was performed by performing a two-tailed unpaired t-test with Welch's correction using GraphPad Prism (version 10.2.3). Sample sizes are indicated in the captions of corresponding figures. The following notations apply for all statistical analyses: NS (not significant), P ≥ 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001.

FoF1-ATP synthase (FoF1) interconverts the energy of the proton motive force (pmf) and that of ATP through the mechanical rotation. The H+/ATP ratio, one of the most crucial parameters in bioenergetics, varies among species due to differences in the number of H+-binding c-subunits, resulting in H+/ATP ratios ranging from 2.7 to 5. In this study, we seek to significantly enhance the H+/ATP ratio by employing an alternative approach that differs from that of nature. We engineer FoF1 to form multiple peripheral stalks, each bound to a proton-conducting a-subunit. The engineered FoF1 exhibits an H+/ATP ratio of 5.8, surpassing the highest ratios found in naturally occurring FoF1s, enabling ATP synthesis under low pmf conditions where wild-type enzymes cannot synthesize ATP. Structural analysis reveals that the engineered FoF1 forms up to three peripheral stalks and a-subunits. This study not only provides valuable insights into the H+-transport mechanism of FoF1 but also opens up possibilities for engineering the foundation of cellular bioenergetics.

FoF1-ATP synthase (FoF1) is a ubiquitous enzyme found in the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria. It synthesizes ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) coupled with proton translocation across membranes along the proton motive force (pmf)1,2,3. FoF1 is a unique molecular motor complex composed of two rotary molecular motors: F1 and Fo1,2. Bacterial FoF1 exhibits the simplest subunit composition of a1b2cx (x varies among species) for Fo and α3β3γ1δ1ε1 for F14,5,6 (Fig. 1a). Fo is a membrane-embedded molecular motor driven by pmf. When protons are translocated through the proton pathway in Fo along pmf, the multimeric rotor ring composed of c-subunits (termed c-ring) rotates against stator ab2 (Fig. 1a, b). F1 is the catalytic core domain of FoF1 for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis7. When isolated from Fo, F1 acts as an ATP-driven molecular motor that rotates the γε rotor complex against the catalytic α3β3 stator ring coupled with ATP hydrolysis8. These two motors are coupled via two stalks: the peripheral stalk, composed of the b2 dimer stalk and the δ subunit. The central rotor stalk is composed of a γε complex and a c-ring. Under ATP synthesis conditions where pmf is sufficient and the rotational torque of Fo exceeds that of F1, Fo rotates the γε complex in F1 in the reverse direction of ATP hydrolysis, driving the ATP synthesis reaction on the α3β3 ring9,10. Conversely, when the torque of F1 exceeds that of Fo, F1 rotates the c-ring in Fo, forcing Fo to pump protons in the reverse direction, thereby generating pmf. Thus, FoF1 interconverts the pmf and chemical potential of ATP hydrolysis through mechanical rotation.

a Bacterial ATP synthase (from thermophilic Bacillus PS3) consists of F1 (α3β3γδε) and Fo (ab2c10) motors. As F1 has three catalytic sites, three ATP molecules are synthesized per turn of the rotor subunits (γεc10) against the stator subunits (α3β3δab2) during ATP synthesis. b Models of proton translocation through Fo coupled with the rotation of the c-ring. The highly conserved arginine residues of the a-subunit and glutamate (or aspartate) residues of c-subunits are depicted with pink and black open circles, respectively. Protons are depicted as light blue circles. In the models of c10-ring/single a-subunit and c15-ring/single a-subunit, 10 and 15 protons, equal to the number of the c-subunits, are transferred in one turn, respectively. Conversely, in the c10-ring and triple a-subunits model, a total of 30 protons, equal to the number of the c-subunits multiplied by the number of the a-subunits, are transferred in one turn.

Considering the Gibbs free energy of this coupling reaction (\(\Delta G^{\prime}\)),

\(\Delta G^{\prime}\) is givens:

where \(\Delta {G}_{{{{\rm{ATP}}}}}^{{\prime} }\) is the Gibbs free energy of ATP synthesis, \(F\) is Faraday's constant, \(n\) is the H+/ATP ratio, which is defined as the number of protons translocated through Fo coupled with a single turnover of ATP synthesis on F1. Hence, the following conditions must be satisfied to drive ATP synthesis:

Thus, the H+/ATP ratio is the critical factor in determining the lower limit of pmf required for ATP synthesis, given that \(\Delta {G}_{{{{\rm{ATP}}}}}^{{\prime} }\) does not largely vary among species. The H+/ATP ratio is principally defined by the ratio of the reaction stoichiometry of Fo per turn of the rotor complex to that of F1, and the ratio of H+/turn of Fo to ATP/turn of F1. All the F1s studied so far, without exception, have three catalytic β subunits and couple three reactions of ATP hydrolysis/synthesis per turn, defining the ATP/turn ratio as 310. The reaction stoichiometry of Fo, H+/turn varies among species due to differences in the number of c-subunits in the c-ring. According to the half-channel model, supported by recent structural studies, the H+ pathway in Fo is formed by the c-ring and the a-subunit, which has two half-channels exposed to the periplasmic or cytoplasmic side of the membrane11,12,13. During ATP synthesis, H+ from the periplasmic solution enters the half-channel exposed to the periplasmic space and is transferred to one of the c-subunits in the c-ring. Following one revolution of the c-ring, H+ is released into the cytoplasmic solution through the opposite half-channel (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, the half-channel model assumes that the stoichiometry of H+/turn is determined by the number of c-subunits.

The number of c-subunits in the c-ring in F-type ATP synthases ranges from 8 to 15, depending on the species14,15,16. When assuming perfect energy coupling between F1 and Fo, the H+/ATP ratio should vary between 2.7 and 5.0 among the species. Various groups have attempted to experimentally determine the H+/ATP ratio from the biochemical measurements of the thermodynamic equilibrium point where the pmf and \({\Delta G}_{{{{\rm{ATP}}}}}^{{\prime} }\) are balanced. The Bacillus PS3 FoF1, with a c10-ring, has been reported to show good agreement with the structurally expected H+/ATP ratio of 3.317. FoF1s from E. coli and yeast mitochondria, both of which also have the c10-ring, exhibit slightly different H+/ATP ratios: 4.0 ± 0.318 and 2.9 ± 0.219, respectively. For spinach chloroplast FoF1 with the c14-ring, two independent studies reported smaller values for the H+/ATP ratio: 4.0 ± 0.218 and 3.9 ± 0.319, which are lower than the expected value of 4.7. Thus, the experimentally determined H+/ATP ratios are close to, but not always identical to, the structurally expected values, varying within a narrow range of 3 to 4.

The H+/ATP ratio of FoF1 is one of the most critical parameters in the bioenergetic system of cells, which defines the energy cost of ATP synthesis and the threshold pmf required for ATP synthesis (see Eq. 3)14,17. Since \(\Delta {G}_{{{{\rm{ATP}}}}}^{\prime}\) does not largely differ across organisms, FoF1 with a higher H+/ATP ratio can synthesize ATP even at a lower pmf. In fact, alkaliphilic bacteria living in highly alkaline environments and photosynthetic organisms that grow under light-limiting conditions have a c-ring with a large number of c-subunits20,21,22. This is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that allows stable ATP synthesis under low and/or unstable pmf conditions22,23. Thus, organisms may have optimized the H+/ATP ratio through evolution by tuning the stoichiometry of the c-ring to meet their energetic requirements.

Conversely, when reconsidering the half-channel mechanism, we can assume that the stoichiometry of H+/turn in Fo is determined not only by the number of c-subunits but also by the number of a-subunits (Fig. 1b, bottom). In particular, the Fo structures solved so far show that a large portion of the c-ring is exposed to the lipid bilayer, suggesting the possibility of accommodating one or two additional a-subunits, although FoF1 with multiple a-subunits has not yet been identified.

Here, we explore the possibility of doubling or tripling the H+/ATP ratio of FoF1 by increasing the number of a-subunits in Fo, rather than increasing the stoichiometry of the c-ring as observed in nature.

So far, all ATP synthases have a single copy of the a-subunit per FoF1 complex. Considering that the a-subunit is tightly bound to the membrane portion of the peripheral stalk, the key factor for multiplying the a-subunits should be the structural mechanism that limits the number of peripheral stalks. The peripheral stalk of the b2 dimer extends from the membrane to the upper surface of the α3β3 subcomplex of F1, binding to the δ subunit. The δ subunit binds to the top of the α3β3 subcomplex, associating with the N-terminal regions of the three α subunits. One α subunit interacts with the C-terminal region of the δ subunit, while the other two interact with the N-terminal region of the δ subunit, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2a. Since the N-terminal domain of the δ subunit is located in the central concavity of the α3β3 ring, occupying the pseudo-threefold symmetry axis of the α3β3 ring, it is reasonable to assume that the N-terminal domain of the δ subunit disrupts the pseudo-threefold symmetry, limiting the stoichiometry of the peripheral stalk to one (Fig. 2a). We hypothesized that by removing the N-terminal domain of the δ subunit (Fig. 2b), it becomes possible to accommodate a truncated δ subunit on each α subunit (Fig. 2c). A possible concern regarding the truncation is that the truncated δ subunit (δΔN) does not form a stable complex with the α3β3 ring. Therefore, we designed the δΔN-α fusion construct of Bacillus PS3 FoF1, where the C-terminus of the δ subunit was genetically fused to the N-terminus of the α subunit. In addition, the inhibitory C-terminal domain of the ε subunit was removed to enhance enzymatic activity17,24. In this study, Bacillus PS3 FoF1-εΔC was used as a wild-type FoF1 for comparison.

Top views of Bacillus PS3 FoF1 from the cytoplasm (PDB ID: 6N2Y). The α (red), β (yellow), γ (blue), δ subunits (orange), and the b2 stalk (pink) are shown. The non-transparent red parts indicated by the arrows represent the N-terminal region (residues 2–30) of the α subunit. a Asymmetric interactions between the δ and α subunits. The single δ subunit interacts with the three α subunits, occupying the central concavity of the α3β3 subcomplex. b Model structure after deletion of the N-terminal domain (residues 2–104) of the δ subunit. The central concavity is exposed, and two of three α subunits are unoccupied. c Model structure after each of the N-terminus of the three α subunits is fused to the C-terminal domain (residues 105–178) of the δ subunit.

The δΔN-α fused FoF1 was purified following a previously reported procedure for the wild-type Bacillus PS3 FoF117. To estimate the subunit stoichiometry, the δΔN-α fused FoF1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with the wild-type FoF1 for comparison (Fig. 3a, b). The δΔN-α fused FoF1 lacked δ and α, and the δΔN-α fusion appeared above the band position for the α subunit (Fig. 3a). The δΔN-α fused FoF1 retained the complete set of subunits. Then, we estimated the subunit stoichiometry of the a- and b-subunits in the δΔN-α fused FoF1 by using the γ subunit as the internal reference in comparison with the wild-type (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 2). In the wild-type, the b-subunit exhibited a band intensity comparable to that of the γ subunit, whereas in the δΔN-α fused FoF1, the b-subunit showed higher signals relative to the γ subunit. Similarly, the δΔN-α fused FoF1 exhibited a higher band intensity for the a-subunit compared to the wild type, indicating that the δΔN-α fused FoF1 increases the stoichiometry of the a- and b-subunits. For a more quantitative estimation, we plotted calibration lines for the wild-type and mutant subunits and standardized the lines using the γ subunit calibration lines as the internal control (Fig. 3b). We then determined the stoichiometries of the a- and b-subunits in the δΔN-α fused FoF1 by comparing them to the wild-type. The estimated stoichiometries of the a- and b-subunits were 2.2 and 1.8 times higher than those of the wild-type FoF1, respectively (see Fig. 3b legend). Thus, it was confirmed that the δΔN-α fused FoF1 has multiple, two on average, peripheral stalks and a-subunits.

a SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified wild-type (WT) Bacillus PS3 FoF1 and the δΔN-α fused FoF1. Each sample was derived from a single purification batch. 3 μg of FoF1 was loaded in each lane. The molecular masses of the δΔN-α, α, β, γ, a, δ, b, εΔC, and c-subunits are 63, 55, 53, 32, 26, 20, 19, 9, and 7 kDa, respectively. The experiment was independently repeated three times with similar results. b The band intensity vs total protein amount. A single series of diluted FoF1 from the same purification batch was loaded into a gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The band intensity of each subunit was plotted against the total amount of FoF1 loaded for SDS-PAGE analysis. The plots were fitted with a linear function. The slopes for γ (black), a- (red), and b-subunits (blue) were determined to be 2082, 502, and 2004 (arb. units/µg) for the WT FoF1, and 1521, 821, and 2675 (arb. units/µg) for the δΔN-α fused FoF1, respectively. By normalizing the slopes of the a- and b-subunits to the slope of the γ subunit of each FoF1, the stoichiometries of the a- and b-subunits of the δΔN-α fused FoF1 were estimated to be 2.2 ( = (821/1521)/(502/2082)) and 1.8 ( = (2675/1521)/(2004/2082)) times higher than those of the wild-type FoF1, respectively.

We attempted to determine the H+/ATP ratio of the δΔN-α fused FoF1 through biochemical measurements of the thermodynamic equilibrium between pmf and \(\Delta {G}_{{{{\rm{ATP}}}}}^{,}\), as previously reported17. Firstly, we prepared the FoF1-reconstituted proteoliposomes (PLs) and incubated them in an acidic buffer. The PLs were injected into the base assay medium to initiate ATP synthesis. The ATP synthesis/hydrolysis activity was monitored with the luciferin/luciferase assay system under various pmf conditions, with a given reaction quotient, Q \((=\left[{\mbox{ATP}}\right]/\left(\left[{\mbox{ADP}}\right]\cdot \left[{\mbox{Pi}}\right]\right))\). Figure 4a shows the time courses of the assay, in which the initial rate was determined. Figure 4b shows the reaction rates plotted against the pmf when Q = 2.5. The δΔN-α fused FoF1 was shown to catalyze the ATP synthesis reaction even at low pmf, at which wild-type FoF1 is unable to synthesize ATP. For a more quantitative analysis, the data points were fitted with an exponential function to determine the equilibrium pmf (pmfeq), where the torques of F1 and Fo are balanced and the net reaction rate is zero. At the condition of Fig. 4b where Q = 2.5, pmfeq was determined to be 68 mV for the δΔN-α fused FoF1 and 133 mV for the wild-type. Thus, the minimum pmf for ATP synthesis was halved for the δΔN-α fused FoF1, suggesting that the functional H+/ATP ratio of the δΔN-α fused FoF1 is also doubled, in agreement with SDS-PAGE analysis. For further confirmation, we determined the pmfeq at various Q values (Supplementary Fig. 3). Under all conditions, the pmfeq of the δΔN-α fused FoF1 was nearly half that of the wild-type.

a Time courses of the ATP synthesis/hydrolysis activity of the reconstituted proteoliposomes (PLs) at different pmf. ATP synthesis reaction was measured using the luciferin/luciferase system. The reaction quotient, Q was 2.5; [ATP] = 500 nM, [ADP] = 20 µM, [Pi] = 10 mM. The rate of catalysis was determined from the initial slopes (bold lines). b The ATP synthesis/hydrolysis rates determined from (a) were plotted against pmf. The data points were fitted with an exponential function for the determination of the equilibrium pmf, pmfeq, as the interception of the x axis. c Determination of the H+/ATP ratio. The mean (filled circles) and the SD of \(F\cdot {{pmf}}_{{eq}}\) values were determined from 3 to 4 independent biological replicates (open circles) at each Q condition using different batches of purified enzymes, and \(2.3{RT}\cdot \log Q\) values were plotted against the corresponding \(F\cdot {{pmf}}_{{eq}}\) values according to Eq. (5). Sample sizes (n) from left to right are: 3, 3, 3, 4, 3 (WT) and 4, 3, 3, 4, 3 (δΔN-α). Each line represents a linear regression fit to the dataset obtained from each FoF1.

For the comprehensive analysis of the functional H+/ATP ratio, Eq. (2) was transformed as below,

where \(\Delta {G}_{{ATP}}^{0,}\) is the Gibbs free energy of ATP synthesis under the biochemical standard state, R and T are the gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively. Here, pmfeq values were experimentally determined under defined Q conditions. The other values are constant. Therefore, when \(2.3{RT}\cdot \log Q\) is plotted against \(F\cdot {{pmf}}_{{eq}}\), n (= the H+/ATP ratio) is determined as the slope of the data points. In addition, \({G}_{{ATP}}^{0,}\) is determined as the interception of the y axis. As shown in Fig. 4c, the δΔN-α fused FoF1 exhibited a significantly steeper slope compared to the wild-type FoF1. From the linear fitting, the H+/ATP ratio was determined to be 5.8 ± 0.4 and 3.0 ± 0.2 (fitted value ± SE of the fit) for the δΔN-α fused FoF1 and wild-type, respectively. Although the H+/ATP ratio of the wild-type is slightly lower than the structurally expected value of 3.3 and the reported value (3.3 ± 0.1)17, δΔN-α fused FoF1 was shown to double the H+/ATP ratio, in close agreement with the subunit stoichiometry analysis from SDS-PAGE. This agreement suggests that the δΔN-α fused FoF1 has two functional a-subunits in the ensemble average. From the interception of the y axis, the \(\Delta {G}_{{{{\rm{ATP}}}}}^{0,}\) values are determined to be 38 ± 3 kJ mol−1 (fitted value ± SE of the fit) for both. This value shows a fine agreement with the reported values for Bacillus PS3 FoF1 (39 ± 1 kJ mol−1)17, E. coli (38 ± 3 kJ mol−1)18, yeast (36 ± 3 kJ mol−1)19, and chloroplasts (38 ± 3 and 37 ± 3 kJ mol−1)18,19, supporting the validity of the experiment.

We determined the structure of the δΔN-α fused FoF1 by single-particle cryo-EM analysis. The purified δΔN-α fused FoF1 in detergent was applied to EM grids, frozen in liquid ethane, and imaged with 300 kV cryo-EM followed by single-particle analysis using cryoSPARC. The cryo-EM map was obtained by ab initio 3D reconstruction and classification, followed by refinement with C1 symmetry. Since the rotor complex in FoF is oriented at one of the three catalytic dwell angles relative to the stator ring and peripheral stalk, alignment against the central core complex, including the rotor complex, revealed three distinct positions of the peripheral stalk, each separated by 120°, as observed in previous reports25,26. Map structure classification was performed by masking the peripheral-stalk positions, confirming the presence or absence of the peripheral stalk at the masked position (Supplementary Fig. 4). This classification was conducted for each stalk position: Stalks 1, 2, and 3. Thus, the map structure was classified into eight sub-classes. The overall resolution was 2.5–3.2 Å (Supplementary Fig. 4). While the wild-type FoF1 contains only a single peripheral stalk, this structural classification confirmed that some fractions of the particles contained multiple peripheral stalks (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4). A significant fraction of the particles, however, had either no peripheral stalk or only a single one. The percentages of FoF1 structures with 0, 1, 2, and 3 peripheral stalks, as determined from the 3D classification, were 15, 51, 26, and 8%, respectively. Because of the lower resolution of the Fo region, focused refinement with Fo was conducted by masking the Fo region. The refined structure achieved resolutions of 3.5–6.6 Å, confirming that the peripheral stalk always accompanies Fo a-subunits (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, the percentage of FoF1 with 0, 1, 2, and 3 a-subunits should correspond to that for peripheral stalks. The fractions of FoF1 with multiple a-subunits were small, and the ensemble average of peripheral stalk was only 1.26 per molecule, which is evidently lower than the expected value of ~2 per molecule based on the subunit stoichiometry analysis and the functional analysis of H+/ATP ratio. Although the exact reason for this discrepancy is unclear, it is highly likely that the peripheral stalk and the a-subunit dissociated due to the meniscus force and/or the interaction with the air/water interface during cryo-EM grid preparation27.

The composite cryo-EM maps of FoF1 with single, double, and triple peripheral stalks. The number represents the position of each peripheral stalk. Scale bar, 25 Å.

Among the eight sub-classes, three structures contained a single copy of the peripheral stalk, each located at position Stalk 1, Stalk 2, or Stalk 3. These structures fit well with the reported three rotational state structure of the wild-type Bacillus PS3 FoF125, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating the structural integrity of the binding of the b2 dimer to the F1 part via δΔN-α fusion. Slight differences were observed at the top of the F1 headpiece and on the side of the central stalk because the δΔN-α fused FoF1 lacks the N-terminal region of the δ subunit and the C-terminal helix of the ε subunit. The maps of the double- and triple-stalk FoF1 were compared with the corresponding maps of single-stalk FoF1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6). These maps were well fitted, indicating that multiple stalks have no significant structural constraints on the whole structure of FoF1.

The atomic models for triple-stalk FoF1 are shown in Fig. 6. The structure of the δΔN-α fusion region was well resolved, providing atomic details of its binding site with the b2 dimer (Fig. 6a, b). As designed, the three binding sites were almost identical, with structures similar to those found in wild type Bacillus PS3 FoF125 and other ATP synthases28 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). These observations reveal that the three b2 dimers are incorporated via the canonical interaction with δΔN-a fusion, suggesting the integrity of the peripheral stalks of the δΔN-α fused FoF1.

The structure and the position of the a-subunits of the triple-stalk FoF1 were investigated by comparing them with those in the wild-type Bacillus PS3 FoF125 (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 7b). The spatial intervals between the a-subunits are not perfectly symmetric because of the symmetry mismatch between the ring structures of F1 and Fo, that is, threefold versus tenfold. Each a-subunit interacted with three neighboring c-subunits, forming an a1c3 unit. Therefore, a total of nine c-subunits interacted with the a-subunits, leaving the remaining c-subunit at the open position (gap) between two a-subunits (Fig. 6c). As a result, the three a-subunits were not positioned exactly 120° apart from each other. The asymmetric positioning of the a-subunits is in good agreement with that suggested by the three states of the wild-type Bacillus PS3 FoF125. When the a-subunits in the triple-stalk FoF1 were compared to each other, Cα-RMSDs were 0.3–0.5 Å (Fig. 6d). In addition, the Cα-RMSDs estimated by superimposition of each a-subunit in the triple-stalk FoF1 with that in the corresponding state of the wild-type FoF1 were 0.9–1.0 Å. Moreover, superimposing the a1c3 units in the same manner yielded Cα-RMSDs of 1.0–1.2 Å (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Thus, at the current resolution, the overall structures of the three a-subunits in the triple-stalk FoF1 were essentially identical to each other and closely resembled that of the wild-type Bacillus PS3 FoF1. This suggests that all a-subunits are functional, which is consistent with the aforementioned biochemical analyses showing the enhanced H+/ATP ratio.

The structure of the F1 portion of the triple-stalk FoF1 was investigated by comparing it with previously reported structures. The F1 structure was found to be very similar to that of the Bacillus PS3 FoF1-εΔC under uni-site catalysis conditions26, with one β subunit bound to ADP in a closed conformation (\({{{{\rm{\beta }}}}}_{{{{\rm{TP}}}}}^{C}\)) and two β subunits without bound nucleotide adopting open conformations (\({{{{\rm{\beta }}}}}_{{{{\rm{E}}}}}^{O}\), \({{{{\rm{\beta }}}}}_{{{{\rm{DP}}}}}^{O}\)) (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). The purified δΔN-α fused FoF1 was prepared in nucleotide-free conditions. Therefore, it is highly likely that the bound ADP was endogenous. Notably, at a low-density threshold, weak map density was observed at the outer periphery of \({{{{\rm{\beta }}}}}_{{{{\rm{TP}}}}}^{C}\), which can be well fitted with the open β conformation of the nucleotide-depleted F1 in the Bacillus PS3 FoF1-εΔC26 (Supplementary Fig. 8c). This suggests that the cryo-EM map includes two conformations: closed and open. Other sub-class structures also exhibited similarly mixed maps.

The present study provides insights into the design principles of ATP synthases using an engineering approach. Firstly, the δ subunit is the factor that defines the number of peripheral stalks. In this study, the N-terminal domain of δ, which breaks the structural pseudo-threefold symmetry by binding to the position on the symmetry axis, was deleted, and the C-terminal domain of δ was genetically fused to the N-terminal of the α subunit. As a result, up to three peripheral stalks were incorporated into the FoF1 complex. Structural analysis using cryo-EM revealed that the δΔN-α fusion and the b2 dimer adopted the canonical binding structure observed in the wild-type FoF1, except for the missing N-terminal domain of the δ subunit. This observation clearly shows that the N-terminal domain of the δ subunit determines the number of peripheral stalks per FoF1, restricting it to one by disrupting the structural symmetry.

Next, the number of a-subunits is determined based on the number of peripheral stalks. While cryo-EM analysis showed that some molecules lost peripheral stalks due to the detachment of the b2 dimer, the observed peripheral stalks always remained bound to the a-subunits, indicating stable binding between the a-subunit and the b2 dimer. Thus, the number of peripheral stalks determines the number of a-subunits. The structure of the triple-stalk FoF1 clearly showed that the c10 ring can accommodate up to three a-subunits, but not more than four due to spatial constraints. Considering that each a-subunit can interact with three c-subunits, accommodating four or more a-subunits in FoF1 would require the c-ring consisting of more than 12 c-subunits, along with further engineering on the F1 part, such as introducing a peripheral interaction site at the N-terminus of the β-subunit.

Another important finding of this study is the functional independence of the a-subunit, at least in terms of the coupling stoichiometry of H+ (see below). In the triple-stalk FoF1, all three a-subunits interacted with the c-ring. In addition, the structural features of the interaction agreed well with those observed in the wild-type FoF1 structures. This suggests that each of the three a-subunits is functional. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the samples used in this study had an average of two peripheral stalks and two a-subunits. Consistent with these results, analysis of the equilibrium pmf revealed an H+/ATP ratio that was doubled compared to that of the wild type. These results indicate that the coupling stoichiometry of the H+ ions is proportional to the number of a-subunits. The additivity in H+ stoichiometry means that each a-subunit tightly couples H+ translocation and rotation of the c-ring, regardless of the presence of other a-subunits. This is consistent with the half-channel model, which assumes that the probability of H+ translocation between the a and the c-subunits depends primarily on the relative position of these subunits, which explains well the functional independence of the a-subunits. Based on these considerations, we propose that the number of H+ ions transported coupled with rotation is determined not only by the number of c-subunits constituting the c-ring but also by the number of a-subunits as follows:

where \({N}_{{H}^{+}/{turn}}\), \({N}_{c}\), and \({N}_{a}\) represent the total number of H+ ions per turn, the number of c-subunit in the c-ring, and the number of a-subunit in Fo, respectively. However, one might point out the inconsistency between the biochemical results and the structural analysis with cryo-EM. The proportion of molecules with three peripheral stalks was extremely low, clearly lower than the average number suggested by the biochemical results. This is attributable to the dissociation of the peripheral stalks during sample preparation for cryo-electron microscopy. To confirm this point, it is necessary to develop multi-stalk FoF1 in which peripheral stalks stably bind to F1 and to more accurately analyze the correlation between the number of the a-subunit and the H+ stoichiometry.

As mentioned above, the increased H+/ATP ratio suggests the functional independence of the a-subunits. However, this does not guarantee kinetic independence among the a-subunits. Thus, an arising question is: ‘Can Fo with multiple a-subunits rotate the c-ring at the same rate as the wild-type Fo?'. In other words, ‘Do the a-subunits conduct H+ translocation without mutual interference?' This is a reasonable question considering that, before each 36° rotation step of the c-ring, all a-subunits must complete the H+ translocation with the interacting c-subunits. Therefore, the time constant for each 36° rotation step is expected to be proportional to the number of a-subunits, meaning that the rate constant would decrease inversely.

Our biochemical experiments suggest that ATP hydrolysis-coupled proton pump activity was lower than that of the wild type (Supplementary Table 1). This aligns with the above expectation. However, other scenarios are possible: the engineered FoF1 may be more susceptible to the pmf progressively generated upon proton transport, and the engineered FoF1 may affect the catalytic activity of F1. Therefore, a quantitative and systematic analysis is necessary to verify this issue.

Regarding the lower activity of the mutant, a naive question could arise: ‘Why can the mutant still carry out the ATP synthesis reaction under lower pmf conditions despite its lower activity?'. The reason is as follows: the pmf required for FoF1 to synthesize ATP is determined by the pmfeq at which the synthesis and hydrolysis reaction rates are balanced. The present study shows that the engineered FoF1 with multiple a-subunits doubles the H+/ATP ratio, resulting in a halved pmfeq. Therefore, although the engineered ATP synthase has lower catalytic activity, the mutant enzyme can continue the ATP synthesis reaction under low pmf conditions where the wild-type enzyme is unable to synthesize ATP.

This study has shown that, in principle, ATP synthase has the capacity to expand its H+/ATP ratio to more than double. To date, experimentally confirmed H+/ATP ratios of FoF1 have only been ~3–4. Even structural estimates suggest that 5.0 is the maximum for photosynthetic bacteria. Regarding this point, an N-type ATPase—considered a subtype of the F-type—has been reported to have an exceptionally large c-ring composed of 17 c-subunits29. Although the function and overall structure of this enzyme remain unknown, its predicted H+/ATP ratio is 5.7. The present study demonstrates that the H+/ATP ratio can be significantly increased by genetically engineering ATP synthase to increase the number of a-subunits, without resorting to such a large c-ring. Such genetic mutations may have arisen over the course of evolution. Indeed, we found that the gene operon of ATP synthase from Acidaminococcus fermentans shows the gene fusion of the δ and the α subunits (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, the N-terminal domain of δ is missing. These features are well consistent with the δΔN-α fused FoF1 we designed. Thus, it is highly likely that A. fermentans FoF1 has a multi-stalk structure and can synthesize ATP under low pmf conditions. We also found that other species show similar features (UniProt ID: G4Q3K6, A0A1I2C5T3), suggesting more possibility of a multi-stalk FoF1 in nature. Thus, the present study suggests the unexpected diversity in the design principles of the FoF1 ATP synthase, which awaits further experimental verification.

From an engineering standpoint, the findings of the present study may provide future directions for cell engineering. So far, in microbial fermentation, attention has primarily been devoted to developing metabolic pathways and altering metabolic fluxes, while little effort has been made to optimize the intracellular concentrations and ratios of NAD(P)H and ATP, which are fundamental to cellular bioenergetics. When ATP synthesis is driven by oxidative phosphorylation, the amount of ATP produced depends on the extent of NADH oxidation. In such cases, an increase in the H+/ATP ratio translates into a higher NADH/ATP ratio. This could have a significant impact on microbial fermentations. In particular, it could enhance bioproduction in photosynthetic bacteria when ATP is the bottleneck factor22,30. To verify this possibility, it will be necessary to investigate how introducing ATP synthase with a modified H+/ATP ratio affects cell growth and product formation. Additionally, such insights are likely to shed light on the physiological role of naturally occurring multi-stalk FoF1, which may also exist in nature.

In this study, Bacillus PS3 FoF1-εΔC, which has a 10× His-tag at the N-terminus of the β subunit and lacks the inhibitory C-terminal domain of the ε subunit17,24 was used as the wild-type. The engineered δΔN-α fusion construct of Bacillus PS3 FoF1-εΔC lacks the full-length δ subunit and has a δΔN-α fused subunit in which the N-terminal domain (residues 2–104) of the δ subunit is deleted and its C-terminus is fused to the N-terminus (without Met) of the α subunit via a short linker. The wild-type and engineered FoF1s were expressed in E. coli DK8 cells, which lack endogenous FoF1 genes, by incubating in Super broth at 37 °C for 20 h. Cultured cells were suspended in a solution (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and disrupted by sonication. After removing the cell debris at 9100 × g for 45 min, membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation for 131,500 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. FoF1 was solubilized from the membrane fraction by adding 0.5% (w/v) LMNG (NG310; Anatrace, USA) and incubating for 30 min at 30°C. After centrifugation at 162,000 × g for 30 min, the solubilized fraction was applied to a Ni-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with M buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate buffer and 100 mM KCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.005% LMNG. The column was washed with M buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and 0.005% LMNG, and FoF1 was eluted with M buffer containing 200 mM imidazole and 0.005% LMNG. The eluted FoF1 fractions were concentrated before being applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.005% LMNG). The peak fractions corresponding to FoF1 were collected and concentrated to 5–10 mg/mL, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. The protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The molecular weight of the protein was calculated based on the sequence and subunit stoichiometry. For the δΔN-α fused FoF1, the molecular weight was calculated assuming an average of two peripheral stalks per FoF1 molecule.

ATP synthesis/hydrolysis activity of FoF1 was measured using a luciferin-luciferase system at 25 °C, as described previously17. FoF1-reconstituted PLs were prepared as described17. Then, 300 µL of the PLs were mixed with 700 µL of acidic buffer containing 50 mM MES or HEPES buffer, 0.143–14.3 mM NaH2PO4, 6.7 mM KCl, 49 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, and 600 mM sucrose and NaOH to obtain the desired pH, and then ADP and valinomycin were added to a final concentration of 20-640 µM and 200 nM, respectively. After incubation for 10–24 h at 25 °C for acidification, base assay medium was prepared by mixing 25 µL of the luciferin/luciferase mixture (2× concentration of CLSII solution in ATP bioluminescence assay kit, Roche, and 5 mM luciferin), 800 µL of the base buffer (380 mM HEPES buffer, 0.1125–11.25 mM NaH2PO4, 5.63 mM KCl, 55 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, KOH to adjust K+ concentration and NaOH to adjust pH), 50-100 µL of ATP and ADP to obtain the desired concentration, and water to adjust the total volume to 900 µL and incubated for 10 min for equilibrium. Then, the 100 µL of acidified PLs was injected into the base assay medium to initiate the ATP synthesis reaction, and the ATP synthesis/hydrolysis activity was monitored with the luciferin/luciferase assay system using a luminometer (Luminescencer AB2200, ATTO). For calibrating luminescence light intensity to ATP concentration, 10 μL of 10 μM ATP was added. The rate was determined from the initial slope of the linear regression of the time courses. The ΔpH was obtained by subtracting pHin from pHout, which was determined by directly measuring the pH using a glass electrode. Transmembrane electrical potential, Δψ, was estimated from the Nernst equation.

SDS-PAGE analysis was performed with 10–20% (w/v) gradient gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB Stain One Super, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and imaged with a ChemiDoc Imaging System (BIORAD, USA). The band intensity of each subunit was measured using the gel analyzer tool of Fiji (ImageJ 1.54 f) software. ATPase activity measurements of PLs using an ATP regeneration system were performed at 25 °C in the ATPase assay solution (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 μg/ml Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 100 µg/mL lactate dehydrogenase, 100 µg/mL pyruvate kinase and 0.2 mM NADH) as described previously31. ATP-driven H+-pumping activity was measured by quenching of ACMA (9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine) fluorescence at 25 °C in PA4 buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 0.3 μg/ml ACMA and 1.0 μg/ml FoF1-reconstituted PLs31.

After adding 0.05% lysophosphatidylcholine (1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), 3.0 µL of purified protein (3–6 mg/mL) was loaded onto the glow-discharged Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 grids using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Grids were blotted for 5 s with a blotting force of 15 under 100% humidity at 18 °C, and flash-frozen in liquid ethane. Data were collected using a 300 kV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Falcon 4i direct detector device camera with Selectris-X automated with EPU software. Images were recorded in electron counting mode by recording 50 movie frames with an exposure rate of 1.0 e−/Å2 per frame. The defocus range was 0.8–2.0 μm, and the original pixel size was 0.75 Å.

All image processing steps were performed using cryoSPARC v4.3.0. Details of the image processing workflow are described in Supplementary Fig. 4. A total of 56,081 micrographs were first motion corrected, and the CTF was estimated by patch CTF estimation. Particles were manually picked, and templates for particle selection were generated from 2D classification. After template picking, the selected 4,316,627 particles were subjected to 2D classification. Then, further selections with ab initio 3D reconstruction, heterogeneous, homogeneous, and non-uniform refinements were performed. After non-uniform refinement, all particles were sequentially subjected to a focused 3D refinement using masks for each of the three peripheral stalks, including the N-terminal region of the α subunit, the C-terminal region of the δ subunit and the hydrophilic region of the b2-subunits. Each mask was generated from three rotational states of wild-type Bacillus PS3 FoF1 (PDBs 6N2Z, 6N30, and 6N2Y). Eight classes, including one to three peripheral stalks and three rotational states of FoF1, were identified. The three datasets were collected, merged and refined with non-uniform refinement, resulting in an overall resolution of 2.5–3.2 Å. Further refinement with the Fo mask resulted in a map of the Fo region with an improved resolution of 3.5–6.6 Å. The resolution was estimated using the FSC criterion of 0.143 threshold. The cryo-EM data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. The local resolution maps, FSC curves, orientation distribution plots and Model-to-map fits are shown in Supplementary Figs. 10–12.

Models were built and refined in COOT v0.9.8.93 and PHENIX v1.20.1-4487. using PDB 6N2Z, 6N30, and 6N2Y as the initial model. Validation statistics are shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. A composite map was generated by combining the F1 region of the triple-stalk FoF1 map and the Fo map obtained through local refinement with the Fo mask, using UCSF ChimeraX v1.8 for illustration purposes only. Figures were prepared using PyMOL v2.4.0&2.5.2, UCSF Chimera v1.17.3, and UCSF ChimeraX v1.5&1.8. RMSD values for Cα-atoms were calculated using PyMOL 2.4.0 align command without outlier rejection.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","From Sensual Butt Songs to Santa's Alleged Coke Habit: AI Slop Music Is Getting Harder to Avoid","https://www.wired.com/story/from-sensual-butt-songs-to-santas-alleged-coke-habit-ai-slop-music-is-getting-harder-to-avoid/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:55:00 GMT","

AI slop is flooding every single digital platform, and music streaming services are no exception—so much so, even someone who generally avoids AI might find themselves unknowingly listening to a robot hornily singing about butts.

Take the sordid saga of “Make Love to My Shitter,” an AI-generated track from an artist called BannedVinylCollection. Brace Belden, a host of the popular politics podcast TrueAnon, says that Spotify recently queued up the bawdy song after he'd finished listening to alt-country legend Lucinda Williams' 1992 album Sweet Old World. “I didn't realize the song was AI at first,” he says. “I thought it might've been some obscene joke record from the '80s or '90s.”

The person behind BannedVinylCollection, who goes by “JB” and would not otherwise identify themselves to WIRED, confirmed that his output of X-rated novelty songs are made with AI. Other tunes in BannedVinylCollection's butt-erotica-themed oeuvre include “Grant Me Rectal Delight” and “Taste My Ass.” He says that he is making some money off the music, though most of the profit comes from Patreon and Bandcamp rather than Spotify. “I think it's fair to make money from it,” he says. “Each song can take hours to make.” His monthly earnings on Spotify, he says, are around $200.

Tim Ingham, the founder and publisher of the trade publication Music Business Worldwide, documented his own experience tracking AI-generated music on Spotify last week. Like Belden, the first AI-generated music Spotify served up to him fell under the adult novelty umbrella; instead of butt-themed country music, it was '70s soul-inspired songs about substance use like “I Caught Santa Claus Sniffing Cocaine.” Browsing around Spotify, Ingham writes that he quickly identified 13 artists that appear to be AI-fueled “with approximately 4.1 million cumulative monthly listeners between them.” Not all of this music was overtly goofy—some of it simply imitates popular genres like country.

Spotify did not respond to requests for comment.

The mainstreaming of AI music is not contained to Spotify alone. French music streaming app Deezer tracks the volume of AI songs on its platform and has found in recent months that its AI detection system flags 18 percent of tracks uploaded per day, which is around 600,000 songs per month. Deezer's tools flag and remove some AI content, and the service also removes content flagged as AI from its recommendations. Other major streamers do not yet offer a way for listeners to proactively block AI-generated songs from appearing through algorithmic recommendations. 

“I fully believe that all streaming platforms shouldn't allow the music to be uploaded,” says Belden. Right now, there's no such streamer with a blanket AI ban. Major platforms like Spotify and YouTube prohibit AI music that deepfakes actual artists, while YouTube requires creators to label “realistic” AI content. Spotify does not have a disclosure rule around labeling content that's AI.

Belden initially shared his story on X last week after media reports highlighted the overnight success of the Velvet Sundown, a psychedelic rock band that had swiftly amassed over half a million monthly listeners on Spotify within weeks of debuting its music on the platform. Reporters described both the images the band used to promote itself and its music as obviously AI-generated.

WIRED initially sought comment from a X account claiming to be Velvet Sundown. The account claimed the band “never uses AI” for its music. A day later, though, an individual clarified that he had impersonated Velvet Sundown on social media, which included setting up a fake email for the band, and was not affiliated with the Spotify project.

AI-speech-recognition expert Yossi Keshet assessed Velvet Sundown's output as “definitely AI-generated.” What strikes him as the most notable thing about the AI music is how much traction it gained, and its quality: “There's been a rise in AI-generated music, but this is phenomenal,” he tells WIRED. “Relatively, the quality is really good.”

Andy Cush, a musician and editor at the independent music publication Hearing Things, recently stumbled upon AI music in an unlikely setting. “My girlfriend and I were hanging out in Prospect Park, and there was a guy blasting some sort of smooth jazz instrumental guitar music nearby,” he says. The pair, who both play guitar, were curious enough about what they were hearing that they went up and asked the man what he was playing. He showed Cush a YouTube compilation video; later, Cush looked the video up and discovered that it had been flagged as AI-generated.

“It was a weird experience and prompted somewhat of a crisis for me,” says Cush. He'd found the music corny overall but had been genuinely impressed by the guitarist's proficiency. Finding out that it was AI made him realize that it might be harder to write-off AI music than he thought.

Around the same time Cush was grooving to robotic riffs in the park, AI music took another leap toward ubiquity. In June, an AI-generated song appeared on the US charts for the first time, hitting number 44 on the TikTok Viral 50 chart. Vinih Pray's “A Million Colors,” a doo-wop pastiche, was generated with the AI tool Suno. It's popular on other platforms, too, with well over a million plays on Spotify. The top comment on YouTube: “I hate how much I love this song.”

Updated 7-3-25, 1:22 pm EDT: WIRED has clarified the source of statements provided by the accounts purportedly representing Velvet Sundown. WIRED has also updated the capabilities of Deezer's AI removal tools.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Promise and Peril of Digital Security in the Age of Dictatorship","https://www.wired.com/story/the-promise-and-peril-of-digital-security-in-the-age-of-dictatorship/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 09:30:00 GMT","

Steven Rodríguez traveled more than 40 miles from his home in Santa Ana, in western El Salvador, to attend the Pride march in the capital on June 28. It is the second time he has attended. There, some 20,000 people gathered in a mix of celebration and protest for the rights of sexual diversity. But this year, joy was replaced by fear.

“Maybe it won't escalate, but there is a fear that what happened to the El Bosque cooperative will happen. But, from deep down I believe that, as people, we have the right to a dignified life. If it's not me, who else is going to defend my experiences,” says Rodríguez about his decision to attend in the midst of the authoritarian escalation that the country is experiencing.

When Nayib Bukele assumed power in 2019, one of his first actions was to eliminate the Directorate of Sexual Diversity. In February 2024, during his participation in the Conservative Political Action Conference in the US, he made his position clear: “We do not allow those ideologies in schools and colleges. I think it is also important that the curriculum does not include gender ideology and such things.”

Rodríguez's main fear is that the march will serve as an excuse to criminalize its attendees. Earlier this year, on May 12, a hundred members of the El Bosque cooperative held a peaceful protest to avoid being evicted. This was repressed by the military police and ended with the arrest of community leader José Ángel Pérez and lawyer Alejandro Henríquez for public disorder. Both are serving provisional detention in a penal center. In the past four months, at least six human rights defenders have been arrested in the country for political reasons.

On the afternoon of June 28, the march ended peacefully and, at least on the ground, no arrests were recorded.

Rodríguez is part of a collective called Pedrina, which focuses on community articulation for LGBTIQ+ rights in the West. His approach to digital security began when members of the organization started receiving insults, threats, and hate messages on social networks.

Rodríguez and his collective received digital security training from Amate, another LGBTIQ+ organization that advocates nationally. Since May, Amate has trained 60 people on issues including digital rights, risk analysis, extortion, phishing, outing, surveillance, and revenge porn. It also includes the implementation of tools such as the use of VPN and encrypted messaging platforms, such as Signal and Proton.

“Something that activists were telling us [that] is very common is that people take their Facebook photos and impersonate them on social networks, either to attack other collectives or to undermine personal aspects. So it's a very interesting experience. People are not aware of the exposure we have in the digital world,” says Fernando Paz, who is in charge of teaching these courses.

For Rodríguez, these tools are a way of confronting a country that, with government support, is becoming increasingly violent towards those who represent diversity.

“At the university, we have had experiences of hate speech in classes. Professors have said that they share Bukele's thinking on gender ideology and that this has to disappear because it poisons the youth,” Rodríguez says.

One way the government has used to hide violence against the LGBTIQ+ community is the lack of accounting of hate crimes committed in El Salvador. In recent years, the country's Attorney General's Office, also known as FGR, has used the categories “murder due to social intolerance” and “murder due to family intolerance” to count homicides that it cannot attribute to what it calls “general crime” (mostly, according to the government's narrative, perpetrated by gangs). There is no clarity about what falls into these categories, which are not official, are not defined, and are only used publicly—not within administrative reports. Between 2023 and 2024, the FGR counted 182 of these cases.

In the face of statistical obscurity, the exercise of documenting and archiving hate crimes has been taken up by organizations. The Passionist Social Service, an anti-violence group, found that 154 LGBTIQ+ people have been detained during El Salvador's emergency regime, which began in March 2022 and has been extended 39 times to date. Following this, Nicola Chávez and her team saw the need to record cases of violence against members of the LGBTIQ+ population.

“We had always intended to start an observatory, but with the start of the exception regime everyone knows that police violence and military harassment have a disproportionate impact on the LGBT community. Obviously that hurts us, and I don't know who else they count on to be able to denounce,” Chávez says.

To date, Chávez's team has registered 68 incidents of violence against LGBTIQ+ people, although they believe there could be more. One of the main challenges has been to create a centralized database of the information that each member had kept on their own.

“One of the big frustrations has always been that we don't have consistency when it comes to storing information,” Chávez says. “To make this database, I had to go from computer to computer, collecting information in emails and loose files.”

Chávez, a doctoral student in American Studies and archivist, applied her knowledge to compile and organize the information. For her, it's crucial to secure the databases that contain sensitive information related to the victims' allegations under the emergency regime. One of the keys is to protect the data with multiple layers of security and to use encrypted platforms with automatic self-destruct functions, such as CryptPad.

The authoritarian escalation in El Salvador has forced organizations to be more cautious with their public work. For this reason, Chávez requested that her organization not be mentioned for fear of reprisals following the recent approval of the Foreign Agents Law, which requires those receiving international funds to register as “foreign agents.” If authorized, they would be subject to a 30 percent tax on all foreign funding, a measure that opponents of the legislation say seeks to economically stifle dissenting voices.

El Salvador's political situation has forced them to contemplate several scenarios on how to safeguard information. The most critical implies that the government may consider the activities of their organization as a direct contravention of the law and raid their offices. Another concern is that, at the time of registration, they will be required to hand over the contents of the devices.

“The registry is designed as an all-powerful entity. There are minimum requirements to be able to register, but they have the power to demand whatever they want,” says Chávez. “There are no limits in the regulations on what they can request. What worries us is that, as part of a routine process, they want to seize computers, hard disks, etc.”

The passage of this law to control speech and information is not an isolated case. In November 2024, El Salvador's Congress passed laws establishing the creation of the State Cybersecurity Agency, whose powers include managing cyber threats and overseeing data protection compliance.

“The government of El Salvador has created an entire infrastructure to have not only social, but also digital control of the citizenry. With the creation of this agency, an oversight tool is enabled for issues related to information, the use of technology and our digital identity,” explains Joshi Leban, a specialist in advocacy and digital literacy.

The records that Chávez is so keenly guarding also have a vision in which this hope for justice persists.

“At some point, perhaps this will become an international litigation, or it may be that this government ends and a process of oversight of what has happened begins. In that scenario, it will serve that the organizations have put these facts on record as documentation.”

“Is Qonto a real bank?” is one of the top suggested questions in Google searches about the French fintech startup. The answer is no, but it could change: Qonto has filed for a banking license in France, CEO Alexandre Prot revealed.

Qonto, which targets European freelancers and SMBs, currently operates with a payment institution license it obtained in 2018, and which already enabled it to introduce a form of buy now, pay later (BNPL). But a credit institution license would let it offer broader lending, savings, and investment options to its target customers.

Since its current license is valid across the EU, Qonto has already been able to expand into several European markets, and recently reached the milestone of 600,000 customers. But lacking a credit license is a hindrance for its goal to reach 2 million customers by 2030.

While offering a more comprehensive solution seems like a natural move to compete with incumbent banks, obtaining a license and rolling out credit is not easy. That explains why Qonto's SMB fintech competitors have approached this issue in different ways, and why Qonto isn't exactly playing catch-up. 

Memo Bank was founded as a bank from the outset, and offers lending to SMBs, but that makes it an outlier. Finom operates with an electronic money institution (EMI) license, but it only just started testing the kind of lending that this regulatory middle ground allows. Revolut has a full Lithuanian license, but other than BNPL, it has yet to roll out credit options to businesses — although it plans to do so this year.

Still, the marketing power of well-funded competitors that operate both in B2C and B2B may have been a sign that Qonto needed to accelerate, especially as Revolut recently loudly announced plans to seek a French license and turn Paris into its Western Europe HQ. 

Not mentioning competitors, Prot said that Qonto's timing was driven by “having achieved profitability ahead of schedule in 2023.” 

The son of former BNP Paribas President Baudouin Prot, Qonto's CEO had obviously already thought about pursuing a credit license — and that's not just a guess. During a press briefing, Prot confirmed that he and co-founder Steve Anavi seriously considered the idea at one point, but ultimately dismissed it because it would have required too much time and additional fundraising.

Having been profitable since 2023 means that this hurdle now won't require Qonto to raise more funding than the $552 million it secured in 2022 at a $5 billion valuation. Prot recently said that “the main, or the only reason, why we could raise additional capital is if we do a large or very large M&A deal, paid mostly in cash.” 

In its eight years of existence, Qonto has made two acquisitions: It took over its German competitor Penta in 2022, and it bought accounting and financial automation platform Regate in 2024.

The latter is a reflection of Qonto's positioning beyond banking and as an integrated finance management solution, with an offering that also includes tools for invoicing and bookkeeping.

This approach helped it grow in the B2B segment across Europe. Prot declined to give a full breakdown of its 600,000 customers, but he said that Germany is now Qonto's largest market after France. In unspecified order, Spain and Italy come next, followed by the markets it entered in late 2024: Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal.

Still, Prot operates under the assumption that some customers won't choose Qonto unless it is a credit institution. That's because this would grant them additional guarantees on their deposits, and because they want credit to be an option if they ever need it, which some already do.

Qonto validated that demand for credit with its Pay Later service; launched in 2024, it has already facilitated €50 million in financing, according to the company (approximately $59 million). But the offer is limited by its current license — both for Qonto, which can only lend from its own equity, and for its customers, who can't borrow for longer than 12 months.

To help its customers access other types of loans, Qonto also put together a “financing hub” with third-party fintech partners including Defacto, Karmen, Riverbank, and Silvr. Prot said Qonto plans to keep it for at least a few more years. And some of these offerings are more specific than what the company may want to get into.

Still, becoming a credit institution in its own right would unlock new revenue for Qonto, both from the margin on credits and more upside from deposits, which it would be able to use for lending. Prot declined to disclose revenue figures but said that revenue increased by 30% in the last year.

However, Prot said that this additional revenue wasn't the main factor at play. Acquiring new customers aside, Qonto also sees this as an opportunity to depend less on others and launch new products faster. In the same vein, it recently built an in-house card processor to increase acceptance rates while reducing its reliance on third parties.

With a team of 1,600 people, Qonto now hopes that it will have the bandwidth to work on new product developments, such as the AI-enabled “Qonto Intelligence” layer, while also enhancing its banking infrastructure and risk management teams.

The latter is also aimed to demonstrate its readiness to France's banking supervisor, with which it plans to work closely to obtain its license. The process may still take years, but it is also part of a broader “growing up” effort for Qonto, which recently added several senior profiles to its board of directors. These steps could also help lay the groundwork for a future IPO, though that remains a longer-term prospect.

Note: This story's headline was changed to clarify that Qonto is not yet a bank.

The ransomware gang known as Hunters International announced on its dark web page Thursday that it is shutting down. 

“After careful consideration and in light of recent developments, we have decided to close the Hunters International project,” the hackers wrote in a post, without clarifying what specific developments it was referring to. “This decision was not made lightly, and we recognize the impact it has on the organizations we have interacted with.”

The hackers also said they are offering free decryption keys “to all companies that have been impacted by our ransomware.”

“Our goal is to ensure that you can recover your encrypted data without the burden of paying ransoms,” wrote the gang, which asked victims to visit its official site to obtain the decryption keys and to recover the encrypted files.

At the time of writing, there is no such information on the website. 

Hunters International has claimed several victims in its two years of existence, including a U.S. cancer center and the U.S. Marshals Service; however, the law enforcement agency denied having been hacked by the cybercrime gang.

Several ransomware gangs in the past have released their victims' decryption keys, then shut down, each of them for different reasons. Some shut down only to return under a new name, perhaps in an attempt to confuse researchers and law enforcement agencies and sometimes to escape sanctions. Others decided to call it quits after obtaining enough funds to retire.

In the case of Hunters International, it's still too early to tell what the gang's motivations are for shutting down, but there were signs as far back as April that point to a rebrand and transition to a group called World Leaks, according to Allan Liska, a threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. 

“I think this is more of a ‘cutting of ties' with the old infrastructure,” said Liska, who has been tracking ransomware for years. “As far as releasing decryption keys, at this point they aren't likely to make any money from any Hunters' victims who are still out there, so they probably see it as a gesture that doesn't really cost them anything.”

World Leaks group uses a new ransomware software and has a new site hosted elsewhere, but the people behind it may be the same, said Liska.

Liska said the reason for the gang going dark may be that “using the same technical infrastructure too long makes you more vulnerable to law enforcement,” referring to Hive, a ransomware gang that was seized and shut down by the FBI in 2023. 

“Or, they got wind that law enforcement was closing in and decided to get ahead of them,” he said.

Despite their imposing presence, quantum computers are delicate beasts, and their errors are among the main bottlenecks that the quantum computing community is actively working to address. Failing this, promising applications in finance, drug discovery, and materials science may never become real.

That's the reason why Google touted the error correction capacities of its latest quantum computing chip, Willow. And IBM is both working on delivering its own “fault-tolerant” quantum computer by 2029 and collaborating with partners like Qedma, an Israeli startup in which it also invested, as TechCrunch learned exclusively.

While most efforts focus on hardware, Qedma specializes in error mitigation software. Its main piece of software, QESEM, or quantum error suppression and error mitigation, analyzes noise patterns to suppress some classes of errors while the algorithm is running and mitigate others in post-processing.

Qedma's co-founder and chief scientific officer, Professor Dorit Aharonov, once described as a member of “quantum royalty” for her and her father's contributions to the field, said this enables quantum circuits up to 1,000 times larger to run accurately on today's hardware, without waiting for further advancements on error correction at the computer level.

IBM itself does both quantum hardware and software, and some of its partners, like French startup Pasqal, also develop their own hardware. But it sees value as well in partnering with companies more narrowly focusing on the software layer, like Qedma and Tiger Global-backed Finnish startup Algorithmiq, its VP of Quantum, Jay Gambetta, told TechCrunch.

That's because IBM thinks driving quantum further requires a community effort. “If we all work together, I do think it's possible that we will get scientific accepted definitions of quantum advantage in the near future, and I hope that we can then turn them into more applied use cases that will grow the industry,” Gambetta said.

“Quantum advantage” usually refers to demonstrating the usefulness of quantum over classical computers. “But useful is a very subjective term,” Gambetta said. In all likelihood, it will first apply to an academic problem, not a practical one. In this context, it may take more than one attempt to build consensus that it's not just another artificial or overly constrained scenario.

Still, having a quantum computer execute a program that a classical computer can't simulate with the same accuracy would be an important step for the industry — and Qedma claims it is getting closer. “It's possible that already within this year, we'll be able to demonstrate with confidence that the quantum advantage is here,” CEO and co-founder Asif Sinay said.

With a doctorate in physics, Sinay previously worked as a physicist at Magic Leap, then a multi-billion-worth AR company with a large R&D center in Israel. Like the founders of several Israeli startups, from Metacafe to Wiz, he is also a Talpion — an alum from Israel's elite military program Talpiot, where one of his classmates was Lior Litwak.

Litwak is now a managing partner at Israeli VC firm Glilot Capital Partners, which led Qedma's $26 million Series A through its early growth fund, Glilot+, which he heads. The round included participation from existing investors such as TPY Capital, which backed Qedma's $4.7 million seed round in 2020, as well as new investors including Korean Investment Partners — and IBM.

Since last September, Qedma has been available through IBM's Qiskit Functions Catalog, which makes quantum more accessible to end users. Sinay noted the synergies between the two companies, but emphasized that Qedma's plans are hardware-agnostic.

The startup has already conducted a demo on the Aria computer from IonQ, a publicly listed U.S. company focused on trapped ion quantum computing. In addition, Qedma has an evaluation agreement with an unnamed partner Sinay described as “the largest company in the market.” Recently, it also presented its collaboration with Japan's RIKEN on how to combine quantum with supercomputers.

The joint Q2B Tokyo presentation was co-delivered by Qedma's CTO and third co-founder, Professor Netanel Lindner. An associate professor of theoretical physics and research group lead at Technion, he told TechCrunch he is hoping that some of his former doctorate students — or others they know — will join Qedma as part of the startup's hiring efforts.

According to Sinay, Qedma will use the proceeds from its latest funding round to grow its team from around 40 to between 50 and 60 people. Some of these new recruits will be researchers and software engineers, but he said the startup also plans to hire for marketing and sales roles. “We are selling our software to the end users, and our partners are the hardware manufacturers.”

For hardware manufacturers like IBM, this software layer addresses the fact that a quant at a bank or a chemist who could leverage quantum are not experts in how to run circuits in the presence of noise. However, they know their respective domains and the conditions they want to set.

“So you want to be able to write the problem and say, I want it to run with this accuracy, I'm OK with this much usage of a quantum computer, and this much usage of a classical computer,” Gambetta said. “They want [these] to be essentially little options that they can put into their software; and that's exactly what Qedma is doing, as well as some of [the] other partners we're working with.”

Some researchers are already taking advantage of this via Qiskit Functions, or through partnerships that research institutions have established with Qedma and its industry peers. But the debate is still open as to when these experiments will become larger, and when quantum advantage will materialize for the broader world.

Qedma hopes to accelerate the timeline by providing a shortcut. Unlike error correction at the computer level, which adds overhead that limits scalability, Qedma's approach doesn't require more quantum bits, or qubits. “Our claim is that we can get quantum advantage even before a million qubits are achieved,” Lindner said. 

However, other companies are approaching that issue from different angles. For instance, French startup Alice & Bob raised $104 million earlier this year to develop a fault-tolerant quantum computer whose architecture relies on “cat qubits,” which are inherently protected against certain errors, reducing the need for more qubits. 

But Qedma is not dismissive of the race for more qubits; since it acts as a booster either way, its team wants hardware to have as many qubits as possible, and the best qubits possible. In practice, though, it will be hard to maximize both at once, just like software-based error mitigation typically means longer runtimes. The best choice will depend on the specific task — but first, quantum will have to get to those tasks.

In late May, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei appeared to kick open the door on a sensitive topic, warning that half of entry-level jobs could vanish within five years because of AI and push U.S. unemployment up to 20%. But Amodei is far from alone in sharing aloud that he foresees a workforce bloodbath. A new WSJ story highlights how other CEOs are also issuing dire predictions about AI's job impact, turning employment doom into something of a competitive sport.

Several of these predictions came before Amodei's comments. For example, at JPMorgan's annual investor day earlier in May, its consumer banking chief Marianne Lake projected AI would “enable” a 10% workforce reduction. But they've been coming fast, and growing more stark, ever since. In a note last month, Amazon's Andy Jassy warned employees to expect a smaller workforce due to the “once-in-a-lifetime” technological shift that's afoot. ThredUp's CEO said at a conference last month that AI will destroy “way more jobs than the average person thinks.” Not to be outdone, Ford's Jim Farley delivered perhaps the most sweeping claim yet, saying last week that AI will “literally replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”

It's a dramatic shift from executives' previous cautious public statements about job displacement, notes the Journal. Indeed, the outlet notes that while some tech leaders — including from powerful AI companies — have proposed that fears are overblown, the growing string of warnings suggests massive restructurings are coming, whether people are ready for them or not.

Ambiguity in your storage format isn't good in the long run… JSON lines can be trivially parsed anywhere without a second thought.

I have started writing web apps that simply store the user data as a file, and I am very pleased with this approach.It works perfectly for Desktop and Android.iOS does not allow for real Chrome everywhere (only in Europe, I think), so I also offer to store the data in the ""Origin private file system"" which all browsers support.

If there were something that formalized this a little more, developers could even make their apps in a... Bring Your Own Network... kinda way. Maybe there's already someone doing this?

Could this allow accessing a local db as well? Would love something that could allow an app to talk directly to a db that lives locally in my devices, and that the db could sync across the devices - that way I still get my data in all of my devices, but it always stays only in my devicesOf course this would be relatively straightforward to do with native applications, but it would be great to be able to do it with web applications that run on the browserBtw, does Chrome sync local storage across devices when logged in?

A lot of what I've read about local-first apps included solving for data syncing for collaborative features. I had no idea it could be this simple if all you need is local persistence.

But in all seriousness, I may be going on a tangent but I don't think that anybody can monetize code under less than 1k loc. Are there any cool examples anybody want to share?Maybe ""simple"" api's would generally be the only thing that would be more monetizable and still fall under less than 1k loc. But still I would love hearing more about this kind of thing.

Now what I do like though is the second line of your post. What are the comparisons...
Now IMO, the biggest thing is that this thing is genuinely really tiny (less than 1k loc is wild) and maybe they really followed the occam's razor and just ditched sql and the simplest sql (sqllite) altogether for the sweet csv.I never thought there would be a day where I would have to say that sqlite would be the one complex given how in all senses sqlite is like the most simplest / embeddable sql database or databases in general. Maybe I am going into a tangent but I love sqlite and what pocketbase does tbh. I think of sqlite + per user db and I just get so happy thinking about this architecture tbh. I love sqlite.

NIH mostly.A big part of why PocketBase is so good is because the project is aggressively constrained, both in features and contributions. I'd suggest people contribute to the ecosystem, which is big and growing.

I tried to experiment with an API similar to what k8s api server offers: dynamic schemas for custom resources, generated uniform REST API with well-defined RBAC rules, watch/real-time notifications, customisation of business logic with admission hooks etc.I also attempted to make it as small as possible. So yeah, I don't try to compete with Pocketbase and others, just trying to see what it takes to build a minimally viable backend with a similar architecture.The choice of the ""database"" is dictated by the very same goals. I deliberately made it an interface, better databases exist and can be plugged in with little code changes. But for starters I went with what Go stdlib offers, and CSV is easy enough to debug.

Given the setup I'd guess it makes sense for little household scale apps w/ a user list in the low tens of people.

I appreciate how it seems like we have a spectrum of similar options emerging now for simple backends, ranging from pennybase to trailbase to pocketbase. I do hope one of them eventually implements postgres as an alternative to sqlite at some point though.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Google's electricity demand is skyrocketing","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/03/1119627/google-electricity-fusion-ai/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Meanwhile, company emissions are up 50% since 2019.

We got two big pieces of energy news from Google this week. The company announced that it's signed an agreement to purchase electricity from a fusion company's forthcoming first power plant. Google also released its latest environmental report, which shows that its energy use from data centers has doubled since 2020.

Taken together, these two bits of news offer a fascinating look at just how desperately big tech companies are hunting for clean electricity to power their data centers as energy demand and emissions balloon in the age of AI. Of course, we don't know exactly how much of this pollution is attributable to AI because Google doesn't break that out. (Also a problem!) So, what's next and what does this all mean? 

Commonwealth Fusion Systems is trying to bring a long-promised technology to reality.

Let's start with fusion: Google's deal with Commonwealth Fusion Systems is intended to provide the tech giant with 200 megawatts of power. This will come from Commonwealth's first commercial plant, a facility planned for Virginia that the company refers to as the Arc power plant. The agreement represents half its capacity.

What's important to note here is that this power plant doesn't exist yet. In fact, Commonwealth still needs to get its Sparc demonstration reactor, located outside Boston, up and running. That site, which I visited in the fall, should be completed in 2026.

(An aside: This isn't the first deal between Big Tech and a fusion company. Microsoft signed an agreement with Helion a couple of years ago to buy 50 megawatts of power from a planned power plant, scheduled to come online in 2028. Experts expressed skepticism in the wake of that deal, as my colleague James Temple reported.)

Nonetheless, Google's announcement is a big moment for fusion, in part because of the size of the commitment and also because Commonwealth, a spinout company from MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, is seen by many in the industry as a likely candidate to be the first to get a commercial plant off the ground. (MIT Technology Review is owned by MIT but is editorially independent.)

Google leadership was very up-front about the length of the timeline. “We would certainly put this in the long-term category,” said Michael Terrell, Google's head of advanced energy, in a press call about the deal.

The news of Google's foray into fusion comes just days after the tech giant's release of its latest environmental report. While the company highlighted some wins, some of the numbers in this report are eye-catching, and not in a positive way.

Google's emissions have increased by over 50% since 2019, rising 6% in the last year alone. That's decidedly the wrong direction for a company that's set a goal to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the decade.

It's true that the company has committed billions to clean energy projects, including big investments in next-generation technologies like advanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal systems. Those deals have helped dampen emissions growth, but it's an arguably impossible task to keep up with the energy demand the company is seeing.

Google's electricity consumption from data centers was up 27% from the year before. It's doubled since 2020, reaching over 30 terawatt-hours. That's nearly the annual electricity consumption from the entire country of Ireland.

As an outsider, it's tempting to point the finger at AI, since that technology has crashed into the mainstream and percolated into every corner of Google's products and business. And yet the report downplays the role of AI. Here's one bit that struck me:

“However, it's important to note that our growing electricity needs aren't solely driven by AI. The accelerating growth of Google Cloud, continued investments in Search, the expanding reach of YouTube, and more, have also contributed to this overall growth.”

There is enough wiggle room in that statement to drive a large electric truck through. When I asked about the relative contributions here, company representative Mara Harris said via email that they don't break out what portion comes from AI. When I followed up asking if the company didn't have this information or just wouldn't share it, she said she'd check but didn't get back to me.

I'll make the point here that we've made before, including in our recent package on AI and energy: Big companies should be disclosing more about the energy demands of AI. We shouldn't be guessing at this technology's effects.

Google has put a ton of effort and resources into setting and chasing ambitious climate goals. But as its energy needs and those of the rest of the industry continue to explode, it's obvious that this problem is getting tougher, and it's also clear that more transparency is a crucial part of the way forward.

There is enormous potential for this technology, but only if we deploy it responsibly.

Google's recent unveiling of what it calls a “new class of agentic experiences” feels like a turning point. At its I/O 2025 event in May, for example, the company showed off a digital assistant that didn't just answer questions; it helped work on a bicycle repair by finding a matching user manual, locating a YouTube tutorial, and even calling a local store to ask about a part, all with minimal human nudging. Such capabilities could soon extend far outside the Google ecosystem. The company has introduced an open standard called Agent-to-Agent, or A2A, which aims to let agents from different companies talk to each other and work together.

The vision is exciting: Intelligent software agents that act like digital coworkers, booking your flights, rescheduling meetings, filing expenses, and talking to each other behind the scenes to get things done. But if we're not careful, we're going to derail the whole idea before it has a chance to deliver real benefits. As with many tech trends, there's a risk of hype racing ahead of reality. And when expectations get out of hand, a backlash isn't far behind.

We're starting to give AI agents real autonomy, and we're not prepared for what could happen next.

Let's start with the term “agent” itself. Right now, it's being slapped on everything from simple scripts to sophisticated AI workflows. There's no shared definition, which leaves plenty of room for companies to market basic automation as something much more advanced. That kind of “agentwashing” doesn't just confuse customers; it invites disappointment. We don't necessarily need a rigid standard, but we do need clearer expectations about what these systems are supposed to do, how autonomously they operate, and how reliably they perform.

And reliability is the next big challenge. Most of today's agents are powered by large language models (LLMs), which generate probabilistic responses. These systems are powerful, but they're also unpredictable. They can make things up, go off track, or fail in subtle ways—especially when they're asked to complete multistep tasks, pulling in external tools and chaining LLM responses together. A recent example: Users of Cursor, a popular AI programming assistant, were told by an automated support agent that they couldn't use the software on more than one device. There were widespread complaints and reports of users canceling their subscriptions. But it turned out the policy didn't exist. The AI had invented it.

In enterprise settings, this kind of mistake could create immense damage. We need to stop treating LLMs as standalone products and start building complete systems around them—systems that account for uncertainty, monitor outputs, manage costs, and layer in guardrails for safety and accuracy. These measures can help ensure that the output adheres to the requirements expressed by the user, obeys the company's policies regarding access to information, respects privacy issues, and so on. Some companies, including AI21 (which I cofounded and which has received funding from Google), are already moving in that direction, wrapping language models in more deliberate, structured architectures. Our latest launch, Maestro, is designed for enterprise reliability, combining LLMs with company data, public information, and other tools to ensure dependable outputs.

Still, even the smartest agent won't be useful in a vacuum. For the agent model to work, different agents need to cooperate (booking your travel, checking the weather, submitting your expense report) without constant human supervision. That's where Google's A2A protocol comes in. It's meant to be a universal language that lets agents share what they can do and divide up tasks. In principle, it's a great idea.In practice, A2A still falls short. It defines how agents talk to each other, but not what they actually mean. If one agent says it can provide “wind conditions,” another has to guess whether that's useful for evaluating weather on a flight route. Without a shared vocabulary or context, coordination becomes brittle. We've seen this problem before in distributed computing. Solving it at scale is far from trivial.

New research shows that in AI-to-AI price negotiations, weaker models often lose out—costing users real money and raising concerns about growing digital inequality.

There's also the assumption that agents are naturally cooperative. That may hold inside Google or another single company's ecosystem, but in the real world, agents will represent different vendors, customers, or even competitors. For example, if my travel planning agent is requesting price quotes from your airline booking agent, and your agent is incentivized to favor certain airlines, my agent might not be able to get me the best or least expensive itinerary. Without some way to align incentives through contracts, payments, or game-theoretic mechanisms, expecting seamless collaboration may be wishful thinking.

None of these issues are insurmountable. Shared semantics can be developed. Protocols can evolve. Agents can be taught to negotiate and collaborate in more sophisticated ways. But these problems won't solve themselves, and if we ignore them, the term “agent” will go the way of other overhyped tech buzzwords. Already, some CIOs are rolling their eyes when they hear it.

That's a warning sign. We don't want the excitement to paper over the pitfalls, only to let developers and users discover them the hard way and develop a negative perspective on the whole endeavor. That would be a shame. The potential here is real. But we need to match the ambition with thoughtful design, clear definitions, and realistic expectations. If we can do that, agents won't just be another passing trend; they could become the backbone of how we get things done in the digital world.

Yoav Shoham is a professor emeritus at Stanford University and cofounder of AI21 Labs. His 1993 paper on agent-oriented programming received the AI Journal Classic Paper Award. He is coauthor of Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations, a standard textbook in the field. 

Adoption of the tech has civil liberties advocates alarmed, especially as the government vows to expand surveillance of protesters and students.

AlphaEvolve uses large language models to find new algorithms that outperform the best human-made solutions for data center management, chip design, and more.

In 2019, Karen Hao, a senior reporter with MIT Technology Review, pitched writing a story about a then little-known company, OpenAI. This is what happened next.

If you're an Apple fan, then your life will generally be a little bit easier if you choose to stick within that ecosystem when it comes to your other tech. You can get tablets, smartwatches, and MacBooks, sure, but the most common addition to an iPhone user's arsenal is AirPods. These are the best headphones for Apple users, and some of the best available in general as well.

See at Amazon

Well, that's where a good deal can come in incredibly handy. Being able to save any money on these excellent headphones is a huge deal, especially so when you're looking at the top-end options like Apple AirPods Max. Well, thanks to a deal available on Amazon right now, you can currently get these incredible headphones at 13% off. That means they're down to $480 for a limited time.

Apple AirPods Max are over-ear headphones, so they're a lot more comfortable if you're someone who doesn't like having earbuds in. Actually, they're just really comfortable in general, thanks to the incredible design at work here. They also sound incredible, with functions like active noise cancelling and spatial audio allowing these to deliver sound in an unparalleled way. If you're an audiophile and an Apple user, these are the headphones you're probably dreaming of.

Along with that, you've got all manner of controls on them to allow you to change the volume, pause and play your songs or podcasts, and even mute yourself when you're on calls. They've got an immense battery life as well, allowing you to listen nonstop for up to 20 hours on a full charge. On top of all of that, if you're someone who really wants to look good while your music sounds good, then you'll be happy to know that they come in a few different colors as well.

While pricey at the standard price of $549, these headphones really are worth it for those who can afford to get them. So, this discount, while not massive, is big enough to make them even better value for money at $480. We don't know how long this deal will last though, and given that they don't need to get discounted to sell, it's not worth waiting around for too long just in case you end up missing out on them. All five colors are on sale at this price too, which is always nice.

In the new AI economy, it seems no job is safe, not even at a thriving business. Microsoft's Xbox division is a case in point. Last quarter, its revenue soared by 8% year over year. And yet, the division is now at the center of the tech giant's largest wave of layoffs since 2023, with thousands of its employees among the 9,000 jobs cut by Microsoft on Wednesday.

In a memo sent to his shell-shocked employees and reviewed by Gizmodo, Microsoft's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, performed a masterclass in corporate doublespeak. He announced a massive new round of layoffs across the Xbox division, all while insisting that business has never been better.

“I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before,” Spencer wrote. “Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger.”

Xbox's Phil Spencer confirms layoffs impacting Microsoft Gaming unit in an internal memo shared with staff.

""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business."" pic.twitter.com/9x5bHmNibZ

— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) July 2, 2025



And yet, in the same breath, he confirmed that thousands of jobs would be eliminated and that the company will “end or decrease work in certain areas of the business.” A separate memo from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty made the damage concrete: long-awaited, ambitious titles like Perfect Dark and Everwild are being canceled, and at least one studio, The Initiative, one of Microsoft's newer, high-profile studios, is being closed entirely.

So what's really going on? If the company is stronger than ever, why fire thousands of people and scrap years of creative work?

Microsoft Is Firing About 9,000 Because Business Is Great

The answer isn't in what the memos say, but in what they omit: artificial intelligence.

The corporate jargon about “agility,” “effectiveness,” and “removing layers of management” is a convenient smokescreen for a calculated and ruthless strategic pivot. Microsoft is moving toward a new model of game development, one that requires fewer humans. These layoffs appear as the first major casualties of the company's new AI-driven efficiency doctrine.

“The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously,” Spencer wrote. “We must make choices now for continued success in future years.”

When asked to comment on the apparent contradiction between Phil Spencer's claims of record success and the thousands of job cuts, a Microsoft spokesperson declined.

Microsoft hasn't directly said that artificial intelligence is replacing workers in its gaming division. But the timing and language of the memos come amid the company's aggressive push to integrate generative AI into everything, from Office and Azure to GitHub Copilot and game development.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has already stated that AI is writing “20 to 30 percent” of the company's code. This isn't just about simple automation. In game development, AI tools are now capable of generating background art and textures, writing and localizing dialogue, designing levels, conducting quality assurance testing, and even assisting with project management.

In theory, this should speed up production and make developers more efficient. In practice, it also means that some tasks once performed by full teams are now handled by a handful of people and a few powerful models. In this new paradigm, large teams of human creators become “redundant.” The “tough decisions” Spencer mentions are about maximizing profits in a successful business by replacing people with software.

The gaming division is simply the latest and most visible test case for this new philosophy. For years, gamers have anticipated ambitious, creative swings like Perfect Dark and Everwild. These projects require huge teams of artists, designers, and engineers working for years to build new worlds from scratch. But that model is now seen as inefficient. In the age of AI, it is far cheaper and faster to have a smaller team manage AI tools that churn out content for existing, predictable franchises.

When Spencer says “we will protect what is thriving,” he isn't talking about creativity. He's talking about a business model. And right now, the most thriving business model is the one that promises the most aggressive automation and the highest margins, even if it comes at the cost of thousands of jobs and the death of ambitious new ideas.

Microsoft says it has more than 40 projects in active development and that its fall 2025 slate is strong. If all goes to plan, players will barely notice the difference. The games will ship. The platform will thrive.

But behind the scenes, the people who make those games are being reorganized, laid off, or replaced, sometimes by code they helped train. That is the real transformation happening in gaming. And if Microsoft's success is built on tough decisions, the toughest one may be this: a future of gaming where AI builds the worlds, and fewer people get to be part of them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Microsoft Is Firing About 9,000 People Because Business Is Great","https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-just-fired-about-9000-people-while-making-billions-2000623667","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:18:28 GMT","

Microsoft is laying off thousands of employees, even as its profits and stock price hit historic highs. For many worried about the future of work in the age of artificial intelligence, the message is chilling: performance and profitability are no longer protections against the axe.

The software giant, which is playing a central role in the generative AI boom, confirmed to Gizmodo on Wednesday that it is undergoing another major round of layoffs. While Microsoft did not provide an exact figure, only saying it's less than 4% of its workforce, Gizmodo estimates the total cuts at approximately 9,000 jobs based on internal announcements and previously reported reductions throughout the year.

The company last disclosed its global workforce at 228,000 employees as of June 2024.

Here's how the layoffs have unfolded so far: Fewer than 1 percent of staff were cut in January (performance-related), more than 6,000 jobs were eliminated in May, 300 more in June. With this latest wave, Gizmodo calculates the total cuts for July to be around 8,777 jobs, or just under 4 percent of the global workforce.

“We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement, without providing further details.

The cuts are impacting a range of levels, departments, and geographies. A source familiar with the matter told Gizmodo that Microsoft's gaming division, which includes Xbox, is among the areas affected.

The timing of the layoffs stands in stark contrast to the company's financial performance. Microsoft is the second-most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $3.65 trillion, trailing only Nvidia. It is also in excellent financial shape. In the most recent fiscal quarter: its net income jumped 18 percent to $25.8 billion, the company announced in April. Revenue climbed 13 percent to $70.1 billion.

“Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth,” said CEO Satya Nadella in April. “From AI infrastructure and platforms to apps, we are innovating across the stack to deliver for our customers.” That innovation may also be making thousands of jobs obsolete.

While Microsoft has not officially linked these job cuts to its rapid adoption of AI, the timing raises questions. At Meta's LlamaCon conference in April, Nadella told CEO Mark Zuckerberg that 20 to 30 percent of Microsoft's code is now written by AI tools.

Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott has gone even further, predicting that by 2030, AI will write 95 percent of all code used at the company.

The tech giant has invested billions in generative AI, most notably through its close partnership with OpenAI. That includes integrating large language models like GPT into Microsoft Office, GitHub, Azure, and Windows products. These tools are capable of writing, debugging, and deploying code, as well as handling administrative tasks, customer support, scheduling, and more. The company is betting that these technologies will reshape how work is done. But for many employees, especially in tech, AI is already replacing tasks and jobs.

Across the industry, executives are now openly admitting that AI is shrinking their headcounts. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said AI is doing “50 percent of the work” at his company, just before announcing another 1,000 job cuts. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said AI has allowed the fintech firm to reduce its workforce by 40 percent. IBM and Duolingo have also confirmed that they are replacing teams or functions with AI systems

As AI tools become more capable — and cheaper than full-time employees — companies may continue to shed workers even while reporting record growth. Microsoft's latest move only reinforces that trend. For now, the company insists it is simply restructuring to stay competitive. But for workers watching AI generate code and copy — and executives celebrate those gains — the writing may already be on the wall.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Confirmed: A Rare Interstellar Object Is Passing Through Our Solar System","https://gizmodo.com/meet-a11pl3z-a-possible-third-known-interstellar-visitor-whizzing-through-our-solar-system-2000623474","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:30:39 GMT","

Update: July 3, 09:24 a.m. ET: On Wednesday, July 2, the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center confirmed that an interstellar object is traveling through our solar system. Officially named 3I/ATLAS, the object appears to be a comet hurtling toward the Sun.

Original article follows. 

Astronomers are scrambling to gather data on a mysterious object that's currently hurtling through the solar system. Preliminary observations suggest it came from interstellar space, and if confirmed, it would mark the third discovery of an interstellar object in history.

The cosmic visitor—tentatively named A11pl3Z—first appeared in data collected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) between June 25 and 29, Universe Today reports. ATLAS uses telescopes in Chile, South Africa, and Hawaii to scan the skies multiple times a night in search of moving objects. ATLAS spotted A11pl3Z again on Tuesday, July 1, and by Wednesday, the Deep Random Survey remote telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, had detected it, too. These early observations suggest the dim object is likely a large asteroid or comet—potentially 12 miles (20 kilometers) wide—that is traveling toward the inner solar system at roughly 152,000 miles per hour (245,000 kilometers per hour), according to EarthSky. It appears to be approaching from the Milky Way's galactic disk.

The International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center added the object to its near-Earth object confirmation list on Tuesday, July 1. This means astronomers need further observations to confirm that it is, in fact, a new near-Earth object. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has also added A11pl3Z to its near-Earth object confirmation page. Though it's too soon to say anything for certain about this visitor, early estimations of its speed and trajectory suggest that it came from outside the solar system and has enough momentum to shoot through it without slowing down. But don't worry, A11pl3Z has no chance of hitting Earth or even coming that close to us.

“Astronomers may have just discovered the third interstellar object passing through the Solar System!” the European Space Agency's Operations account shared on Bluesky early Wednesday. “ESA's Planetary Defenders are observing the object, provisionally known as #A11pl3Z, right now using telescopes around the world.”

Until now, astronomers had only spotted two confirmed interstellar objects. The first was ‘Oumuamua, a small, cigar-shaped object that visited our solar system in 2017. Its true nature is still up for debate, though some experts believe it was a comet. The second was a comet called Comet 2I/Borisov that streaked through our cosmic neighborhood in 2019. Discovering an interstellar object offers astronomers an extremely rare chance to learn about other star systems by observing their remnants as they pass by. While these objects are likely natural phenomena, that hasn't stopped people from speculating that they are extraterrestrial probes.

A11pl3Z is currently about 3.8 astronomical units (au) from Earth, according to Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard University. One astronomical unit is equal to the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. On October 3, it should make a close approach to Mars, coming within just 0.2 au of the Red Planet, Universe Today reports. This may be close enough for NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to detect it. A11pl3Z should make its closest approach to the Sun on October 29 and its closest approach to Earth on October 30, both at a distance of 1.35 au. The object will be traveling outbound at roughly 61 miles per second (98 kilometers per second), according to Universe Today.

By then, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which recently released its first findings, should be able to gather data on A11pl3Z. In just 10 hours of test observations, this powerful telescope discovered more than 2,000 new asteroids. The James Webb Space Telescope should be able to catch a glimpse of this object, too. As astronomers learn about these strange outsiders, the universe beyond our solar system becomes less mysterious—but all the more captivating.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Tesla's Numbers Are In, and They're Not Good","https://gizmodo.com/teslas-numbers-are-in-and-theyre-not-good-2000623670","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 01:10:56 GMT","

Tesla's struggles continue as the company reports another drop in vehicle deliveries, deepening concerns that its image problem, especially in Europe, is weighing heavily on consumer demand.

In the second quarter of 2025, the electric vehicle giant delivered 443,956 vehicles, a 13.5 percent decline from the same period in 2024. Deliveries are Tesla's key sales metric and are closely watched by investors and analysts alike. Nearly all of those deliveries — 97.3 percent — were for the company's two most popular models: the Model 3 and Model Y.

Wall Street had expected a dip of about 10 percent, so the final number was worse than anticipated.

The drop underscores the lasting impact of Elon Musk's political turn. Once a darling of eco-conscious and tech-savvy progressives, Tesla has alienated parts of its original customer base. The shift became more pronounced after Musk accepted a high-profile role in the Trump administration, running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an agency tasked with cutting federal spending. Under Musk, DOGE became infamous for slashing budgets without concern for what those programs did.

Musk's vocal support for far-right political parties in the United Kingdom and Germany has also alienated European buyers, many of whom had embraced Tesla as a climate-conscious status symbol. The backlash has been especially strong in Germany, a major market for the company.

On top of the political fallout, Tesla faces increasingly aggressive competition from both Chinese automakers like BYD and domestic rivals including Ford, General Motors, and Rivian.

Despite the decline in deliveries, Tesla actually produced more vehicles this quarter, building 410,244 units, which is virtually flat compared to the same quarter last year. This hints that underlying demand might not be collapsing, or that Tesla is betting demand will return soon.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, struck an optimistic note.

The numbers were “better than feared,” Ives said on X (formerly Twitter), citing a rebound in China and interest in the refreshed Model Y. “Big step forward.”

Tesla announced its 2Q delivery numbers this morning which came in at 384k vehicles well above Street whisper numbers of ~365k vehicles, which was better than feared as the company saw success with its Model Y refresh cycle in the quarter.  China rebound. Big step forward 🔥🏆🐂

— Dan Ives (@DivesTech) July 2, 2025



Part of the bullish case is the looming expiration of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, a key provision in President Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The Senate version of the bill ends the credit this September, ahead of the initial calendar. Analysts believe this could spark a rush of last-minute purchases from consumers hoping to claim the credit before it disappears.

Still, Musk has been downplaying the role of vehicles in Tesla's long-term future. In recent public comments, he emphasized that Tesla is evolving into an artificial intelligence, robotics, and software company. He pointed to Full Self-Driving (FSD), Tesla's long-delayed autonomous driving software, and Optimus, the humanoid robot under development, as the company's next big revenue drivers.

But so far, the results have been mixed.

Tesla's much-hyped robotaxi service, launched in Austin last month, was limited to a handful of loyal superfans and required a human supervisor in the passenger seat. The next day, videos of the rides circulated on social media and quickly became fodder for ridicule and skepticism.

Elon Musk's Trillion-Dollar Robotaxi Gamble Is Here

 

For now, the future Musk envisions — a Tesla powered by AI and robots — remains just that: a vision. And the company's core business, selling cars, is still dealing with the fallout of a CEO who insists on mixing politics with product.

The drive to push the performance envelope of modern GPUs often comes at the cost of power. As NVIDIA's high-end cards keep climbing in performance, so does the frequency of their power connectors melting down. This time, however, it's not even a flagship model like the 4090 or 5090, but rather a budget GPU from the Ampere series — the RTX 3060 Ti.

A user on Baidu reported the power connector of their RTX 3060 Ti GDDR6X melting down in a freak incident, specifically the Asus Megalodon V2. It's worth noting that this is a special variant of the 3060 Ti designed exclusively for the Chinese market and, as such, it features a 12VHPWR power connector instead of the standard 8 or 6-pin that was the default with the 30-series.



However, the cable that the user received was a standard 12-pin cable that lacked the additional 4 pins present in a normal 16-pin 12VHPWR connector. These extra four pins are purposefully there to ensure a secure connection between the card and the cable, precisely in order to combat situations like this one.

Therefore, this can be chalked up to a strange and unacceptable mistake on Asus' part, especially when you dig a little deeper. In the photos supplied by the user, a dual 8-pin to 12-pin adapter can be seen, which ships with some 12-pin GPUs for use with older power supplies that don't have these new connectors.

So, despite the 3060 Ti rocking a 12VHPWR connector, the user received a 12-pin cable (and adapter) in the box, both of which are catalysts for a fire hazard. But it doesn't end there. All this happened while the card does not even need the beefy 16-pin connector in the first place, as it's just a 3060 Ti, which has a maximum power draw of 310W.



12VHPWR connectors don't have an issue supplying power up to 400W; it's only beyond that threshold where it starts to overheat, regardless of how tight the connection is. Here, the missing four pins that forced a 16-pin connector into a 12-pin one essentially guaranteed a loose fit that would ultimately lead to its demise.

This is the first-ever case of a relatively low-power GPU getting fried like this post the introduction of 16-pin connectors. No matter where it goes, 12VHPWR always finds itself in trouble. Sure, maybe there's some user error at play here, but shipping the wrong cable out of the box is a far more dangerous precedent to set than victim blaming.

EDA software in exchange for antimony, gallium, and germanium?

The U.S. government on Thursday revoked U.S. export curbs that required American companies to obtain licenses to provide chip design software to customers in China, as part of an agreement intended to ease bilateral trade tensions around advanced technologies, reports Bloomberg. In exchange, China will ease export controls on rare earth materials.

The Commerce Department formally informed Cadence Design Systems, Siemens EDA, and Synopsys that they no longer needed government approvals to offer their electronic design automation (EDA) products to Chinese entities. As a result, all three companies can immediately reinstate access to their tools for Chinese chipmakers, which can now continue designing their processors using world-class EDA tools. This is crucially important for companies in China, as design software from Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys is by far more versatile than tools developed in China.

""On July 2, Synopsys received a letter from the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce informing Synopsys that the export restrictions related to China, pursuant to a letter received on May 29, 2025, have now been rescinded, effective immediately,"" a statement by Synopsys reads. ""Synopsys is working to restore access to the recently restricted products in China. Synopsys is continuing to assess the impact of export restrictions related to China on its business, operating results and financials.""

The U.S. had implemented export restrictions on chip design tools in May in response to China's curbs on exporting certain rare earth materials vital for industrial and defense applications. Under a deal finalized last week, the U.S. committed to allowing sales of chip development software, ethane shipments, and aircraft engines, assuming Beijing honored its pledge to accelerate permits for critical minerals.

As a result of the deal, China secured a significant symbolic victory by getting the U.S. government to include export regulations — something typically considered a security issue rather than a commercial bargaining chip — in the scope of trade negotiations.

When the measures targeting EDA products were introduced in May, it left the chip design software industry puzzled, as there was almost no guidance about which activities remained permissible, which essentially made them stop all of their activities in China. This lack of detail contrasted with the usual extensive consultation process that accompanies such export control actions. Eventually, DoC's economic advisor Kevin Hassett hinted that some semiconductor-related controls might be loosened.

Truth be told, even now it is not completely clear whether the U.S. government has lifted all EDA software export restrictions to China, which includes programs intended to design chips made on 14nm/16nm-class DRAM and logic technologies, or just those that are not restricted by other regulations.

Analyst Ryan Fedasiuk, a former State Department China adviser, noted that EDA software had been among the last foreign technologies still accessible to companies like Huawei, which relies on these tools to design its upcoming processors. Even with market access restored, U.S. firms now face uncertainty that Chinese companies may pursue local alternatives or diversify suppliers to avoid future disruptions.

We've seen 3D printers that can print some strange materials—one of our favorites being a chocolate 3D printer. That said, we have never come across one that can 3D print organs. At least, not until today, when we discovered that scientists from the University of Hong Kong in China are experimenting with technology to 3D print functional organ tissue.

SCMP shared a post detailing the ins and outs of the development, featuring Professor Michael Chan from the team. According to Chan, the researchers have developed a system that involves organ tissue that isn't just 3D printed but also lab-grown. Combining the two, along with a little help from a custom organoid, ensures a lower chance of rejection for the patient.

Chan explains that 3D printed biomaterial isn't entirely new, but it can't perform the right function without cells pertaining to the organ it's replacing. That's where the team's organoid embedding comes into play. These organoids are created using stem cells from the patient to ensure not only function but also genetic compatibility.

These organoids, sometimes referred to as ""mini organs"", are created with a simple oral swab that gets enough material to start a cultivation. The biggest challenge Chan shared was in finding a method for embedding the organoids into the 3D-printed airway. They can be used to test whether or not the patient is potentially allergic to medication before it's administered.

This process is made easier for the team thanks to a company set up by the University of Hong Kong known as C2iTech. The company specializes in the cultivation of organoids that scientists like the ones on this team can use for their work. This helps the team save time and resources that would otherwise be spent finding help from third parties to cultivate the organoids.

At the moment, they are heavily focused on the reconstruction of airways but intend to expand to other areas of the body in the future after refining the process. If you're interested in 3D printing or want to snag yourself a new machine, check out our list of the best 3D printers. You won't be able to print a working kidney, but it's an excellent foray into the technology that makes professor Chan and his team's accomplishments possible.

Despite the low price, sales could be limited of yet-another 8GB GPU.

The first third-party review for Nvidia's new RTX 5050 graphics card has been published at Quasarzone, and throughout the extensive benchmarks, it falls behind the Intel Arc B580 by 2.5% on average, and the RTX 4060 by around seven percent. It proves notably faster than the RTX 3060, though, topping it by just over 13% across the 15-game average.

As with all of Nvidia's recent 8GB graphics card releases, no review samples were sent out for the new RTX 5050, but we had our first taste of what it could do from board partner Inno3D a few days ago. It also hasn't stopped reviewers from buying up the card themselves to see how it performs. While other reviews from native English publications will no doubt follow in the coming days, this first one gives us a clear picture of what the RTX 5050 is capable of, including impressive gains when using multi frame generation.



Testing the card against a range of its peers from current and previous generations, QuasarZone ran the card at 1080p in 15 popular games and some 3DMark synthetic benchmarks. Although there were a few points of variation from game to game, the RTX 5050 largely performed weaker than the RTX 4060 and B580, but better than the RTX 3060 and RTX 2070 Super. It also beat out the RX 7600, but only by less than a percentage point.

One area where the RTX 5050 did show a significant advantage, though, was in games that support multi frame generation. There, despite being far slower than last-generation cards at native or when just using DLSS upscaling, the RTX 5050 could leverage multi frame generation to beat not just the RTX 4060 significantly, but also the RTX 4060 Ti. Where those cards can only generate a single AI frame in between the native ones, the RTX 5050 can use multi frame gen at up to 4x mode to generate an additional three AI frames.

Although not everyone is a fan of the input lag increase and visual artifacts that can be present when using multi frame generation, it is a unique advantage of the RTX 50-series and gives the RTX 5050 a feature that its otherwise-faster counterparts can't match.



The review doesn't highlight any particular issues with the 8GB of VRAM on the card, though it was only tested at 1080p. As with other graphics cards of its generation, like the 8GB RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti, it's possible that this could be a limiting factor when raising resolution or detail levels.

The RTX 5050 does have some overclocking headroom, though. QusarZone was able to push its core clock up by an impressive 420MHz, and the memory by an additional 1,000MHz. Combined, those gave the card a near-10% increase in TimeSpy score and an extra 7% in Cyberpunk 2077 frame rates. Further overclocking was limited by the hard-locked 130W TDP.

The question now becomes whether these performance advantages, such as they are, are enough to encourage gamers to spend $250-$300. Sales of new 8GB GPUs this year are down significantly, according to recent data from German retailer Mindfactory. The lower price of this entry-level card will surely help, but there's plenty of competition at this price point. And as this review shows, a number of those cards beat or compete favorably with Nvidia's new budget card.

Others disagree, though, and CEOs often like to hype up potential savings and profits

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a recent interview that he believes ""half of all white-collar workers in the U.S."" could lose their jobs to artificial intelligence (AI) in the coming years. Although other executives, like Nvidia's Jensen Huang, claim otherwise, Farley is not alone in his predictions. A number of other business leaders have been quoted this year saying that the workplace as we know it will change dramatically due to AI, and that's going to mean redundancies as per WSJ.

The debate over the impact of AI on workers and their employment status has been hot for the past few years. Some of the biggest fear-mongers come from the AI industry itself, with the CEO of Anthropic, Dario Amodei, recently stating that he thought half of all white collar workers would be replaced by AI, and that this could spike unemployment to 20%.

Although an argument could be made that Anthropic benefits from overhyping the capabilities and potential impact of AI, other CEOs in non-affiliated industries are also sounding warning bells. Along with Ford's Farley, Fiverr's CEO Micha Kaufman said in a staff memo earlier this year that it didn't matter what field you were in, ""AI is coming for you.""

The CEO of Shopify, Tobi Lütke, was quoted as telling workers to only make new hires if AI couldn't do the job instead. IBM has reportedly replaced several hundred of its HR workers with AI agents. There are also reports that Microsoft is internally trying to use AI for more tasks, which could be a factor in its latest round of layoffs.

The CEO of JPMorgan Chase also said in May that it could see its headcount being cut by 10% in the coming years as it makes use of new AI tools in its business. Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, told employees in June that it expected its overall corporate workforce to be reduced over the coming years. This may come in line with its expanded use of robotics across its logistics network.

However, CEOs are known to want to share exciting potential for new efficiency savings and potential profit expansion to stockholders and the media, and not every executive is convinced that AI will have such a devastating effect on the employment of millions of workers around the world.

Nvidia's Huang has previously said he “pretty much disagree[s] with almost everything,"" that the Anthropic CEO said about the potential dangers of AI. OpenAI's COO, Brad Lightcap, also stated on the ""Hard Fork"" podcast recently that there has been little evidence so far that AI has replaced entry-level jobs on a large scale and that any such change won't be as swift or as broad as others claim.

It may be that certain jobs are displaced, but that others become more important in turn. Following IBM's reduction in HR staff, it actively hired more programmers and salespeople.

Others argue that AI will simply make workers more efficient, increasing productivity, rather than reducing the need for workers altogether.

 July 03, 2025  

An artificial intelligence (AI) model has performed dramatically better than doctors using the latest clinical guidelines to predict the risk for sudden cardiac arrest in people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The model, called Multimodal AI for ventricular Arrhythmia Risk Stratification (MAARS), is described in a paper published online on July 2 in Nature Cardiovascular Research. It predicts patients' risk by analyzing a variety of medical data and records such as echocardiogram and radiology reports, as well as all the information contained in contrast-enhanced MRI (CMR) images of the patient's heart.

Natalia Trayanova, PhD, director of the Alliance for Cardiovascular Diagnostic and Treatment Innovation at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, led the development of the model. She said that while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common inherited heart diseases, affecting 1 in every 200-500 individuals worldwide, and is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes, an individual's risk for cardiac arrest remains difficult to predict.

Current clinical guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, and those from the European Society of Cardiology, identify the patients who go on to experience cardiac arrest in about half of cases.

“The clinical guidelines are extremely inaccurate, little better than throwing dice,” Trayanova, who is also the Murray B. Sachs Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins, told Medscape Medical News.

Compared to the guidelines, MAARS was nearly twice as sensitive, achieving 89% accuracy across all patients and 93% accuracy for those 40-60 years old, the group of people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy most at risk for sudden cardiac death.

MAARS was trained on data from 553 patients in The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy registry. The researchers then tested the algorithm on an independent external cohort of 286 patients from the Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute hypertrophic cardiomyopathy registry in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The model uses all of the data available from these patients, drawing on electronic health records, ECG readings, reports from radiologists and imaging technicians, and raw data from CMR.

“All these different channels are fed into this multimodal AI predictor, which fuses it together and comes up with the risk for these particular patients,” Trayanova said.

The inclusion of CMR data is particularly important, she said, because the imaging test can identify areas of scarring on the heart that characterize hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. But clinicians have yet to be able to make much use of those images because linking the fairly random patterns of scar tissue to clinical outcomes has been a challenge.

But that is just the sort of task that deep neural networks  are particularly well-suited to tackle. “They can recognize patterns in the data that humans miss, then analyze and combine them with the other inputs into a single prediction,” Trayanova said.

Better predictions of the risk for serious adverse outcomes will help improve care, by ensuring people get the right treatments to reduce their risk, and avoid the ones that are unnecessary, Trayanova said  The best way to protect against sudden cardiac arrest is with an implantable defibrillator — but the procedure carries potential risks that are best avoided unless truly needed.

“More accurate risk prediction means fewer patients might undergo unnecessary ICD implantation, which carries risks such as infections, device malfunction, and inappropriate shocks,” said Antonis Armoundas, PhD, from the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

The model could also help personalize treatment for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Trayanova said. “It's able to drill down into each patient and predict which parameters are the most important to help influence the management of the condition,” she said.

Robert Avram, MD, MSc, a cardiologist at the Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, said the results are encouraging. “I'm especially interested in how a tool like this could streamline risk stratification and ultimately improve patient outcomes,” he said.

But it is not yet ready for widespread use in the clinic. “Before it can be adopted in routine care, however, we'll need rigorous external validation across diverse institutions, harmonized variable definitions, and unified extraction pipelines for each modality, along with clear regulatory and workflow-integration strategies,” Avram said.

Armoundas said he would like to see the model tested on larger sample sizes, with greater diversity in healthcare settings, geographical regions, and demographics, as well as prospective, randomized studies and comparisons against other AI predictive models.

“Further validation in larger cohorts and assessment over longer follow-up periods are necessary for its full clinical integration,” he said.

Armoundas, Avram, and Trayanova reported having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

DISCLOSURES |  July 03, 2025  

After decades of frustration and failure, the landscape of drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is starting to shift beyond anti-amyloids. Fueled by a growing pipeline of investigational agents, a broader range of therapeutic targets, and a record number of active clinical trials, a growing, but cautious, optimism is taking hold.

The Alzheimer's Drug Development Pipeline 2025 reported there are currently 138 novel drugs under evaluation in 182 clinical trials — up 9% from 2024. Initiated by Jeffrey L. Cummings, MD, and colleagues in 2016, this year's annual report showed these clinical trials are being conducted at more than 4500 sites worldwide and included more than 50,000 participants.

“There's great reason for optimism. It's not just the increased amount of clinical trials, but the targeted therapies being studied,” said Cummings, Department of Brain Health, Kirk Kerkorian School of Medicine, University of Nevada, Nevada, in a statement.

Howard Fillit, MD, cofounder and chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, agreed.

“What's going on is really quite remarkable. We have the first disease-modifying drugs on the market, which is amazing, and I think the portfolio of drugs in development has changed dramatically from even 5 years ago,” Fillit told Medscape Medical News.

James Rowe, PhD, professor of cognitive neurology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, was equally impressed by the latest report.

“What strikes me is not just the number of new drugs but their range of targets in which they work, giving us multiple shots on goal,” Rowe commented during a media briefing on the report.

Currently 12 phase 3 trials are expected to report results this year. In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Cummings noted that “one of the most interesting and probably most influential of the readouts that will occur this year” involves two trials evoke and evoke+ of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist semaglutide in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD dementia.

“Semaglutide is a drug approved for diabetes and obesity, and it has epidemiologic and laboratory support for testing in Alzheimer's disease. And what's important is that this is an oral medication and it would just be fabulous if we had an oral alternative for treatment,” said Cummings.

Phase 3 data on the combination of xanomeline plus trospium, a medication approved for schizophrenia in adults, which is being tested for psychosis in AD, is also highly anticipated, Cummings said.

“There are no approved treatments for psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, so this is going to be a particularly interesting readout,” he noted.

Cummings also highlighted BIIB080, Biogen's investigational antisense oligonucleotide targeting tau, as another promising compound for early-stage AD. The therapy received Fast Track designation from the FDA in April.

In early testing, BIIB080 reduced soluble tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), decreased aggregated tau pathology in the brain and showed favorable trends in exploratory clinical outcomes. New data on BIIB080 is expected in 2026.

Hopes are also high for trontinemab (Roche), a modified version of the anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody gantenerumab. The therapy uses brain shuttle technology to improve its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

“This so-called brain shuttle technology is exciting because they've found a way to get much more of the antibody across the brain barrier and into the brain and engage the target. And this technology could be used to get other drugs into the brain,” Cummings said.

There are currently 48 trials assessing 31 drugs in phase 3; 86 trials assessing 75 drugs in phase 2; and 48 trials assessing 45 drugs in phase 1. Of the 182 trials, 16 are long-term extensions of agents in prior trials.

Since the beginning of 2024, 56 new trials entered the pipeline across all phases, including 10 new phase 3 trials. A total of 12 therapeutic agents are expected to complete phase 3 trials and 29 are scheduled to complete phase 2 in 2025.

Disease-targeted therapies (DTTs) continue to dominate the AD drug pipeline. Biological DTTs comprise 30% of the pipeline and small molecule DTTs account for 43%.

Drugs targeting cognitive enhancement make up 14% of the pipeline and drugs aimed at ameliorating AD neuropsychiatric symptoms comprise 11%. Repurposed agents represent 33% of the pipeline agents. In addition, biomarkers are among the primary outcomes of 27% of active trials.

Anti-amyloid agents, lecanemab and donanemab, became the first disease-targeting medications for AD and represented a “huge leap forward in our understanding and ability to treat AD,” Sheona Scales, PhD, director of research, Alzheimer's Research UK, told reporters attending the press briefing.

Scales noted that a key focus of ongoing anti-amyloid research is to find ways to increase brain exposure and reduce the side effects of these agents.

Beyond anti-amyloids, the latest pipeline report showed not only numerical growth but also increased biological diversity among the agents under investigation.

“Research is revealing even more complexities around how Alzheimer's disease starts and progresses, and this goes beyond amyloid. The current therapeutic pipeline has more diverse targets than in previous years,” Scales said.

Similar to 2024, this year only 18% of drugs in the pipeline target amyloid-related pathophysiology, whereas 11% target tau-related processes.

“Neuroinflammation, in particular, is a highly active area of therapeutic development,” Emma Mead, PhD, interim chief scientific officer, Oxford Drug Discovery Institute, told reporters.

“Neuroinflammation is the brain's response to injury, infection or disease, and research has suggested that in neurodegenerative conditions, microglia, the immune cells of the brain, become dysregulated and this contributes to the damage associated with Alzheimer's disease,” Mead explained.

Thirty drugs (22%) in the pipeline target neurotransmitter receptors, 24 (17%) address neuroinflammation/immune processes and 6% address synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection.

Given the complexity of AD, it's become clear that targeting a single pathway may not be sufficient for effective treatment. Combination therapy targeting multiple complementary pathologic mechanisms will be necessary to maximize therapeutic effects.

The 2025 AD drug pipeline includes 20 trials of combination therapies, comprising 11% of all current trials. Ten of these trials target aspects of both inflammation and amyloid.

For example, two trials are testing dasatinib, in combination with quercetin, as a senolytic therapy for dementia. Senescent cells accumulate with age and are believed to contribute to age-related diseases like dementia.

Six trials are assessing combinations of dextromethorphan and a CYP2D6 inhibitor for reducing agitation associated with dementia.

Four trials are assessing the combination of xanomeline plus trospium.

“Because Alzheimer's disease is so complex and different pathologies develop at different times across the disease course, it's likely that in the future, patients are going to be offered specific treatments that target distinct mechanistic pathways depending on their disease stage,” Mead said.

Rowe said one of the most compelling findings in the latest pipeline reported as the notable increase in late-phase trials focused on prevention. These AD prevention trials aim to intervene before symptoms appear — targeting individuals at high risk due to genetics, biomarkers, or early pathological changes — to delay or even prevent clinical onset.

“The aspiration to prevent, not just treat, is starting to be seen in the figures and that's very exciting,” he told the briefing.

About a third of the agents currently under investigation are repurposed medications — drugs originally approved for other conditions — which may offer a faster path to patient access. They include the GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) used to treat diabetes and obesity.

In addition to semaglutide, another GLP-1 RA, liraglutide, demonstrated a 50% reduction in brain atrophy and 18% slower cognitive decline in the phase 2b ELAD clinical trial of adults with mild to moderate AD. The diabetes medication metformin is also in phase 3 testing for AD with results expected in 2026.

Antihypertensive medications — including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) — are also being studied for their potential neuroprotective effects.

A randomized trial of the ARB candesartan showed positive neurocognitive effects independent of, and in addition to, their blood-pressure lowering effects.

Further, a low dose formulation of the antiepileptic levetiracetam has also shown potential in the treatment of MCI and early AD by targeting hippocampal hyperactivity, a hallmark of AD.

Research has also hinted that antibiotics, antivirals, some vaccines, and anti-inflammatory medications may protect against dementia, possibly by mitigating pathogen-induced neuroinflammation.

“Trial innovation” is also evident in the 2025 AD drug development pipeline, the report's authors noted, with plasma biomarkers playing a greater role in AD diagnosis.

Recent studies have suggested that plasma p-tau 217 measures are equivalent in diagnostic accuracy to CSF biomarkers of AD pathology. Several trials entering the pipeline this year are using plasma p-tau 217 to confirm AD diagnosis and serve as an eligibility criterion for clinical trial participation.

In one trial, eligibility was based on Aβ 42/40 plus the ratio of p-tau 217/nonphosphorylated tau 217; a separate trial used “blood biomarkers” or past CSF or PET evidence of Aβ abnormalities for eligibility.

CSF levels of microtubule-binding region tau243 have been shown to correlate with insoluble tau detected by tau PET imaging and are being used as a primary outcome measure in an anti-tau antibody trial.

“The use of biomarkers to determine eligibility and as outcomes in clinical trials shows the increasingly important role that biomarkers play in AD drug development,” Cummings and colleagues wrote.

Summing up, they said the 2025 AD drug pipeline report demonstrates “robust” momentum toward identifying new therapies for the treatment of AD.

“Seeing the broad range of scientific research that's taking place, I am extremely hopeful that we are closer than ever to finding a cure for Alzheimer's,” Cummings said in the news release.

Funding for this research was provided by grants from the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

Microplastics are particles ranging from 1 micrometer to 5 millimeters in diameter, and nanoplastics, which are even smaller, are found in virtually every environment on Earth, from mountain peaks to ocean depths, and from the smallest animals in the food chain to human brain cells.

These particles can originate from the breakdown of larger plastic items or be intentionally manufactured for use in products, such as cosmetics, synthetic fabrics, and pharmaceuticals. Recent studies suggest that the human brain may contain up to a teaspoon of microplastics and nanoplastics, with the tiniest fragments primarily composed of polyethylene, the same material commonly used in plastic bags and food packaging.

These particles have been detected in areas such as the walls of blood vessels in the brain and within immune cells. However, it remains unclear whether microplastics contribute to the progression of neurological diseases or whether these conditions render the brain more susceptible to particle infiltration. In animal studies involving fish and rodents, prolonged exposure to nanoplastics has been linked to memory impairment, brain inflammation, and alterations in synaptic protein levels.

Beyond the brain, microplastics have been found in human feces, arterial plaques, and even the placenta. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine linked the presence of microplastics in the arteries to a heightened risk for heart attack, stroke, and overall mortality.

According to a preliminary study published in Brain Medicine by researchers at Technische Universität Dresden in Dresden, Germany, therapeutic apheresis, a medical procedure that filters tiny particles from the blood, may help remove microplastics from the human body. The technique can capture particles as small as 200 nanometers, which is approximately 5000 times smaller than a millimeter.

In this study, the researchers evaluated the procedure in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. They analyzed the waste fluid discarded during apheresis using a specialized infrared spectroscopy technique.

The analysis detected substances that matched the chemical signatures of polyamide and polyurethane, two common types of industrial plastics. This suggests that microplastics may have been successfully removed from the blood of patients during the procedure.

Notably, this study did not measure the total amount of microplastics removed or compare their levels in patients before and after apheresis. What has been demonstrated so far is the presence of microplastics in the waste material discarded by the device — an observation that suggests, but does not yet confirm, the effective removal of these substances from the human body.

Researchers have cautioned that the detected materials may reflect chemical structures common to proteins, meaning that further analysis is required to verify the exact nature of the removed particles. Nonetheless, the findings offer hope to researchers seeking to address the growing accumulation of microplastics in the human body.

The authors recommended conducting studies with larger groups and quantitative analyses comparing the levels of microplastics in the blood before and after the procedures. The authors concluded that “such analyses will help determine particle removal from blood and tissues and assess correlations with symptom improvement in conditions like myalgia encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.”

Currently, evidence that microplastics are effectively removed from the human body after ingestion is limited.

A 2011 study examined bisphenol A (BPA) levels in blood, sweat, and urine samples from 20 individuals. In 16 cases, BPA appeared only in sweat, suggesting that induced perspiration may help eliminate certain compounds from the body. However, more studies are needed to assess its long-term safety and efficacy.

“That is why we focus on reducing exposure to microplastics in the first place,” said Nicholas Fabiano, MD, a psychiatry resident at the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and co-author of a related article in Brain Medicine.

The challenge of this research began with tracking the effects of microplastic particles. “From a clinical perspective, it is very difficult to establish a direct link between exposure to microplastics and adverse health outcomes,” said Fabiano.

To address this, he advocated the development of new tools to measure dietary risks, such as a dietary microplastic index. “We propose the development of a Dietary Microplastic Index that could be integrated with existing dietary risk assessment tools to estimate microplastic exposure based on the types of food consumed,” he said.

DISCLOSURES |  July 03, 2025  

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a variant of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA)-associated vasculitis that most commonly presents with proteinase 3 (PR3) serology and distinct clinical features that necessitates swift identification and therapeutic intervention. Prompt treatment plays a crucial role in minimizing permanent organ damage, particularly in the renal and pulmonary systems. 

What do you know about the management of GPA? Check your knowledge with this quick quiz.

The latest guidelines from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) both recommend initiating immunosuppressive therapy in patients with suspected PR3 positive ANCA vasculitis, which is indicative of GPA, even if clinicians are still awaiting biopsy results. Further, EULAR specifically acknowledges that collecting biopsies might not be feasible for each patient with ANCA vasculitis and treatment should “not be delayed while awaiting histological information.”

Learn more about biopsy for GPA.

KDIGO recommends maintaining therapeutic intervention for 18 months to 4 years following successful remission, which is similar to the EULAR guidelines recommending maintenance therapy for 24-48 months in patients with GPA. They also state, “longer duration of therapy should be considered in relapsing patients or those with an increased risk of relapse, but should be balanced against patient preferences and risks of continuing immunosuppression.”

Learn more about remission maintenance in GPA.

Infection is a significant concern in ANCA vasculitis, especially regarding immunosuppressive therapies including glucocorticoids that are used to manage the clinical manifestations of the disease. Recent research has shown that chronic nasal carriage of S aureus is significantly higher in patients with the GPA subtype; it has also been shown to be associated with increased endonasal activity and risk for relapse.

Although M catarrhalis, H influenzae, and S pneumoniae do not appear to have a specific association with GPA, data have shown that infection is among the most common causes of death in GPA.

Learn more about infection in GPA.

Data indicate that the GPA subtype is an independent risk factor for disease recurrence. Additionally, KDIGO also considers lower serum creatinine, more extensive disease, PR3 histology (which is associated with higher relapse rates than MPO-positive disease commonly seen in MPA) and ear, nose, and throat involvement as “baseline factors” for disease recurrence. Factors after diagnosis include history of relapse, ANCA positivity at the end of induction, and rise in ANCA. Treatment-related relapse factors include lower cyclophosphamide exposure, immunosuppressive withdrawal, and glucocorticoid withdrawal.

Learn more about prognosis in GPA.

To ensure disease does not recur into the transplanted tissue, KDIGO specifically recommends delaying kidney transplantation until patients have achieved complete clinical remission for at least 6 months. Further, ANCA positivity or negativity should not factor into this decision, with KDIGO stating, “the persistence of ANCA should not delay transplantation.” Although a serum creatinine of > 4 mg/dL is a significant predictor of relapse, guidelines recommend considering combination of a monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent for this indication. Similarly, induction and maintenance of dialysis should also be done under various separate conditions.

Former world-class rowers have an elevated risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) in the years after retirement, according to an observational case-control study.

Researchers found 1 in 5 former Olympic, world, or national-level Australian rowers aged 45-80 years had the heart rhythm anomaly. The ex-rowers, who had competed for at least 10 years, were nearly seven times more likely to have been diagnosed with AF compared to a control group. During a follow-up period of around 4 years, new cases of AF were also higher among the ex-rowers (6.3% vs 2.3%), according to the researchers, who published their findings last month in the European Heart Journal.

“As a clinician, I was not surprised that rowers experienced more AF,” said André La Gerche, PhD, MD, a cardiologist and head of the Heart Exercise And Research Trials Lab at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, and senior author of the study. “However, I was very surprised by the magnitude of the difference. Furthermore, I learnt that the risk persists years after retirement and is not just due to genetic factors.”

The findings are “consistent with prior research demonstrating that endurance athletes — especially highly trained endurance athletes — seem to have this higher risk of AF,” said Gregory Marcus, MD, MAS, a cardiac electrophysiologist and the inaugural Endowed Professor of Atrial Fibrillation Research at the University of California, San Francisco.

“These numbers nudge me in the direction of more aggressively screening for AF specifically in masters-aged rowers, such as with the use of Holter monitors or wearable devices approved to detect AF,” said Jeffrey Hsu, MD, an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.

La Gerche and his team captured data from 121 former rowers — 75% men, all White, with a median age of 62 years — who were matched with more than 11,000 control individuals from the UK Biobank who had never rowed and had varying fitness levels. The ex-rowers had similar rates of ischemic heart disease and diabetes as did the control individuals, but lower blood pressure. They also were less likely to have ever smoked.

The athletes showed persistent changes in cardiac function after retirement. Ex-rowers had larger left ventricles, lower heart rates, longer PQ intervals, and longer QT intervals compared to control individuals.

The research, “raises the question of whether certain types of intensive exercise — like elite-level competitive rowing — leads to long-lasting, perhaps even irreversible, enlargement of the cardiac chambers,” Hsu said.

Genetics factored into the risk for AF among both groups. While the prevalence of rare variants in genes associated with cardiomyopathy was low across the study, the combined risk for individual genes associated with AF was a strong predictor of the disease in both athletes (odds ratio [OR], 3.7) and nonathletes (OR, 2.0). The proportions were similar between them (P = .37), indicating genetics did not fully account for the increased risk in the ex-rowers, La Gerche said.

Marcus flagged a few factors that may have skewed the results. The former athletes tended to be tall, White, and in many cases, drank more alcohol than control individuals — all of these factors increase the risk for AF.

Because the ex-rowers volunteered for a cardiovascular study, selection bias could have skewed prevalence higher, Marcus said. After a sensitivity analysis, ex-rowers still had a 2.5-fold higher risk for AF in the case of a 100% selection bias.

La Gerche emphasized the findings shouldn't dissuade clinicians from encouraging regular exercise or high-level sports training.

“The overall health outcomes of these rowers are generally superb,” La Gerche said. “Rather, this highlights an important ‘Achilles heel' that requires attention and, ideally, effective prevention strategies so that sports can be enjoyed by more people, more often.”

The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council. La Gerche, Hsu, and Marcus reported having no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

MRI-based screening in patients older than 50 years with new-onset or deteriorating diabetes detected stage IB pancreatic cancer in a patient with deteriorating diabetes, highlighting the need for targeted screening in this high-risk population.

“Preliminary results from the PANDOME study support further MRI-based PC [pancreatic cancer] screening research efforts in individuals with NOD [new-onset diabetes] and DD [deteriorating diabetes],” the authors concluded.

This study was led by Richard Frank, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Nuvance Health, Norwalk, Connecticut. It was published online in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

T his study faced challenges with low accrual rates due to healthcare network realignments and high declination rates by potential participants. Selection bias potentially led to lower detection rates, as most participants were referred by primary care physicians or endocrinologists. Moreover, the majority of participants were White individuals (83%), despite higher pancreatic cancer risk among Black populations, limiting generalizability.

This study received support from a Tribute to Pamela/The Naughton Family Fund, the Rallye for Pancreatic Cancer, Pacific Crest Trail for Pancreatic Cancer, and the Glenn W. Bailey Foundation. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)-induced cardiogenic shock undergoing hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter, the use of a microaxial flow pump (mAFP; Impella) reduced the intrinsic mechanical work performed by the heart by reducing native cardiac output and pulmonary pressures while maintaining the power output delivered to the body.

“We consistently found lower pulmonary pressures and a PCWP [pulmonary capillary wedge pressure] during mAFP support, each of which provides confirmation of LV [left ventricular] unloading while on mAFP. Reducing these pressures helps alleviate pulmonary edema, reduce right ventricular afterload, and enhance forward flow,” the researchers wrote.

“By reducing myocardial work and wall stress, unloading may be protective in stunned, postischemic myocardium vulnerable to further insult,” the authors of an editorial accompanying the journal article wrote.

This study was led by Jacob Eifer Møller, MD, DMSc, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark. It was published online on June 23, 2025, in Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

Pulmonary artery catheter was used more frequently in patients randomized to the mAFP group compared with the standard care group. Data capture may not have been streamlined or complete as this study involved patients who were critically ill, unstable, and had imminent need for treatment. Hemodynamic monitoring was limited to the first 48 hours and did not account for long-term effects or changes.

The original trial was supported by the Danish Heart Foundation and Abiomed. Several authors reported receiving research, educational, and/or travel grants, speaker fees, and honoraria; serving on advisory boards; holding stock options; and having other financial ties with various pharmaceutical, healthcare, and other companies, including Abiomed, Novo Nordisk Foundation, and Boston Scientific.

Among patients undergoing maintenance dialysis, chronic heart failure and hypoalbuminaemia were significantly associated with a poor humoral response at 3 months after completing three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine; however, no association was observed between haemodialysis-related variables and antibody response levels.

""CHF [chronic heart failure], like CKD [chronic kidney disease], is also an immunocompromised condition, which could explain the reduced vaccine response,"" the authors wrote.

""The French government currently recommends administering a SARS-CoV-2 vac­cine booster every six months for immunocompromised patients,"" they added.

This study was led by Pierre Laurent, Department of Nephrology, Dialysis, and Transplantation, University of Picardie Jules Verne, Amiens University Hospital, Amiens, France. It was published online on June 23, 2025, in BMC Nephrology.

The retrospective, single-centre design of the study introduced potential biases. The small patient population limited the statistical power for group comparisons and restricted the number of variables that could be included in the analysis. Moreover, the study included only patients who received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, excluding those who initially received viral-vector-based vaccines.

Adolescents and men in the US faced a notable burden of orbital fractures and associated ocular injuries from sports such as baseball, softball, and bicycling, underscoring the need for protective glasses and clear safety rules — as well as the strict enforcement — of these regulations to prevent loss of sight during athletic activities.

“The sustained rates of orbital fractures highlight a critical gap in sporting protective equipment and emphasize the importance of adopting protective equipment specifically designed for orbital injury prevention, including face shields and protective eyewear,” the researchers reported.

“The findings presented here, coupled with evidence that properly fitted protective eyewear or face shields can reduce the risk of ocular injuries by 90%, emphasize the crucial role of eye protection in sports,” they added.

This study was led by Niloufar Bineshfar, MD, of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in Miami. It was published online on June 21, 2025, in Ophthalmology.

Some injuries may not have been reported or may have been labeled incorrectly, causing inaccuracy in the incidence rates for orbital fractures and related eye injuries. No details were available on the severity of the injuries, how people healed over time, or what care they received. Since injuries to other parts of the body were noted only from 2019 onward, some damage to the eye before that date may have been missed.

This study was funded by the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and a Research to Prevent Blindness Unrestricted Grant. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

In a study of patients with T1 glottic squamous cell carcinomas, a group who received transoral microlaryngeal surgery alone had a higher risk for recurrence than a group who received radiotherapy alone, while 5-year overall survival rates remained similar between the two groups. Patients with T1b tumors had lower survival rates and higher rates of laryngectomy than those with T1a tumors.

“The results indicated a significant difference in 5‐year overall survival in favor of T1a vs T1b tumors and that microlaryngeal surgery should be used with caution in patients who have T1b cancer,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Hedda Haugen Cange, MD, PhD, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden. It was published online on June 26, 2025, in Cancer.

The study was limited by its retrospective, observational design. Data were missing on factors like voice quality, quality of life, and comorbidities, which limited comprehensive assessment. Additionally, the small sample size for T1b tumors reduced the study's statistical power.

DISCLOSURES |  July 03, 2025  

Insulin resistance, detected using a simple and readily available blood test, may flag cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD), preliminary results of a new study suggested.

Using the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index to measure insulin resistance, investigators found that cognitive decline was four times faster in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD who had the highest insulin resistance levels compared to those with lower levels.

The findings underline the importance of risk stratification strategies and early interventions to change the trajectory of cognitive decline, lead author Bianca Gumina, MD, neurology resident, Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy, told Medscape Medical News.

“The results suggest that in MCI-AD, the brain seems to be more vulnerable to metabolic stress. By identifying and addressing modifiable risk factors like metabolic health, we can use the tools we already have to potentially slow the disease course,” Gumina said.

The results were presented on June 23 at the Congress of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) 2025 in Helsinki, Finland.

While insulin resistance has been linked to AD onset and pathology, its role in how rapidly the condition progresses has remained unclear.

The single-center retrospective study included 315 patients without diabetes who had a neurodegenerative disorder (NDD) detected through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Of these, 210 had AD (mean age, 71.51 years; 79% men), and 115 had another NDD, mostly Lewy body dementia or frontotemporal dementia (mean age, 69.19; 60% men).

Baseline measurements included neurologic evaluations, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to test cognition, CSF biomarkers (Abeta42 or pTau181), APOE4 genotyping, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity (CSF/serum albumin ratio).

Follow-up assessments involved cognitive testing, typically every 6 months, with most patients followed for 3 years. Cognitive decline was defined as a loss of more than 2.5 points per year on the MMSE.

Investigators measured insulin resistance with the TyG index, a metabolic marker calculated from fasting triglycerides and fasting glucose levels. The index, which Gumina called a “practical tool,” can be obtained from standard blood tests.

Researchers stratified patients into tertiles (low, medium, or high) according to TyG index levels.

After adjusting for age, sex, baseline MMSE, disease duration, AD therapy, and BMI, the study found high TyG was significantly associated with faster cognitive decline over 3 years in a subgroup of 161 subjects with MCI (77% men) compared to those with lower TyG levels (hazard ratio, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.06-15.73).

Insulin resistance may accelerate AD progression by impairing brain glucose uptake, said Gumina. This could exacerbate neuroinflammation and disrupt the BBB, “all of which accelerate neurodegeneration,” she added.

The study did link high TyG to elevated BBB permeability, but only in patients with AD.

“This supports the hypothesis that metabolic dysfunction may worsen neurodegeneration via mechanisms specifically related to AD,” said Gumina.

Researchers observed an association between TyG and conversion from MCI to dementia, although this trend was not significant.

Insulin resistance did not affect clinical progression in those with a neurodegenerative disease other than AD, which again likely reflects a disease-specific mechanism, said Gumina.

“AD may be the most sensitive to metabolic stress due to its underlying pathology,” she said.

The study found no significant interaction between TyG and APOE4 genotype on the rate of cognitive decline.

These new results show that insulin resistance “influences the speed of disease progression, especially in early stages, which could be the most vulnerable in modifying the trajectory,” said Gumina.

The findings could lead to more prompt identification of high-risk patients. “By using the TyG index, we can stratify MCI patients by risk of fast progression, enabling personalized follow-up and interventions when the brain is still more responsive,” said Gumina.

She recommends more widespread use of the TyG test, especially in patients with MCI or early AD. “It's already available through routine and simple blood tests, found in every lab, so it could be used to flag patients for closer monitoring or early intervention.”

Such interventions could include targeted enrollment in anti-amyloid or anti-tau clinical trials and timely introduction of lifestyle modifications and perhaps medications to improve insulin sensitivity.

“Lifestyle changes like regular exercise, a healthy diet, weight control, and managing blood pressure and cholesterol are all effective,” said Gumina. “Some medications that modify insulin resistance are also under investigation.”

The research team is investigating whether the TyG index correlates with neuroimaging biomarkers and integrating it with genetic and imaging data to improve prediction models.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Sebastiaan Engelborghs, MD, PhD, professor and chair of Neurology, Vrije University Brussels, Brussels, Belgium, said the study “adds an important piece to the Alzheimer's puzzle.”

The results highlighted how a routine metabolic marker such as the TyG index could help identify patients most likely to benefit from early, targeted interventions, said Engelborghs, who co-chaired the EAN panel on dementia and was not part of the research.

And with precision neurology becoming ever more relevant, “such noninvasive and low-cost tools could become critical in tailoring care and optimizing clinical trial design,” he added.

Engelborghs agreed lifestyle interventions could affect insulin resistance and noted research shows that 45% of dementias can be prevented or delayed by modifying 14 risk factors. One such risk factor is obesity, and insulin resistance “goes hand and hand” with obesity, he said.

“We expect that people who modify their lifestyle in order to lose weight and reduce insulin resistance will decline more slowly,” Engelborghs said.

Study funding was not disclosed. Gumina and Engelborghs reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

In children aged 2-6 years with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who required at least six units of insulin daily, using the auto mode of the MiniMed 780G hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system improved glycemic control compared to the system's manual mode — without increasing insulin requirements — and maintained an acceptable safety profile.

“These important findings add to the existing evidence on the safety and efficacy of hybrid closed-loop systems in this vulnerable population and, pending regulatory approval, will increase the options for young children and caregivers to choose their preferred hybrid closed-loop system,” Charlotte K. Boughton, MD, PhD, from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, wrote in a related comment.

This study was led by Tadej Battelino, MD, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. It was published online in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.

Each center managed its own hemoglobin A1c testing, potentially introducing variations. Excluding children who required fewer than six units of insulin per day may have limited the generalizability of the findings. This study did not capture data on food intake or physical activity, and its sample size was insufficient to assess safety events that occurred infrequently.

This study was funded by Medtronic. Four authors reported being employees of Medtronic. Several other authors reported receiving consultant or speaker fees, advisory board fees, research grants, and travel grants from Medtronic and various other pharmaceutical and healthcare companies.

Rett syndrome is a devastating rare genetic childhood disorder primarily affecting girls. Merely 1 out of 10,000 girls are born with it and much fewer boys. It is caused by mutations in the MeCP2 gene on the X chromosome, leading to a spectrum of cognitive and physical impairments, including repetitive hand motions, speech difficulties, and seizures. 

However, besides severe impairment of neurological functions, which has been the primary focus of researchers, Rett syndrome also upsets the functions of many non-neurological organs, including the digestive, musculoskeletal, and immune systems. This complexity has made the development of an effective cure able to treat the disease across the multiple tissues an extreme challenge.

Now, a highly multi-disciplinary research team at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University has made a significant breakthrough by leveraging an AI-driven drug discovery process in combination with innovative disease modeling. Their study identified a drug known as vorinostat as a promising treatment for Rett syndrome, demonstrating disease-modifying abilities across multiple neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in preclinical models of Rett syndrome that were superior to trofinetide, the only approved treatment for Rett syndrome. The findings are published in Communications Medicine.

Because vorinostat has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a blood disease, the Wyss-enabled startup Unravel Biosciences has been able to rapidly repurpose this drug as a therapy for Rett syndrome. Unravel Biosciences' lead pipeline asset, RVL-001, is a proprietary formulation of vorinostat, which recently received an Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA. Unravel will be initiating a proof-of-concept clinical trial to assess the drug's efficacy and safety in 15 female patients with Rett syndrome in Colombia later this year, and will test an ""n-of-1 trial design"" to evaluate different vorinostat treatments within individual patients, which is more appropriate to the complexity of the disease, and to rare disease communities in general.

The identification and further development of vorinostat as the potentially first curative treatment for Rett syndrome would not have been possible without our unique AI-enabled computational approach to drug discovery, and its combination with an innovative disease model that broadly mimics the features of Rett syndrome. This new target-agnostic approach for drug discovery proved to be extremely fast and effective and, together with our unique technology translation capabilities, creates a model for us to tackle other diseases with unmet need that pose similarly enormous challenges.""

Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., senior author and Wyss Founding Director

Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, and the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Key to the discovery of vorinostat as a potential Rett syndrome therapy was the Wyss Institute's computational nemoCAD pipeline that enabled the team to predict drug candidates not based on a specific target molecule of the disease – as most traditional drug discovery approaches do – but on changes that occur in the entire gene network across multiple organ systems in Rett syndrome. Richard Novak, Ph.D., then a Staff Scientist on Ingber's team at the Wyss Institute and now CEO of Unravel and other members of the team originally developed nemoCAD as part of the Wyss-led DARPA THoR Project to be able to identify why some patients are more tolerant to infection with pathogens than others. This DARPA-funded project led the path to other successful demonstrations of drug discovery by the Wyss Institute across diverse medical challenges, from neuropsychiatry to artificial hibernation.

As a starting point to develop a treatment for the full clinical spectrum of symptoms experienced by Rett disease patients, the team created a small animal model consisting of tadpoles from the frog Xenopus laevis, in which they used CRISPR genome-engineering technology to generate various mutations inactivating the MeCP2 gene to reflect the diverse patient population. The engineered tadpoles recapitulated a range of critical features of Rett syndrome, including developmental and behavioral delay, seizures, as well as intestinal, muscle and brain anomalies. Importantly, the researchers could analyze this new Rett model for changes in gene expression, across multiple organs that are associated with Rett syndrome-specific neurological and non-neurological changes in behavior and tissue function.

The researchers then used nemoCAD to compare all gene expression changes that occurred in MeCP2-defective tadpoles vs. healthy tadpoles to predict drug compounds from a public data base curated by the NIH that could reverse the pathological changes in the same gene expression networks. LINCS, as the data base is called, contains gene expression signatures induced by more than 19,800 drug compounds in a large variety of human cell lines, including drugs that already have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of other diseases. This type of analysis far exceeds traditional gene expression analysis, which determines the expression changes of individual genes or smaller groups of genes in isolation from all other changes.

""Critically ill patients demand accelerated discovery of new treatment options for their understudied disorders. Computing how entire gene expression networks are changing in a concerted fashion allowed us to predict which drugs are the most likely to push the Rett-specific gene expression network back to its normal state across multiple organs,"" said co-first author Novak, who led the project together with co-author and Unravel co-founder Frederic Vigneault, Ph.D. ""We then went from a list of candidates predicted in silicoto directly validating the top candidates in vivo in our tadpole model within a few weeks, demonstrating an efficient way of identifying previously unknown therapeutic mechanisms,"" Novak added.

Vorinostat scored the highest on the list and produced the strongest therapeutic effects in the genetically engineered tadpoles, which showed an impressive reversal of their disease features on a whole organism level. Symptoms such as seizures, unusual swimming motions that resemble repetitive behaviors in patients with Rett syndrome, as well as gastrointestinal and muscular symptoms were all potently suppressed by the drug; and vorinostat was much more effective at suppressing these symptoms than trofinetide. 

""Important for its translation toward patients, vorinostat also consistently reversed multiple symptoms of Rett syndrome in a preclinical mouse model, even when administered after symptoms were already in full progression, which trofinetide was unable to do. The FDA has considered success in this model as a critical milestone before deciding moving trofinetide to human clinical trials in the past,"" said Tiffany Lin, a co-first author on the new study and Wyss Staff Scientist who worked closely with Novak and Vigneault in Ingber's team. ""Excitingly, with some additional formulation work, vorinostat produced significant therapeutic outcomes even as an oral treatment.""

Through their gene network predictions and in-depth analysis of the molecular and cellular processes affected in MeCP2-defective tadpoles and following treatment with vorinostat, the researchers discovered what could be an unexpected driving force of the disease. MeCP2 encodes a protein that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes. It does so by binding to DNA regions that carry so-called methyl groups, and forming complexes with other proteins. One such class of proteins is known as histone deacetylases (HDAC), which modify other proteins by removing a different small chemical group known as an acetyl group from them. The acetylation status of proteins such as histones and other proteins is misregulated in Rett syndrome due to the inactivation of MeCP2.

However, the team's study in whole organisms utterly redefined this view. They found that while histones in the Rett syndrome models indeed were under-acetylated in brain cells, they, surprisingly, were over-acetylated in other tissues affected by the disease, like the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Importantly, the team's network analysis predicted vorinostat to also affect the acetylation of a-tubulin, a protein that plays important roles in neurodegenerative disorders and other diseases. a-tubulin assembles diverse cytoskeletal structures in cells that critically contribute to their functions, such as surface cilia that help move mucus in the lung and GI tract.

""In our models, a-tubulin in cilia was also hypo-acetylated in brain tissue but hyper-acetylated in the other tissues such as the GI tract, which correlated with signs of functional abnormalities, including inflammation,"" said Lin. ""Vorinostat was able to reverse this dysregulated a-tubulin acetylation pattern in both directions, which tells us that it must have targets beyond the HDAC family for which it is known, and that Rett syndrome, across multiple organs, is caused by mechanisms that should be explored further."" 

Unravel Biosciences, which was founded by Novak and Vigneault, together with Ingber and Wyss Institute Associate Faculty member Michael Levin, Ph.D., another author of the new study, is building on vorinostat and the team's discovery of a new therapeutic mechanism to advance the possibly first curative therapy for Rett syndrome in a first patient cohort. ""We are extremely excited to be reaching clinical stages following this rapid discovery and development journey and hope to be able to impact the lives of Rett syndrome patients in an unprecedented way,"" said Novak.

The study was also authored by Shruti Kaushal, Megan Sperry, Erica Gardner, Sahil Loomba, Kostyantyn Shcherbina, Vishal Keshari, Alexandre Dinis, Anish Vasan, Vasanth Chandrasekhar, Takako Takeda, Rahul Nihalani, Sevgi Umur, and Jerrold Turner.

Adults with poor Life's Essential 8 scores faced significantly higher atrial fibrillation risk, suggesting that heart-healthy habits could be key to preventing this common arrhythmia.

Study: Association of life's essential 8 score with incidence of atrial fibrillation: The Framingham heart study. Image Credit: Magic mine / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology, researchers in Boston, USA, investigated the relationship between the Life's Essential 8 (LE8) score and the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF).

AF is the most common arrhythmia, whose prevalence and incidence are increasing worldwide. Thirty years ago, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) established age, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, valvular heart disease, heart failure, and coronary heart disease as risk factors for AF. Since then, obesity, metabolic syndrome, excess alcohol intake, and obstructive sleep apnea have been identified as modifiable risk factors for AF pathogenesis.

LE8 is based on the Life's Simple 7 (LS7), which was developed to define and measure cardiovascular health and promote positive health outcomes. LE8 is an update to LS7 that additionally includes a sleep health metric. Recent studies indicate an inverse relation between the LE8 score and health outcomes, such as fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), kidney disease, dementia, and CVD mortality.

Diet was assessed using a 40-point DASH adherence scale, where higher scores reflected greater intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains balanced against limited salt and saturated fats.

The present study evaluated the associations between the LE8 score and AF risk. The study population included subjects from the FHS Omni 1 and Offspring cohorts. Individuals aged 45 years or older attending one or more index exam cycles were included in the current analyses. Participants were assigned a composite cardiovascular health score at their index exams based on their adherence to eight healthy lifestyle components.

These lifestyle components included diet, smoking habits, sleep duration, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, physical activity, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The LE8 score was the mean of the scores assigned to each component. The study's outcome was incident AF, ascertained from electrocardiograms. Subjects were followed up from the date of the index exam until the next index exam, incident AF, death, or for 10 years.

Fine-Gray hazard models, which account for competing mortality risks, were used to evaluate the associations between LE8 and AF risk, adjusted for sex and age. In secondary analyses, separate models were developed for each LE8 component. In addition, the team investigated whether age modified the association between incident AF and LE8. The association between the LE8 score and the risk of all-cause mortality was also assessed.

Non-HDL cholesterol showed a surprising protective pattern, intermediate levels unexpectedly lowered AF risk compared to ideal levels in component-specific analysis.

The study included 3,161 participants aged 65 years, on average, who contributed 4,628 index exam cycles. Most participants were female (57%) and from the Offspring cohort (93%). The average LE8 score was 67.6 at the index exams. The LE8 score was ≥80 (ideal), <50 (poor), and 50–79 (intermediate) for 16%, 7%, and 76% of participants, respectively. Overall, 410 individuals had incident AF, and 424 deaths occurred over the follow-up.

The risk of incident AF was higher for individuals with poor LE8 scores compared to those with ideal scores. The incidence rate of AF per 1,000 person-years of follow-up was 17.2 for participants with poor LE8 scores, 7.9 for those with ideal scores, and 10.3 for those with intermediate scores. Notably, intermediate cardiovascular health showed no significant difference in AF risk compared to ideal health (sHR=0.95). Moreover, higher continuous scores were associated with a reduced risk of AF.

Subjects with poor scores on the BMI, blood pressure, and glucose components had a greater risk of AF than those with ideal scores on the respective components. There was no evidence that age modified the association between incident AF and LE8. Furthermore, participants with poor LE8 scores had an elevated risk of all-cause mortality relative to those with ideal scores. A more favorable score for physical activity, glucose, and smoking was associated with lower mortality risk.

In sum, the study assessed the risk of incident AF in two FHS cohorts using LE8 scores. AF incidence was 10.4 cases per 1,000 person-years, comparable to estimates from other studies. A poor LE8 score was associated with an increased risk of AF compared to an ideal score. Moreover, higher continuous scores were associated with lower risk of AF and all-cause mortality. Poor blood pressure, glucose, and BMI scores were also associated with a higher AF risk.

An intermediate LE8 score was not associated with the risk of AF. The analysis accounted for repeated participant contributions across exam cycles using statistical clustering methods. Notably, the sample predominantly comprised middle-aged and older adults of European descent (the Offspring cohort), which limits generalizability to younger individuals and other ethnic or racial groups. Recall or misclassification bias was also likely, as several LE8 components were assessed using self-reported data. Future analyses should focus on whether specific interventions or behaviors would augment CVD outcomes.

A new groundbreaking study by researchers from University of Birmingham, UCL, Great Ormond Street Hospital and Birmingham Children's Hospital has revealed important clues into what is driving disease in children with arthritis.

Cutting-edge techniques have allowed scientists for the first time to uncover the unique architecture of cells and signals inside the joint as inflammation takes hold.

The new study published in Science Translational Medicine looks at arthritis in children, caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking joints. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis affects more than 10,000 children in the UK. It causes swelling, stiffness and pain in the joints over years or decades, leading to damage of the joints and long-term disability. Whilst treatments are available to manage the condition, and in some cases achieve remission, there is no cure. It can take time to find which treatment works for each person. Treatments don't work in the same way for every child, suggesting there are hidden differences between individuals that we are only beginning to understand.

Deepening the scientific and clinical community's understanding of the condition is vital if more effective treatments are to be found, and undertaking biopsies in young children provides a new way forward. Working with families of children with arthritis opened the door to this study, as the families advocated for the potential of the study, agreeing that the procedure would be acceptable to families, especially compared to living with a chronic inflammatory disease.

In a world first, tiny tissue samples were collected from the joint lining when children were having medicine injected into the joint. These samples were then analysed with advanced imaging and gene-profiling technologies. The fine resolution maps of the joints revealed differences between children of different ages and cell changes in those with more severe disease. These unique cellular fingerprints may help researchers understand why some drugs work better for some children, and not others. The joints of children with arthritis looked significantly different to those with adults, demonstrating the need to understand arthritis in children better. 

We know how frustrating it can be for families and young people to find a drug that best works for their arthritis. Finding ways to better predict which medicines will be beneficial for a particular child would mean we were able to treat the disease more rapidly and effectively. To achieve this goal, we first needed to understand what cells make-up the lining of the joint where the inflammation occurs.

Equipped with that knowledge, we can now start to tackle the next challenge, determining how these cellular fingerprints within the joint tissue can help us predict which drug will work best, ensuring we give the right drug, to the right child, at the right stage of their disease."" 

Professor Adam Croft, Versus Arthritis Professor of Rheumatology at the University of Birmingham and chief investigator of the study

One of the children who took part in the study was Aurelia, from London, who was diagnosed with arthritis after injuring her knee while on holiday.

""Aurelia is a sporty child and loves art, drama, music and ballet. We noticed pain and swelling of her knee whilst on holiday. We thought perhaps she had injured it playing, but when this didn't get better and she was struggling to walk, we realised something else was wrong. She was referred to the Rheumatology team at Great Ormond Street Hospital who diagnosed her with arthritis. This came as a bit of a shock given how active she is!

""They offered her a steroid injection in her knee under general anesthetic to alleviate the symptoms. The team asked if we were happy for her to take part in this research study and collect some tissue samples at the same time.

""We were keen for her to be involved, as there's still a lot of unknowns with arthritis in children, and not all treatments can work. Given that she was already having an anaesthetic, and it wasn't an additional operation for her, it was a great opportunity for researchers to take samples and to be better able to study the conditions. We hope the study will help other families with children in similar positions to us,"" explained Aurelia's mum, Emily.

Professor Lucy Wedderburn, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Consultant of Paediatric Rheumatology at Great Ormond Street Hospital said:

""This study represents a real step change in our work with children and young people who live with arthritis, and has been a huge team effort. Rather than having to rely on blood tests which often do not tell us accurately what is happening in the joint, we can now directly analyse the joint lining, across different types of childhood arthritis and different ages. Our findings show that younger children have different types of immune cells invading their joints compared to older children. Samples from children with arthritis looked different to adult samples, with a different make up of immune cells, blood vessels and distinct connective tissue cells. This suggests that treatments may need to vary depending on age and shows why we can't just extend studies from adult studies to understand arthritis in children.""

The study was funded by the Medical Research Council, Versus Arthritis, National Institute of Health and Care Research, Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity, amongst others, and delivered through the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Birmingham Biomedical Research Centre (BRC).

Lucy Donaldson, Director of Research at Versus Arthritis said:

""People with arthritis should never be reduced to just their condition. Each person deserves to be treated holistically as an individual, including, of course, children and young people with arthritis.

""We are very proud to invest in truly innovative research like the MAPJAG study which is helping us to better understand the individual differences between young people with juvenile arthritis.

""The MAPJAG team's findings clearly show that children and young people aren't just small adults, but have a different ""cellular fingerprint"". Importantly the team have also shown that this can change with age. The findings can give real hope to all those families that more can be done, sooner, to enable young people with arthritis to live the lives they choose."" 

A wider programme of work, made possible by a Medical Research Council partnership award known as Tissue Research in Childhood Arthritis (TRICIA), supports the infrastructure needed for multi-centre tissue research of the joint. In future, it is hoped that a larger study, involving more centres will allow researchers to dig deeper into the remaining questions about how best to tailor treatments for individual patients.

Instrumental to driving this research forward was Dr Eslam Al-Abadi, a study investigator from the Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, who sadly passed away before publication. His incredible efforts in seeking to improve the care of children with this disease are gratefully acknowledged.

As young athletes increasingly turn to supplements for a competitive edge, new research warns that most supplement claims are based on adult studies, posing unknown risks to their growing bodies. 

Study: Use of Nutritional Strategies, Bioactive Compounds, and Dietary Supplements in Young Athletes: From Evidence to Potential Risks—A Narrative Review. Image credit: matimix/Shutterstock.com

Unlike adult athletes, young athletes present unique nutritional challenges as they undergo rapid growth and development and intensive exercise training. Yet, few studies specifically focus on sports nutrition in children. A recent narrative review published in Nutrients examines the place of bioactive supplements in the training of young athletes.

Bioactive supplements for athletes include omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin, caffeine, creatine, and antioxidant vitamins.

Young athletes typically use supplements based on the recommendations for adult athletes. However, adolescents differ markedly from adults, growing and undergoing rapid and profound hormonal changes. Significant alterations in body composition and metabolism accompany organ maturation.

Physiologically, prepubertal athletes depend far more on an increase in heart rate to increase cardiac output than adults, who rely more on stroke volume. Unlike adults, children respond to exercise by increased ventilation. Children also rely more heavily on fat oxidation during endurance training than adults.  

Young athletes engaged in training and competition, especially at elite levels, as opposed to recreational sports, need a unique blend of nutrients. Their diet must support growth, development, overall health, and athletic performance.  Nutritional guidelines designed for adult athletes fall short of these requirements.

Notably, dehydration, insufficient energy intake, and lack of essential macro- and micro-nutrients, put young athletes at risk for severe adverse health outcomes. These include delayed maturation, impaired reproductive function, poor bone development, short stature, eating disorders, and injury.

Adolescents in sports are increasingly using supplements due to peer pressure or the fear of falling behind others. Without professional guidance, they may not know what these contain, how to use them, or the associated risks, such as inadvertent drug violations.

Despite being unethical and risky, banned drug use occurs in up to 3% of adolescent athletes and will become more common. Most youngsters feel that their competitors are using prohibited drugs, making it seem normal and acceptable.

The current review sought to identify and analyze the various nutritional strategies used in young athletes. Notably, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus statement discounts the evidence that most supplements enhance either performance or health.

Most evidence for supplement use comes from adult studies and is often weak or inconclusive. Long-term safety studies are notably limited for adolescent use. Moreover, sex and genetic differences may affect the outcomes of bioactive use from person to person. 

Currently, there are no quantitative parameters to assess the impact of nutritional strategies on young athletes. Children's energy intake will likely be adequate if they meet their standard growth and development markers.

Adequate energy intake is crucial in young athletes, and relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S) is a recognized condition that impacts physiological functions needed for health and athletic performance, especially during the growing years. Multiple adverse outcomes have been reported, including impairment of reproductive function, psychological well-being, and performance.

National dietary guidelines for adults are adapted to determine energy intake according to use in adolescents, since the evidence indicates that no additional energy is required to fuel their metabolism. Fat consumption also follows adult guidelines.

Micronutrients like vitamin D and calcium are essential to avoid deficiencies and prevent poor health. They ensure peak bone mass of 90% built up by 18, but do not enhance performance. For example, a single 200,000 IU dose of vitamin D improved jumping ability and speed in vitamin D-deficient young soccer players. At the same time, routine use in sufficient individuals showed no apparent benefit. Iron in bioavailable form may help young female athletes prevent iron deficiency and improve physical performance.

Ergogenic substances of benefit in adult athletes include caffeine, which improves anerobic performance; β-Alanine (a precursor of carnosine), which prevents acidosis during high-intensity exercise; and dietary nitrates (especially from beetroot juice), which enhance available nitric oxide in muscle tissue, increasing muscle efficiency and blood flow. These substances have known or biologically plausible mechanisms of action. However, evidence for their use in adolescents remains limited, with mixed or inconclusive results.

Curcumin and vitamin C are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory molecules. They may promote recovery from exercise, but chronic high-dose use could limit training adaptation. Conversely, omega-3 fatty acids are suitable for overall health and muscle protein synthesis, and their intake should be encouraged in all adolescents via two helpings of fatty fish per week. Supplements should be required only if fish intake is deficient.

The study suggests that specific bioactives may benefit post-training recovery, promote immune function, and enhance performance in young athletes. However, these benefits remain largely theoretical or based on limited data from small-scale or adult-based studies. Bioactive use should be part of a comprehensive dietary and nutritional program, and only under expert supervision.

Importantly, bodies like the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) acknowledge potential benefits of supplements like creatine in adolescents. However, current data is limited, and more rigorous studies are needed.

Unregulated and unsupervised supplement use could lead to their misuse, toxicity, and failing drug tests because of contamination with banned substances. Without individualized care, this could cause dependency, poor body image, and performance pressure, impairing the adolescent athlete's mental and emotional well-being. This is especially difficult to justify in recreational sport settings.

Today, the need is to regulate supplement use by young athletes, raise awareness among the adolescent athlete's family and coaches, and provide regular overall checkups. This will ensure that young athletes make informed decisions.

Future extensive, well-designed studies are critical to provide evidence of safety and efficacy before it is possible to routinely recommend ergogenic compounds, multivitamins, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and other anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory agents like curcumin.

Some bioactives, like caffeine, may show promise in young athletes as health and performance-boosting substances, but there is little evidence to recommend their routine use in this group. Despite their growing use, more research is needed among children to ensure that performance-enhancing supplements used in this population are safe, effective, and appropriate for their unique needs.

“In this context, the role of a well-balanced, age-appropriate diet should always take priority over supplementation, particularly in growing individuals with unique physiological needs. Moreover, rather than focusing solely on isolated nutrients, interventions aimed at improving the overall dietary patterns of young athletes… may have greater long-term health and performance benefits, with fewer risks and side effects. “

Replacing refined grains with whole grains could be a simple yet powerful step to reduce your risk of hypertension, according to the largest analysis of its kind to date.

Study: Whole grain and refined grain consumption and the risk of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies. Image Credit: marilyn barbone / Shutterstock

Eating 200g of whole grains daily (like 2 bowls of oatmeal) showed a 22% lower hypertension risk compared to no intake – a specific dose threshold highlighted in the nonlinear analysis, even though the overall trend was linear.

In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers investigated the associations between the dose-dependent consumption of grain subtypes (whole grain versus refined grain) and the subsequent risk of hypertension.

Their study leveraged data from nine cohort studies, which were compiled across two online scientific repositories (PubMed and Embase), comprising data from over 182,000 individuals. Review findings revealed several beneficial associations between whole-grain consumption and hypertension risk.

Notably, individuals in the highest strata of whole-grain intake were 26% less likely to develop hypertension than their counterparts in the lowest strata. This association was found to be linear and dose-dependent. Every additional 90 g of whole grains consumed daily (equivalent to three slices of whole-grain bread or one bowl of whole-grain cereal) reduced the risk of hypertension by a further 14%. In contrast, no clear association was demonstrated between refined grain intake and hypertension.

These findings support dietary guidelines that advocate for whole-grain substitutions in the prevention of hypertension.

Whole grains might lower blood pressure through multiple pathways: The paper details possible mechanisms beyond fiber, including increased nitric oxide (relaxing blood vessels), anti-inflammatory effects from antioxidants like avenanthramide (in oats), and beneficial gut bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids.

Colloquially termed ‘high blood pressure', hypertension is a non-communicable cardiovascular condition characterised by the higher-than-normal force of blood pushing against a patient's artery walls. While independently medically alarming, untreated or poorly treated hypertension can quickly exacerbate into heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other potentially lethal comorbidities.

Unfortunately, hypertension is a silent pandemic estimated to impact more than 1.28 billion adults globally, almost half of whom remain unaware of their condition. The disease is assumed to claim more than 10 million lives annually, with predictions painting an even grimmer future picture.

Evidence suggests that modifiable health behaviors (diet, physical activity, sleep quality, etc.) are strongly associated with hypertension outcomes. While weight, salt intake, and physical activity are well-known risk modifiers, the role of specific food choices remains under scrutiny.

Epidemiologists have long suspected that whole grains (cereals containing all three kernel parts), rich sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, may help regulate blood pressure. However, individual cohort studies have produced mixed results, and a comprehensive assessment of the effects of refined versus whole grain on hypertension was needed.

Switching populations to high whole grain intake could prevent 5.6% to 10.5% of hypertension cases, the authors estimated based on data distribution within several large US cohort studies included in the analysis.

The present systematic review addresses this knowledge gap by conducting a timely meta-analysis of prospective studies examining grain intake and the incidence of hypertension. Its methodology and outcome reporting adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Publications with the potential for review and meta-analysis inclusion were obtained from the PubMed and Embase repositories from the database's initiation until July 2024. All case-cohort, within-cohort, nested case-cohort, and prospective cohort studies reporting relative risk estimates (aRRs) for associations between grain consumption (whole-grain and/or refined) and hypertension outcomes were included in the downstream review and analyses.

Statistical analyses included relative risks (RRs), sample demographic and medical data, and publication details meta-data extraction, comparing highest-versus-lowest intakes of grains subtypes, and conducted dose-response analyses (Greenland and Longnecker's protocol) per 90 g/day increments.

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the World Cancer Research Fund grading criteria were used to assess publication quality and the strength of evidence, respectively. Using the latter, the authors graded the evidence for whole grains as supportive of a 'probably causal' relationship, while the evidence for refined grains was deemed 'limited-no conclusion.'

Random-effects models (DerSimonian and Laird) were used to account for between-study variability. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed via I2 and funnel plots. The authors noted that, although there was no indication of publication bias, the analysis for whole grains revealed very high heterogeneity, suggesting significant variability in the results of the included studies.

Furthermore, they acknowledged that a high intake of whole grains may be associated with a generally healthy lifestyle, which could potentially confound the results. However, significant risk factors were adjusted for in the analysis. Refined grains included white bread, white rice, and pastries, while whole grains were defined as foods containing all grain parts--bran, germ, and endosperm.

Sensitivity analyses excluded single studies to test robustness. Authors also explored whether overall dietary quality, adjustment for various confounders, or differences in demographic factors affected the associations. All models were adjusted for potential statistical confounds.

Current Nordic recommendations (75-90g whole grains/day) align with the observed benefits, but the study noted one Chinese cohort showed potential for even greater risk reduction at much higher intakes (up to 400g/day), warranting future research on optimal levels.

Of the 6,360 publications identified during the keyword search, sequential screening of the publication titles, abstracts, and full texts identified nine publications for meta-analysis. Analyses have unequivocally demonstrated that whole-grain intake reduces the risk of hypertension. Participants in the highest whole-grain consumption group had a 26% lower risk of hypertension (RR = 0.74, p < 0.001, n = 9) compared to their counterparts in the lowest consumption group.

This relationship followed a linear, dose-dependent pattern: consuming 90g of whole grains daily reduced the risk of hypertension by 14% (RR = 0.86, p = 0.008, n = 8). The paper discusses several plausible biological mechanisms for this effect, including the high dietary fiber content in whole grains, which improves insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, as well as the potential benefits of antioxidants and their impact on the gut microbiome.

In contrast, refined grain showed no statistically meaningful association with hypertension.

This meta-analysis supports dietary guidelines urging the replacement of refined grains with healthier whole-grain alternatives. It demonstrates how even modest increases can reduce the risk of hypertension by approximately 14% or more. With hypertension claiming more than 10 million lives each year, population-level grain shifts may offer meaningful public health benefits.

Clinicians and policymakers should promote the consumption of high-quality whole grains for comprehensive cardiovascular health. Future research is warranted to confirm these findings through additional studies, particularly with sex-stratified analyses and data from regions outside North America.

The last time a Republican-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump moved to slash Medicaid spending, in 2017, a key political force stood in their way: GOP governors.

Now, as Congress steamrolls toward passing historic Medicaid cuts of about $1 trillion over 10 years through Trump's tax and spending legislation, red-state governors are saying little publicly about what it does to health care — even as they face reductions that will punch multibillion-dollar holes in their states' budgets.

Medicaid, a program jointly run by states and the federal government, covers more than 70 million low-income or disabled people, including nearly half of the nation's children. Republicans say the $900 billion-a-year program was allowed to grow too large under Democrats Barack Obama and Joe Biden by adding nondisabled adults they say don't deserve government assistance, and they have long sought to scale it back.

Some of the biggest health cuts in the legislation Trump calls the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" are achieved through new policies that would reduce enrollment by imposing more paperwork demands on enrollees, including a requirement that many prove they're working. Those policies would affect only states that expanded Medicaid to more low-income people under the Affordable Care Act.

Nineteen of those states are led by Republican governors. Their silence on the bill's health measures is giving political cover to GOP lawmakers from their states as they seek to cut Medicaid coverage for millions of people who gained it within the last decade.

KFF Health News contacted all 19 governors for comment on the legislation's Medicaid cuts. Only six responded. Most said they backed imposing a work requirement on adult Medicaid enrollees.

""Implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults is a good and necessary reform so that Medicaid is being used for temporary assistance and not a permanent entitlement,"" said Drew Galang, a spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia.

""Governor Rhoden supports workforce participation as a requirement of Medicaid expansion eligibility,"" said Josie Harms, a spokesperson for South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, adding that congressional lawmakers have the governor's support: ""South Dakota has an excellent federal delegation, and Governor Rhoden trusts them to fight for South Dakota's priorities while delivering on President Trump's promises.""

In a sign of how the political winds have changed, none of the governors said anything about another of the legislation's significant cuts, to provider taxes — a tool that all of their states use to help pay their share of Medicaid and gain additional funds from the federal government. That change is expected to cost states billions.

In contrast to the radio silence from GOP governors, Democratic governors have campaigned against the megabill for weeks.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro posted on the social platform X that Trump and congressional Republicans were misleading Americans by saying they were cutting only waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid.

""They're rushing to kick hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians off their healthcare — and lying about it,"" he posted. ""The damage this will do here in Pennsylvania and across America is staggering and will be felt for years to come.""

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul on July 1 charged that Trump's legislation would devastate hospitals and could lead to more than 34,000 job cuts in her state.

""The collective impact of the GOP reconciliation bill in Washington, D.C., could force hospitals to curtail critically needed services such as maternity care and psychiatric treatment, not to mention to downsize operations, and even close entirely,"" she said in a statement.

In 2017, the chorus was bipartisan, as Republican governors in Ohio, Nevada, and Massachusetts spoke out against cutting Medicaid. Trump's bill to repeal much of the Affordable Care Act and roll back its Medicaid expansion narrowly failed in the Senate.

""It's been surprising that red-state governors, particularly those in Medicaid expansion states, haven't spoken out against Medicaid cuts,"" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. ""Republican governors were a potent political force in the failed 2017 effort to repeal and replace the ACA, including Medicaid expansion.""

What's changed since 2017, policy experts say, is that there are fewer moderate Republican governors, and GOP state executives who advocated for Medicaid expansion over a decade ago are no longer in office.

Additionally, seven of the then-red states that expanded Medicaid did so via ballot initiative, mostly over opposition from their governors.

In fact, the Medicaid work requirement is backed by many Republican governors, even if it means less federal Medicaid money and leads to fewer people covered.

Several states, including Arkansas and Ohio, have already passed state laws to implement a requirement that adults enrolled under the ACA's Medicaid expansion work, volunteer, go to school, or participate in job training. Most states have yet to bring work requirement programs to fruition because they are waiting for federal government approval.

Charles ""Chip"" Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, a trade group of investor-owned hospitals, said that while fewer governors have engaged publicly in trying to block Medicaid cuts under the bill, federal lawmakers are hearing from legislators in their states.

A political dilemma for Republican governors is that, unlike in 2017, the bill before Congress is not legislation aimed expressly at repealing Obamacare. With a scope broader than health care, it would extend many of Trump's tax cuts and direct billions in new spending toward border security, immigration enforcement, and the military, while also cutting health care spending.

""It's like playing multidimensional chess rather than focusing on one issue,"" Kahn said.

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said some Republican governors may have expressed concerns privately to their states' GOP senators but are not speaking out publicly for fear of drawing Trump's wrath.

""Why are they being cagey? Trump and not wanting to be 'Liz Cheney'd,'"" Jacobs said, referring to the Republican former Wyoming lawmaker whom Trump helped oust after she served as vice chair of an inquiry into his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

The political peril Republican lawmakers face in publicly challenging Trump remains explicit. On June 29, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced he would not run for reelection after he voiced concerns about the bill and the president threatened to back a primary challenger. Tillis was one of three GOP senators to vote against it on July 1, though it still narrowly passed.

In addition to the work requirement, the biggest Medicaid cuts in the bill stem from its restrictions on provider taxes — levies that states impose on hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care institutions to help increase their federal reimbursement. Much of the additional money is then returned to the health care providers in the form of higher payments for their Medicaid patients.

The practice, which has been adopted in every state but Alaska, has been criticized by some Beltway Republicans as ""money laundering"" — even though the taxes are approved by state lawmakers and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and have been allowed under federal law for decades.

The Senate bill would limit the money states could raise — a move that would mean billions in funding cuts to states and their hospitals.

The states with Republican governors that expanded Medicaid are Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Utah.

One of the governors who expressed concerns about repealing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in 2017 was Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Democrat at the time.

In a June 2017 letter to West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, Justice wrote: ""Since so many of our people count on Medicaid, any cut to Medicaid would destroy families in West Virginia."" He added that ""the consequences would be beyond catastrophic.""

On July 1, Justice — elected to the Senate as a Republican last year — voted for Trump's megabill, including its Medicaid cuts.

""The Senator believes this bill strikes a good balance between protecting the most vulnerable and those who rely on the program while rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure the program is run efficiently for those deserving,"" William O'Grady, a Justice spokesperson, said in an email July 2.

Prenatal exposure to ambient fine particulate matter and climatic factors, such as temperature and rainfall, are associated with adverse birth outcomes in India, according to a study published July 2nd, 2025, in the open-access journal PLOS Global Public Health by Mary Abed Al Ahad from the University of St Andrews, U.K.

Ambient air pollution poses a global threat to human health, with a disproportionate burden of its detrimental effects falling on those residing in low and middle-income countries. Referred to as the silent killer, ambient air pollution is among the top five risk factors for mortality in both males and females. With a diameter of less than 2.5 microns, ambient fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), which primarily originates from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, is considered the most harmful air pollutant. In the 2023 World Air Quality Report, India was ranked as the third most polluted country out of 134 nations based on its average yearly PM2.5 levels.

Ambient air pollution has been associated with a range of pediatric morbidities, including adverse birth outcomes, asthma, cancer, and an increased risk of chronic diseases. Most studies investigating the association between ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes have primarily been conducted in high-income countries. Despite the alarming rise in air pollution levels in India, there has been a paucity of research exploring its impact on adverse birth outcomes.

To address this knowledge gap, the researchers investigated the impact of ambient air pollution on adverse birth outcomes at the national level, focusing on low birth weight and preterm birth, and used different geospatial models to highlight vulnerable areas. The analysis provided evidence of the association between in-utero exposure to PM2.5 and adverse birth outcomes by leveraging satellite data and large-scale survey data. The individual-level analysis revealed that an increase in ambient PM2.5 is associated with a greater likelihood of low birth weight and preterm birth. Climatic factors such as rainfall and temperature were also linked to adverse birth outcomes. Children residing in the Northern districts of India appeared to be more susceptible to the adverse effects of ambient air pollution.

According to the authors, the geostatistical analysis underscores the need for targeted interventions, particularly in Northern districts. In addition, the National Clean Air Program should be intensified, with stricter emission standards and enhanced air quality monitoring. Climate adaptation strategies, such as developing heat action plans and improving water management, should be incorporated into public health planning to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures and irregular rainfall. Public health initiatives should be implemented to raise awareness of the risks of air pollution and climate change, particularly among pregnant women.

News Medical speaks to Bernd Gleixner, Division President Automation at Bruker Biospin, about the future of lab automation and how to overcome the challenges that arise when trying to implement it.

Chemspeed was founded 27 years ago by former Russian employees. The company began in a garage close to Basel and continued to scale up before being acquired by Bruker last year. This acquisition added to our lab automation and digitalization capabilities, with Bruker supporting our strategic growth as a trusted partner.

Chemspeed offers automation solutions for chemists by chemists. We support accelerated science, R&D, and QC by providing high-quality data 24/7 via robotics and analytical tools. This data can be used to support AI applications to accelerate drug discovery or target appropriate molecules.

The biggest challenge and opportunity lies in seamlessly connecting quality data end-to-end, from instrumentation to robotics, algorithms, and AI. There is also scope to continue to improve machine-to-machine interaction to avoid mistranslations or complex interfaces.

Part of our plan lies in keeping track of technological advancements and leveraging these where possible. For example, third-generation robotics could give us new logistical opportunities to allow us to better connect the dots.

Hybrid setups combining manually operated workbenches or workflow segments with automated sections could work well with a basic data layer forming a kind of infrastructure to keep things connected. These hybrid setups would help to increase the speed of implementation, automating sections of a standard lab workflow and moving forward from there.

Bringing labs' data infrastructure up to high standards also helps when combining robotic and manual workstations, allowing us to develop a roadmap for the step-by-step replacement of manual workstations with robotics while efficiently leveraging the lab's existing assets, technological advancements with collaborative robots, intelligent camera setups, and other aspects to bridge from an entry-level automatic setup to more complex, fully automated or full-screen automated systems.

It is important to remember that big monolithic systems are not always the way forward. One advantage of benchtop systems is that they are relatively easy to install and maintain. For example, benchtop NMR is a robust system that does not require helium.

We can combine these benchtop setups with robotics, for example, by adding synthesis capabilities in a flow setup. This level of automation does not require many new interfaces, and we can generate data, add an analytical layer to collate this data, and combine it with AI to enable more efficient experiment planning.

This means feeding the generated data and analytics into algorithms to define the next step in an experiment, then seamlessly feeding that back. The combination of lower class benchtop instruments in multimodality setups, for example, combining NMR with Raman spectroscopy, with software augmentation adds a lot of value.

The Bruker package offers the customer peace of mind. Buying different tools from different vendors and trying to set them up on your own can waste valuable time. Scientists and PhDs should focus on answering important research questions rather than spending time setting up and integrating technology. Our out-of-the-box, easy-to-use, pre-qualified system combines robotics, automated chemistry, and characterization methods, a particular area where Bruker has much to offer.

Multimodality and pre-screening are also key to performing efficient experiments. Acquiring the best-quality data does not always require a lot of time, as faster methods and software augmentation can help streamline these processes.

Bruker's analytical capabilities are first-rate, so combining these with minimal interface requirements, pre-qualified setups, and advanced instrumentation selected and integrated by our team offers significant benefit to the industry. This is also coupled with Bruker's excellent service and access to a single point of contact.

There are four key questions to ask oneself before investing in automation.

The first question is to ask why you are investing. This decision should be driven by science, and automation should contribute to the scientific problems we are trying to solve.

The second question relates to change management, because transitioning from a human-operated lab toward robotics and automation is a big project that has to be supported. The human staff will make all the difference in terms of whether or not the project is successful.

The third question relates to automation's impact on the organization. For example, there might be roles that are no longer needed once automation is in place, or new roles may be created around workflow programming or maintenance. These new roles will also require training. This question is closely connected to the change management aspect.

The fourth question is around the IT landscape. We are typically working with a brownfield approach, with a lot of different legacy systems that must be logically and sustainably connected to an automated system that will generate a lot of data. Data governance should also be considered, deciding what data is important data and what is needed to bridge the gap from data to knowledge.

Chemspeed is perfectly positioned to support green chemistry, and a lot of our customers' projects are already working toward being more sustainable.

Material efficiency is one of basic challenges for any lab. To improve your lab, simply use less material. This is also connected to AI when it comes to planning, because efficient experiment planning can reduce the number of experiments required, using fewer resources.

The other aspect of our work in this area is supporting the scientific community to be more resource efficient and sustainable. For example, there are well-known mechanochemistry processes where reactions are triggered by mechanical force, like grinding, requiring fewer coatings for photovoltaics, battery research, or power-to-X green hydrogen research.

Most of our systems are already connected to some kind of smart tools or AI-driven workflows, removing the need for fully manual experiment design and speeding up processes. Modern software, whether this is open source or commercially available, supports users to reduce activities like bin counting to the bare minimum, helping them to focus on answering scientific questions.

AI is becoming a key part of lab environments, but this is just one element. It is still important that lab staff know what they are doing, so we are focused on implementing technological possibilities in a way where we can still understand the science and answer the big questions while accelerating this and making it greener.

Chemspeed's place in the wider Bruker family affords us plenty of opportunities. We have access to cutting-edge instruments across different industries and modalities, and a lot of very powerful characterization methods.

Our sister division, IDS, is focusing on data management with its ZONTAL platform supporting AI readiness. As we continue to combine robotics, data management capabilities, and cutting-edge instruments, we will be able to provide increasingly seamless integrated DMTA (design, make, test, analyze) setups that will accelerate science and help to answer the right questions.

We will also see more discussions with our clients around the future of labs, with Chemspeed leaning into the consultancy field. The days of clients spending a lot of money on automation as a standalone transaction are over, and the focus is now on creating lasting real-world impact.

Chemspeed's partnership with Bruker has positioned us to be a major player in shaping the future of combined technology's increasingly central role in supporting science.



Bernd Gleixner is currently Division President Automation at Bruker BioSpin, a role he assumed in March 2024 following Bruker's acquisition of Chemspeed Technologies AG, a Swiss lab automation company.

Women who see themselves as having lower social status are more likely than other people to show early signs of heart stress linked to future disease risk, according to a new study led by researchers at McGill and Concordia universities.

One in three women in North America die from heart disease. Yet, women are less likely to receive important cardiac interventions or therapies than men. This highlights the need to rethink how we assess cardiovascular risk in women.""

Dr. Judy Luu, Co-Lead Author, Assistant Professor in McGill's Department of Medicine and a clinician-scientist at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre

Subjective social status – how people feel they rank compared to others in terms of their social standing – has previously been linked to physical and mental health, with lower social status associated with poorer health. The findings of this study are among the first to show measurable, sex-specific effects in the heart.

More than 400 adults between the ages of 35 and 83, all without diagnosed heart disease, took part in the study. Each completed a questionnaire ranking their social standing on a 10-rung ladder. Cardiac MRI scans then measured early signs of stress in the heart's tissue.

Women who ranked their social status lower showed more signs of potential inflammation and early scarring in the heart, even when their income and education matched those who ranked their status higher. Men who ranked their social status lower than others with the same income and education did not show these warning signs.

There are two theories that may explain the findings, said co-lead author Jean-Philippe Gouin, Full Professor of Psychology at Concordia.

""First, subjective social status may better reflect women's real-life experiences than objective data on their socioeconomic status,"" he said. ""For example, even with the same education as men, women often earn less or face additional social pressures. So, their self-perception may capture those realities more accurately.""

The second theory is about psychological impact, he said. Women may feel fewer opportunities for upward mobility, which can lead to more stress.

The researchers note that stress is one of the top five risk factors for heart disease in women under 65. Experiences such as trauma, discrimination, and caregiving demands may contribute to the subtle changes in heart tissue observed in this study – suggesting early signs of inflammation, even before disease is diagnosed.

The researchers plan to follow a larger group of participants over time to see whether these early markers predict heart disease.

""We hope our work helps shift the paradigm in cardiac care,"" said Luu. ""We want to make it normal to discuss mental wellness, social circumstances and stress in routine medical practice.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study unveils powerful strategy to rejuvenate effectiveness of CAR T cell therapy against glioblastoma","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250703/Study-unveils-powerful-strategy-to-rejuvenate-effectiveness-of-CAR-T-cell-therapy-against-glioblastoma.aspx","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 06:19:00 GMT","

A team of researchers from the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET, Milan), led by Nadia Coltella and Luigi Naldini, has unveiled a powerful strategy to rejuvenate the effectiveness of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy against glioblastoma, one of the most lethal and treatment-resistant brain tumors. The findings, published in Science Translational Medicine, highlight how gene therapy targeting immune stimulating cytokines to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enabling their private cross-talk with CAR-T cells not only restores CAR-T killer activity but also boost a broader immune response that inhibits tumor growth and extends host survival in a preclinical glioblastoma models.

The study builds on the prior development by the Naldini's laboratory of a gene therapy strategy that exploit genetic engineering of hematopoietic progenitors to generate a progeny of monocyte/macrophages that selectively release their immune stimulating payload upon infiltrating a tumor. This strategy has been taken to its first-in-human clinical testing as stand-alone treatment of glioblastoma by the biotech company Genenta Science, a spin-off from the San Raffaele Institute now listed on the NASDAQ.

""Solid tumors like glioblastoma have been notoriously difficult for CAR-T cells to penetrate and control,"" explains Dr. Rossari, first author of the work, ""By reprogramming a population of tumor-infiltrating macrophages to deliver cytokines directly into the tumor, we've morphed the immunosuppressive TME into one supportive of immune cells, thus allowing CAR T cells to better persist, become activated and attack tumor cells.""

CAR-T cells have shown transformative results in blood cancers but have struggled in solid tumors due to the hostile, immunosuppressive TME. The team's strategy leads to selective release of two cytokines within the TME: interferon-α (IFN-α), a pleiotropic immune stimulator that counteracts local immune suppressive cues and enforces antigen presentation and immune effectors' activity, and an engineered mutant of interleukin-2 that can only activate a cognate mutant receptor co-introduced with the CAR into T cells, thus boosting the proliferation specifically of the administered effector engaged in fighting the tumor.

""The private 'cross-talk' between genetically engineered macrophages and CAR T cells established in the TME ensures that the immune stimulants act only where needed, sparing the rest of the body from systemic toxicity, and specifically on the relevant target cells involved in the tumor attack, again preventing collateral damage and aberrant effects,"" says Dr. Alvisi, co-first author of the study.

In a mouse model of glioblastoma that mimics the pathology and immunological barriers seen in human patients, the targeted cytokines rescued the activity of CAR-T cells that, given alone, were ineffective – as mostly seen in clinical trials. In turn, the rescued CAR T cells now synergized with cytokine delivery, significantly enhancing their effect on delaying tumor growth and extending mouse survival. Strikingly, even tumors with only a fraction of cells expressing the CAR-targeted antigen B7-H3 were effectively controlled, indicating engagement of endogenous T cells on top of the CAR-T to fight the tumor.

""We observed not only reactivation of the CAR-T cells but also the recruitment of the host's own T cells against a wider range of tumor antigens,"" says Dr. Nadia Coltella, senior co-corresponding author. ""This phenomenon, known as antigenic spreading, was mostly dependent on IFN-α activity in the TME and is a key feature for creating effective immunity as it may overcome immune evasion by tumors targeted only through a single antigen by the CAR-T cells.""

""This work represents another important step forward in our decade-long commitment to develop a novel gene and cell therapy strategy effective against tumors, as we have been able to do for several genetic diseases along the life of our institute"" adds Luigi Naldini, Director of SR-TIGET and Professor at Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele. ""The tumor-targeted IFN-α delivery strategy is already being evaluated as stand-alone treatment in a first-in-human phase 1/2a trial on the most aggressive type of glioblastoma (Temferon trial) led by the biotech company Genenta Science. The study has shown feasibility, safety, biological activity in reprogramming the TME and early but promising indication of therapeutic benefit, albeit limited by the small number of treated patients and the design of a phase 1 study. A combination of Temferon with CAR-T cells administration, as prompted by our new study, could in future further enhance the benefit of the treatment and broaden its efficacy to a larger fraction of patients.""

This study was supported also by the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC), the Louis-Jeantet Foundation through the Jeantet-Collen Prize for Translational Medicine to Luigi Naldini, and a research contract from Genenta Sciences.

Your mouth is a magician. Bite the inside of your cheek, and the wound may vanish without a trace in a couple of days. A preclinical study co-led by Cedars-Sinai, Stanford Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), has discovered one secret of this disappearing act. The findings, if confirmed in humans, could one day lead to treatments that enable rapid, scarless recovery from skin wounds on other parts of the body.

The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine.

Our research began with two questions: Why does your mouth heal so much better than your skin? And if we figure that out, can we use that information therapeutically?""

Ophir Klein MD, PhD, executive vice dean of Children's Health at Cedars-Sinai, executive director of Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children's, the David and Meredith Kaplan Distinguished Chair in Children's Health and co-corresponding author of the study

The need for therapies is clear. Wounds to the lining of the mouth typically disappear in one to three days. But skin wounds may take nearly three times as long to heal and can leave unsightly scars.

""Unfortunately, current treatments do not adequately resolve or prevent scarring because we do not fully understand the mechanism,"" Klein said. ""Our research helps fill in that knowledge gap.""

In the study, investigators analyzed tissue samples from the lining of the mouth, known as the oral mucosa, and the facial skin of laboratory mice. In the oral mucosa, they found a signaling pathway between cells, involving a protein called GAS6 and an enzyme called AXL, which blocks a different cellular pathway, known as FAK, that promotes scarring.

When the investigators inhibited the AXL enzyme in the laboratory mice, the oral mucosa wounds' healing worsened, making them more like skin wounds. When AXL was stimulated in the skin wounds, they healed much like oral mucosa wounds, regenerating tissue more efficiently.

""This data shows that the GAS6-AXL pathway is potentially important for scarless healing in the mouth and that manipulating it may help reduce skin scars as well,"" Klein said.

The next steps are to further determine how these preclinical findings apply to humans and to develop therapies to improve healing of skin wounds, according to Michael Longaker, MD, the Dean P. and Louise Mitchell Professor in the School of Medicine at Stanford University, and the study's co-corresponding author.

""Further clinical studies should be performed to assess the nature of the relationship between AXL and scarring in humans,"" Longaker said.

A team led by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine discovered that both a mouse model and people carrying blood stem cells with mutations in the gene TET2, but not in the gene DNMT3A, had a lower risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Their study proposes a mechanism that can protect against the disease and opens new avenues for potential strategies to control the emergence and progression of this devastating condition.

""Our lab has long been studying blood stem cells, also called hematopoietic stem cells,"" said lead author Dr. Katherine King, professor of pediatrics – infectious diseases and a member of the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy and the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor. She also is part of Texas Children's Hospital.

Hematopoietic stem cells live in the bone marrow and generate all the different types of blood cells the body needs to stay alive and healthy – red blood cells, immune cells and platelets. As people get older, blood stem cells can develop mutations, and this occurs in about 20% of 70-year-olds. Most of the time, these mutations don't cause problems, but sometimes, a mutation drives the cells to divide more than others, forming a clone. This process is called clonal hematopoiesis and it has been linked to a higher risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, blood cancers like leukemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, many questions remain regarding the connection between clonal hematopoiesis and Alzheimer's disease.

""In the current study, we investigated the effect of the two genes most commonly mutated in clonal hematopoiesis, TET2 and DNMT3A, on Alzheimer's disease,"" said first author Dr. Katie A. Matatall, instructor in the King lab. ""We also selected these mutations because they are involved in inflammation, which is known to be increased in Alzheimer's disease.""

The researchers assessed the effect of clonal hematopoiesis on the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease using human data stored in the UK Biobank. They also evaluated the role of mutations in genes Tet2 and Dnmt3a in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.

The team discovered that the two mutations do not behave the same way. Clonal hematopoiesis with the TET2-mutant was associated with a 47% reduced risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease in humans, whereas other mutations of clonal hematopoiesis did not confer protection. In a mouse model, transplantation of Tet2-mutant bone marrow reduced cognitive decline and beta-amyloid plaque formation, effects not observed with Dnmt3a-mutant cells.

""Furthermore, we found that the protective effect seemed to be mediated by TET2-clonal stem cells circulating in the blood,"" Matatall said. ""Immune cells derived from these clones were able to migrate into the brain where they cleared beta-amyloid deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, more effectively than cells without the TET2 mutation. We think that it's both the increased migration into the brain and the enhanced ability to clear Alzheimer's-associated damage that drives the better outcomes.""

Until now clonal hematopoiesis has primarily been associated with promoting the progression of disease. This is the first time that these two mutations in blood stem cells have been shown to influence disease in different ways. The findings show that some clonal hematopoiesis promote disease while others, like TET2, may provide protection. We need to think about clonal hematopoiesis in a mutation-specific way and assess their risks and benefits.""

The findings establish a novel experimental platform for understanding the role of clonal hematopoiesis in Alzheimer's disease and may inform future approaches to mitigate the risks of central nervous system degenerative diseases.

A new study from Mass General Brigham researchers offers a stark reminder of how pervasive cell phone use while driving is among young people. The study team developed and disseminated a questionnaire to over 1,100 participants and conducted 20 interviews for high school students to identify the factors influencing them to engage in distracted driving. They found an average of 21% of teen drivers drive distracted and share other insights behind the behavior. Their results are published in Traffic Injury Prevention.

Driving distracted doesn't just put the driver at risk of injury or death; it puts everyone else on the road in danger of an accident. The findings from the study give us insights into the perceptions and beliefs from teenage drivers, which can be used to help create effective interventions to prevent distracted driving.""

Rebecca Robbins, MSc, PhD, lead author of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital

The interviews and questionnaire responses indicated many young drivers believe their peers drive distracted, highlighting the perceived social norm of the behavior.

""We found that while young drivers recognize the advantages of using smartphone features like GPS, they also understand the heightened risk of accidents associated with distracted driving,"" said Robbins. ""Encouraging the use of 'Do Not Disturb' mode, keeping phones out of reach and ensuring teens get adequate sleep are effective strategies to mitigate this dangerous behavior.""

WASHINGTON (July 2, 2025) – A relatively inexperienced United States Women's National Team dominated FIFA's No. 8-ranked Canada by a 3-0 scored at a sold-out Audi Field in the annual Allstate Continental Clásico to close out a very successful three-match window.

First-half goals from defensive midfielder Sam Coffey and midfielder Claire Hutton, the first of her international career, led the Americans to their 54th all-time win over Canada and fifth straight clean sheet. A late goal from Yazmeen Ryan in the 89th minute sealed the victory for the United States.

The match concluded a commanding FIFA window for the USA. The USWNT won all three of its matches and did not concede a goal while playing with a roster that did not include almost all of its European-based players, with defender Naomia Girma, tonight's captain, being the exception. The USA has won its last five matches with a combined score of 18-0, giving head coach Emma Hayes a strong building block ahead of the next matches this fall and FIFA World Cup Qualifying next year.

Hayes made 10 changes from the starting XI that featured against Ireland on June 29 with Lynn Biyendolo as the only holdover. The 10 remaining players in today's starting XI also started the first match of the FIFA window against Ireland on June 26.

Both teams arrived in the nation's capital with hopes of extending winning streaks. Top-ranked USA had earned four straight shutouts, including consecutive wins over Ireland. Meanwhile, Canada had won three straight, most recently a 4-1 win over Costa Rica.

The USA nearly opened the scoring twice early on blistering counterattacks down the right side. First, forward Michelle Cooper advanced the ball quickly with right back Avery Patterson, who lobbed a terrific ball over the top of Canada's high line to Biyendolo.

The forward tracked down the ball, then tried to swerve her shot around Canada goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan, but the strike didn't curl enough and missed wide. Moments later, Cooper beat her defender with the ball toward the endline and served a cross into the box for a Biyendolo header that Canada goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan reacted quickly to stop for her first of five saves of the night.

Soon, the United States would convert for the game's first goal. Left back Lilly Reale, making just her second career start, drove forward with the ball and drew a foul on the left side of the pitch. Canada deflected Rose Lavelle's excellent left-footed service off the free kick, but the ball bounced off Patterson to Coffey, who pounced to finish first-time from eight yards out and give the USWNT a 1-0 lead.

A minute later, goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, in just her second cap, made a huge play to keep the clean sheet going. Canada's tower striker Jordyn Huitema found some space deep inside the penalty box for a right-footed shot, but the American goalkeeper made herself big to make an excellent save. Not only did she make the initial save, Dickey stayed with the play to pounce on the rebound, denying Canada any hope of equalizing.

Dickey finished the night with three saves and her second straight clean sheet as a starter.

Canada struggled to contain the United States all night and the USA showed flashes of creativity all over the field. Later in the half, Reale made a high run and played a terrific through ball to Thompson, leading her into the box. Thompson made the short pass to Biyendolo, who swung the ball to Coffey on the right. The midfielder played it back to Thompson who was making a sneaky run toward the back post, but the speedy forward couldn't connect from close range and Canada escaped the close call.

In the 36th minute, the United States scored on a set piece for the second time in the half. Moments after a nifty nutmeg from Lavelle opened the attack, the United States earned a corner kick. Like on the opening goal, Lavelle proved dangerous with service from her favored left foot, floating the kick into the box. Claire Hutton timed her jump perfectly, snapping a header from five yards out into the lower left corner of the net. The goal was a career first for the 19-year-old in just her sixth cap.

Canada had never beaten the U.S. trailing by two goals in the series history and the United States was on the front foot for the rest of the game, hungry for more goals in a match that could have seen the Americans double the final scoreline. The U.S. dominated the match and the score sheet, piling up 22 shots to just seven for Canada on the night and controlled 66 percent of the possession.

In the 52nd minute, Patterson switched the ball beautifully to Thompson with tons of space on the far side. With her second touch, Thompson cut back to set up a shot with her right foot. Looking for her third goal in as many matches, Thompson struck the ball well, but her shot sailed high.

The third and final goal of the night arrived in the 89th minute and involved two late substitutes. Three minutes after coming into the match, Washington Spirit birthday girl Tara McKeown, playing in her club's home stadium, charged down the right side on the dribble. With Canada's defense collapsing on her, she dished the ball to Ryan. The forward had time to control her touch and set up a low, left-footed shot from 18 yards out that skipped into the lower right corner for her second goal in as many matches.

USA – SAM COFFEY (AVERY PATTERSON), 17th minute: Lavelle lofted a gliding ball into the box on a direct free kick about 30 yards from goal. The kick took an unintentional flick off a Canadien defender, and then off Patterson. Coffey stepped in and from close range with her right foot, delivered a low-driven strike into the lower right side of the net for the opening goal. USA 1, CAN 0

USA – CLAIRE HUTTON (ROSE LAVELLE), 36th minute: The second goal of the night also arrived on a set piece. On a corner kick, Lavelle drove a left-footed kick into the box from the right side. Hutton soared to put her header on frame from just inside the edge of the six-yard box. The ball took one bounce on its way into the goal's left corner. USA 2, CAN 0

USA – YAZMEEN RYAN (TARA McKEOWN), 89th minute: McKeown flew down the right wing on the dribble then passed the ball off to Ryan in the center of the pitch. The forward had time to set up her shot then hit the ball with her left foot from the top of the 18-yard box. Ryan's low, firm strike bounced once and stuck into the right corner of the net.

Emma Hayes starts Gotham FC's Rose Lavelle, Lilly Reale, Emily Sonnett in the third and final friendly of the international break.

The US women's national team capped off a three-game run of friendlies with a 3-0 win over Canada on Wednesday night at Audi Field in Washington, DC.

The US scored 11 goals total over the international window, with three shutouts in three games played this past week. Claudia Dickey proved sturdy in goal for her second national team start while Sam Coffey kicked off the scoring, leading the way for fellow midfielder Claire Hutton to score her first senior national goal and for former Gotham FC forward Yazmeen Ryan to finish the game with a goal of her own.

Prior to this week's friendlies, US head coach Emma Hayes spoke at length about her vision for a national squad fit to play in the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup, evaluating players selected for this camp as she begins to narrow down her choices for a World Cup team come October. Tonight's win is one of several matches Hayes will be looking at when determining her closed roster towards the end of this year. 

If these past three friendlies have proven anything, it's that the USWNT can still consistently field an impressive team despite the absence of several key figures. The ""Triple Espresso"" attacking trio of Sophia Smith, Mallory Swanson, and Trinity Rodman are unlikely to make a return to the squad this year, with both Smith and Swanson expecting and Rodman out with injury. No matter, as Hayes brought in several rising talents to fill in for their absence.

Sam Coffey, a member of the 2024 Paris Olympic gold medalist squad, opened up the scoring with a 17th-minute goal after a free kick from Rose Lavelle came her way. However, it was a youngster who notched the team's second goal and made the biggest impact of the night. In just her sixth national team appearance, 19-year-old Claire Hutton scored her first USWNT senior goal. A corner kick from Lavelle gave Hutton the opportunity to take advantage of the space left by Canada's back line to head in a goal just before halftime. Yazmeen Ryan finished off the scoring with a decisive strike in the 89th minute.

Claire Hutton makes it count 🇺🇸

Her first USWNT goal comes from a well-placed header off the corner!

""[Hayes] is bringing people that are willing and wanting to learn who are really good at soccer and also who are fully invested,"" USWNT forward Lynn Biyendolo said on the U.S. Soccer podcast ahead of the match. ""That does make the veterans' job a bit easier.""

All in all, it was a dominant showing from the US While there wasn't much doubt over whether or not this new USWNT squad would live up to expectations, the end result of multiple-goal games with consecutive shutouts should offer some reassurance for Hayes if she hopes to continue with a similar camp strategy heading into the 2027 World Cup.  

It's quite possible that Gotham players Lavelle, Lilly Reale, and Emily Sonnet will be on Hayes' short list for her FIFA Women's World Cup roster. All three players started in both the first friendly against Ireland as well as the last friendly against Canada. The three held their own while adjusting to Hayes' changes.

Reale represents Hayes's vision for building a new team from the ground up by bringing in youth to replace retired USWNT stars. As one of the younger players at this camp at only 21 years old, Reale is among a group of young US stars who are building camaraderie as they look towards bringing a cohesive national team to the World Cup in two years.

The District was the place to be tonight 🏛️🙌

Lavelle scored and assisted several goals, leaving little question about whether or not she'll receive a call back. Despite Hayes' desire to form a younger team, there's no questioning the impact Lavelle has had on this team of youngsters, bringing her experience as an Olympic gold medalist and World Cup champion. As with any inexperienced team, previous leadership is a plus, and Lavelle's ability to show up on the biggest stages in the sport is an added bonus to inspire a fairly new USWNT team. If Lavelle remains healthy, there's a high chance she'll earn a spot on the final roster. 

Like Lavelle, Sonnett is a USWNT veteran, having played for the national team that won both the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Her dependability as a defender for the national squad cannot be understated, given her sharp eye and ability to read the ball. Previous positions as a full-back, center-back, and defensive midfielder make her an invaluable asset to the USWNT. Given Hayes' continued confidence in Sonnett's versatility and perseverance, it's likely she will remain one of the key veterans on this squad as the 2027 World Cup approaches.

All three Gotham FC call-ups made the USWNT Starting XI as Rose Lavelle returned to the lineup with a Player of the Match performance, and Lilly Reale earned her first cap.

Veterans Rose Lavelle and Emily Sonnet will be joined by 21-year-old national team debutant Lilly Reale.

Hope Solo was the greatest goalkeeper of her generation — and one of the most problematic players ever to suit up for the USWNT.

...

ST. LOUIS — The U.S. men's national team is heading to the Gold Cup final, and from the fourth minute onward here at Energizer Park, that outcome was rarely in doubt.

The USMNT raced out to an early 2-0 lead in Wednesday's semifinal, and ultimately beat Guatemala, FIFA's 106th-ranked team, 2-1.

But for long stretches of the first half, it struggled. At the 45-minute mark, Guatemala had more Expected Goals, and more than twice as many shots.

And over the final 15 minutes, after a Guatemala goal, amid raucous noise, the U.S. wobbled.

Fortunately for the Americans, they had Diego Luna.

Luna's meteoric rise — from the outside looking in at the under-23 Olympic roster to the full USMNT's starting lineup — continued Wednesday with a fourth-minute goal, then shot even further skyward with a 15th-minute banger.

With the confidence and borderline cockiness that head coach Mauricio Pochettino loves, Luna dropped his shoulder, shimmied, deked into the box, and slammed his second goal of the match past Guatemalan goalkeeper Kenderson Navarro.

""It's just finding the rhythm and being able to get the freedom from the coaching staff and the team,"" Luna said post-match about being the team's difference-maker. ""[Knowing] that they're going to have my back and the trust of the defensive responsibilities, allows me to do what I do on the ball.""

He silenced a pro-Guatemala crowd, and sped for the corner flag, and pointed to the U.S. Soccer crest on his left pec. He pointed to the name on the back of his jersey, then danced as his teammates mobbed him, and as Guatemalan hopes seemed to dim for good.

But then, over a somewhat shocking half hour, those hopes were rekindled.

They were rekindled by 20,000 Guatemaltecos, who injected unceasing energy into the evening, just kept chanting.

“Gua-té!” they shouted. “Gua-té!”

And even after their team went down 2-0: “Sí se puede!” Yes we can!

And their players responded.

Los Chapines, as they're known, could've hung their heads. They could have conceded that the USMNT was simply better. But instead, playing in their first Gold Cup semifinal in 29 years, they fought. And they fought some more.

They earned back territory. And gradually, they grew into the game. They created a few half-chances, then some legitimate chances. And the USMNT, which had spent the past 70 hours talking about fighting, didn't fight back.

The Americans nearly succumbed to the pressure. Their intensity slipped, and for around 20 minutes, the game was relatively one-sided — in favor of the side that not a soul expected to be in this semifinal.

Rubio Rubin, the Oregon-born Guatemala striker, got free in the box more than once, and nearly pulled the underdogs back into the match.

In the end, they simply didn't have enough quality. They gave Luna and Malik Tillman too much space in the opening 15 minutes. And they couldn't take advantage of the space that the USMNT, after a strong start, began to give them.

In the second half, the U.S. stabilized. But Patrick Agyemang, Pochettino's choice to start at striker throughout this Gold Cup, had his worst game in a USMNT jersey. His touches were sloppy. His passes were off. His finishing was wayward. He and his U.S. teammates seemed to get discouraged, and exhibited frustration.

Then, in the 80th minute, they conceded, and Energizer Park erupted.

The U.S. threw on a second left back, then a second center back, Walker Zimmerman. They held on for dear life against a team whose entire roster is worth about one-fourth of Tillman. Matt Freese scrambled to make a stoppage-time save.

And in the end, they held out for a victory to advance to Sunday's final.

But that, they surely know, will be a much tougher game. They'll meet the winner of Wednesday's second semifinal between Mexico and Honduras. They'll have a chance to win a trophy. But still, in many ways, they haven't proven anything yet.

The U.S. Men's National Team advanced to its 13th Concacaf Gold Cup Final on Wednesday night. The USMNT punched its ticket with a 2-1 win over Guatemala in the tournament semifinals.

Midfielder Diego Luna tallied the two goals in the first half. Luna netted his first National Team goal in the quarterfinal against Costa Rica, and in his 11th career cap, he bagged his first international brace.

In the Gold Cup's 34-year history, the Americans have taken home the trophy seven times and will have the chance to earn their eighth on Sunday, July 6. The United States won the inaugural biennial tournament in 1991 and last won it in 2021.

It'll be a relatively new squad going for the title; only two players from that 2021 starting XI are on this roster — goalkeeper Matt Turner and defender Miles Robinson. However, neither player has contributed significantly on the field in this year's tournament. So, a group of several Gold Cup newcomers look to earn their first confederation championship.

Now, the USA awaits the winner of the Mexico vs. Honduras match to find out its opposition in the final. That semifinal match kicks off Wednesday, July 2 at 10:00 p.m. ET.

Mexico, the USMNT's biggest rival, has faced the USA eight times in the Gold Cup — seven of those were in the final.

Meanwhile, if Honduras pulls off the upset like it did against Panama in the quarterfinal, it'll be the first time the United States and Honduras have battled for the title since the first tournament in 1991. 

Regardless of who's on the other side, one thing's for certain: the USA is in the final. The championship match kicks off in Houston at NRG Stadium on July 6 at 7 p.m. ET.

The U.S. Men's National Team secured a spot in the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final after defeating Guatemala 2-1 on Wednesday in front of an announced attendance of 22,423 at Energizer Park.

U.S. winger Diego Luna struck twice in the first 15 minutes, giving his team an ample cushion to make it through the match — first in the 4th minute, pouncing on a rebound inside the box and slotting a left-footed shot past Guatemalan goalkeeper Kénderson Navarro. 

About 10 minutes later, Luna received a long cross-field pass from Malik Tillman, cut right, then doubled the lead with a right-footed strike from the top of the penalty box.

Luna became the first player from any national team to score two goals in the opening 15 minutes of a Gold Cup semifinal match.

Despite starting slow, Guatemala nearly scored in the 26th minute when Óscar Santis sent a header just wide of the goal. Navarro, the Guatemalan keeper, kept the match within reach in the 61st minute with a diving save to stop a header by U.S. striker Patrick Agyemang.

Guatemala's breakthrough came in the 80th minute when Olger Escobar buried a right-footed shot inside the box, sending the stadium into a frenzy and injecting life into the underdogs. The momentum carried into stoppage time, where José Morales had a chance to level the match, but U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese made a critical stop to preserve the win.

While chants of “Sí se puede!” — Spanish for “Yes, we can!” — rang out across the stadium, Guatemala's historic tournament run came to a close. Some fans rushed the field after the final whistle, and several were tackled by security.

Guatemala thrilled its devotees with a series of narrow-margin wins in the tournament, including dramatic penalty shootouts and late winners that marked one of the nation's deepest runs in Gold Cup.

For some fans, Wednesday's matchup was deeply personal.

“This was the match I was hoping that would happen — never thought I'd actually get to see it,” said David Chavarria, 22, of Imperial, whose parents are Guatemalan and American. “I've been to games here in St. Louis before. This is nothing new, but a game such as this, for me personally, is a dream come true.”

Others reflected on what the match meant for the region and local soccer community.

“For the city of St Louis, it means a lot,” said Casey Adams, a 37-year-old USMNT fan from Ballwin.“ We just have had our team … for a couple of years now, and to be able to have a matchup like this — I think it's pretty awesome. It puts St. Louis on the map for international soccer.”

The United States will face Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final on Sunday at NRG Stadium in Houston.

ST. LOUIS (July 2, 2025) — The U.S. Men's National Team utilized an early brace from Diego Luna to defeat Guatemala 2-1 in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Semifinal in front of a sellout crowd of 22,423 at Energizer Park. With the victory, the USA advances to a record 13th Concacaf Gold Cup Final on Sunday, with the team set to face the winner of Wednesday's other semifinal between Mexico and Honduras.

United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino emphasized matching Guatemala's energy early and its motivation to continue its underdog run after upsetting Canada in the quarterfinal.

Pochettino kept the same starting lineup from the quarterfinal, that group — aside from Tyler Adams, who dealt with an injury at the beginning of the tournament — has played in four of the United States' five Gold Cup games.

Midfielder Luna set the tone early with a goal in the fourth minute, pouncing from just outside the six-yard box after the Guatemala ‘keeper spilled an initial attempt from Luca de la Torre.

Eleven minutes later, Luna found the back of the net again. The trio of Sebastian Berhalter, Patrick Agyemang and Malik Tillman bounded a couple of short passes to build up the attack. Tillman then sent a beautiful cross to a streaking Luna on the left side of the box. Luna crossed up a defender to create space and struck the ball into the lower left corner in the 15th minute.

The USA held Guatemala off for most of the match until Olger Escobar scored in the 80th minute. Off a short pass, Arquímidez Ordóñezpushedinto the box before Escobar ran onto the ball and slotted a low strike past goalkeeper Matt Freese and inside the lower right post. Ultimately, the Americans held off Guatemala from finding the equalizer.

Guatemala posed an intense opposition despite the U.S. gaining control early. It was a physical match that saw 30 total fouls and six yellow cards shown. Defender Chris Richards, Luna, de la Torre and Freese were all cautioned for the USA while Stheven Robles and Oscar Santis also saw yellow cards for Guatemala. Los Chapines created more in attack than what the USA had seen previously in the tournament and outshot the United States 20-12. 

Coming off his impressive three-save performance in Sunday's quarterfinal against Costa Rica, Freese saw the most action of his six USMNT appearances, recording a career-high four saves, including his stop on José Morales deep into injury time which kept the USA from a second-straight shootout.

Next, the USMNT will face the winner of Wednesday's second semifinal between Mexico and Honduras in the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Final on Sunday, July 6 at NRG Stadium in Houston at 7 p.m. ET (FOX, Univision, TUDN, Fútbol de Primera, SIRIUSXM FC).

USA — DIEGO LUNA, 4th minute: Defender Alex Freeman sent a cross to midfielder Luca de la Torre who launched a shot on target that bounced off the keeper's hands. Luna, in great position, alertly collected the rebound with his right before slotting it home with his left from seven yards out. USA 1, GUA 0

USA — DIEGO LUNA (MALIK TILLMAN), 15th minute: Tillman played a long square pass to Luna on the left. The midfielder dribbled into some empty space before beating a Guatemala defender and ripping a right-footed effort from just outside the box and into the lower left corner. USA 2, GUA 0

GUA — OLGER ESCOBAR (ARQUÍMIDES ORDÓÑEZ), 80th minute: Off a short pass, Ordóñez pushed forward before Escobar ran onto the ball and slotted a low strike past goalkeeper Matt Freese inside the lower right post. USA 2, GUA 1 FINAL

One of the breakout stars of the U.S. Men's National Team this year, Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna was the man of the hour in St. Louis on Wednesday as his brace fired Mauricio Pochettino's side into the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.

The 21-year-old made an impact early, stunning Guatemala with a close-range effort in the fourth minute to open the scoring. Just 10 minutes later, Luna was back at it, pulling off an excellent solo run to the edge of Guatemala's box, throwing in a neat step over along the way, before finding the bottom corner of Kenderson Navarro's goal.

Some questionable defending from the USMNT led to plenty of chances as the game wore on for the visitors, including a disallowed goal in the 29th minute. Eventually, Olger Escobar found a way past Matt Freese in the U.S. goal with 10 minutes to go, but this proved little more than a consolation as a late dive from the New York City FC keeper prevented an equalizer deep into added time.

Luna, whose energy and fight has endeared him to fans across the country, has now featured in all but one game for the USMNT this year, and has started four of their five wins at the Gold Cup en route to Sunday's final.

With three goals in his last two games, the MLS All-Star will now surely be on the radar of teams around the world, as noted postgame by FS1's Rob Stone.

“I hope his agent is a very, very busy human being the next couple hours, days, weeks and months because that is a young man that this country would like to cheer for,” he said postgame.

“He's doing the right things, he's saying the right things, and those moments are coming that are memorable, and its in the context of a team that, like we said, came into this tournament where there was a lot of negativity towards this team,” USMNT legend Alexi Lalas added.

“And there still is, I'm sure theres people that aren't sold on, whether it's Diego Luna or anybody else out there, but sports are for the moments, they're not for being practical, they're not for being realistic.

“You've got to be able to celebrate these moments and it's fun to see this team celebrate and its fun to see others celebrity this team in terms of what they're doing and a lot of it is someone like Diego Luna for the way that he plays and the way in which he holds himself when he plays.”

Landon Donovan, another legend of the USMNT, was equally high on Luna, comparing him to Clint Dempsey whilst laying out why he believes the youngster is “unique.”

“He's a little bit unique in the modern game in that he is willing to take chances,” he explained. “You remember I played with Dempsey, one of the best ever, he takes chances, he does at people, he tries stuff in front of the goal. So don't just look at his goals…You watch him and the joy he has, and you can't help but be so happy for him.”

Luna, whose contract with RSL runs through the 2026 MLS season, will return to action on Sunday at NRG Stadium when the USMNT takes on Mexico in the final.

The last time these two sides met at a Gold Cup final was in 2021, with the USMNT coming out on top via a late Miles Robinson goal.

...

ST. LOUIS — The question was about chance creation. But Mauricio Pochettino wanted to talk about soccer culture.

He was speaking after his U.S. men's national team beat Guatemala 2-1 here in a Gold Cup semifinal. But of all the things he witnessed Wednesday, what apparently impressed Pochettino the most was “the fans of Guatemala … Unbelievable,” he said.

And then he spoke for two minutes and 40 seconds straight, from the heart, about what he hoped U.S. soccer would learn from the experience. From the passion that filled Energizer Park immediately when gates opened at 4:30 p.m. From the chants that rang and the flags that rippled and “the energy that translates” to the field, as Pochettino said. It inspired Guatemalan players, who on paper were overmatched, but on Wednesday put a mighty scare into the USMNT.

After they came up just short, “I saw a player of Guatemala crying,” Pochettino said.

He congratulated that player, then used him as an example 20 minutes later.

“That,” he said, “is the way that we need to feel.”

“And our fans need to feel the same,” he continued. “It's not to come here to enjoy all the spectacle, and if you lose, nothing happens. … Things happen.”

Pochettino is from Argentina. “In Argentina, it's not the same if we lose. The consequences are massive,” he explained. They're significant as well in Spain, France and England, where he spent 30 years as a player and coach before taking charge of the USMNT last fall. “Win or lose, it's not the same. It's not the same. It's a lot of consequence,” he reiterated at his postmatch press conference.

His stateside move, in this sense, has clearly been a culture shock. He has inherited players who, he seemingly feels, do not have the same level of life-or-death desire that gets ingrained in kids throughout South and Central America.

In many countries, “you play [to] survive. You play for food. You play for pride,” Pochettino said. “You play for many things. It's not to go and enjoy, and go home, and laugh, and that's it.

“The moment that we — now, this roster — start to live in this way, I think we have big room to improve.”

He hasn't explicitly said that his players go home and laugh after wins. But many grew up in a country, the U.S., where soccer is not played to survive, to escape poverty, to change a family's life; it typically begins as a recreational pursuit, often in middle-class suburbs. It becomes something more as talented kids join academies, and then turn pro, of course; there is a level of “desperation,” though — a word Pochettino has used — that is socially ingrained elsewhere but not here.

And it's reinforced, if not mandated, by fans. Fans who demand everything by giving everything. Fans who buzz around a stadium at 10 a.m., then fill it at 6 p.m., and stand for 90 minutes, and chant: “Sí se puede!” Yes we can!

“I think the fans gave to you, to Guatemala, an unbelievable energy,” Pochettino said.

Veteran defender Tim Ream agreed: “It spurred them on to push and fight.”

“That is football,” Pochettino said, and then he repeated the line twice more. “That is football. That is football.”

That “connection between the fans and the team,” he said, “that is the connection that we [would] like to see in the World Cup. That connection that makes you fly.”

In his time atop the USMNT, instead, he has seen several half-empty stadiums. And even when full, the environments are relatively laid-back, inorganic or tame. They are muted by what many fans feel are ridiculous ticket prices. The apathy surrounding the team has likely opened Pochettino's eyes, and sometimes seems difficult for him to fathom.

What he hadn't yet experienced, though, until Wednesday, was a true road game at home.

""You're playing in the heart of America, and you have 95% Guatemalan fans,"" Ream said, amazed but unsurprised.

“It was like [playing] in Guatemala,” Pochettino said.

“It was an atmosphere that we didn't expect,” he added. And it clearly had an impact on the game.

“You can't understate what a partisan crowd can do to young minds, guys who haven't experienced it,” Ream said. “Sometimes, the pressure comes, the fans feel like they're on top of you, the noise is deafening, and you kinda lose it a little bit.”

As a few players pointed out, Pochettino should have expected it. It's a reality in the United States, where there are millions of people with ties to soccer-mad countries in Latin America.

“We're a country full of immigrants. It was kind of expected for tonight,” defender Chris Richards said. “It's beautiful to see how much respect they have, but also how much support they have.”

When told that Pochettino was surprised, Richards said: “I think Mauricio kinda being a little bit newer to the U.S., I think he wasn't quite ready for it.”

Ream indicated that some younger players were taken aback, too. He and others called it an ideal “learning experience” for Sunday's final against Mexico in Houston. “This game tonight would be like a little brother to the U.S.-Mexico game,” Richards said. They'll go into Sunday better equipped, mentally.

Pochettino, though, wasn't thinking about how his team would handle that atmosphere. He was dreaming of replicating Guatemala's passion, and its impact on players, in the team that he coaches.

“If you see the big teams or countries [play games], it's not playing,” Pochettino said. “Today, do you think that was a sport, two teams playing, and doing a spectacle? No. You play for something more. You play for emotion. You play [to], be happy, be sad.”

That is what he wants here. It's a dynamic, of course, that takes decades to develop, and might never develop in a nation of unmatched wealth and unparalleled opportunity in other sports and fields. But how can it start?

“I think winning helps. But I also think guys like [midfielder] Diego Luna help. I also think guys like [midfielder] Malik Tillman help,” Ream said. And “fighting and togetherness” help. “Doing that fosters that connection with the fans — with the diehards, with the casuals, with everybody. And as long as we continue to do that, that culture grows. The feelings grow. And the connections grow.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

What's more dangerous: playing soccer in the midday sun amid temperatures nearing 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or playing soccer when there's lightning eight miles away?

If you answered the latter, congratulations—you're now qualified to join the FIFA Club World Cup organizing committee.

Whether you think FIFA's approach to severe weather at the tournament is too strict or too blasé, this much is clear: If the concern is always player and fan safety, the disparity between concern over heat and concern over severe weather is nonsensical. And it's a discrepancy that needs to be solved before next year's World Cup.

We've already seen extreme hot weather cause very real hardship in recent tournaments on American soil during daytime kickoffs.

At last year's Copa América, an assistant referee collapsed during a game between Peru and Canada in Kansas City, Kansas, amid temperatures in the low 90s and relative humidity above 50%.

At the final in Miami Gardens, Florida, numerous fans were seen requiring water and medical treatment amid sweltering conditions and crowd control difficulties.

More generally, heat is far more likely to cause death than lightning strikes in the United States. If anything, the number of heat-related fatalities may be undercounted because they can present as cardiac or other health issues.

Perhaps most maddening, it's also an easily solvable problem. Major League Soccer has moved away almost entirely from daytime summer kickoffs. Of 510 league games this year, only seven were scheduled to begin before 6 p.m. local time between June and August, defined as meteorological summer. Three of those were in decidedly mild Seattle.

There is an abundance of indoor venues FIFA has more or less ignored. The good news: the 2026 World Cup will feature more of those, including five with full coverage and four with climate control. But several obviously feasible indoor sites were never considered, including three 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup host venues in Minneapolis; Arlington, Texas; and Glendale, Arizona.

At least the lightning policy is born out of concern for those involved—and, perhaps, the lawsuits they might file. But it's likely overly cautious, applying general guidance that was originally intended for situations lacking sophisticated surveillance.

The common standard at NCAA events is the 30/30 rule: if you hear thunder within 30 seconds of seeing a lightning flash, suspend play for 30 minutes. That's meant to avoid play once lightning is within six miles, and to be enforceable at smaller-scale events where there may be little staff beyond coaches and players.

That standard has been ratcheted up to eight miles at MLS games and the ongoing Club World Cup, and even 10 miles at outdoor NFL games. But with nighttime kickoffs, MLS games can usually wait out severe weather that diminishes as temperatures cool. NFL regular-season games are played entirely outside of meteorological summer.

FIFA should instead follow Major League Baseball's model, which includes no hard-and-fast policy on implementing lightning delays.

A 2023 analysis suggested as many as one in 14 MLB games are played with lightning within an “unsafe” distance, as defined by the eight-mile radius. That's more than 170 games a season.

But MLB also has generations of experience dealing with the issue and stadium personnel whose primary job is to monitor radar and weather conditions—accounting for a storm's relative severity, speed and direction in addition to proximity.

With this common-sense approach, modern MLB has avoided lightning-related injuries. If you search for lightning-related MLB deaths, you'll find the wild story of Ray Caldwell, who was struck down on the mound in 1919—before the advent of radio, let alone radar.

FIFA should follow that model, placing a qualified meteorologist at each venue empowered to make nuanced, real-time decisions rather than enforcing a rigid rule. We see this regularly in the medical field. The same doctor who advises the average person to rest for two weeks might give more nuanced guidance to a professional athlete who has a training staff to help manage risks while playing through an injury.

To be clear, FIFA should not sacrifice player and fan safety for the sake of convenience. But it must think about actual safety—not the appearance of it.

Forcing thousands of fans into crowded, sweltering concourses or unsheltered parking lots amid a remote chance of lightning can't possibly be the safest choice every single time. Nor can forcing athletes to exert themselves for two hours in the peak of the midday summer sun.

Midfielder's suspension may mean shifting Fernández and risking raw talent in quarter-final against Palmeiras

Moisés Caicedo was still going strong. There were 108 minutes on the clock at the Bank of America Stadium – not taking into account the lengthy weather delay – when the Chelsea midfielder won possession in Benfica's half, found Cole Palmer and surged forward.

Palmer advanced towards a back-pedalling, understaffed defence. He waited for support before finding the overlapping Caicedo. Benfica, tiring with 10 men, were defeated by Caicedo's power. The 23-year-old shot, Anatoliy Trubin made a mess of his save and the ball squirmed loose to Christopher Nkunku to score the goal that sent Enzo Maresca's side into the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup.

One problem, though: Caicedo will be serving a one-game ban when Chelsea meet Palmeiras in Philadelphia on Friday night. One momentary lapse of judgment could prove costly. Caicedo had to be smarter when he questioned a refereeing decision in the second half against Benfica. He took his protest too far and received a booking for dissent, leaving Maresca with a dilemma.

Caicedo is Chelsea's midfield linchpin – nobody mocks his £115m fee now – and his absence is significant. The Ecuadorian started every Premier League game last season, becoming the first Chelsea player to do so since César Azpilicueta in the 2018-19 campaign, and his durability is not in doubt.

Stretch it out and he has not been forced to miss a game since illness kept him out of a 2-1 defeat to Wolves on Christmas Eve in 2023. Before that, the only other times when he has not started in the league were as a late substitute during a 4-1 defeat to Newcastle in November 2023 after returning late from international duty and when unavailable for a goalless draw against Bournemouth in September 2023.

It has become common to see Caicedo run off an injury after coming off worse in a 50-50 challenge. He needed treatment on a blow to his knee against Benfica but still played on. No wonder Maresca has leant so heavily on him. The head coach does not like to go into key games without the former Brighton midfielder.

There was no question of Maresca resting Caicedo in the league when he was one yellow card away from a two-match ban during last season's run-in. Caicedo was trusted to stay out of trouble, even though he plays on the edge and is never shy to go in hard when the ball is there to be won.

But indiscipline has cost him in the United States. Chelsea, who have added João Pedro to their squad after signing the forward from Brighton, have to react. Caicedo plays when it matters. Maresca rested him in the Carabao Cup and in easy Conference League games but never when the stakes were high. After all, Caicedo started and scored in the Conference League final victory over Real Betis. Being given a breather against Espérance last week is irrelevant given that Caicedo has started three of four games at the Club World Cup.

Caicedo's importance is vast. His long-term cover is Dário Essugo, who has just joined from Sporting. Essugo is inexperienced and has only made two substitute appearances for his new side. It would be a huge gamble for Maresca to select the combative 20-year-old against Palmeiras.

Maresca is likely to find other ways to compensate for losing his best tackler. It is frustrating given that the Benfica game was the first time Caicedo, Roméo Lavia and Enzo Fernández had started together in midfield since the opening weekend of last season. The likeliest solution seems to be shifting Fernández into a deeper role.

However, there was some concern after the brilliant but fragile Lavia was not pictured in training earlier this week. There is no replacement for Lavia's control and ability to conduct play. Chelsea need him to be ready for his fourth start of the tournament. Essugo is raw. Andrey Santos is viewed as a No 8 and is learning Maresca's style. Reece James impressed at right-back against Benfica but struggled in central midfield when Chelsea lost to Flamengo in Philadelphia during the group stage.

That was a bad afternoon. Nicolas Jackson was sent off – the striker has completed a two-game ban – and Chelsea failed to cope with Flamengo's flair, adventure and passion. At least they face Palmeiras knowing not to underestimate Brazilian opposition.

Palmeiras remain unbeaten and will be backed by a large following at Lincoln Financial Field. They have tried to calm the hype around Estêvão, the exciting young winger who joins Chelsea after the tournament. Their manager, Abel Ferreira, has won 10 trophies during his five years in the job, developed young talent and turned down lucrative offers from clubs in Europe and Saudi Arabia because of his desire to make Palmeiras world champions for the first time.

Chelsea will have to be at their best. There has been talk of a favourable route to the final – they avoided a last-16 tie against Bayern Munich and were expected to face Manchester City in the last four, only for Al-Hilal to shock Pep Guardiola's side – but there is no room for complacency against Palmeiras. It is a repeat of the 2022 final, when Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea collected the final trophy of the Roman Abramovich era by beating Ferreira's punchy Palmeiras side in extra time, and it will not be easy without Caicedo.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The tournament has been very profitable for the club so far.

Real Madrid's pursuit of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup title has proven to be highly lucrative, with the club amassing €55 million in prize money after advancing to the Quarterfinals, making them the highest-earning team in the tournament so far. 

Los Blancos now have the chance to secure an additional €20 million if they overcome Dortmund and reach the Semifinals. Progressing to the Final would guarantee them €27 million in case of a loss, while winning the championship would bring in a staggering €37 million. In total, Madrid has a potential €56.4 million riding on the three matches they have left to play.

Fully aware of the immense financial rewards this tournament offers, Real Madrid's board strategically bolstered the squad by signing key players like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen. These acquisitions were made to ensure the team had the necessary reinforcements to make a significant impact and maximize their chances of success in the competition.

FIFA Club World Cup

Gianni Infantino has no doubt about it. This Club World Cup, the FIFA president says, represents a “new era of club football”, a “big bang” in the history of the world's biggest sport.

He has been talking in those terms for a while, banging the drum for the expanded Club World Cup with a fanatical, almost maniacal zeal. The same superlatives appear all over his Instagram account, where he checks in after every game to tell his 3.2million followers of “incredible” drama, “phenomenal” atmospheres and an “epic” tournament, full of “unprecedented moments”, that is “taking over the United States”.

It is not easy to share Infantino's enthusiasm. In fact, at times it has felt far easier to deride it. Where he sees unprecedented moments of incredible drama played out in phenomenal atmospheres, some of us have seen matches of varying quality, some of them embarrassingly one-sided, some ruined by the madness of playing in the stifling afternoon heat, some interrupted for more than an hour by storms, some played in front sparse crowds, others attendances swelled and enlivened only by those supporting Real Madrid or the teams from Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.

But somewhere in the chasm of perception between Infantino's bombast and the indifference felt by many football fans, certain things are easier to say. Just as there have been meagre turnouts at some games, there have been big, noisy crowds at others. Just as there have been poor matches, where the quality has been low or totally mismatched, there have been some very good ones — none better than Al Hilal's thrilling 4-3 victory over Manchester City in Orlando on Monday night while Riyadh and Manchester were sleeping.

That was the one that prompted Infantino's boldest “new era” claim so far. “A game for the ages,” he said on Instagram. “The emotions and passion on display were something only a global, inclusive competition such as the FIFA Club World Cup can generate.”

It was, to repeat, a thrilling game, a big moment for Saudi Arabian football and for this tournament. But… does the most powerful man in world football really believe the emotions witnessed at Camping World Stadium on Monday “were something only a global, inclusive competition such as the FIFA Club World Cup can generate”? You would suspect not. You would certainly hope not.

There have been some strong attendances, but nothing like as many as Infantino was suggesting there would be before the tournament. He told a sceptical media audience in Atlanta in April that he had even seen “friendly games, exhibition games” sell out in American cities in recent years, so he was “not worried at all to fill a stadium when teams are coming to play a World Cup, to play for (…) something real”.

Advertisement

He said it would be like staging “14 Super Bowls” in Atlanta — six at this summer's Club World Cup and eight at next year's World Cup. But the city's five games to date have hosted an average of 38,265, which is not only barely half the capacity of Mercedes-Benz Stadium but also almost 6,000 below Atlanta United's average attendance in what has been a deeply disappointing MLS season. Atlanta United's prices are significantly lower of course, but that suggests they know their market rather better than FIFA do.

The Athletic revealed Wednesday night that prices for Friday's quarter-final between Fluminense and Al Hilal in Orlando had been slashed, with Ticketmaster, FIFA's official ticket-selling partner for the tournament, offering seats for as little as $11.15. (£8.17). It was also offering tickets for Chelsea's quarter-final against Palmeiras in Philadelphia for as little as $22.30 (£16.34). FIFA has been using a “dynamic” pricing model, but these prices are significantly lower than Ticketmaster was showing for any group stage before the start of the tournament.

To the vast American sporting public, this strange global tournament is proving a much harder sell than Infantino appeared to expect — harder than many of those of “friendly games, exhibition games” Infantino was breezily talking about. Harder, indeed, than a lot of matches in MLS, where there is a more clearly established bond between the fans, the teams and the competition they are watching.

Football has become obsessed with globalisation, but the sport — as opposed to the business — is still fuelled by what happens at a local level. Whether it is in the big leagues of Europe (or indeed the smaller leagues of Europe), the Brazilian Campeonato, Argentina's Primera Division, the Saudi Pro League, Japan's J1 League, MLS, Liga MX or anywhere else, so much of what we feel as football supporters is about tradition, about rivalries built upon decades of enmity and shared history, about grudge matches and coveted prizes.

It can be hard to see where the Club World Cup fits into all that. It is certainly a big thing for Al Hilal and for a group of big-money signings eager to prove they can still perform on a big stage, and the enthusiasm of the South American teams and fans has surprised nobody who knows how much they have relished those clashes with European opposition in previous iterations of this tournaments for many years. But among the European teams there is an air of reservedness — a sense that, while it would be very nice to be crowned world champions, the players are not going to lose sleep if they don't (and not many of the fans back home are going to lose sleep to watch a match that kicks off at 9pm EDT).

It was interesting to hear Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva say on Monday that elimination at the hands of Al Hilal felt “a little bit like going out of the Champions League” — interesting that he only said a “little bit” but, on the other hand, “a little bit” is a lot more than some of the tournament's detractors might imagine.

Both in theory and in practice, though, the idea of a Club World Cup has plenty to recommend it. Not as much as Infantino suggests, but there is a clear value in watching the best teams from the Americas, Africa and Asia doing battle with some of the big beasts from European football. Victories for Brazilian clubs Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense over Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Inter, respectively, were thoroughly entertaining, as was a 4-4 draw between Porto and Al Ahly.

Infantino had already decided it was the greatest development in the game's history (“incredible“, “unprecedented”, “phenomenal“, “epic”) and was already thinking of expanding it to 48 teams in 2029. If a point even exists at which he would have questioned the validity of the exercise, this tournament has not come within a million miles of it.

But “a new era of club football”? A “big bang”? It all makes this sound like a sport that has been in darkness and is about to see the light, rather than one so all-conquering and all-consuming that the only risk to its future is that it might eat itself.

One of the things Infantino said on the eve of the tournament, addressing an audience in Miami, was that he wants the Club World Cup to lead to “globalised football, to make it truly, truly global, because when you scratch the surface (…), the elite is very concentrated in very few clubs, in very few countries, and we want to give hope and opportunities to Mamelodi Sundowns from South Africa, Ulsan from (South) Korea, Auckland City… .”

The elitism of football. Now you're talking, Gianni. But isn't the great contradiction here that this tournament, with a $1billion prize fund to be shared (far from equally) among the entrants, is reinforcing the elitism — “in very few clubs, in very countries” — that Infantino talks about? Does it not resemble the Champions League financial distribution model that took hold at UEFA during Infantino's years there, making the richest clubs richer year after year, widening inequalities both between leagues and within leagues, creating a landscape in which competitive balance has been eroded?

Palmeiras and Fluminense have earned almost $40m in prize money by reaching quarter-finals. Flamengo and Botafogo earned around two-thirds of that sum by reaching the round of 16. There could be a trickle-down effect through the transfer market, which benefits some other clubs in Brazil and South America, but essentially we are looking at a system — as has been seen in European football over the past two decades — that rewards success to such an enormous degree that it almost becomes self-perpetuating, distorting leagues in the process.

The same applies to the other confederations. Inter Miami have earned $25m by reaching the round of 16. Seattle Sounders earned $9.55m despite losing all three games. Nice for those two clubs, but does it really help MLS clubs compete with the rest of the world? Or does it just give these two clubs a big competitive advantage over the domestic rivals (and, in Inter Miami's case, having been granted a qualifying place by winning the MLS Supporters' Shield in 2024, a peculiarity that FIFA insists had nothing to do with wanting Lionel Messi at the tournament)?

Infantino talks about driving back against elitism, but the vast majority of that prize money will end up going to the biggest European clubs, who, having already been promised a greater market share of the $425m, represent five of the last eight and, due to the way the knockout bracket has taken shape, are guaranteed at least two semi-finalists and at least one finalist. Does it create a more level playing field if, for example, Real Madrid, PSG, Bayern Munich or Chelsea end up winning the $100m prize?

Even if Al Hilal were to win it, this is a club whose transfer spend over the past two seasons is north of $500m, more than anyone in world football except for PSG, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. Their spending, along with several other Saudi clubs, is largely financed by the kingdom's Public Investment Fund — which was also announced shortly before the tournament as an official partner of the Club World Cup, strengthening the ties between FIFA and Saudi Arabia, already confirmed as hosts of the 2034 World Cup.

As for the likely future expansion of the tournament, does anyone imagine that adding 16 clubs would mean a greater proportion of clubs from the North and Central American, African, Asian and Oceanian confederations? There has been no Barcelona at this tournament, no Liverpool, no Arsenal, no Manchester United, no Napoli, no Milan. For all the talk of empowering the other confederations, for all that the South American clubs in particular have brought to the party this time, it is pretty obvious where FIFA will see more potential for growth.

So does this Club World Cup really herald the dawn of a new era in global football? Or does it reinforce all the trends that have taken hold of the game in recent years — the strength of the “super clubs” in Europe, the rise of Saudi Arabian influence, the incessant demands on the players, the belief that the only way to improve football is by playing more and more games, more and bigger competitions? Because constant expansion equals more games, which equals more money. And because more money is the name of the game, no matter where that money comes from or what geopolitical strings it comes with.

What does Al Hilal's victory over Manchester City represent? That is harder to say, particularly given that Pep Guardiola's players looked desperate for a summer holiday. But it can hardly be called a shift in the balance of power between European and Asian football, given that City had thrashed last year's Asian Champions League winners Al Ain, of the United Arab Emirates, 6-0 eight days earlier.

The rise of football in Saudi Arabia is another matter entirely, driven by the investment that started in earnest with Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al Nassr two and a half years ago. Al Hilal, with players like Yassine Bounou, Kalidou Koulibaly, Joao Cancelo, Ruben Neves and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in their ranks and coached by Simone Inzaghi, looked like a serious team — something Milinkovic-Savic was particularly keen to spell out to those who had questioned their career choices.

It was a match that showcased the various merits of the tournament: a richly entertaining, end-to-end encounter, where a big crowd was captivated as an Asian team beat a European team for the first time in the history of the Club World Cup — a stat that Infantino would surely love to use, but it would require him to acknowledge that the competition existed previously.

But Infantino wants us to see this as Year Zero, a “big bang” that will shape the structure of the football universe for the years to come, “incredible”, “phenomenal”, “epic”. It hasn't felt like that. Have those fans who have swerved it missed anything unmissable, groundbreaking or indeed epic? Not really.

The football — some of it — has been enjoyable. Well, of course it has; it's football, after all.

But the game doesn't need a “big bang”. There have been more than enough smaller bangs down the years. For some of us, troubled by this constant drive for expansion — more, more, more — there is a persistent concern that the next bang will be the sound of a bubble bursting.

That hasn't happened here. The football world isn't coming to an end because FIFA has held a 32-club tournament in the U.S. at the height of summer.

But neither has it launched a glorious new era, with more thrilling action, more raw emotion — or indeed more people in the stands — than anyone has ever experienced before. More money? Yes, of course, but with it comes the nagging concern about where all of this is taking the game.

It's not always easy to predict winners of soccer games at major international tournaments, but the FIFA Club World Cup could be headed toward a Europe vs. Brazil final.

One bracket has two Brazilian sides competing in the July 4 quarterfinals - Fluminense and Palmeiras, against Al-Hilal (Saudi Arabia) and Chelsea (England)

The other side has four European teams competing in the July 5 match-ups - Paris Saint-Germain (France) vs. Bayern Munich (Germany), and Real Madrid (Spain) vs. Borussia Dortmund (Germany).

The winners will advance to the semifinals at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. on July 8 and 9, with the champion being crowned at the same venue on Sunday, July 13.

Of course, there can be other variations of a theme as the 32-team tournament enters its final 10 days.

In many international soccer competitions, some of the best games are in the quarterfinals. So, we might be in for a treat or two over the next few days.

Here is a quick look at the four quarterfinals:

This contest matches a pair of underdogs who were not given much of a chance of advancing far in the competition by Opta. Al-Hilal was given a 17.9 percent chance of reaching the quarters and 0.4 percent chance of winning it. Fluminense was at 15.8 percent of qualifying for the final eight teams and 0.1 percent of emerging as the winner.

Backed by an enthusiastic fan base, Fluminense (1-0=2, 5 points) finished second in Group F behind Borussia Dortmund (2-0-1, 7). The Brazil team started with a scoreless draw against the German side and followed that up with a 4-2 win over Ulsan HD (South Korea) and another 0-0 deadlock with Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa). In its 2-0 Round of 16 victory over Inter Milan (Italy), Fluminense scored early (37-year-old Argentine German Cano in the third minute) and late (24-year-old Brazilian Hercules) in the third minute of second-half stoppage time) in Charlotte, N.C. on June 30. Inter Milan lost to PSG in the UEFA Champions League final, 5-0, in May.

Two keys to the Brazilian side's success have a pair of fortysomething players - center back and team captain Thiago Silva, who will turn 41 in September, and veteran goalkeeper Fabio, who will be 45 that month. Fabio recorded four saves against Inter, for his fourth clean sheet of the tournament.

""The Europeans sign the best players in the world, but with attitude and dedication to the team, we managed to defend,"" Fluminense head coach Renato Gaucho told reporters.

“We are very proud of ourselves for the affection and joy we are bringing to our fans and, without a doubt, to Brazilian football. We are proving that we have commitment and attitude on the pitch. Off the pitch, we can't compete financially, but on the pitch it's 11 against 11. That's it.”

Al-Hilal has weathered the hot and humid conditions quite well. The Saudi Arabian team, which is bolstered by several big European stars, is unbeaten in four matches (2-0-2), having played Real Madrid to a 1-1 draw, Red Bull Salzburg to a scoreless tie and stunning Pachuca. 2-0, in Group H action. The squad finished second to Real Madrid.

The Saudis are coming off the upset of the tournament, a thrilling 4-3 triumph over English powerhouse Manchester City on June 30. It was considered one of the biggest wins in Middle Eastern soccer history. Marcos Leonardo, who struck for a brace, including the game-winner in the 112th minute, will face his countrymen. The 22-year-old forward, who is once played for Santos in Brazil, is tied for second place with a dozen other players in goals (three). Angel Di Maria, whose Benfica team, was eliminated in a 4-1 loss to Chelsea in the Round of 16, topping the charts with four goals.

It was an emotional moment for Leonardo.

“I've had a difficult time in the last two months. My mother spent 70 days in the ICU,” he said. “Today, she's fine, thank God. When I scored those two goals, I thought of her. She was able to watch the match.”

In the lone South American-European match-up of this round, the teams will tussle in the only quarterfinal encounter under the lights.

Palmeiras, one of the South American country's most storied clubs, has won Campeonato Brasileiro Série A 12 times (most recently in 2023) and Copa Libertadores on three occasions (most recently 2021). In this competition, Verdão (Big Green) started with two shutouts, a scoreless tie with Porto and a 2-0 win over Al Ahly before playing to a 2-2 deadlock with Inter Miami CF in the final Group A encounter.

In a battle of Brazilian sides in the Round of 16, Paulinho's 100th-minute goal, his second of the competition, lifted the squad to a 1-0 win over Botafogo in Philadelphia on June 28, its third clean sheet in four matches.

“Coach has been saying this since the start of the season, that we have a dream and dreaming costs nothing,"" Palmeiras defender Bruno Fuchs told the Associated Press. ""We follow that dream, one game after another. Always thinking about the present, about the next game. ... We're very happy, we're pleased to have qualified, and as I said, we have to keep dreaming.”

Chelsea's trophy case is pretty full with a host of domestic and international hardware. That includes six Premier League/First Division titles, eight FA Cup titles and the 2021 Club World Cup championship.

The Blues (2-1-0, 6) finished second to Flamengo (2-0-1, 7) in Group D, losing to the Brazilian side in its second match, 3-1, after blanking Los Angeles FC. 2-0. Yet, they shrugged off that defeat with two consecutive wins. They shut out Esperance de Tunis, 3-0, and then 10-man Benfica in the Round of 16, in extra time, 4-1, in a match that was delayed for two hours due to lightning in Charlotte, N.C. on July 28. Chelsea produced some lightning of its own in extra time as French international forward Christopher Nkunku (108th minute) scored the game-winner off a rebound. Portuguese international winger Pedro Neto added his team-best third of the competition (114th) and English midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall his first (117th) for some late insurance.

Prior to the tournament, Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca told his squad: ""We are not here for pre-season. It's a big, big tournament.""

So far, the team has taken those words to heart.

On paper, this is the marquee quarterfinal match, as the UEFA Champions League winners and French Ligue 1 champions take on the Bundesliga champs at the indoor venue.

The key to PSG's success is that it doesn't necessarily have one superstar, but it boasts stars at just about each position and even off the bench. Seven players have celebrated goal, with Portuguese international midfielder Joao Neves and Moroccan international defender Achraf Hakimi leading the way with two apiece.

When playing at its optimum, the French side is difficult to beat and forces its opposition to chase the game, as Inter Milan learned the hard way in the UCL final, a 5-0 triumph, in May. PSG continued that excellence in its 4-0 thrashing of Atletico Madrid. It hit a speed bump in a 1-0 loss to Botafogo but rebounded to finish atop Group B behind a 2-0 win over the Seattle Sounders. In the Round of 16 in Atlanta on June 29, PSG booked a quarterfinal berth behind a 4-0 thumping of Inter Miami CF, scoring three times in the waning minutes of the first half, as Neves bagged a brace.

“We [had] a very good game. Even when we were winning four-nil, we didn't stop,"" Neves said. ""We keep on playing our game and I think it was a positive day for us. It's the first time I scored two in one game, so I'm very happy but I'm happier for the win.”

Added head coach Luis Enrique: “I'm happy with all the players, with the mentality and the attitude. I think we need to improve, like always. ... But, I'm happy.”

Bayern Munich, which has won 34 German First Division titles, brings some impressive firepower as well, as it has not one, not two, but three players who have written their names on the scoresheet three times. The formidable threesome is England national team striker Harry Kane, German international midfielder Jamal Musiala and French national team midfielder Michael Olise.

The Bundesliga champions (2-1-0, 6) started out with a 10-0 victory over Auckland City, a team comprised of semi-pro players from New Zealand, before coming back down to earth in Group C. They then edged Boca Juniors, 2-1, before dropping a 1-0 decision to Benfica in their group finale. Die Bayern then went out and recorded a 4-2 triumph over Flamengo in the Round of 16 as Kane bagged a brace, scoring on either side of halftime at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on June 29.

“I know a lot of my game is judged on goals and I've been doing it throughout my career, but what maybe some of the German fans and some of the Bayern fans are realizing is that I'll do anything for the team to help us win,"" Kane said.

Real Madrid is one of the kings of domestic and global soccer, having won 36 La Liga titles (most recently in 2023-24) and five Club World Cups (most recently in 2022), among countless other championships. Los Blancos are a team to be reckoned with, and then some.

The Spanish powerhouse finished atop Group H with a 2-0-1 mark. It began with a 1-1 draw against Al-Hilal before registering three consecutive wins. Real then defeated Pachuca, 3-1, and then Red Bull Salzburg, 3-0. In the Round of 16 in Miami Gardens on July 1, Real edged Juventus, on Gonzalo Garcia's 54th-minute goal, his third of the competition.

Real enters the quarterfinals with a relatively fresh Kylian Mbappé, who missed every group match after he was hospitalized with an acute case of gastroenteritis. He made his tournament debut, replacing Garcia in the 68th minute against Juve. Mbappé, 26, a member of France's 2018 World Cup championship side, can be handful and a half to cover and stop when he is at the top of his game. He is a player to watch.

“I think that every single day he is getting better,” Real head coach Xabi Alonso said. “I think from now until the quarterfinals he's going to be even better. I talk to him every single day and ask him how he is feeling, and I think he is going to be way better for the quarterfinals.”

Borussia Dortmund might not enjoy the same storied history as its Bundesliga rivals, Bayern Munich, but still can be a difficult side to overcome.

Die Borussen (The Prussians) started off slowly, playing Fluminense to a 0-0 deadlock in Group F. Dortmund put together three one-goal victories, edging Mamelodi Sundowns, 5-4, and Ulsan HD, 1-0, and Monterrey, 2-1, in the Round of 16 in Atlanta on July 1. Guinea international striker Serhou Guirassy scored both goals in the latter win. The team has seen success without star center back Nico Schlotterbeck, who suffered a meniscus tear in April.

Dortmund will be remembered as the team that kept its reserves in an air-conditioned locker room for its game vs. Mamelodi Sundown in Cincinnati on June 21.

Also, U.S. international Gio Reyna, who could have helped his country in the Concacaf Gold Cup, was on the Dortmund roster, but has watched from the bench for most of the competition.

""Of course, against Real Madrid we'll need to raise the level even more. With their individual quality, they have an advantage,"" goalkeeper Gregor Kobel said on DAZN after the win over Monterrey. ""We'll need to compensate for that in other areas and have a really good day.""","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Palmeiras vs. Chelsea, Club World Cup: You choose the starting lineup

Chelsea have managed to find ourselves on the favorable side of the Club World Cup knockout rounds bracket, but better teams have already fallen by the wayside in this tournament so we should certainly be aware of the need to keep putting in the effort and playing well.  (If the defeat against Flamengo hadn't already served as a wake-up call.)

Next up in the quarterfinals are Palmeiras: a repeat of the 2021 Club World Cup final that we won 2-1 in extra-time.  They will certainly be motivated to not only exact revenge for that, but to continue the Brazilian league's great successes in this year's expanded field.

There are two three changes of note in the squad. Two additions, as Nicolas Jackson returns from his two-match suspension following his red card against Flamengo and new signing João Pedro is immediately available after his signing on Wednesday. He's already joined training though presumably isn't exactly fully match fit just yet.

The one big miss will be Moisés Caicedo, who has picked up a one-match suspension after getting his second yellow of the competition in the Round of 16.  This is why Dário Essugo has been signed, right?

What's more dangerous: playing soccer in the midday sun amid temperatures nearing 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or playing soccer when there's lightning eight miles away?

If you answered the latter, congratulations—you're now qualified to join the FIFA Club World Cup organizing committee.

Whether you think FIFA's approach to severe weather at the tournament is too strict or too blasé, this much is clear: If the concern is always player and fan safety, the disparity between concern over heat and concern over severe weather is nonsensical. And it's a discrepancy that needs to be solved before next year's World Cup.

We've already seen extreme hot weather cause very real hardship in recent tournaments on American soil during daytime kickoffs.

At last year's Copa América, an assistant referee collapsed during a game between Peru and Canada in Kansas City, Kansas, amid temperatures in the low 90s and relative humidity above 50%.

At the final in Miami Gardens, Florida, numerous fans were seen requiring water and medical treatment amid sweltering conditions and crowd control difficulties.

More generally, heat is far more likely to cause death than lightning strikes in the United States. If anything, the number of heat-related fatalities may be undercounted because they can present as cardiac or other health issues.

Perhaps most maddening, it's also an easily solvable problem. Major League Soccer has moved away almost entirely from daytime summer kickoffs. Of 510 league games this year, only seven were scheduled to begin before 6 p.m. local time between June and August, defined as meteorological summer. Three of those were in decidedly mild Seattle.

There is an abundance of indoor venues FIFA has more or less ignored. The good news: the 2026 World Cup will feature more of those, including five with full coverage and four with climate control. But several obviously feasible indoor sites were never considered, including three 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup host venues in Minneapolis; Arlington, Texas; and Glendale, Arizona.

At least the lightning policy is born out of concern for those involved—and, perhaps, the lawsuits they might file. But it's likely overly cautious, applying general guidance that was originally intended for situations lacking sophisticated surveillance.

The common standard at NCAA events is the 30/30 rule: if you hear thunder within 30 seconds of seeing a lightning flash, suspend play for 30 minutes. That's meant to avoid play once lightning is within six miles, and to be enforceable at smaller-scale events where there may be little staff beyond coaches and players.

That standard has been ratcheted up to eight miles at MLS games and the ongoing Club World Cup, and even 10 miles at outdoor NFL games. But with nighttime kickoffs, MLS games can usually wait out severe weather that diminishes as temperatures cool. NFL regular-season games are played entirely outside of meteorological summer.

FIFA should instead follow Major League Baseball's model, which includes no hard-and-fast policy on implementing lightning delays.

A 2023 analysis suggested as many as one in 14 MLB games are played with lightning within an “unsafe” distance, as defined by the eight-mile radius. That's more than 170 games a season.

But MLB also has generations of experience dealing with the issue and stadium personnel whose primary job is to monitor radar and weather conditions—accounting for a storm's relative severity, speed and direction in addition to proximity.

With this common-sense approach, modern MLB has avoided lightning-related injuries. If you search for lightning-related MLB deaths, you'll find the wild story of Ray Caldwell, who was struck down on the mound in 1919—before the advent of radio, let alone radar.

FIFA should follow that model, placing a qualified meteorologist at each venue empowered to make nuanced, real-time decisions rather than enforcing a rigid rule. We see this regularly in the medical field. The same doctor who advises the average person to rest for two weeks might give more nuanced guidance to a professional athlete who has a training staff to help manage risks while playing through an injury.

To be clear, FIFA should not sacrifice player and fan safety for the sake of convenience. But it must think about actual safety—not the appearance of it.

Forcing thousands of fans into crowded, sweltering concourses or unsheltered parking lots amid a remote chance of lightning can't possibly be the safest choice every single time. Nor can forcing athletes to exert themselves for two hours in the peak of the midday summer sun.

If you're a big soccer fan, you might not only want to book a place to catch a game (or three)—you might want to take advantage of Airbnb's new partnership with FIFA to offer specialty experiences that can bring fans up close and personal with their football heroes during the World Cup events.

Airbnb has announced these special experiences, available to be booked now:

A private training session with legendary American goalkeeper, Tim Howard

Watching a game in Philadelphia with former professional soccer player and commentator, Cobi Jones

An in-depth pre-match analysis session with former Swiss goalkeeper, Pascal Zuberbühler

(Airbnb)

“The World Cup brings the world together—and so do we,” said Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO in a statement. “Airbnb is proud to partner with FIFA to offer fans once-in-a-lifetime experiences during the tournaments—while welcoming hundreds of thousands of guests during the 2026 FIFA World Cup and driving meaningful economic impact for local communities.”

There are three World Cup competitions being held in North America—the first is FIFA Club World Cup in 2025, encompassing 32 teams and 12 venues. (The schedule can be found here.)

The second is the FIFA World Cup 2026, held next year, which is the World Cup everyone is familiar with. This will be held across 16 Host Cities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. (Here are all the host cities.)

And the third is the FIFA Women's World Cup 2027, to be held in Brazil. (Cities and venues are here.)

Airbnb hosts are set to rake it in if they're in one of the host cities through not only next year's FIFA World Cup, but its precursor, FIFA Club World Cup 2025, which kicked off June 14 in Miami.

The platform says its hosts can earn up to $210 million during the 2026 Games.

Short-term rentals in key host cities like Washington D.C., Seattle, and Atlanta are commanding higher nightly rates than they did this time last year, according to new data from AirDNA, a short-term rental data analytics firm.

On average, host cities are seeing a 10% year-over-year boost in the average daily rate (ADR) for their short-term rental listings.

According to consulting firm Deloitte, Airbnb stays during the FIFA World Cup '26 are expected to contribute $3.6 billion to Host City economies and create over 34,000 full-time jobs.

The home hosting company will also implement the Airbnb Host City Impact Program, a separate, targeted $5 million investment for the FIFA World Cup '26.

Here's an in-depth look at the three World Cup Airbnb Experiences on offer:

A private training session with FIFA legend Tim Howard will be held near East Rutherford, NJ (exact location revealed upon booking), where a series of Club games are set to be played in June at the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford.

“Football has the power to bring people together in unforgettable ways,” said former pro goalkeeper, Tim Howard in a statement. “[The Airbnb Experience] is a chance to share my love for the game and connect with fans in a hands-on, meaningful way.

“They won't just be watching from the stands, they'll step onto the pitch, get a behind-the-scenes look at pro training, and experience the sport from a whole new perspective.”

(Airbnb)

“I'm a goalkeeper who earned 121 caps for the U.S. Men's National Team and played more Premier League matches than any other American,” Howard writes in his Airbnb bio. “I gained global recognition for my record-breaking performance in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where I made 16 saves in a single match.”

In this experience, for ages 16 and up, guests will be coached by Howard through a series of drills designed personally by the player. They will practice penalty shots and a strike; then there will be a talk about the FIFA Club World Cup match, and a group photo.

Activity level is moderate and skill level is intermediate. Guests must be prescreened or risk cancellation.

Another experience is getting to watch a Club game with Howard's former U.S. Men's National Team team member, Cobi Jones—not on television, mind you, but in the stadium stands.

“Join me for an exclusive Airbnb Experience, where we'll spend Saturday, June 28th in Philadelphia watching an unforgettable knockout round match together pitchside!” Jones said on Instagram. “Who's ready for some world-class football?”

This experience will take place in Philadelphia, where a series of games are scheduled for Lincoln Financial Field. Guests also need to be prescreened by Airbnb.

This Hall of Famer, who played 12 seasons with the Los Angeles Galaxy, in the 1992 Olympic Games, and competed in 3 FIFA World Cups, will sit and chat with you all through a game.

“I'll share real-time commentary and context during the game,” he says on the app. “We'll discuss key moments and predict tactical adjustments. Get mid-game insights along with stories from my pro days.”

The experience will wrap up with a photo.

(Airbnb)

The third experience being offered is an in-depth pre-match analysis session hosted by a senior expert on FIFA's Technical Study Group, Pascal Zuberbühler, a Swiss National Team veteran who played in the 2006 World Cup.

This experience, the only one with a public price ($60 and up), will be held in Bay Harbor Islands, FL.

“Get an inside look at our cutting-edge analytics technology,” says the app of this experience. “Hear insights on how the experts will analyze today's game.”

The experience concludes with a Q&A session with Zuberbühler and “stories from within the analytics world.”

While these are the only three tailored experiences that can currently be booked, Airbnb tells Realtor.com® that more are on the way.

“Guests can now explore Airbnb Experiences led by locals that spotlight regional traditions, hidden gems, and the spirit of the Host Cities,” according to the platform.

“From immersive cultural activities to opportunities to engage with football legends and experts through Airbnb Originals, Airbnb will help fans create unforgettable memories that go far beyond the matches.”

Concacaf announced that players from Canada, United States and Mexico who receive a red card during the 2025 Gold Cup will serve a suspension during the team's next friendly match, as the disciplinary action does not carry over into the 2026 World Cup.

""Following extensive discussions with FIFA, Concacaf is now in a position to confirm that any 2025 Gold Cup pending suspension for Canada, Mexico, and the United States (co-hosts of next year's World Cup) must be served during their next international friendly match and not during the FIFA World Cup 2026,"" a spokesperson from Concacaf said to ESPN.

The question arose when Jacob Shaffelburg received a second yellow in Canada's 1-1 (5-6) Gold Cup quarterfinal match loss to Guatemala, being ejected from the pitch as the team faced elimination from the tournament. As a host of the upcoming World Cup, the Canadian men's national team will not compete in the upcoming Concacaf Qualifiers and therefore has no competitive matches until the 2026 tournament.

Given the lack of official tournaments in the schedule, Shaffelburg will be suspended for the team's upcoming friendly match but will remain available for selection under head coach Jesse Marsch for the Canadian men's national team 2026 World Cup opener.

The rule applies to all players of the 2026 World Cup host nation, under article 69.3 of FIFA's disciplinary code.

""If a representative team is hosting a final competition and is consequently not required to participate in qualifying matches to reach the final competition of this tournament and its next official match is in that final competition, any match suspension shall be carried over to the representative team's next friendly match,"" states FIFA.

Any player from Mexico or the United States who earns a red card in the semifinal game or final of the 2025 Gold Cup will be out for the next friendly match scheduled before the World Cup.

The USMNT beat Guatemala 2-1 in the Gold Cup's first semifinal on Wednesday, while Mexico faces Honduras later for a ticket to the final.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

Prices for FIFA's Club World Cup have been slashed for the quarter-finals of the competition, with some tickets as low as $11.15 (£8.17) available as standard admission entry.

According to Ticketmaster, FIFA's official ticket-selling portal for the competition, tickets for the quarter-final between Brazil's Fluminense and Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal were available on Wednesday for $11.15 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, while tickets for Premier League power Chelsea's clash against Brazilian club Palmeiras at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field could be bought for $22.30. This is cheaper than had been showing for any group stage game before the start of the competition.

The heavyweight clash between Bayern Munich and European champions Paris Saint-Germain at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta came in higher at $44.60 but still a substantial reduction of FIFA's original pricing for the tournament.

FIFA have applied a dynamic pricing model for Club World Cup tickets, which has sometimes worked in the interests of the consumer during this tournament as prices have tumbled down from FIFA's original expectations following their initial release in December. It's also possible that some fans may have bought tickets at higher prices only for them now to be available at a much lower rate.

Tickets in the lower bowl of the stadiums for the quarter-final were priced at nearly $500 in January, according to a now deleted post on Bayern Munich's website, but lower bowl tickets were available for $22 in the Chelsea-Palmeiras game and $27.90 in the Fluminense-Al Hilal match-up as of Thursday. The demand appears higher at the Bayern game against PSG, where the lower bowl is commanding over $140 in the resale market, but in the upper rings standard admission tickets can now be bought for $44, which is substantially below the original pricing.

Spanish giants Real Madrid have been the most popular team in the tournament, commanding over 60,000 in attendance at all four of their games, and their game against German team Borussia Dortmund at MetLife Stadium on Saturday is proving more resilient in demand and pricing. The cheapest standard admission seats remain $128 in the upper ring, while the lower bowl prices are showing at over $300 via verified resale.

FIFA have publicly lauded the expanded Club World Cup and claim that over two million supporters have attended matches over the 56 games of the competition so far. This represents an average of over 35,000 fans per game, but many games have seen tens of thousands of empty seats as FIFA plumped for NFL venues for many of the matches. The round of 16 attracted an average of 42,750 fans, as attendances dramatically varied. Less than 26,000 attended Chelsea vs. Benfica and Inter vs. Monterrey, but over 60,000 turned out for games such as Real Madrid vs. Juventus, PSG vs. Inter Miami and Bayern Munich vs. Flamengo. FIFA have been donating some for veterans and community soccer groups within cities over the past fortnight.

FIFA's hope had been that demand for the tournament would increase as it goes on, but the lower pricing for the quarter-finals may be owed partly to the small runway between the rounds in which to market to fans, while the cost for loyal club fans to traverse U.S. cities is also burdensome.

FIFA did not respond when approached for comment by The Athletic.

FIFA had concerns before the tournament that attendances may fall below the organization's expectations. The Athletic has previously reported how the organization has committed substantially more than $50m in marketing the competition, including a vast spend on social media promotion and influencers. Their attempts to fill Hard Rock Stadium for the Club World Cup opening match between Inter Miami and Egyptian team Al-Ahly involved offering students at an affiliated local college (with a network of 100,000 students) a single ticket for $20 — but with the promise of up to four complimentary tickets.

The cheapest entry for Inter Miami's game against Al-Ahly dropped to $55 the week before the tournament — half of what they were available for in May. Tickets were $230 for the cheapest seat in January and $349 after the draw in December.

Despite this, FIFA are holding the cheapest standard admission prices at $978 for the second of the semi-finals of the Club World Cup on Wednesday. Both semi-finals will take place at MetLife Stadium, but the second game will see the winner of Real Madrid's game against Dortmund take on the winner of PSG's match against Bayern. Verified resale tickets are available for $426. Standard admission for the first semi-final, between the winners of Chelsea vs. Palmeiras and Al-Hilal vs. Fluminense, has standard admission pricing of $473.90.

The cheapest standard admission ticket remaining for the final on July 13 remains $892. All these tickets remain subject to the dynamic market and may fluctuate.

The higher pricing of the games involving Europe's largest teams underlines that these teams still appear to hold the greatest demand in the U.S. market, with Real Madrid a particular draw.

This tournament has represented an attempt by FIFA to diversify interest in the global game. FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed “the new era of club football has truly started” after Al-Hilal knocked out English side Manchester City in the round of 16, but within the marketplace, it appears it will still take time to catch up.

Women are playing a critical role in making the 2026 World Cup happen.

Back in North America for the first time since 1994, the tournament will take place across the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer.

Through a series of interviews with NBC and Telemundo, we learned more about the women – behind the scenes and in front of the camera – who are making the World Cup special.

Telemundo Deportes host Vero Rodríguez shared the challenges of covering massive events like the FIFA World Cup and how she combats gender discrimination in sports journalism.

It's important for us to say (something) whenever there is violence, we have to raise our hand. We have to raise our voice and say 'This is not correct.'

Irene Klepp discussed how her early experiences as an NFL cheerleader and Disneyland employee helped prepare her for her current role as CFO of the LA Sports and Entertainment Commission — where she's now helping bring the World Cup to Los Angeles.

For the U.S., it's been more than 30 years since the last World Cup, so we really want to come back and create a formula for it to be successful.

An event as large as the FIFA World Cup requires significant federal support. U.S. Representative Kathy Castor, D-Florida, is the co-chair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus and has been instrumental in helping soccer grow in the U.S.

GOAL pays tribute to the beloved Liverpool and Portugal attacker, who has passed away at just 28 years of age

On Thursday morning, MARCA reported that Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota, along with his brother Andre Silva, had been killed in a car accident in Spain. The initial reaction was disbelief.

There'd clearly been some sort of horrible mix-up. Jota had only just got married, after all. He was young, healthy and happy. There was just no way this could be true.

But denial was soon forced to make way for devastation. The heart-breaking news of Jota's passing was confirmed by his club at 10:23am. A wife had lost her husband, three children had lost their father, and Liverpool had lost one of its most beloved adopted sons.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arsenal are targeting Rodrygo as an “upgrade” on Gabriel Martinelli and their chances of signing the Real Madrid winger are “increasing”.

Mikel Arteta is reportedly looking to bolster his attacking ranks during the summer transfer window. A new No.9 sits at the top of that priority list, with the Gunners continuing to be heavily linked with the likes of Sporting sensation Viktor Gyokeres and RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.

The Premier League heavyweights are also in the market for another creative talent to line up on the left flank. It has been suggested that Martinelli could be offloaded - amid links to Bayern Munich and teams in the Saudi Pro League - as Arsenal raise much-needed funds.

Some of that money could be invested in another Brazil international, with The Mirror reporting on how Rodrygo has become a “bystander” for Real Madrid at the FIFA Club World Cup - with the 24-year-old starting just one game and spending a lot of time on the bench.

New Blancos boss Xabi Alonso has implemented a new tactical system, with it his opinion that Rodrygo, Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham cannot line up in the same starting XI. That means somebody will become “the fall guy”.


The Mirror claims Rodrygo could be that man, which potentially plays into the hands of Arsenal. It is claimed that “the player's camp are becoming increasingly aware that his days in Madrid could be numbered”. 

It is reported that Rodrygo's representatives “don't want to jump too soon”, with Arsenal also willing to be patient, but amid talk of a £70 million ($96m) price tag being in place, it is acknowledged that the chances of another South American superstar moving to north London are “increasing”.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Portuguese was heavily linked with a move to the Saudi side ahead of the tournament, but the move didn't make sense for anyone concerned

Gianni Infantino made no secret of his desire to see Cristiano Ronaldo compete at the Club World Cup. The FIFA president even publicly revealed during an interview with CR7 super-fan IShowSpeed last month that some of the participants in the expanded tournament were considering signing the Portuguese forward.

Ronaldo subsequently admitted himself that he had received several offers to ""play in the Club World Cup"", but ultimately decided that he would be better served by re-signing with Al-Nassr before taking a much-needed break from the game.

""I think it didn't make sense,"" the 40-year-old told his club's official TV channel, ""because I prefer to have a good rest, a good preparation, because next season will be very long, with the World Cup at the end.""

Chelsea are reportedly lining up a deal for Borussia Dortmund wonderkid Soumaila Coulibaly, with a loan plan already in the works.

Talented youngster Coulibaly has been attracting interest from across Europe. As things stand, he has taken in just two competitive appearances for Dortmund. He made his debut in a Champions League clash with FC Copenhagen in November 2022.

Coulibaly's Bundesliga bow arrived in April 2023, with useful experience being picked up on loan since then. He has spent time with Royal Antwerp in Belgium and Ligue 1 outfit Brest - with important minutes, including Champions League outings, being picked up there.

It is now being claimed that the commanding centre-half - who spent time in Paris Saint-Germain's academy system before heading to Germany - could be readying himself for a Premier League switch.

Any deal would, however, see him return to his native France for the 2025-26 campaign. Sky Sports report that: “Chelsea have held talks about signing Borussia Dortmund's 21-year-old centre back Soumaila Coulibaly with a view to him playing for Strasbourg.”

Coulibaly has been capped by France at youth level through to the U20 set-up and is considered to have plenty of potential still to be unlocked in his game. Chelsea may be the ones to benefit from that on a long-term basis.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cam Norrie secured one of his biggest wins of the season at Wimbledon.

In the second round he took on world number 12 Frances Tiafoe, who was the favourite going into the contest.

The American was proving this to be true when he claimed the opening set against Cam Norrie but his opponent came back strongly.

The 29-year-old turned the tables and came back to complete a four-set victory and advance to the third round at the All-England Club.

Norrie was very impressive against Tiafoe and his performance caught the eye of Nick Kyrgios.

The 2022 Wimbledon runner-up is analysing the grass court Grand Slam for talkSPORT this season and he watched Norrie's 6-4, 4-6, 3-6, 5-7 win over Tiafoe, the American number three.

Nick Kyrgios was so pleased with what he saw from Norrie that he thinks the former semi-finalist at SW19 is capable of beating anyone other than defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and world number one Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon.

“One guy that really impressed me, I sat down and watched the last two sets was Cameron Norrie, taking it to [Frances] Tiafoe, the 12th seed, he played well,” Kyrgios said.

“Someone that's made the semi-finals here before, Norrie is going to fly under the radar and he's got a genuine chance to stir something up.

“He's just very experienced at Grand Slams. I think apart from Alcaraz or Sinner he can go up against anyone and upset them. I think when you get to that business end of the tournament, he could for sure.”

Norrie was delighted after reaching the third round at Wimbledon for the second successive year.

While Jack Draper has received plenty of attention as he goes in search of a first Wimbledon title, Norrie has somewhat slipped under the radar.

He defeated Draper at the All-England Club in the second round at Wimbledon a year ago, and in 2025 he defeated Tiafoe to reach round three and he fed off the energy from the Court 1 crowd, an arena he loves to play in.

“I was really happy when I saw the schedule,” he said in his on-court interview. “I saw I was on Court One and that's my favourite court. It's an amazing atmosphere and we both played [at] a really high level.

“I just stayed calm and played point-by-point. It was so nice to play Frances at such a big match. I served really well in that last game and you guys [the fans] were amazing in that last game, so thank you.

“It's so special. You forget so quickly. You just feel goosebumps. It's such a special court and such a special tournament.

“I just walked out and smiled as much as I could. And then you have to go out to battle. I'm really happy with my level today. It's so special. My parents are here, my sister is watching as well, and my girlfriend as well.”","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

This month, Jannik Sinner will get another chance to win a fourth major championship after he fell just short in June.

Sinner enters Wimbledon as ATP's No. 1-ranked men's singles player, though he's coming off of a loss to world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final. The 23-year-old Italian has won the Australian Open (twice) and the U.S. Open, but he's never won a French Open nor a Wimbledon final.

Sinner's best finish at Wimbledon was a semifinal appearance in 2023, when he lost to eventual runner-up Novak Djokovic in straight sets. Last year, Sinner lost to Daniil Medvedev in five sets in the quarterfinals.

Here's how to watch Sinner at this year's Wimbledon Championships:

Just under one month after losing to Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final, Sinner defeated fellow Italian Luca Nardi in straight sets in the first round of Wimbledon. ATP's No. 1-ranked player dropped just seven games en route to the victory and will play his second match on Thursday.

Australian Aleksandar Vukic is the No. 93-ranked men's singles player in the world, according to the latest ATP rankings. His win over Chun-Hsin Tseng in the first round moved Vukic to the second round of Wimbledon for the third year in a row, though he's never advanced to the third round.

Here's how Sinner has fared at Wimbledon thus far:

The ESPN family of networks will broadcast matches throughout the tournament. The Tennis Channel will also air a ""Wimbledon Primetime"" coverage show, which ""will typically run six hours and offer news, analysis, interviews, features and match-segment re-airs.""

Fans who prefer to stream can also use ESPN+ or Fubo, which offers a seven-day free trial.

 Novak Djokovic cruised to some long-awaited revenge on Thursday at Wimbledon, where the seven-time champion defeated home favourite Daniel Evans 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 to reach the third round. 

 Facing Evans for the first time since the Briton pulled off a stunning straight-sets victory at the 2021 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, Djokovic produced a classy all-around display to level the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The seven-time Wimbledon champion served precisely throughout, dropping just nine points on serve in the match, and dealt with Evans' trademark slice backhand with aplomb in his one-hour, 47-minute triumph. 

 “I think everyone knew that it was going to be a special atmosphere today on the court,” said Djokovic. “Obviously a Brit in Britain is never easy to face. ‘Tricky' is maybe not a great word, but he's a good quality player who possesses a lot of talent, a lot of touch. For the grass, where the ball stays very low with his slice, he can be causing a lot of trouble to you if you are not on top of your game, which I think I was, to be honest, from the very beginning.”

 By defeating Evans on Centre Court, Djokovic moved clear of Roger Federer for the most men's singles third-round appearances (19) at the grass major in the Open Era. The 38-year-old, a record 24-time Grand Slam champion is now 99-12 on the lawns of SW19. 

 “It means that I've been playing quite a long time,” joked Djokovic, when asked about his new third-round appearance record. “Nineteen times. That's a great stat. It's probably almost as much as Sinner and Alcaraz have as years in their life, but I still enjoy it. This sport has given me so much... Wimbledon remains the most special tournament in my heart, the one that I always dreamed of winning when I was a kid, so any history made here is obviously extra special for me."" 

 The man standing between Djokovic and his 100th Wimbledon main-draw win is a fellow Serbian, Miomir Kecmanovic. The No. 49 player in the PIF ATP Rankings earlier rallied past Jesper de Jong 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 

Put your hands up if you are through to R3 🙌@DjokerNole cruises past Evans 6-3 6-2 6-0.@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/33UXbX4rEq

 While Djokovic's win against Evans was ultimately very comfortable, the sixth seed had to be patient in the early stages. The Serbian let slip his first nine points of the match, but after finally converting one for a 5-3 lead in the opening set, he barely looked back. 

 Striking the ball cleanly off both wings, Djokovic repeatedly pulled the 35-year-old Evans around the court. The Briton attempted to move forward to the net whenever possible, but he was unable to maintain any sort of pressure on an opponent who produced some of his best tennis of 2025 so far. 

 “I was preparing well for the match, technically and tactically. I knew what I needed to do, and I executed perfectly,” reflected Djokovic. “Sometimes you have these kinds of days when everything goes your way and everything flows. It's good to be in the shoes and holding a racquet on a day like this, no question about it.” 

 Djokovic capped his win having outhit Evans by 46 winners to 19. He is now 23-8 for the 2025 season, a tally which includes his run to his 100th tour-level title in May in Geneva.

Alex de Minaur shook off some early rust on Thursday before powering to an impressive victory at Wimbledon, where he booked his spot in the third round.

The fired-up Australian overcame French qualifier Arthur Cazaux 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 in a vibrant two-hour, 48-minute battle on No. 2 Court. De Minaur, who reached last year's quarter-finals, produced a clinical response to dropping the first set and did not face a break point during the final three to prevail.

De Minaur arrived at Wimbledon off the back of a first-round defeat to Jiri Lehecka at Queen's Club, but he is showing few signs of a hangover this week. The No. 11 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will next face qualifier August Holmgren or Tomas Machac.

#NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik also made it safely through to the third round on Thursday with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(4) win against Marcos Giron to equal his best run at a Grand Slam tournament.

With his two-hour, 51-minute victory, the 19-year-old is the youngest Czech man to advance to the third round at Wimbledon since Tomas Berdych in 2005. He will next face Flavio Cobolli, who eased past British wild card Jack Pinnington Jones 6-1, 7-6(8), 6-2.

Mensik has enjoyed a standout start to the 2025 season, highlighted by lifting his maiden trophy at the ATP Masters 1000 in Miami, where he stunned idol Novak Djokovic in the final.



Jan-Lennard Struff overcame a nervy night's sleep to defeat 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime 3-6, 7-6(9), 6-3, 6-4 and book a meeting with two-time champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Struff had fought back on Wednesday night to win the second set before their second-round clash was suspended due to darkness. Yet the German returned with vengeance to level his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Auger-Aliassime at 3-3.

Jaume Munar will be able to sleep easy on Thursday night after narrowly avoiding a potential disaster at Wimbledon, where he ultimately reached the third round for the first time in his career.

Leading Fabian Marozsan by two sets and a break, Munar had one foot in the locker room, but the finish line proved elusive. The Spaniard was forced to dig deep, needing 11 match points to seal a 6-2, 6-3, 7-6(9) victory after a rollercoaster tie-break.

“It was unbelievable the way I had to manage the end of the match,” Munar told ATPTour.com. “I think I was playing quite good tennis and was on top for 90 per cent of the match, then I started to struggle a little bit. But it is what it is, when you're fighting for these things and trying to make steps forward, it's always a challenge. I was expecting difficult moments, but I'm happy to have a chance.”



Munar let slip two consecutive match points on return at 5/2 in the third set, then a further three in the ensuing game on his serve. Though he wasn't undone by his own work: Marozsan swung freely and took it to the Spaniard, who remained undeterred and responded well.

In a dramatic tie-break to end their second-round clash, Munar squandered four more match points before having to fend off a set point on his serve, doing so with an unreturned first delivery out wide at 7/8 before eventually closing out victory after two hours, 17 minutes.

“I was trying to be calm and think point by point, it's never easy, but I had the mentality that even if I lose the third set, I was going to have a chance,” Munar said. “I was feeling that I was the better player on court today.”

With his victory, Munar is up to a career-high No. 50 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is now at 17 tour-level wins in 2025, just two off his year-best 19 recorded in 2022. Into the third round at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time at Wimbledon, Munar will next face British No. 1 Jack Draper or former champion Marin Cilic.

Munar faced a similar situation two weeks ago at Queen's Club, where he converted his eighth set point to level his clash with Carlos Alcaraz but fell in the third.

Two-time champion plays at SW19 one last time

There are two sides to Petra Kvitova the tennis player, and they're both loved and feared equally.

One is the ruthless, merciless, take-no-prisoners Kvitova, who demolishes her opponents by unleashing a barrage of winners, taking the racquet completely out of their hands.

When she played that way, there was nothing her opponents could do but applaud her.

Just ask Maria Sharapova and Eugenie Bouchard, the two players she defeated in the finals at Wimbledon back in 2011 and 2014.

Belinda Bencic once famously coined the hash-tag ‘#petrasvictims' on social media after she was handed a heavy beating by the Czech lefty at the 2019 Australian Open.

A round later in Melbourne, Amanda Anisimova suffered a similar fate before posting on social media: “I got a tennis lesson today, but at least it was from one of the best in the world hey.”

Bencic commented on the post: “Welcome to the #petrasvictims club.”

Everyone knew, if Kvitova is on, they very likely had no chance against her.

The other side of Kvitova was the one that inspired the term ‘P3tra', as a nod to the many times she took the scenic route to victory, stretching herself to three sets instead of closing in two. Those were battles Kvitova mostly fought against herself. And it was always a wonder how she overcame her demons to get some of those wins.

The 35-year-old played her final Wimbledon this week, and will officially hang up her racquet at this summer's US Open.

As she gets set to bid farewell to tennis, Kvitova reflected on what it was like navigating a career that oscillated between two such distinct personas.

“It was always up and downs in my career,” the former world No.2 told reporters at the All England Club.

“I could play amazing tennis and I could play terrible. But I was always fighting. So, let's put it this way. Even if you don't see it, I always fight in myself. Maybe sometimes with myself. 

But that's what I've been taught from being a kid to fight until the last point. So even when I played amazing or very bad, I was always fighting.”

So which side does she relate to more?

“It's a really tough question. Because both sides are me,” she said with a smile.

A two-time Grand Slam champion, Olympic bronze medallist, six-time Billie Jean King Cup winner, and WTA Finals champion – Kvitova built a resume that makes her a shoo-in for a place in the Hall of Fame in five years' time when she becomes eligible for enshrinement.

But perhaps what she'll be remembered for the most is how universally liked she was by everyone on tour, in the locker room and beyond.

After her last match at Wimbledon – a defeat to 10th-seeded Emma Navarro on Tuesday – many of her peers were moved to tears watching her give one final speech on No.1 Court.

“I saw it in the locker room before my match. I was actually tearing up, had goosebumps when she was speaking, so it was a super special moment,” Bencic told rolandgarros.com.

“My favourite Petra moment, she probably doesn't remember, but that's probably the first time I played her in Tokyo, 2013, I think.

“I got a wild card and then won a match against Daria Saville, and then was able to play Petra, which, of course, was huge for me. I was 16, 17, and was able to play her. Now we are actually really good friends, fellow mums.

“She's really one of my closest friends now, so it's super nice. She was my idol, and now we're just very close.”

Maria Sakkari made sure to give Kvitova a hug when she saw her on Tuesday and the Greek heaped praise on the retiring Czech.

“She was quite a unique player. First of all, she's an amazing person. That, for me, will always stay as the number one thing about her,” said Sakkari.

“Then, okay, her tennis was so unique. Because when she was on, it was good luck. You had no chance. I think her career was incredible. She's not done yet, obviously. She has a few more tournaments to play. But I think she's in a very good place.

“She has her family. She's achieved incredible things. She looks happy. She looks like it was probably the right time to do it. She won't have doubts doing it.

“I just saw her now, coming here. I gave her a hug and I said, I'm so proud that I could be a very small part of your journey. For me, she will always stay as one of the players that one of the most liked in the locker room, by far. Always smiling. Probably one of the most talented as well, in the latest years.”

Paula Badosa said Kvitova was one of her favourite players growing up, Madison Keys said she was one of her favourite players to watch, while Ons Jabeur hailed her mental strength, especially in the manner she recovered from a knife attack at home and returned to tennis before fully regaining sensation in her wounded hand.

“She's really an amazing player and she has a lot of courage,” said Jabeur.

“Mentally, she's really strong. What happened to her at her apartment and then coming back, that's really unbelievable. I have a lot of respect for Petra and I'm glad that I have shared the court with her.”

Kvitova is fully at peace with her decision to walk away from tennis, despite the fact that her return from maternity leave was short-lived.

She got to play one last match in front of the Wimbledon crowd and takes with her over 15 years' worth of memories from her happiest hunting ground.

Asked how she hopes she'll be remembered, Kvitova said: “I hope they're going to remember me as a normal girl from Czech Republic, growing up in a small city with my parents with no money. So, I always will be very humble.

“I always try to play fair play as well. So, I hope that in this case they will remember me like a basically normal human being.”

A normal human being with an extraordinary heart. We'll be saying this for the next few weeks until her final goodbye: Thank you, Petra!","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland Garros'}","tennis"

The Antalics family of Reisterstown spent about a week in Paris last month, doing all the usual Parisian things like sightseeing and viewing art. As much as they enjoyed those experiences, the focus of their trip was not rococo, but Coco.

“This was our first international trip for a tennis player,” said mom Mia Antalics, whose young daughters are huge fans of tennis player Coco Gauff and had the unforgettable experience of watching the No. 2 player in the world win the French Open.

The whole trip was centered around the Roland Garros Stadium where the matches were held. “This was tennis first and then Paris,” she said.

Gauff lost in the opening round of Wimbledon on Tuesday, but the Antalics are still reflecting on getting to witness the American player's victory against Belarus' Aryna Sabalenka. Yes, the games themselves were fun because of the sport itself, but also because of the opportunity Gauff's success represents.

The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.

“It felt really surreal,” Averlin Antalics said. “It was like living in a dream. She's a hard worker and she's dedicated. She doesn't give up.”

Averlin, 14, and Arden, 11, have played tennis since they were about 5 years old. “It's something we play as a family,” their mother said. “I wanted them to have a foundation to carry through their whole life.”

Mia, who is Black, said she wanted her girls to be inspired by “seeing a young brown girl.” 

“She inspires my girls to be better players, but it's also how she is off the court,” she said. ”I love supporting the idea of having my daughters have someone to look up to. They're so passioned about the sport, and I want to facilitate in that passion.”

That passion has been solidified by the rare joy of seeing a Grand Slam match in person, surrounded by a very loud crowd. “A lot of people were rooting for Coco,” Arden said.

The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.

I am far, far older than the Antalics girls. If you have always grown up seeing people who look like you inhabit every sport and field you dreamed of, you may not understand how momentous it is when that happens. I remember the resistance that the Williams sisters met when they appeared on the tennis scene with bright eyes and beaded hair.

As messed up as the current climate is, it's hopeful to know that Averlin and Arden have grown up in a world where it's not odd to see someone who looks like them killing it on the court. “There has always been someone in the mix,” Mia said. “The door has been open. There's so much opportunity and inspiration for the next generation to say, ‘I can do it, too.'”

The way Gauff handles herself off the court is also admirable. Right after she won the French Open, there was a brief bit of drama when Sabalenka said publicly that Gauff didn't beat her as much as Sabalenka played poorly. (She has since apologized and the two have danced it out.) 

Gauff's classy response to the incident was an excellent example to set, Mia said. “She didn't lessen or lower herself. She's said that she wants to behave in a manner that her brothers can be proud of her. You win some, you lose some. The key is to get out there and to have fun.” 

Gauff, now 21, has been famous since she was a teenager and knows the pedestal she's put on, Mia said. ”She's inspired young girls and boys of any color who can say ‘I wanna be like her.'”

The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.

The Antalics family, which includes dad Christian, saw Gauff play in person once before, when she won 2023's Mubadala Citi DC Open. But the French Open was by far the biggest deal. 

Their next goal is to see Gauff play at the U.S. Open. In the meantime, they'll be watching from home — through both the wins and losses — still feeling motivated by this young, tenacious woman.

“To be there in a moment of history is so much different than watching it on TV,” Mia said. “Just like Coco saw Serena [Williams] play and said, ‘I want to be great like that,' this is part of paying it forward, like a sisterhood of tennis with women of color who want to be great, so you can be greater.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Nick Kyrgios reveals when he plans to return to tennis after missing Wimbledon and the French Open","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/nick-kyrgios-reveals-when-he-plans-to-return-to-tennis-after-missing-wimbledon-and-the-french-open/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Nick Kyrgios had hoped to play Wimbledon in 2025, but was forced to withdraw due to injury.

The 30-year-old picked up an injury before the grass-court season, which led to Kyrgios withdrawing from Wimbledon.

Kyrgios had already skipped the French Open in June as fans await the Aussie's return to Grand Slam action.

Working as a pundit for TalkSport at Wimbledon this year, the 2022 finalist continues to be involved with tennis.

It may not be too long until we see him back on the court, however, as Kyrgios now reveals when he plans to return.

Speaking to Former doubles number one Jamie Murray on ‘Wimbledon Unfiltered with Nick Kyrgios', the world number 637 updated fans on his injury status.

“Well, I was supposed to be back for Wimbledon, but I had a bit of a knee niggle three weeks ago, so just trying to get back for the US swing,” said Kyrgios.

“I think we're both in the twilight of our careers, but look, I really want to come back, I'm hitting the ball great.

“Had a bit of a session today, feeling good.”

The US swing Kyrgios is referring to begins in Washington later this month and finishes at Flushing Meadows in September.

Kyrgios has enjoyed real success at those tournaments over the years, winning the Washington Open on two occasions and reaching the Cincinnati Open final in 2017.

If he can recover from injury in time, what better place to return than Washington, a tournament Kyrgios has won twice before.

Regardless of where he returns, Kyrgios will no doubt hope to start racking up the wins on the ATP Tour before too long.

Playing his first competitive match in over a year, Kyrgios returned to tennis at the Brisbane International, where he lost in three tight sets to big-server Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

Another defeat followed in Melbourne, when Kyrgios lost to Jacob Fearnley 6-7, 3-6, 6-7.

Beginning his year with an 0-3 run, Kyrgios retired down 6-7, 0-3, to Botic van de Zandschulp at Indian Wells.

It was at his next tournament that Kyrgios finally returned to winning ways, when he took to the court for his opening match at the Miami Open.

After dropping the first set 3-6, Kyrgios fought back to beat Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to book his place in round two.

Having secured his first win in 895 days, Kyrgios was unable to back it up in the second round, as he fell to Karen Khachanov 6-7, 0-6.

He hasn't played another match on tour since, as Kyrgios currently has a 1-4 record in 2025.

With just 50 ATP points to his name, Kyrgios is currently ranked 637th in the world, a long way from his career-high ranking of 13th.

Only time will tell if Kyrgios can shoot back up the rankings when he returns later this year, but it will most certainly be worth tuning in for.

Kyrgios may well return at the Washington Open ATP 500 event, which is scheduled to begin on Monday, July 21.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Montreal


			By The Canadian Press		

Posted July 3, 2025 12:26 pm.

Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff headline a star-studded women's field for the National Bank Open in Montreal, Tennis Canada announced Thursday.

The world No. 1 and No. 2 are scheduled to take centre stage at IGA Stadium in a field that's also set to include two-time defending champion Jessica Pegula.

The WTA's top 68 competitors are poised to compete as part of a 96-player main draw — the largest in the event's history — as the annual showcase enters its new 12-day format.

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam champion, has posted a 44-8 record so far in 2025, including victories in Miami and Madrid, along with an appearance in the French Open final.

Gauff, who defeated Sabalenka at Roland-Garros for her second Grand Slam win, owns a 31-10 record this season.

There will be at least three Canadians in the main draw, with Leylah Fernandez (No. 38) of Laval, Que., set to make her sixth NBO appearance. Toronto's Victoria Mboko, who was eliminated in the second round at Wimbledon on Thursday, and Bianca Andreescu of Mississauga, Ont., have both been awarded wild-card berths.

Pegula became the first woman to capture back-to-back NBO titles since Martina Hingis in 2000 when she triumphed in Toronto last summer. The world No. 3 has added titles in Charleston, Austin and Bad Homburg to her resume this season, marking the first time she's won three tournaments in a single campaign.

Iga Swiatek (No. 4), Jasmine Paolini (No. 5), Qinwen Zheng (No. 6), Mirra Andreeva (No. 7), Madison Keys (No. 8), Paula Badosa (No. 9), and Emma Navarro (No. 10) are also scheduled to take part in the Canadian event.

Other notable names include past Canadian champions Elina Svitolina (No. 13) and Belinda Bencic (No. 35), along with three Wimbledon winners — Barbora Krejcikova (No. 16), Marketa Vondrousova (No. 73) and Elena Rybakina (No. 11).

The first NBO under the new format begins with qualifying July 26. Main-draw play runs July 27 through Aug. 7. The top 32 seeds will receive first-round byes and will begin play July 29 or July 30.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","'Well I'm shocked'","https://talksport.com/tennis/3343925/arthur-fery-wimbledon-delayed/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 10:27:41 GMT","





Arthur Fery will hope a Wimbledon court supervisor's 'surprising' decision can rescue him from the jaws of defeat.

The British star trailed 6-4, 6-3 in his second round match against Luciano Dardieri when he received what may prove to be divine intervention.

As the pair walked back to their chairs at the end of the second set, the match supervisor strolled onto Court 2 and made the executive decision to postpone the contest due to bad light, with the match to resume on Thursday afternoon.

The call was made at 8:45pm, although play had continued through to 9:15pm on previous evenings in SW19.

BBC commentary duo Matt Chilton and Dom Inglot were left baffled by the supervisor's decision to bring an end to Wednesday's proceedings earlier than usual.

""There is a collective groan around the ground now,"" Chilton said.

""That is a little surprising that at quarter-to-nine, play is suspended.""

Inglot replied: ""Well I am shocked. If I was Darderi I would be carrying on as long as I possibly could.

""He is playing some unbelievable tennis right now.

""You never know, he could come back tomorrow and not be feeling it like he is right now.""

Chilton added: ""They have been going on till much later than this.

""However, the decision has been made and these two will return to this court tomorrow.""

Fery, 22, reached the second round at Wimbledon thanks to a stunning upset over 20th seed Alexei Popyrin.

It marked the first time Fery won a match at a grand slam.

But the world No. 481 will have it all to do against Darderi when their game resumes.

Fery and Darderi are not the only stars to have had their match postponed until the following day at this year's Wimbledon.

American star Taylor Fritz's gruelling first round encounter against powerful Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard had to be pushed to the next day, but not because of bad light.

Instead, it was due to the 11pm curfew in place.

Fritz and Mpetshi Perricard had played an energy-sapping four sets - three of which were tiebreaks - under the closed roof on Centre Court when the umpire called an end to proceedings for the night as the 11pm deadline loomed.

It was not a decision Fritz wanted as he was keen to continue playing through to 11pm, but Mpetshi Perricard was not.

""They told us before the match, 'Hey, are you good to play 'til 11? We're going to stop at 11,' "" Fritz said.

""When I'm looking at the clock at the end of the fourth set, I'm thinking, 'Oh, it's 10, there's no way they're going to stop us. We're forsure playing this fifth set.'

""The idea of stopping wasn't even in my mind. I was fully tunnel- visioned on this match is finishing tonight.

""What happened was, I get it -- we both have to agree. If we don't, then the referee makes a decision. What I didn't understand, the referee, after he said what his decision was, he kept asking me. I think he just wanted me to, like, agree with him.

""I said, 'I don't know why you keep asking me, because I want to play. Stop asking me, because you already said we're not playing.' ""

Fritz and Mpetshi Perricard returned the following day to finish off the contest 6-7 (6-8), 6-7 (8-10), 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.

Things didn't get much easier for the American in the second round as he prevailed in another taxing five-set encounter, this time against Canada's Gabriel Diallo.

A record number of British singles tennis players advanced past day one of this year's Wimbledon.

Now four days into the Grand Slam tournament, how is the home-grown talent faring in SW19?

Jack Draper

Leading the charge for a British Grand Slam champion this year is Jack Draper.

The British men's No 1 - who entered Wimbledon ranked No 4 in the world - cruised into the second round after seeing off Argentina's Sebastian Baez.

However, he faces a tougher test against former US Open winner Marin Cilic next on Court One on Thursday.

Draper is officially in the midst of a breakout after winning three titles over the last year, among those being the Masters 1000 event at Indian Wells in March.

But speaking ahead of his second-round Wimbledon match, the 23-year-old said he isn't particularly feeling the pressure just yet.

He said: ""I obviously was aware of the build up and all that sort of stuff, but I think my preparation has been really good and I feel confident, so I'm not thinking too much about that.""

Cameron Norrie

Cameron Norrie has already booked his place in the third round of Wimbledon after knocking out 12th seed Frances Tiafoe.

The former British number one came close to dropping out of the top 100 earlier this season but entered SW19 ranked 61 in the world.

And not being in the top 10 has meant Norrie is enjoying tennis ""more than ever"".

He said: ""I think it's a good thing to go through being injured, not winning, then having resilience to back yourself. I'm enjoying my tennis more than ever. It was really nice coming up to get into the top 10 but it's just tough, really tough, to stay there.""

Norrie plays Mattia Bellucci in the third round on Friday.

Emma Raducanu

The current British women's No 1 has started her Wimbledon campaign strong, defeating former champion Marketa Vondrousova to reach the third round.

Emma Raducanu was left grinning after the 6-3 6-3 win that has set up what is due to be a blockbuster third-round clash with world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Friday.

Speaking ahead of the third round, the 22-year-old said: ""I'm just so happy I get to play another match here. [Sabalenka] is number one in the world, so dominant, has won literally everything.

""I'm just so happy how I performed. I guess there's no pressure at all on me.""

Sonay Kartal

Sonay Kartal appears to be in with a good chance of making the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time as she takes on qualifier Diane Parry next at Wimbledon.

The 23-year-old followed up her defeat of 20th seed Jelena Ostapenko by racing to a 6-2 6-2 win over Bulgarian Viktoriya Tomova to make it to the last 32.

Reflecting on her performance over Tomova, the British hopeful said she was pleased with her play.

She said: ""I don't think I did much wrong at all. I was seeing it really well. I felt confident. I feel like I was playing really aggressive tennis.""

Dan Evans

Home-grown hopeful Dan Evans was knocked out of this year's tournament by seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.

The pair battled it out on Centre Court on Thursday, with the Serb winning in straight sets.

""I knew it was going to be a special atmosphere on the court today, a Brit in Britain is never easy to face,"" Djokovic said after the match.

""He's a good quality player that possesses a lot of talent.""

Evans had won their only previous career meeting, in Monte Carlo four years ago.

He had arrived at this year's Wimbledon as a wild card, ranking No 154 in the world.

Katie Boulter

Despite expertly navigating her way into the second round of Wimbledon, Katie Boulter suffered defeat against Argentina's Solana Sierra.

The loss means she has still never progressed beyond the third round at any of the sport's four major tournaments. It is also the second time in a row she has not made it beyond the second round at Wimbledon

""Of course it hurts, it's a really tough pill to swallow - it always is here,"" said Boulter, who may yet end the tournament back at British number one.

Arthur Fery

British wild card Arthur Fery was unable to mount a comeback as his second-round tie with Luciano Darderi, which started on Wednesday, resumed on Thursday on Court Two with the Italian two sets up.

Darderi took the third set to secure a 6-4 6-3 6-3 victory in two hours and 21 minutes.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","tennis"

It's been an entertaining start to Wimbledon, with plenty of big names falling in the early rounds of the men's and women's draws. The likes of Coco Gauff, Qinwen Zheng and Daniil Medvedev all lost their opening matches, leaving the competition wide open. There was no such misfortune for Emma Raducanu, who did brilliantly to beat Marketa Vondrousova in the second round.

Raducanu will face a tough test against Aryna Sabalenka in round three, while Jack Draper will be hoping to beat Marin Cilic later today. Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, will go up against Dan Evans with high hopes of upsetting the British crowd on Centre Court. The other big-name players in action on day four include Iga Swiatek, Jannik Sinner and Mirra Andreeva.

Tommy Paul called the physio and received a mid-game medical time-out in the second set of his match against Sebastian Ofner when he appeared to pull his foot while jumping for an overhead.

He had his foot strapped up at 4-4. But he's since dropped the second and third set after taking the opener.

Ofner leads the 13th seed 1-6 7-5 6-4.

There are plenty of top players in trouble right now. But five-time Major winner Iga Swiatek has made sure she won't fall victim to an upset on Thursday.

The eighth seed came back from a set down to beat Caty McNally 5-7 6-2 6-1 on Centre Court.

No. 4 seed Jack Draper is on the cusp of going out over on Court 1.

And another top player is at risk. 28th seed Sofia Kenin lost the first set of her second-round match 6-1 to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro - the dangerous Spaniard who is known for causing upsets at Majors.

Jack Draper is now two sets down over on Court 1.

Cameron Norrie is the only British man into round three at Wimbledon and at this rate, the world No.4 Draper won't be joining him.

Maric Cilic took the first set 6-4 and he takes this second one 6-3.

Draper needs a massive, massive effort to get back into this. Croatian veteran Cilic, 36, is on fire.



British No. 1 Jack Draper is in some serious trouble over on Court 1.

The fourth seed trails Marin Cilic by a set and a break. Cilic, a former world No. 3, won the US Open in 2014 and made the final here three years later.

But he's since slipped down the rankings after battling injuries on-and-off for years.

There's another medical time-out on Court 3, this time for Tommy Paul. The physio is treating his foot after he appeared to tweak something in the middle of a game.

It's 4-4 30-15 on the American's serve but he's now having his left foot bandaged up after landing awkwardly on it when he jumped for an overhead.



She's had to do it in three sets again, but defending champion an 17th seed Barbora Krejcikova is through to the third round after beating Caroline Dolehide 6-4 3-6 6-2.

She meets world No. 10 Emma Navarro for a spot in the second week.

The seeds just keep on falling here at Wimbledon - and we could see another bow out.

Eighth seed and five-time Major winner Iga Swiatek has lost the first set of her match against Caty McNally 7-5 on Centre Court. The former world No. 1 led by a break before falling away.

Sebastian Ofner has called the physio after losing the first set 6-1 to Tommy Paul over on Court 3 and he's now having a medical time out to have his right wrist strapped up.



Alex de Minaur has admitted it was tough to reset ahead of his own match after watching his fiance, British No. 2 Katie Boulter, suffer a crushing defeat on Wednesday.

“It's not ideal. It's not nice. I felt for Katie yesterday, and I've been in those positions myself. It's not easy by any means to, yeah, forget about it. It's something that kind of stays with you,” the Aussie said after beating Arthur Cazaux 4-6 6-2 6-4 6-0.

“It definitely does have a little bit of impact on yourself, and you've got to do your best to try and have a mental reset and kind of shift your focus towards yourself and realising that you do have a match the following day that you've got to prepare for, it's not going to be an easy one, it's going to be a battle.”

Grigor Dimitrov booked his spot in the third round of Wimbledon with a 7-5 4-6 7-5 7-5 victory over Corentin Moutet over on Court 3.

It's been a positive start to Wimbledon for former semi-finalist Dimitrov, who has been forced to retire injured from the last four Grand Slam tournaments. He awaits the winner of Sebastian Ofner vs Tommy Paul.



Elena Rybakina admitted that it was ""quite unexpected"" that so many top seeds have fallen around her at Wimbledon.

Aryna Sabalenka, who faces Emma Raducanu, is the only player in the top five remaining after exits for Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Qinwen Zheng.

But Rybakina defeated Maria Sakkari in straight sets to reach the third round at SW19 for the fifth year in a row.

2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina breezes past Maria Sakkari and into round three.

She wins 6-3, 6-1 on Court One and will face the winner of Clara Tauson vs Anna Kalinskaya.

Next up on this court, Jack Draper! He faces Marin Cilic.

The provisional order of play (which could still change) has been announced for tomorrow.

Emma Raducanu will be the final match on Centre Court when she takes on world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in the third round.

Centre Court (1.30pm) 

Fritz vs Davidovich Fokina

Struff vs Alcaraz

Sabalenka vs Raducanu

No 1 Court (1pm) 

Parry vs Kartal

Bellucci vs Norrie

Mertens vs Svitolina

No 2 (11am) 

Pavlyuchenkova vs Osaka

Siegmund vs Keys

Jarry vs Fonseca

Novak Djokovic was a picture of class after booking his spot in the third round with a win over Dan Evans, thanking the Centre Court crowd for a ""special atmosphere"".

He added: ""A Brit in Britain is never easy to face. Dan Evans can be causing a lot of trouble if you are not on your game which I think I was from the beginning to be honest.

""I knew exactly what I needed to do and I executed it perfectly. Sometimes you have these kinds of days where everything goes your way.""

The win was the Serb's 99th at Wimbledon, where he is a seven-time champion, and he added: ""It means that I have been playing for quite a long time!

""I still enjoy and this sport has given me so much. Wimbledon still stays the most special tournament in my heart and the one that I always dreamed of winning when I was a kid.

""Any history made here is very special for me.""



Dan Evans' Wimbledon run is over - he's suffered a 6-3 6-2 6-0 defeat to seven-time champion Novak Djokovic on Centre Court.

It was still a good week for Evans, who won his first main-draw singles match here since 2021. The former world No. 21 can take confidence from his impressive grass season, which saw him upset top-20 players Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul in Queen's and Eastbourne.

Carlos Alcaraz has become the latest tennis star to pay tribute after Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva passed away in a road traffic accident in Spain.

""Rest in peace Diogo and Andre. My sincere condolences to your loved ones,"" he wrote on Instagram.

It comes after Wimbledon bosses confirmed players would be allowed to wear a black ribbon to pay tribute to Jota.

British wildcard Arthur Fery's Wimbledon campaign has come to an end in the second round. He earned his first-ever tour-level win over 20th seed Alexei Popyrin in round one, causing a huge upset.

He trailed Italy's Luciano Darderi by two sets to love on Wednesday night when their match was suspended. And Darderi returned on Thursday to complete a 6-4 6-3 6-3 victory.

It's been a crazy start to Wimbledon for the top players, as 23 seeds went out across the men's and women's singles draws in the first round, and more continue to fall as the tournament progresses.

Reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz has benefited massively - it's now guaranteed that he could only face one seeded player until at least the semi-final.

The world No. 2 meets Jan-Lennard Struff in the third round.

No. 14 seed Andrey Rublev or French star Adrian Mannarino await in round four. And Nicolas Jarry, Joao Fonseca, Mattia Bellucci and Cameron Norrie are potential quarter-final opponents.

Novak Djokovic now leads Dan Evans by two sets on Centre Court 6-3 6-2.

No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva is back into the third round at Wimbledon. The 18-year-old came back from a break down in the second set to beat Lucia Bronzetti 6-1 7-6(4) on Court 1.

Maria Sakkari takes on 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the next match on the All England Club's second-biggest showcourt.



Plenty of big names have suffered upsets in the first two rounds of Wimbledon so far. But world No. 10 Emma Navarro made sure she wasn't one of them, sealing a dominant 6-2 6-2 win on Thursday.

The American was later asked why she thought there were so many shock early exits and said: ""I'm not sure really. I feel like the grass is, I don't know, nothing wrong with the grass. Yeah, it was hot for a couple of days, but I think a lot of us are equipped to handle it, for sure.

""This time of year it's getting towards the second half of the season, and for a lot of players it's a lot of tournaments in a row, and it's a pretty long stint in Europe. Even if you go home for a couple of weeks, you kind of feel like you've been playing a lot.

""Wimbledon is sort of the end of a long few months in Europe. So maybe that has something to do with it. I'm not sure, but yeah, can't really tell you.""

Novak Djokovic failed to convert his first nine break points in this second-round match. But he's finally taken his 10th, forcing an error from Dan Evans, and he's serving for the first set against the British wildcard on Centre Court.

Seven-time champion Djokovic easily serves out the first set to love 6-3.



Novak Djokovic is racing through his service games on Centre Court. But he's struggling on break points.

The Serb has had seven chances to break Dan Evans' serve and not taken any of them. It's 3-3 on Centre Court, and the fans are getting right behind the British wildcard.

Alex de Minaur is through to the third round after surviving an early wobble against qualifier Arthur Cazaux.

Plenty of top players have tumbled out of Wimbledon in the first few days, but the No. 11 seed made sure he wouldn't be one of them, storming back to win 4-6 6-2 6-4 6-0.

The All England Club has confirmed that it will make an exception to its all-white kit rule, allowing players to wear black ribbons to pay tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva, who passed away in a car accident.

To Centre Court, where Novak Djokovic faces Dan Evans.

The 24-time Major winner has just made a statement, winning the first game of the match in around one minute. He held to love and the longest rally was three shots.

But the fans are right behind Evans, a loud cheer erupted when he started his own service game with two aces.



Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic and British veteran Dan Evans have just stepped out onto Centre Court for their second-round clash.

Evans has an undefeated 1-0 record against Djokovic, upsetting the former No. 1 in Monte Carlo four years ago. But his ranking has taken a tumble over the last year, and he needed a wildcard to get into the main draw here.

""I think this is just a reward for Evans, he's had a difficult 12 months, he was up as high as No. 21 in the world,"" Tim Henman said on the BBC ahead of the match.

""He's shown his hunger and desire to try and drop down to the Challengers and build his way back up. Came through a comfortable victory against Jay Clarke and earned this opportunity to play Djokovic.""

Former Wimbledon semi-finalist Hubert Hurkacz pulled out of the tournament last Friday, hours after the draw was made.

The ex-top-10 player has been battling injuries over the last year and has now announced that he's undergone knee surgery.

""After exploring different options, we decided that having an arthroscopy this past Monday was the best solution,"" he wrote.""During the procedure, the overgrown synovial membrane causing the inflammation, pain, and related issues was removed. A huge thank you to Dr. Bartłomiej Kacprzak who performed the surgery.""

A post shared by Hubert Hurkacz (@hubihurkacz)

Jack Pinnington Jones' Wimbledon run is officially over. The British wildcard earned a statement win over Tomas Etcheverry in the first round but he was no match for No. 22 seed Flavio Cobolli.

Pinnington Jones fought hard in the second set and looked on his way to taking it in the tiebreak. But the Italian shut the door and sealed a 6-1 7-6(6) 6-2 victory on Court 18.

He might have been facing a Brit, but Cobolli had plenty of supporters cheering and chanting his name on the outdoor court, which is open to grounds pass holders.



Well, that didn't take long in the end...

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has finally booked his spot in the third round. The 26th seed led Botic van de Zandschulp blew a match point before play was suspended due to darkness at 5-5 in the fourth set last night.

But he's returned to seal victory on Court 6, spending less than half an hour on the court on Thursday to win 6-1 4-6 6-3 7-6(5). He let out a loud “vamos” and pointed towards the stands after taking it in a tiebreak.

Alejandro Davidovich Fokina is back out on Court 6 to resume his match against Botic van de Zandschulp after it was suspended due to darkness last night.

The Spanish 26th seed served for the match in the fourth set and got broken, then had a match point he couldn't take. Once van de Zandschulp levelled the score at 5-5, play was halted, and Davidovich Fokina wasn't happy.

Can he get the job done now? He's just held for a 6-5 lead.

British wildcard Jack Pinnington Jones put in an incredible effort in the second set of his match against 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli. The Italian served for it at 5-3 but got broken.

The world No. 281 forced a tiebreak and led by a mini-break but Cobolli has taken it 7-6(6)

There's work to do for Pinnington Jones - who is fresh out of college after opting not to return to Texas Christian University for his final year - if he wants to extend his time at Wimbledon. He's two sets down on Court 18.

Alex de Minaur is trying to avoid becoming the latest top seed to fall early.

The Aussie world No. 11 dropped the first set to qualifier Arthur Cazaux but he's just levelled the score 4-6 6-2.

No. 10 seed Emma Navarro became the first singles player to notch a win on Thursday as she stormed into the third round with a statement 6-1 6-2 victory over Veronika Kudermetova.

The American served for it at 5-0 in the second set and got broken. But she still raced through in an hour and 14 minutes. It'll be Grigor Dimitrov vs Corentin Moutet up next on Court 3.



Czech doubles duo Patrik Rikl and Petr Nouza were the first winners on day four of Wimbledon, upsetting No. 15 seeds and Olympic gold medallists Matt Ebden and John Peers 6-3 6-4 on Court 8.

The seeded players have been dropping like flies here at Wimbledon this week, with plenty of huge upsets across the first two rounds.

No. 11 seed Alex de Minaur is hoping to avoid being the latest victim - he's currently a set down to qualifier Arthur Cazaux on Court 2.

There's still a long way to go in this best-of-five set match, but the French world No. 115 leads 6-4.

Emma Raducanu took out 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3 6-3 on Centre Court yesterday.

And former Olympic silver medallist Vondrousova - who beat Raducanu earlier this year in Abu Dhabi - was full of praise for the Brit's game.

“I think she was playing amazing tennis. Yeah, I couldn't do much. Like, I felt, you know, okay, but she was crushing me in the rallies, so there wasn't much I could do. I felt like it wasn't bad for my side, but yeah, she was better,” the Czech star said.

“I felt like here she was using a bit more, like, slices, and she was serving a bit differently than she did in Abu Dhabi. Yeah, I felt like, you know, like my slices and my game wasn't really working today. Yeah, all credit to her. I felt like she was playing some amazing tennis.”

British wildcard Jack Pinnington Jones is in trouble over on Court 18. No. 22 seed Flavio Cobolli has raced through the opening set 6-1 in 22 minutes.

Taylor Fritz played three days in a row at Wimbledon after his first-round match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard was suspended on Monday night ahead of the impending curfew.

He returned to win the fifth set on Tuesday. Then, last night, he beat Gabriel Diallo in five sets at around 10.20pm.

The No. 5 seed finally has a day off today and he's looking forward to sleeping in. But he can't prepare for his next match just yet as he plays the winner of a clash between ALejandro Davidovich Fokina and Botic van de Zandschulp which was suspended on Wednesday night and will continue today.

Fritz said: ""I mean, I think it will be a light practice, for sure. I'm going to sleep in late, have a practice around, I don't know, like 2 or 3. Probably won't hit more than 30 minutes, I think.

""Hitting-wise, there's no need really. I think the biggest thing is I'm going to have to work on some returns because... I mean, I guess it depends. I don't know who I play yet.""

Retired former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal has become the latest tennis player to pay tribute after Diogo Jota and his brother Andre passed away in a road traffic accident.

The Spaniard tweeted: ""What terribly sad and painful news. All my love, affection, and support to his wife, his children, his family, and his friends in such a difficult moment. Rest in Peace, Diogo Jota and Andre Silva.""

Emma Raducanu takes on world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the third round here tomorrow. Raducanu lost their only previous match in Indian Wells last year. But after the Brit took out 2023 Marketa Vondrousova on Wednesday, Annabel Croft believes Raducanu could have a chance against a vulnerable Sabalenka.

“I felt like Sabalenka struggled a little bit in her first set yesterday. She very nearly dropped the first set, so she's not 100 per cent. There's a lot of interest in that match. I'm looking forward to it,” she said on the BBC.

It's just gone 11am and play is getting underway on the outside courts at the All England Club.

No. 11 seed Alex de Minaur faces qualifier Arthur Cazaux on Court 2, while No. 10 seed Emma Navarro faces Veronika Kudermetova.

There's British interest as wilcard Jack Pinnington Jones is starting play on Court 18 against No. 22 seed Flavio Cobolli.

And the first round of the doubles continues today.

British former doubles No. 1 Neal Skupski has paid tribute after Diogo Jota and his brother passed away in a road traffic accident.

Ahead of his first-round match at Wimbledon today, Skupski tweeted: ""Tragic news. YNWA""

British No. 2 Katie Boulter suffered a disappointing three-set defeat to lucky loser Solana Sierra on Wednesday.

Boulter has still never reached the second week of a Grand Slam tournament despite being a former world No. 23 and winning three singles titles.

After her 6-7 6-2 6-1 defeat she admitted it may never happen.

""It's a really tough pill to swallow. It always is here. Unfortunately it's just the way that it is. Sometimes I just have to accept that my moment might not come at some point,"" a dejected Boulter said.

Jack Draper is the talk of the town at Wimbledon this fortnight. Ranked at No. 4 in the world, he is arguably Britain's biggest hope to win the men's singles title here since Andy Murray.

But another British Jack has been causing a stir at SW19. Jack Pinnington Jones got a wildcard into the main draw and faces 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli on Thursday.

Pinnington Jones goes way back with Draper, revealing that the British No. 1 used to drive him to practice at the National Tennis Centre.

""He can't sit in traffic, or he'd hate to sit in traffic so Jack would say: ‘Right, I'm going to be there at 6:30. You're either there or you're not'. I'd be half asleep every time. And I'd be there at 7am with nothing to do,"" Pinnington Jones said of their journeys together.

Taylor Fritz found himself dragged into another five-setter at Wimbledon.

On Monday night, his first-round match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard was halted before the fifth and final set could start. It was 10.15pm - 45 minutes before curfew - and Fritz wanted to play on but the supervisor told them to return the following day. He came back to win, then beat Gabriel Diallo in five sets on Wednesday evening.

Luckily for Fritz, they were able to finish the match in one night. After avoiding more curfew drama, he said: ""I would have lost my mind if they tried to get us at, like, 9:50pm.

""There was plenty of time. I would have absolutely lost it because then I would have had to play again and then again. I need a day off at some point.""



Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill has revealed the Italian cheated on his diet after losing the French Open final to Carlos Alcaraz.

""We had this big bus where we all sit in and for the players they have this candy jar that you can take a couple of candies as you walk out,"" said Cahill on ESPN.

""He took the whole jar. He grabbed the glass jar, had the candies, he'd been on a strict diet for two weeks and that was it. The diet was out the window.

""In the car, he was handing candies out to everyone. He was laughing, he was giggling.

""He moved on pretty quickly and it'll be interesting to see how he moves on here because this will be the big test.""

Naomi Osaka has admitted to experiencing a greater degree of 'fear' than she did in her younger days.

The four-time Grand Slam champion opened up in an honest press conference after beating Katerina Siniakova yesterday.

""When I was younger, I had no fear and I think when you're young you fear nothing and that's one of the really cool things about it,"" said Osaka.

""But I don't know, with age fear kind of crept along and I guess paralyzed me in a way so now I'm kind of just getting over that and trying to spread my wings on grass.

""Ithink it is working and I think I am moving pretty well and yeah, I just hope that in years to come and hopefully this year I can do a lot better in this tournament.""

Fans heading to Wimbledon might be able to find some genuine match kit in the local charity shops.

That is because Joe Salisbury has been donating his competition shirts and clothing for the last 'four or five years'.

The four-time Grand Slam doubles champion told Express Sport: ""Obviously, we have different match kits throughout the year.

""I think we get maybe even five, six, different ones. And we usually get given quite a lot of stuff from our sponsors.

""Once you've used one of them and you're onto to the next one, then you've got a lot of stuff left over.

""I usually give some to friends and family and then a lot of still got lots more of the old stuff, so then I give the rest of that to the charity shop.""



All eyes will be on Centre Court later when Dan Evans takes on Novak Djokovic for a place in the third round.

The pair have only faced off once in their careers, with the Brit surprisingly coming out on top 6-4 7-4 at the Monte Carlo Masters four years ago.

But the Brit once took Djokovic to task over his comments on events being played during the Covid pandemic...

Here's a look at what's coming up on the main courts at Wimbledon today...

Centre Court (from 1.30pm)

Dan Evans vs Novak Djokovic

Iga Swiatek vs Caty McNally

Jannik Sinner vs Aleksandar Vukic

Court One (from 1pm)

Mirra Andreeva vs Lucia Bronzetti

Maria Sakkari vs Elena Rybakina

Jack Draper vs Marin Cilic

The full schedule can be found on the Wimbledon website.

Oliver Tarvet earned £99,000 for reaching the second round but will be forced to give most of it away.

He attends university in the United States and the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) require athletes to stay amateur.

Tarvet is able to claim up to £7,282 in expenses as well as the expenses he has incurred during the tournament.

However, he will miss out on the vast majority of his Wimbledon payout, which will go to his university.

Fellow tennis prodigy Benjamin Heynold continued to fuel rumours of a romance with Emma Raducanu on Wednesday.

He was in her box to watch her beat Marketa Vondrousova and reach the third round at SW19.

It comes just a day after he appeared in the background of a selfie Raducanu had taken.

There was talk of a potential romance after Heynold was spotted in her team's corner at Queen's Club last month.



Hello and welcome to Express Sport's live coverage of Wimbledon on day four of the tournament.

Follow live updates and scores from day four of the Wimbledon Championships at the All England Club

It's day four of Wimbledon 2025 and it's another packed schedule ahead with Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, Jack Draper and Jannik Sinner all in action. 

To the dismay of the home crowd, Djokovic thrashed Britain's Dan Evans in Centre Court's opening match, as the seven-time Wimbledon champion recorded his 99th win at the grass-court slam. That match came after Evans's young teammate Jack Pinnington Jones was beaten by 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli. 

There is still hope for the home crop, though: last out on No 1 Court, Draper faces former major winner and Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic. 

Yesterday saw impressive wins by Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal in the second round of the ladies' draw, although their fellow Briton Katie Boulter bowed out. Raducanu will play the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in a highly anticipated contest on Friday. On the men's side, Cameron Norrie knocked out 12th seed Frances Tiafoe to book his spot in the third round, while Carlos Alcaraz saw off the spirited efforts of British qualifier Ollie Tarvet.

Follow all the latest scores and results from Wimbledon below. 

Jack Draper has had a lot to contemplate so far in this match

The old tennis cliche of a break not being worth a damn until it's consolidated with a hold of serve feels very apt here.

Pressure on Draper as he squanders game point, allowing Cilic to force deuce. But a couple of big serves bail him out. That was a very, very important hold. The set is at his mercy now.

Well, well, well. What have we here? Draper gets himself to 0-30 and then a Cilic forehand is netted. 

Three break points for Draper, having had just two in the entire match so far. First one SAVED by Cilic, who holds a hand up in apology as a net cord goes his way. Draper chuntering away to himself/the tennis Gods in response...

Second one SAVED. Big serve, unreturned. Surely Draper can't afford to squander all three? He doesn't! Well-constructed point and a forehand down the line secures the break for Jack Draper. Big! Can that be a turning point?

Draper's serve is finding its range more consistently now, although his service games are still peppered with moments of Cilic brilliance, such as his thumping forehand winner here.

But in the end, a fairly simple hold to 15 for the Brit.

If you're a Jack Draper fan and looking for the smallest, and I do mean smallest, of consolations, at least he's serving first in this third set.

If his serve holds up as it's going to need to to entertain any sort of epic, late-night, Andy Murray-esque comeback, then he'll have the edge of being ahead and pressurising the Cilic serve.

Draper breezes through his first service game to lay the early template but Cilic responds with a hold to love. Fist pump and an intense look in the eyes of the big Croatian.

Swiatek 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 McNally

You know what, that's a good win all told in the end for Iga Swiatek.

Having dropped the first set from being ahead, she hit back to race through the final two sets against Caty McNally, claiming the decider 6-1.

I know she's not the most comfortable on grass but the way the women's draw is opening up, Swiatek might like her chances of going deep

A “come on” from draper to pump himself up as he wins the first point to get an early foothold in the Cilic service game but that's great power! Cilic just unfurls himself to arrow a backhand winner cross-court before an ace down the ‘T'. 

Unreturned serve and it's two set points. Smooth as you like! Draper's return goes long and Marin Cilic has won the second set 6-3. He's just one set away from a big upset on No 1 Court. Draper in all sorts of trouble

The Draper serve is starting, slowly but surely, to solidify as he bangs down a couple of unreturned serves and finds a clean forehand winner.

Cilic still has a sniff at 40-30 but the Brit sees it out. The Croat will serve for a two-set lead here though.

Cilic loves a long ball bounce before each serve but he's in a rhythm here.

The 36-year-old veteran is absolutely rolling back the years. Draper floats a groundstroke long on the first point of the game but after that it's all Cilic's brilliance.

Two impressive aces sandwiched by a point where he finds a crunching cross-court forehand winner. Sublime

Alarm bells ringing again for the Brit when he slips 0-15 down but responds well to string a few points together and win the game for a vital hold of serve.

Can he put any sort of pressure on the Cilic serve though?

Emma Raducanu played some of her best tennis since her U.S. Open title run in 2021 by sweeping aside former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3, 6-3 and reach the third round

LONDON — Emma Raducanu played some of her most clinical tennis since her U.S. Open title run to sweep aside 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3, 6-3 on Wednesday and reach the third round.

In front of a raucous Centre Court crowd, Raducanu surprised even herself sometimes in outdueling the Czech player in a match between Grand Slam winners who were both unseeded.

“That was one of the best matches I've played in a long time,” said Raducanu, the 2021 champion at Flushing Meadows . “I turned one point around that I think is probably the best point I've ever played, so that was pretty crazy. I think the crowd were loving it.”

She may have to up her level even further in the next match, though. In a tournament where four of the five top women's seeds have already been eliminated, the British home favorite will be up against the only one remaining — No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka .

“Yeah, I guess there's no pressure at all on me the next round,” Raducanu said in an on-court interview, laughing.

There's always pressure on Raducanu playing at Wimbledon, especially after she became the first British woman since 1977 to capture a Grand Slam title when she won the U.S. Open as a qualifier.

She struggled with injuries and form after that, and her fourth-round showing at Wimbledon last year is her best result in a major since.

But her win against Vondrousova, who in 2019 was the French Open runner-up, showed Raducanu might be back to her best.

“She was playing amazing tennis,” Vondrousova said. “She was crushing me in the rallies, so there wasn't much I could do.”

Raducanu seemed pretty impressed with her own performance as well.

“I think today I played really, really well,” she said. “I knew today I had to be aggressive because Marketa would beat me if I was going to push the ball around.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Wimbledon power couple 'break up' and facing extremely awkward U.S. Open situation","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/paulabadosa-stefnos-tsitsips-breakup-1241462","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 00:07:00 GMT","

Tennis's beloved ""Tsitsidosa"" has parted ways. Paula Badosa and Stefános Tsitsipas, romantically linked since 2023 and briefly reconciled in 2024, have quietly ended their relationship for a second time, according to reports in Spain.

The split reportedly ignited after both were ousted in the first round at Wimbledon — Badosa losing to Katie Boulter, and Tsitsipas withdrawing mid-match due to a persistent back injury. Soon after, they unfollowed each other on Instagram and removed all traces of their romance. It comes after Badosa admitted she is facing early retirement in a heartbreaking admission, while Tsitsipas offerde a bleak outlook on his own Wimbledon pain.

According to Spanish celebrity magazine Hola, sources close to the couple described the breakup as “mature and amicable,” without third-party interference, but emphasize that lingering professional pressures and recurring injuries played a major role. This separation poses an awkward situation as they were expected to reunite on court as mixed doubles partners at the upcoming U.S. Open — a joyful pairing that was publicized in late June.

Organizers had already announced their entry as a wildcard team, generating excitement among fans. With the reported split, their U.S. Open involvement is now clouded with uncertainty and potential awkwardness, both personally and in the press.

The Wimbledon exit seems to have functioned as the final straw. Badosa and Tsitsipás had previously broken up in May 2024, but swiftly reconciled soon after. This time, sources suggest, the toll of injuries and disappointing tournament results proved too great.

Both players have been navigating difficult career stretches: Badosa, once ranked No. 2, has fallen after an injury-riddled season and an early Wimbledon exit.

Similarly, Tsitsipas, once a top-5 player, now copes with a nagging back issue threatening his season. It's now clear these professional challenges intertwined with their personal lives, ultimately fracturing the bond they once cemented.

Despite removing each other from social media and withdrawing public displays of affection, there's no animosity involved. According to insiders, both express mutual respect and love, citing the breakup as “healthy” and “adult.” They emphasized no infidelity or family interference — just two individuals facing mounting pressures.

As the U.S. Open approaches — with its Grand Slam spotlight and mixed doubles bracket already publicized — their breakup sets the stage for a potentially tense reunion. Will they still share the court? Will they withdraw quietly, or risk headlines by playing side by side? Tournament organizers and fans alike are watching closely.

Ben Shelton had the crowd in stitches during his opening-round victory at Wimbledon after a lighthearted slip-up about his favorite Grand Slam. The 22-year-old American quickly clarified his allegiance, jokingly reassuring supporters that the US Open still holds a special place in his heart, where he reached the semifinals in 2023.

Shelton, the No. 10 seed at the 2025 Championships, cruised past Australian qualifier Alex Bolt in straight sets, 6-4, 7-6(1), 7-6(4). Known for his booming serve, Shelton landed 15 aces and won 82% of his first-serve points to seal the win. But a moment during his on-court interview drew loud laughter from the Wimbledon crowd.

“I love playing at the Grand Slams. It's one of my four favorite tournaments here,” Shelton quipped, pausing as the audience erupted in laughter. Realizing his gaffe, he grinned and added, “I can't do my home slam that dirty, but one of my favorites, 100%. I love playing here every year.”

 

 

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)



The official Wimbledon Instagram account posted the humorous exchange shortly after the match. Shelton couldn't resist chiming in himself, responding, “Sorry, NYC always comes first.”

Shelton first appeared in the US Open main draw in 2022, where he suffered a first-round exit after losing to Nuno Borges. He enjoyed a breakthrough run at Flushing Meadows in 2023, defeating Pedro Cachin, Dominic Thiem, Aslan Karatsev, and fellow Americans Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe to advance to the semifinals. There, he lost in straight sets to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. In 2024, his campaign ended in the third round with a loss to Tiafoe.

Shelton now moves on to face another Australian, Rinky Hijikata, in the second round at SW19. This will be their second meeting on the ATP Tour, with Shelton winning their first clash at the 2024 Mallorca Championships. They previously faced each other twice on the Challenger circuit, splitting the matches with one win apiece.

The winner of this match will take on either lucky loser Márton Fucsovics or Gaël Monfils in the third round.

Shelton made his Wimbledon debut in 2023, where he defeated Taro Daniel to reach the second round, eventually losing 6-3, 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to Laslo Djere. The following year, he cruised past Mattia Bellucci, Lloyd Harris, and Denis Shapovalov to reach the fourth round, where he lost 2-6, 4-6, 6-7(9) to Jannik Sinner.

Taro Daniel has opened up about the monetary challenges faced by players ranked outside the world's top 100. Most recognized for defeating Andy Murray in the second round of the Australian Open three years ago, Daniel was among numerous contenders who couldn't advance through Wimbledon's qualifying stages.

Despite his determined effort, the 32 year old was eliminated in the second qualifying round, falling 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 to France's Titouan Droguet. Speaking about his financial concerns, Daniel has been compelled to manage his income carefully due to steep expenses related to travel, coaching and physiotherapy.

Following his $200,000 earnings for reaching the third round in Melbourne, the tennis professional endured years of weekly losses, forced to give up personal luxuries to preserve funds.

""In 2017, after an early exit at the French Open, I had $200 in my account,"" he confessed. ""I survived on instant noodles and skipped tournaments because I couldn't afford flights.

""When I was younger, I even wouldn't get the avocado on my Chipotle order because it's like three dollars more. When you try to save too much it ends up impacting people's games negatively.""

From the beginning of 2025, Daniel has earned slightly more than $185,000 in prize money. Nevertheless, multiple expenditures have substantially diminished that sum, leaving him with a substantial credit card balance monthly to handle necessary expenses.

""First of all, you're earning all of this money from foreign countries so they're going to take all the withholding taxes,"" Daniel explained. ""Tournaments cover your hotel room, but they don't cover your coach's hotel room.

""My credit card statement, it's at least $20,000 a month on just operational expenses of hotel, food, flights and not including the salaries I pay to my team.

""As a tennis player, you're like a small company but having all your employees travelling all the time. [It's] at least $100,000 per season for your basic level, not super experienced coach.

""10 years ago, when I started, a lot of players would travel alone because the standards were not as high. Now, it would be very rare for someone to travel alone to a Grand Slam, for example.

""Everyone has a coach or trainer. They're probably right on the red-black line. Even in a Slam, you're not necessarily making money.""

Daniel had his sights set on a hefty prize pot at Wimbledon, where first-round contenders pocket $90,000, second-round participants earn £99,000, and advancing to the third round means raking in $207,000.

The champion of the entire tournament is set to bag an eye-watering $4 million – a record-breaking amount for a Grand Slam event.

Yet, the Japanese star faces several more challenging months before he can lay claim to any game-changing prize money.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Jim Courier names the Grand Slam winner Petra Kvitova reminded him of as she loses her final match at Wimbledon","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/jim-courier-names-the-grand-slam-winner-petra-kvitova-reminded-him-of-as-she-loses-her-final-match-at-wimbledon/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 02:00:00 GMT","

Petra Kvitova enjoyed a legendary tennis career, winning two Grand Slam titles and the WTA Finals.

The Czech legend won her first Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 2011, defeating Russia's Maria Sharapova in the final.

Three years later, Kvitova won Wimbledon for a second time, when she took down Eugenie Bouchard in straight sets.

Now aged 35, Kvitova is set to retire from tennis in 2025, and was competing at Wimbledon one final time.

Unfortunately for the former world number two, she couldn't secure the win in her opening match as she lost to Emma Navarro 3-6, 1-6.

Reflecting on Kvitova's stellar career, Jim Courier named the major winner whom she reminded him of.

Appearing on the Tennis Channel, Courier compared Kvitova to another Czech tennis legend.

“It must not have been too lovely to be on the other side of the net when she was at her apex, this is one of the sweetest strikers of a tennis ball that you will see, especially on fast courts, just beautiful timing,” he said.

“Reminds me of her fellow Czech, Petr Korda, back in our time on tour, when he was in the zone, he was unplayable.

“I feel that way about Kvitova, a lefty like Petr, just elegant on the court and off the court.

“We will miss her, but she has a lot to look forward to with her family life, of course.”

Lindsay Davenport was keen to weigh in with her thoughts as she spoke highly of the two-time Wimbledon champion.

“She's so well-liked off the court. Never upset anyone; everyone loves her. It was great to follow her and her career,” she said.

Courier said Kvitova reminded him of Korda, a Grand Slam champion in his own right.

Korda contested two singles Grand Slam finals in his career, at the French Open in 1992 and at the Australian Open in 1996.

Losing his first to Courier at Roland Garros, the Czech was determined to emerge victorious the second time around.

Travelling to Melbourne as the number six seed in 1996, Korda battled his way through to the final, where he took on Chile's Marcelo Rios.

Winning in straight sets, Korda dominated Rios 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, to clinch his sole major title.

He returned to Melbourne just once more in 1999, losing in the third round to Todd Martin before retiring from tennis shortly after when he received a 12-month doping ban.

During her post-match press conference, Kvitova gave her verdict on the tournament, which she won in 2011 and 2014.

“Wimbledon was the main thing that shaped me throughout my career, as a person as well. I do get along very nicely with the English people, with their sense of humour as well, I love it,” she said.

“I think it was the main thing which happened to me in my life, from nobody, I was somebody.”

Looking back at the second of her two Wimbledon wins, Kvitova believes she proved herself at the ‘best tournament in the world'.

“I was struggling a little bit as well, but the second title was the best as well, that was something that was satisfying, proving that I could play well and that I was a good player,” she said.

“Even though I was in the top ten for a pretty long time, the Grand Slams are the biggest trophies that you can have, and to have two, especially Wimbledon, is something very special and an honor to have.

“I think it's the best tournament in the world.”

Kvitova will retire as one of just three players, alongside Serena and Venus Williams, to have won multiple Wimbledon titles this century, esteemed company for the Czech legend.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","‘Sounds different': Why Aussie hopeful, Wimbledon should fear Jannik Sinner after ‘best ever' build-up","https://www.foxsports.com.au/tennis/wimbledon-2025-jannik-sinner-vs-aleks-vukic-preview-start-time-how-italian-rebounded-from-french-open-final-loss-to-carlos-alcaraz/news-story/abc80998bfb7719d265ef3b91486d0c3","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 10:46:07 GMT","

Smack. Boom. Thhwaaack! A sound like a whip cracking echoed repeatedly across the practice courts at Wimbledon on Wednesday. 

The skies were heavy over the All England Lawn Tennis Club but the thunderclaps being unleashed shortly after midday had nothing to do with the weather, though they most certainly would have alarmed Aussie hopeful Aleks Vukic had he been within earshot.

Out on the Aorangi practice courts which adjoin Wimbledon, Jannik Sinner was inflicting a grievous assault on the set of tennis balls he was pummelling. And “The Sinner Spectacle” on Court 4 was compelling viewing.

The sound that comes from the racquet of the world No.1, who plays Vukic on Thursday on Centre Court, is distinct to most players, with the starkness amplified at Aorangi given the fact several players were practising on courts laid side-by-side at the same time. 

Alongside was Amanda Anisimova, a highly talented American who double-bagelled Yulia Putintseva in the first round. Going through her paces on Court 3, the No.13 seed struck the ball sweetly, but the pace of her shots was pedestrian compared to the Italian. 

When Sinner unleashes with his forehand, it sounds like a pistol has been fired. And he was murdering the ball in a session that drew several interested onlookers.

WRAP: World No.733 wins the hearts of Wimbledon; shock exit in latest victim of giant killings 





As his compatriot Andrea Vavassori said in Miami last year; “For sure you could see when you heard the sound of the ball, the explosion, I think you could understand that he was different from others. The sound when he plays forehands and backhands is different from the other players.”

As this journalist watched the dual-Australian Open champion in action, last year's Wimbledon and Roland Garros finalist Jasmine Paolini edged in to the row alongside to witness Sinner work his younger practice partner over. 

Protecting herself from the chill that descended on Wednesday with a cream-coloured hoodie after the scorching days to open Wimbledon, she seemed as fascinated as everyone else watching her compatriot blast balls into oblivion.

The attraction is scarcely a surprise. After all, had Sinner managed to seize one of three match points in the phenomenal French Open final against Carlos Alcaraz last month, the tennis world would be pondering whether he could complete the “Sinner slam” this fortnight.



As superb as the broadcasting of live sport is, the cameras never truly depict just how hard tennis players hit the ball, nor how swiftly they move, the extent of the contortions of their bodies or, to emphasise the point again, the sound of the ball off the racquet.

The weight and depth of his groundstrokes were formidable, with the 23-year-old leathering the ball crosscourt with his hitting partner, who was wearing a sleeve on his right arm, before unleashing lethal forehands down the line. Boom! Another ball destroyed.

About 40 minutes in Sinner changed from a white T-shirt into a red one and began pounding serves. The pace through the air and the movement off the court, be it arcing away with a slice or kicking like a mule to the right on landing, is alarming to behold, let alone face.

Watching Sinner on Wednesday, as others including Australian Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt and his deputy Jaymon Crabb were from a side-on vantage point, it was impossible to imagine anyone beating him. Yet that is the task confronting Vukic on Thursday.

Asked if would have to serve exceptionally well to stay with Sinner, who won both their outings in convincing fashion while he was still a teenager, the Australian Davis Cup representative responded; “Yeah. And probably more.”

“I'll have to take my chances and have to play a very good match. But I've got nothing to lose,” Vukic said.

While Sinner looked unbeatable in practice, he has lost twice in the past month. Aside from the epic against Alcaraz at Roland Garros, Alexander Bublik defeated him in three sets in Halle in his first match after the heartbreaker.

Nor is it uncommon for even the best players to suffer a lull after an excruciating loss. Alexander Zverev, who was bounced from Wimbledon on Tuesday, is a case in point. The German has not been the same player since falling to Sinner in the Australian Open final.





But Sinner's co-coach Darren Cahill, who was wearing a white jumper and green tracksuit pants while supervising the spectacle on Wednesday, told American television prior to Wimbledon that the Italian had bounced back quickly from the Paris heartbreaker.

The Australian master coach revealed a break in diet and a small act of rebellion as he left the Roland Garros locker room was Sinner's first step in the recovery process.

“For the players, they have this candy jar, where you can take a couple of candies when you walk out of Roland Garros. But he took the whole jar,” Cahill said.

“He had been on a strict diet for two weeks and that was it. The diet was out the window. He was handing candies out to everyone. He was giggling. He was laughing. He moved on pretty quickly. But it will be interesting to see how he moves on here, because this will be the big test.”





Sinner, who was a semi-finalist at Wimbledon in 2023 and has a 14-4 record at the AELTC, became sharper as his opening round match against compatriot Luca Nardi whistled by 6-4 6-3 6-0, which is not a surprise given Cahill's pre-tournament assessment.

“He has had the best week of practice on grass that he has ever had. He is rejuvenated. He is fresh mentally. He looks good,” Cahill said.

“The first couple of matches will be interesting. He has to get his teeth into the tournament and I think if he can get through the first couple of matches, he will be completely fine. 

“The fact is also that had he won (Roland Garros), we would be competing here for the ‘Sinner slam'. He would have won three in a row. So he knows he is around the mark. He is improving all the time on grass. Mentally, he has great self awareness and great perspective on where he is in the game and what he has done to get himself into this position.”





It is an important moment for Vukic, who is in action alongside fellow Australians Alex de Minaur, Rinky Hijikata and Daria Kasatkina.

Last year the popular Sydneysider faced Alcaraz on Court 1 in the second round and stretched the Spanish superstar for a set. Now the No.93 gets an opportunity to play the world's best on the most famous court in tennis.

“I remember last year going out onto the court for the first time (and) it was a little bit surreal,” he said.

“But, and I was talking to coach about this, it is also a little bit more peaceful at the same time, because actually (the outside courts are) quite chaotic, with a lot going on around. You hear all the voices around, whereas over there (on the show courts) you kind of get left alone a little bit. It's actually ... sometimes less distracting to be out there. So it is different.”

No matter what unfolds on Thursday afternoon, Vukic will be able to tell his grandkids about the day he played the world No.1 on a Wimbledon Centre Court card that also featured 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic and four-time French Open star Iga Swiatek.

And that is pretty cool.

Joao Fonseca closed his eyes in relief and put his head in his hands on Wednesday. The Brazilian had just booked his place in the Wimbledon third round, equalling his best result at a major. The 18-year-old, who won last year's Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, will next meet Nicolas Jarry in a South American clash on the SW19 grass.

ATPTour.com caught up with Fonseca earlier this year to learn about his journey. The teenager shared his greatest success, favourite rivalry, favourite tournament and more.

Well, my greatest success has been winning the Next Gen [Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF] or maybe winning my first title, the ATP 250 in Buenos Aires.

What's been the most unique moment in your career?
The most unique moment in my career was winning against [Cristian] Garin in the round of 16 at the Rio Open, the ATP 500 which is in my hometown. And for me it was super unique.

What is the biggest number or the accomplishment that you're chasing?
My biggest dream is to become No. 1 in the world, so I'm working very hard to one day get it.

How long have you been pursuing that dream?
For a long time, since I was 10 years old.

Iga Swiatek avoided the upset bug that has bitten many of tennis' top players at Wimbledon on Thursday as she rallied from a set down in a 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 victory over American Caty McNally.With five Top 10 seeds already out of the women's event over the first three days of the tournament, Swiatek looked as though she might join them as she cut a frustrated figure on Centre Court over the first hour of play, letting a 4-1 first-set lead slip away against a player she knows well.McNally was a junior peer, and rival, of Swiatek; she beat Swiatek in the semifinals of the 2018 junior French Open, where they teamed up to win the doubles title. But their professional paths diverged greatly since then. While Swiatek soared to the top of the WTA rankings, McNally found her greatest success in doubles with a career-high ranking of No. 53 in singles, and has been working her way back following a major elbow injury that necessitated surgery last year.Ranked outside the Top 1,000 in the world when she came back to tennis in November, McNally missed five Grand Slam tournaments before returning at the Australian Open in January on a protected ranking, and her 6-3, 6-1 win over Great Britain's Jodie Burrage in the first round was her first victory at a major since Melbourne in 2023.That lack of high-level match play showed for McNally over sets two and three, as she was unable to sustain the level required to earn a first career Top 10 win.

Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer analyses what's going wrong for Yuki Tsunoda, why Max Verstappen is seemingly the only driver capable of driving the Red Bull – and the conundrum this has created for team boss Christian Horner.

Max Verstappen's early retirement from the Austrian Grand Prix put the focus on Yuki Tsunoda's poor form in the second Red Bull. With Max out, the rest of the Red Bull team's sole focus was the car struggling at the opposite end of the grid. Winding up last at the end of a combative 70 laps, it was another day to forget for the Japanese racer.

The stark reality for Red Bull is that without Verstappen's considerable haul of points, they would be last in the Teams' championship.

After Liam Lawson's disappointing two-race stint for the senior team, things looked temporarily better for Tsunoda at Red Bull, but he is now slumping back to a form worse than Sergio Perez and no better than Lawson's couple of races. The truth is, without Verstappen, Red Bull aren't even midfielders, they are tail-enders in Formula 1 and even a long way adrift of Racing Bulls.

It's been well documented that the car is hard to drive, but you sensed the frustration from Christian Horner in his post Grand Prix comments – “it isn't an easy car to drive, but it's not that difficult either”.

It must have been a tough reality check for the pit wall who didn't have their star driver in play, and who seems the only man capable of driving Red Bull's cars over the last seven years.

So why is the Dutchman the only driver seemingly able to extract decent pace from the Red Bull?

Max has a very specific style and an incredible feel for the car. He likes a positive front end and a car that can be sharp on entry. He can also deal with the usual compromise of oversteer better than anyone in the field. The problem then seems to be finding someone else who can handle similar characteristics to Verstappen.

In the first races of 2025, it was clear that Lawson couldn't drive the car consistently near the limit even around a single lap. He could do an occasional quick corner, but would then lose a heap by making a mistake at the next.

Trying to drive this car on the limit for an entire lap isn't easy, unless you make changes to settle it down. But if you settle it down and find a more drivable balance, you take away the natural strength of the design philosophy and pick up too much understeer, which makes you plain slow. This seems to be where Tsunoda is at now.

Looking at Yuki's Qualifying laps recently, there aren't any obvious errors in there. He's not hanging on to the car, or losing chunks of time in any particular corner.

If anything, as a driver it's nicer to come back from a disappointing session and see that a mistake here or there cost you, because it's something tangible. You can put your finger on it, see what you did wrong and work out how much it cost. You can also figure out changes to your driving style to correct it.

In Yuki's case at the moment, there aren't any obvious errors to point at, which is why both he and the team are left bamboozled at his lack of pace. His crash at the start of Imola Qualifying (see the clip below) looked like a case of a driver trying to reset heading into a crucial session after a difficult run of practices. He'd looked through the data and was determined to attack from the first lap.

Unfortunately in attacking he tried to do the impossible, lumped over the kerbs at high speed and was pitched into his dramatic crash. The car is so difficult to drive that in desperation for performance, it's easy to over-drive and crash. But the alternative is then what happened in Barcelona and Austria – to under-drive, or have the car be too sedate and be slow.

Tsunoda has said he'll delve into the data with his engineers and try to understand what is going on, but history says it's not going to be easy to fix. After all, this is an issue that has impacted multiple drivers in multiple Red Bull cars over multiple sets of regulations.

When asked if he was confident about his chances at Red Bull, Yuki was bullish at the start of the season, but now nine races into his tenure in the sport's toughest seat, I think the understanding of the fates of many before him has hit.

He hoped that because his driving style was closer to that of Max he would be better off, but it turns out that nobody can drive a car similar to how Max can operate at his peak.

I've never known one driver to drive so differently to so many others, but it is the only explanation and it is a complete head scratcher for Red Bull – and anyone else who might want to hire the most formidable talent in the field.

It is that same incredible natural style and feel that makes Max the talent he is, but in developing a car in a way that optimises their star driver, will that make any team with Max in it naturally a one-car team?

And what about Red Bull? Logic would say they should focus their development on making the car more drivable for the ‘average' F1 driver, rather than their superstar, but is that just shackling their greatest asset?

Yuki finds himself in a tough spot. The only thing he can do is dust himself off and go again, trying another reset at Silverstone this weekend. Unlike Lawson, he has the benefit of a few years' worth of CV to fall back on, so we know what he is capable of in the right machinery.

The question is, can he extract anything more out of the second half of the season in Red Bull colours and finally find a flow, or will he end up heading the way of his increasingly long line of predecessors – Alex Albon, Pierre Gasly and so on – and perhaps needing to rebuild a life outside of Red Bull at the end of the year.

Following a thrilling weekend in Austria, the F1 paddock descends on Silverstone for the British Grand Prix with plenty to look forward to.

The latest European double-header continues with a visit to a track that was the starting point for the Formula 1 World Championship, and a huge crowd awaits. Fresh from a thrilling battle between the McLaren drivers on Sunday, there's plenty to look forward to as the paddock reconvenes at Silverstone...

McLaren have enjoyed a clear advantage over most of the field at a number of races this season, leading to Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris sharing eight wins between them from the opening 11 rounds. But Austria was perhaps the longest in-race battle between the two so far, as Norris had to hold off Piastri's attacks for the entire first stint at the Red Bull Ring.

In the end, it was Norris who came out on top, converting a very impressive pole position into victory, closing the gap at the top of the championship to 15 points in the process.

Although the Briton retired after running into Piastri in Canada, he has actually outscored his team mate by a point over the past five race weekends, with two wins and two second places in that time.

Heading to a race where Norris is sure to have significant backing – although both McLaren drivers have received strong support in the past – we're set for the next instalment of a championship battle that is ebbing and flowing in a manner that suggests it could go the distance to the final round this year.

The Austrian Grand Prix saw a number of the front-running teams introduce upgrades following the return to Europe, and McLaren cited their new parts as one reason why they enjoyed a good margin over the chasing pack.

But that chasing pack was led by Ferrari on this occasion, following a floor upgrade from Maranello that Charles Leclerc says delivered a clear step forward. That progress helped Leclerc score his third podium in four races in Austria, with Lewis Hamilton following him home in fourth place for a strong points haul that moves Ferrari back into second place in the Constructors' Championship.

There is a promise of more upgrades to follow soon – perhaps as early as this weekend – and the recent step forward bodes well for Ferrari's chances of having those work as intended, too. But Silverstone will provide another example of how much progress has been made with the latest car developments.

Silverstone was not a happy hunting ground for Ferrari last year in changeable conditions, and they might face more of the same this weekend, providing opportunities to see if there have been improvements on multiple fronts.

There was an enormous crowd of Max Verstappen supporters in Austria, at a track where the Dutchman has enjoyed significant success in the past.

Qualifying had not exactly raised expectations of a sixth win at the Red Bull Ring, but there was still hope from the Orange Army that Verstappen could fight for the podium. Unfortunately, they never got the chance to find out, as the defending champion was hit by Kimi Antonelli at Turn 3 on the opening lap and retired.

With Yuki Tsunoda finishing two laps down and last of those to complete the race, it was a tough day for Red Bull at their home race, but it came just two weeks after a strong showing in Canada.

And they weren't the only team to suffer a challenging weekend, as Montreal race-winner George Russell finished a distant fifth, over a minute behind Lando Norris. Coupled with Antonelli's retirement, it was not the weekend Mercedes had been hoping for, either.

But both teams have been extremely competitive at Silverstone in the past, and Mercedes will be hoping the forecast cooler temperatures hold, that would really play to their strengths after Hamilton's victory here last year.

Prior to their respective disappointing Sundays, two major names in the driver market were central to a lot of the pre-race talking points in Austria, as George Russell suggested Mercedes are in discussions with Max Verstappen about a potential future seat.

Russell is out of contract at the end of this season and says he has not yet started significant talks, but that he is comfortable in his position. His mention of talks with Verstappen – said during an interview with Sky Sports F1 – led to plenty of questions for Team Principal Toto Wolff last Friday, who talked up the pairing of Russell and Antonelli, but did not totally rule out a move.

Until Russell has a new deal in place, speculation is likely to continue, not only about Verstappen and Mercedes but also where Russell himself could end up. And that's before the knock-on impact on any other seats.

For one, it would leave Red Bull needing a replacement for Verstappen, and home fans will get a look at a potential future star in the form of Arvid Lindblad. The Formula 2 title contender will make his FP1 debut this weekend, having been given a Super Licence at the age of 17 following a request made to the FIA.

Silverstone was the venue for the first ever Formula 1 World Championship race 75 years ago, and as a venue it has grown into a special setting for a Grand Prix.

The high-speed nature of the track makes it one that is enjoyed by the majority of the drivers, as it provides them with an opportunity to really push their machinery. The current generation of ground effect cars really come alive through corners such as Copse, Abbey and Stowe, and the rapid changes of direction through Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel.

Similar to the last race in Austria, the huge numbers of fans that descend on Silverstone and stay in its many campsites give the whole weekend a real festival feel, as do the big-name acts that appear on the music stages throughout the four days.

But never are the grandstands more energised than when there is racing taking place on track. With five British or part-British drivers on the grid in the form of Lando Norris, George Russell, Lewis Hamilton, Alex Albon and Ollie Bearman, plus three support categories - Formula 2, Formula 3 and Formula 4 - it's sure to be an action-packed weekend with plenty for them to get behind.

As Formula 1 moves on to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and more.

F1's busy European leg continues with the British Grand Prix at Silverstone this weekend – Round 12 of 24 in the 2025 season.

Free Practice 1 and Free Practice 2 around the historic venue will take place on Friday, July 4, followed by Free Practice 3 and Qualifying on Saturday, July 5 and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, July 6.

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Silverstone is another drivers' favourite with fast, flowing sequences and some of the best corners in the world. Copse, Maggots and Becketts are where you feel g-force on your body that is pretty rare in Formula 1.

Copse is a big challenge even though there's run-off – you go so quick that if anything goes wrong there, you'll be lucky if you get off lightly. And then the change of direction through Maggots and Becketts is a lot of fun.

Slowing it down through the final part of that is the key to make sure you get the exit onto the Hangar Straight as well – it's about finding a rhythm through those sweeping parts. All of this puts a lot of strain on the front-left tyre and we've seen some issues here in the past.

Abbey is the one that is flat-out, but if you're tucked in behind someone in race conditions it can be on the edge. Overtaking is also very possible with the new loop that's not very new anymore – Turn 3 if you fancy a lunge, Turn 6 as well.

Maybe the hardest corner on the circuit is Brooklands, a big braking zone where it's easy to just trail a bit of brake into the apex and snatch a wheel there. It's so good as an overtaking area but also an easy area to make a little mistake.

“There is an important change to the compound choices for this event,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “In fact, Pirelli has gone with the C2 as hard, the C3 as medium and the C4 as soft, which is a step softer than last year.

“The aim, shared with the FIA, F1 and the teams, is to create a wider range of strategy options for the race. In 2024, when the C3 was the soft, it was used by just a few drivers in the closing stages of the race following the rain.

“This year, as the medium, it is bound to play an important role, probably in several phases of the race. For those aiming for a one-stop race, the stints will have to be managed very carefully, while accepting a longer total race time.

“Also a consideration in this equation is the fact that the time taken for a tyre change is not very long (around 20.5 seconds) and while challenging, overtaking is possible.”

In terms of track conditions, the tyre manufacturer adds: “The circuit is in almost year round use with four and two-wheeled racing categories and so it provides good grip right from Friday's first free practice session, aided by the fact the surface is rated medium-low in terms of abrasiveness.

“Despite taking place at the height of summer, the English weather can often be unpredictable with very changeable temperatures and wind and rain suddenly putting in an appearance, turning the tables during the race, as was the case last year.”

McLaren were very much the team to beat last time out in Austria – and it was Lando Norris who led home team mate Oscar Piastri in a 1-2 result, with Piastri's advantage over the Briton in the Drivers' Championship now standing at 15 points.

Following their collision one race earlier in Canada, the pair managed to keep it clean as a thrilling race-long fight played out between them at the Red Bull Ring. Will they again manage to avoid getting too close during their home weekend at Silverstone?

It will also be a home event for Norris – after returning to the top step in Spielberg, can the Briton carry forward his momentum, or will Piastri add a sixth victory of the season to his name?

Max Verstappen, meanwhile, saw his own title charge take a dramatic hit in Austria after exiting the race on Lap 1 via a collision with the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, meaning that he has now lost significant ground to the McLaren pair.

Just nine points behind Verstappen in the standings is George Russell, another driver preparing for his home race. While Austria could not match the highs of the Briton's victory in Canada, the Mercedes driver will be hoping for a strong outing in front of his local crowd.

Silverstone will also welcome back Lewis Hamilton following his emotional triumph at his home circuit in 2024, the seven-time World Champion clinching a record-breaking ninth win at the venue.

This year, the race will be Hamilton's first at home since his switch to Ferrari. The Briton just missed out on a podium in Spielberg with a P4 result – could he achieve his debut rostrum in red at one of his favourite tracks?

Elsewhere, Williams are in need of a good weekend following a double DNF at the Red Bull Ring. The Grove-based outfit continue to hold fifth place in the Teams' Standings but, given the close and changeable nature of the midfield fight, will be hoping to top up their points tally in order to keep their rivals at bay.

Ahead of this year's British Grand Prix, we're taking you back some 17 years to the 2008 event and Lewis Hamilton's sublime first home win.

Hamilton ended a tricky Qualifying session down in fourth, behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, Red Bull's Mark Webber and pole-sitting McLaren team mate Heikki Kovalainen, leaving him with work to do on race day.

However, a blistering getaway from a damp grid saw him jump to second by Turn 1 and, after an initial scrap with Kovalainen through the first few corners, the lead was his in a matter of laps.

From there, it was quite simply the Hamilton show, with the youngster storming into the distance and expertly managing further downpours to finish more than a minute clear of his nearest rival, and having lapped everyone up to P4.

Take a look at all of the odds for this weekend's British Grand Prix, from polesitters to race winners and everything in between.

Formula 1 moves on from Spielberg to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix, with title challenger Lando Norris one of several home drivers targeting success. But what do the odds tell us about the weekend ahead? Read on to find out...

Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet.

The McLaren drivers are back on top of the podium in this category. Norris redeemed himself after his mishap in Montreal to take the chequered flag at the Red Bull Ring and close the gap on his team mate in the championship.

Norris is yet to stand on top of the podium at his home Grand Prix, but he has come close in the last two editions, with a runner-up and top-three return.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri finished fourth on his last visit to Silverstone, but has matured significantly over the past 12 months, registering nine podiums this campaign, including five victories.

Red Bull's Max Verstappen suffered his first DNF of the season in Austria, after being taken out by Kimi Antonelli on the opening lap, and is back at a venue where he has only taken the spoils on two occasions.

Mercedes' drivers are always worth considering at Silverstone, considering their impressive record of nine victories in the last 13 races in England. However, their top dog George Russell has faced some struggles at this venue, producing a best return of fifth, despite growing up only two hours from the track.

The top three drivers in the standings are heavily favoured to snatch a podium this weekend. These individuals have accumulated 23 podiums between them this campaign, but Verstappen lines up after registering his maiden DNF of 2025.

Charles Leclerc is spraying champagne regularly at the moment, entering the top three in three of his previous four starts. The Monegasque's recent consistency results in an average finish of 3.8, highlighting his threat to the rostrum.

Lewis Hamilton returns home with an astounding record of 12 consecutive podiums at this track. The seven-time World Champion is the defending champion in the United Kingdom, and despite his wobbly form this year, remains a contender.

Hamilton is still hunting his maiden Sunday podium with Ferrari, and he has a great chance to do it here.

The papaya duo boast the most top sixes in the championship, with 10 apiece. Piastri has been inside that threshold in every start since Shanghai, while a DNF in Montreal is Norris' only blemish.

Rookie Antonelli is a six-time top-six finisher this term, including a maiden F1 top three in Canada. However, he's proven erratic in recent rounds, failing to finish three of his last five starts on Sunday and ending 18th in Monaco.

Alex Albon blasted into 2025 with three top-six outings in his first seven starts, before his campaign was doused and brought back to reality. The Thai-British driver has earned a DNF next to his name in the previous three races, but he was only culpable in Spain, when he collided with Liam Lawson.

Albon's vehicle let him down in Montreal and Austria, and brought about a bigger discussion about what's going on at Williams. His team mate Carlos Sainz couldn't even start the showdown at Spielberg after his brakes overheated and burst into flames after the formation lap.

Besides the aforementioned event winner, podium, and top six favourites, we turn our focus to two veterans to lead the charge for a top 10.

Fernando Alonso is starting to develop consistency in his Aston Martin, with three consecutive top 10s, including back-to-back seventh places in Canada and Austria. The other seasoned campaigner is Nico Hulkenberg, who is also on a run of three races inside the top 10.

Haas' senior driver, Esteban Ocon, continues to compete for a spot in the first 10. The Frenchman has registered the feat five times in 2025, three in his previous four races.

Racing Bulls pilot Lawson appears to have set aside the drama from earlier in the season, claiming top 10s in 50% of his last four races. The New Zealander starts after a career-best sixth place at the Red Bull Ring.

Credit must also go to another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto, who fought hard for his maiden F1 top 10 in the last round.

The MCL39 continues to outclass its rivals over one lap this season. Norris recorded the team's seventh pole position in the previous round, taking his tally to three.

Norris has started at the front of the grid in two of his past four races, while his Aussie team mate has qualified fastest in four rounds this year.
Meanwhile, Verstappen is a three-time fastest qualifier after 11 rounds, but enters after lining up in seventh in the Styrian Alps.

The Dutchman's fierce rival, Russell, is the only other driver to start on pole this season, proving consistent by qualifying among the fastest three in five rounds. The Briton's starting grid average sits at 4.45 this year, slightly below Verstappen's at 3.18.

Leclerc started in second in Austria, the third such grid position for the Monegasque this season. The previous round also marked the best Qualifying for Ferrari this year, with both drivers ending inside the top five for the first time.

German drivers and cars have won nine of the last 13 British Grands Prix.

Hamilton was the latest victor for Mercedes, but will now defend his title in a red Italian car. Verstappen, Sainz, and Sebastian Vettel are the only non-Mercedes drivers to prevail in England since 2013. That leaves Red Bull and Ferrari with two triumphs apiece in the last 12 years.

McLaren last won the Silverstone showcase in 2008, when a young Hamilton was on their payroll. The Woking-based outfit may have struggled on home soil for 16 years, but they are the team to beat this time around. After 11 rounds, the papayas have won 72.73% of the Teams' trophies on offer, including three in their last four outings.

Lawrence Barretto takes us into one of the world's most famous residences after Formula 1 was hosted by No.10 Downing Street ahead of the 2025 British Grand Prix.

As I passed through security and walked along Downing Street towards No.10, I could spy Larry the cat – officially known as Chief Mouser to the British government's cabinet office, who has been in residence for more than a decade – lying curled up on the cobbles, enjoying the afternoon summer sunshine.

He seemed unmoved by the fact there were two Formula 1 cars – a McLaren and Williams – parked outside his front door and a gaggle of photographers jostled for position behind steel barriers waiting to snap today's visitors walking through one of the most famous doors in the world.

Just a few days out from the British Grand Prix – which hosted Formula 1's first-ever race back in 1950 – the Formula 1 community convened at No.10 Downing Street for a special reception to celebrate 75 years of the sport and highlight the impact F1 has had on the British economy.

It was the first time a Prime Minister had held such an event with F1, as in the past it had usually been cabinet ministers who represented the PM in discussions – and thus this was something of a red letter day for Formula 1.

Haas drivers Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon, plus Williams racer Alex Albon (to be joined later by his team mate Carlos Sainz, who was late arriving because of a delayed flight) were in attendance.

They were soon joined outside No.10 by F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, plus several motorsport apprentices and graduates, for photos and a quick chat before everyone filed inside.

A reception was hosted in the Prime Minister's well-tended and blooming garden – and this featured more than a 100 of the F1 community, including senior team leaders Flavio Briatore, Ayao Komatsu, James Vowles, Jonathan Wheatley and Andy Cowell.

New entrant Cadillac's new boss Graeme Lowdon was also in attendance, alongside F1 Academy boss Susie Wolff and Silverstone Managing Director Stuart Pringle. And there were World Champions aplenty, including Sir Jackie Stewart, Jenson Button and Damon Hill.

While the guests mingled, Starmer and Domenicali had a chat as the Prime Minister checked out the Drivers' and Teams' World Championship trophies. There would be time to catch up in private one-to-one later, but before that, there were speeches to be done.

Domenicali was up first, the sport's President and CEO highlighting how connected the sport feels with the country, from the more than 6,000 people employed in F1 in the UK to the 4,500 companies working in the sport.

There are around 41,000 jobs linked to F1, and 25,000 highly skilled engineers in the country. Overall, he said the sport generates over £12 billion to the UK economy ""as well as helping the country remain a leader in world-class innovation, technology and skills"".

He closed with this: ""I believe we are a fantastic business card for this country around the world, and I look forward to our future together.""

Starmer very warmly welcomed the sport, saying: ""This is the very centre of government. It's where I work every day. It's also my home, it's where I live. So you're very welcome here, and take the fact that we want you here in the heart of government as a statement of intent.""

He later added: ""I'm really proud of what Formula 1 does for our country – not just that technology, not just that innovation, not just the money into our economy and the sheer joy it gives to so many people, but the soft power and global reputation that it gives the United Kingdom.

""And this is really important. It's part of Brand Britain. And that's why I think today is about coming in to celebrate the last 75 years, which I'm really proud of.""

After welcoming tens of thousands of visitors in the Dutch capital already, the Formula 1 Exhibition is staying in Amsterdam for six more weeks.

The Formula 1 Exhibition is extending its stay in Amsterdam by a final six weeks because of incredible demand.

After welcoming tens of thousands of visitors since opening, and receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback, the internationally acclaimed exhibition will now remain at De Kromhouthal in Amsterdam-Noord in the Dutch capital through Sunday, September 7 2025.

The extension means F1 Exhibition remains in Amsterdam one week beyond the Dutch Grand Prix, giving fans the perfect opportunity to enjoy both unmissable events together in the Netherlands.

F1 Exhibition offers an engaging look into 75 years of Formula 1 history, highlighting how the sport has evolved from technical innovation to the personal journeys of its greatest icons.

Visitors explore this rich legacy across seven thematic rooms, featuring standout pieces such as Max Verstappen's 2021 title-winning RB16B, Jim Clark's Dutch Grand Prix-winning Lotus 33, and the dramatic wreckage of Romain Grosjean's Haas from his 2020 crash in Bahrain.

The European tour has already enjoyed successful runs in major cities including Madrid, Vienna, and London, while in the Americas the show opened to critical acclaim in Toronto and Buenos Aires – each showcasing legendary cars, cutting-edge innovations, personal stories, and interactive experiences for fans of all ages, including racing simulators.

“It's fantastic news that the exhibition is being extended – a clear sign of how much it resonates with fans,” said former F1 driver, and ambassador of the F1 Exhibition Amsterdam, Robert Doornbos. “As an ambassador, I'm incredibly proud to be part of an experience that brings the sport to life in such a powerful and inspiring way.”

Jonathan Linden, Co-CEO Round Room Live and Producer of The Formula 1 Exhibition, commented: “We are delighted with the popularity of the Formula 1 Exhibition in Amsterdam and are thrilled to extend our run there.

""With the Dutch Grand Prix coming up as well as the summer holidays in Amsterdam, we expect a high-demand for the newly released tickets and look forward to sharing the experience with even more fans.”

Visitors start by entering Once Upon a Time in Formula 1, where legendary cars including the Sauber C17, Williams FW13B and Fernando Alonso's Ferrari F10 are displayed, while in Drivers & Duels legendary rivalries come alive.

Design Lab explores the ground-breaking technologies driving the sport forward, with Revolution by Design showing the technological advances the sport has gone through in the past 75 years, before The Pit Wall delivers an immersive 360° multimedia experience capturing the thrill and strategy of a race weekend.

Each element of the Formula 1 Exhibition is carefully curated to captivate and entertain fans of all generations – a unique and unforgettable experience for every motorsport enthusiast.

The Amsterdam edition also features an exclusive local highlight: Dutch Drive – a tribute to Circuit Zandvoort and the Dutch Grand Prix. This room celebrates the Netherlands' deep motorsport heritage and the passionate ‘Orange Army' that has embraced the sport.

For more about exhibits in Amsterdam and for ticket information, head to the Formula 1 Exhibition website.

An upcoming, behind-the-scenes documentary series will chart the Cadillac Formula 1 Team's arrival in the sport.

It has been announced that filmmaker and motorsport enthusiast Keanu Reeves will front a documentary series showcasing the behind-the-scenes story of the Cadillac Formula 1 Team's effort to join the F1 grid.

Backed by TWG Motorsports and General Motors (GM), Cadillac are preparing to enter F1 from the 2026 campaign, having received final approval to become the sport's 11th team back in March.

With exclusive access granted by the Cadillac Formula 1 Team, TWG Motorsports and GM, the series will trace the creation of F1's newest operation as they get set to debut at next year's season opener in Australia.

Reeves' own KR+SH company will partner with North One on the production, with the Hollywood star serving as host and executive producer a few months on from his Emmy win for the acclaimed Disney+ docuseries Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story.

It will be developed by Emmy-winning director and executive producer Simon Hammerson and three-time BAFTA-winning executive producer Neil Duncanson.

Audiences are promised “an intimate look at the unique challenges of assembling a competitive team on an accelerated timeline”, while receiving “a first-hand account of the vision behind establishing a distinctly American presence in a sport long dominated by European powerhouses”.

The series is set to air before Cadillac's debut at Melbourne's Albert Park in March 2026.

“I'm very honored and excited to be a part of telling the remarkable Cadillac Formula 1 Team story and its incredible journey into the world of Formula 1 racing,” said Reeves.

“Our goal with the docuseries is to bring audiences into the heart of this journey and showcase what it takes to participate in one of the most exclusive sports arenas in the world.”

Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports and the Cadillac Formula 1 Team, said: “This is a story of bold ambition and relentless drive. We're honored to work with Keanu, whose passion and knowledge of racing runs deep, and proud to partner with GM on this incredible story.

“We have an opportunity to welcome a new generation of fans to Formula 1 and Keanu's creativity is the perfect spark to ignite that journey.”

Mark Reuss, GM President, added: “General Motors and TWG Motorsports joined forces on a bold mission – to build a uniquely American Formula 1 team.

“It's a thrill to have Keanu Reeves document the Cadillac Formula 1 Team's journey to our first season in the FIA Formula One World Championship.”

Cadillac, who are yet to name either of their two drivers for 2026, will initially use Ferrari power units when they enter the sport, before running their own engines in the future.

Fernando Alonso was quick to praise rookie Gabriel Bortoleto after finishing just ahead of the Brazilian in the Austrian Grand Prix.

Fernando Alonso was full of praise for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto after the Brazilian rookie collected his first F1 points in Austria, with the duo engaging in an entertaining duel late on in Spielberg.

With Alonso on his way to a strong seventh-placed finish in the race, Bortoleto – who belongs to the Aston Martin man's Driver Management programme – charged up behind and came incredibly close to picking off Alonso on the very last lap.

With the Aston Martin man opting for the one-stop in Austria, and with Bortoleto's tyres 16 laps fresher, the Spanish two-time World Champion defended hard against his mentee.

However, luck was also on Alonso's side as race winner Lando Norris closed in to take the chequered flag, meaning both had to cede to the McLaren.

Not only did that hand Alonso DRS, but it also ensured that the battling cars took the chequered flag behind Norris and thus had one lap less to complete.

Alonso certainly used all his experience to hang onto P7 – but afterwards, he was as overjoyed for his young charge as he was about his own result, going straight to the Brazilian for a heartwarming hug as they climbed out of their cars in parc ferme.

“Incredible, happy for him,” Alonso said about Bortoleto's first points in F1.

“Gabi was outstanding the whole season, for one reason or another [Nico] Hulkenberg was then scoring the points on Sunday. But I think [Bortoleto] deserved maybe before this one to score already but I hope for him it is the first of many.

“The first points in Formula 1, they taste always very special.“

As for how his race unfolded, Alonso was full of praise for his team, who succesfully tried the one-stop, even with track temperatures hitting 50C and tyre degradation extremely high as a result.

“It was intense,"" Alonso explained. ""Look, the first thing was the strategy. The team was right, the one-stop strategy was the one to go for today, it was the fastest as I was not as fast as the Kick Sauber or the Haas and I still finished in front of them.

“The one-stop was the right choice, good pit stop, good timing as well. And then at the end I got lucky as when Gabi came with a lot better pace, I had Norris with the blue flags so Gabi could not attack me on the last laps. And it meant the race was one lap shorter as, by letting Norris go, we saw the chequered flag so all in all, it was a perfect combo for us.”

Lance Stroll was unable to score on Sunday, coming home 14th for Aston Martin, who remain eighth in the Championship. Thanks to Alonso's points though, they have closed up to Haas and are just one point behind the American outfit heading into Silverstone.

	The Jurassic franchise was, clearly, ready for a new era. 


	The previous Jurassic World film, 2022's Dominion, garnered the weakest reviews and poorest box office of the sequel trilogy (though still managed to top $1 billion). Some thought Universal's dino franchise might be put into cryo storage for a decade. But executive producer Steven Spielberg wasn't ready to let his creation go extinct, and tapped his longtime go-to screenwriter David Koepp to design a new adventure in the saga — Jurassic World Rebirth, which opens this week and stars Scarlett Johansson as a mercenary seeking to retrieve some dino blood samples on a forgotten island that has ties to the original park.

	Koepp co-wrote the beloved 1993 first film (based on Michael Crichton's bestseller) and penned its sequel, 1997's The Lost World: Jurassic Park. His other credits include 1996's Mission: Impossible (and has quite an entertaining idea for a new sequel for that franchise, as you'll read below), 2002's Spider-Man, 2002's Panic Room, 2005's War of the Worlds, and the last two Indiana Jones films.


	Spend a few minutes chatting with the bespectacled 62-year-old industry veteran, and you understand why the world's most acclaimed director has worked with him on roughly a dozen projects. Koepp comes across affable, clever and pragmatically flexible to the sometimes frustrating needs of the industry. But he's also perfectly blunt about what he thinks will work in a story — or won't — as well as his own limitations. 


	“I can only go with what works for me,” Koepp says. “What it works or doesn't for others, that doesn't matter. You have to be sincere … You can only write what you can write.” 

	











So you rewatched all the Jurassic movies to prepare for this. What did that tell you in terms of what works and what doesn't work, in this franchise?


	What I was struck by was that every three movies there's an opportunity to change the tone, characters and ideas. The first Jurassic Park was an incredible feat of imagination. All these movies exist because Michael Crichton had a genius idea, right? The first Jurassic World, okay, that was also a great imagining. So this felt like a license to start with new people and a tone I was comfortable with.


	But what was more important was I re-read both of Crichton's novels — Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Because I was like, “How am I going to come up with stuff that feels new? I've done this twice, but it's been a while.” When I re-read the books, I was like, “Oh, I remember this feeling.” The books are different in tone than the movie Jurassic Park because Crichton's and Spielberg are very different people with different worldviews. [With Jurassic Park], we did something that was not quite as dark, and certainly hoped it was funny and but still had to be grounded in real science. As I was rereading the novels, I started taking tons of notes, because I was like: It's all still here.


So Rebirth feels like: Let's get away from dinosaurs in the real world, and get away from forgetting that dinosaurs are mostly scary monsters, and get away from the idea that velociraptors are your buddies that you go biking with. 












	Well, I felt like in the in the last film, in particular, they took that idea all the way. Dinosaurs were nesting on the Chrysler Building and renting apartments downtown. I didn't have a single idea about where to go with that. But I wanted to respect what occurred in the first six movies, because I hate when you watch a franchise movie and they gaslight you and say, “No, that never happened.” Or, “That was a timeline.” I hate that shit. So I said, “No, that all happened, but I want to make them special again. How do we do that?” I wanted us to be back in their environment instead of them in ours.


	Then, in re-reading the books, I found the perfect justification. There's a great speech which I just popped into the script, which was that we think these things are going to live here now, but we forget that this is a different planet. Our landscape is completely different except this narrow band where the environment is somewhat similar to what it used to be [where dinosaurs can survive]. So let's make dinosaurs exotic and special so that we have to go seek them out instead of, you know, fighting with them over a cab.


Sure, but to give credit where it's due, you introduced the idea of dinosaurs coming into our world with the ending of Jurassic Park 2, when the T. Rex shows up in San Diego. But also to your credit, you only gave us a brief taste of what that would be like.


	Yeah, once you have a T. Rex drinking out of your pool and eating your dog, there's not much more you can do. 

	











One thing I liked in Rebirth is the movie isn't overly interested in expanding the franchise mythology. There's a small percentage of moviegoers who geek out on those details, but most just want a good story where you can stay present and not have to think about random callbacks or heavy exposition. 


	The working title of the script was Survival. I wanted to keep my eye very much on that with every single character fighting to survive once they get to the island. And the animals, of course, are fighting to survive. So when you got that going for you, don't need to goose it. These are people trying to not die. That's a big story.


Speaking of the title, I was really curious about this: Did you consider calling the film Jurassic Park Rebirth instead of Jurassic World Rebirth? Because you're obviously trying to resurrect of the spirit of the first film and the story has much closer story ties to the original franchise than the World movies.


	That would have been a great idea. Where were you? I thought maybe we should have a whole new name, you know, Jurassic Era, something like that. But [choosing the title] was above my pay grade. There are corporate destinies at stake.


The idea of people don't care about dinosaurs anymore is also in the film and it seems almost like a meta commentary on trying to relaunch the franchise.


	I think they also used that first in the first or second Jurassic World movie too, where they were making gigantic, weird things, because there was idea inflation. So yeah, it's a little meta. But all these movies are. In the first Jurassic Park, there's a shot that pans lovingly over the dinosaur pajamas and Jurassic Park lunch boxes in the visitors center — that was actual merchandise that was going to come from the movie. There is a circularity to writing a movie about theme park people.

	











That reminds me of my favorite shot in Jurassic Park. The CG shot of a velociraptor where there are 1s and 0s reflected on its head from a computer screen below. It evokes not only their genetic creation origins, but also how Jurassic Park was the dawn of the digital age of filmmaking, all in one shot. 


	Oh, that had that aspect hasn't occurred to me, but yeah.


Spielberg was apparently heavily involved in Rebirth. It does surprise me a bit that at this point in his career — and with everything else he's working on — that he would still get out of bed for a Jurassic movie. 


	I've done 10 or 12 movies with Steven over the years, and I think his favorite part is making them up. The part where you say, “Hey, do you think it would be cool if…” That's the part where I still find him so engaged, whether it's a movie he's directing or not. So I get why he would want to — because these are fun. He and I enjoy working together. He the one who started this [franchise]. It's his. So I think he felt a certain care and responsibility to ask, “How can this go on? What would make it really good?”


What was important to Steven to have in the film? 


	That it should be scary. We should see some things that we've never seen before. Let's make the science as close to real as we can. And something that is important to him with everything — but in this movie in particular — he really wanted to avoid anything that was a self reference. He does not like to quote himself. He's allergic to it. If you put something in that rings too familiar, he'll say, “Didn't I already do that? Don't do that.” 

	











That's interesting as there's a sequence with your heroes on a boat where they're hunting a dinosaur that definitely has Jaws vibes. 


	Maybe a little. But it doesn't feel like it's redoing anything from Jurassic. Steven had the idea of, “What if a Mosasaurus was depleting fishing grounds?” Then we ran with the idea. But what I loved was this you wouldn't expect is a 25-minute sea going adventure in the middle of this movie. I felt like it was kind of Creature from the Black Lagoon — a bunch of people on a boat go looking for something weird. I find that sequence exhilarating. It's beautifully shot and acted, and gorgeous to look at. It had scope and awe — which was another thing that was important to Steven to recapture, if possible. Because there are moments where you feel moved by how beautiful dinosaurs are, and that they're majestic, but we can't forget they should also be very scary and sometimes want to eat us. 


I remember seeing that original film as a kid and thinking, “That was amazing, but I can't believe they didn't have the raft scene from the book.” So it's no surprise that's my favorite sequence in the new film. That had to be satisfying to finally get to add that.


	You know when you have to sneeze and you can't? I've had that feeling for 32 years about the raft scene. In the first movie, Steven and I had talked about it. I think he'd storyboarded it. And I had put it in the very first draft. It quickly had to get dropped because it didn't quite fit the structure, and it definitely didn't fit the budget. Also, in 1992, doing CG water was still really hard. Showing a T. Rex in the first place was going to be groundbreaking, and nobody knew if we could do it or not. Doing a T. Rex swimming was off the table right away. So it was enormously satisfying to put that in. When I wrote it for this movie, I was almost just transcribing what's in the book, because it's a perfect scene.

	











Scarlett Johansson did a great job. So I read the character was originally written to be gender neutral? (Director Gareth Edwards suggested this in an interview).


	No, she was always a woman. What self-respecting writer would write: “A character — and I can't tell you what kind of person she is”? You gotta make some choices. But yeah, she was great. I try not to think about actors when I'm writing the early drafts. But I didn't dare to think of her anyway because she's a very popular actress. She the only person we talked to, and urgently wanted to do it. She also had some really savvy notes, which I was happy to implement. She's so comfortable with the action and running and sliding and screaming and looking scared and being mad — all things that you have to do that are hard in these movies. You have to be physically capable. My favorite moment of hers is she's rappelling down a cliff, and she zips into the frame and says, “It's fun, isn't it?” and then keeps zipping out of frame.


What were couple of her notes?


	I wish I had something great to offer but I can't remember specifically. But when a good actor comes in, they behave like their character's lawyer. They say, “I don't believe my client would do that,” or, “My client is underrepresented in this portion.” And you're like, “You're right, for 14 pages I kind of forgot about her.” Then you go through and you do a draft looking at it solely from that character's point of view. It really liberates you, because you're not balancing everybody's needs, you're just thinking about that one character. I felt like her character got a lot better. 

	











Without giving away any spoilers, it's fair to say the film's ending doesn't leave you with a cliffhanger to set up a new trilogy. I liked that it was very, “Here's the end. If we do more, we'll let you know.” 


	That was a specific conversation we had. Do we need to throw to the future in this? I thought occasionally about planting a little something here or there that might be helpful. But honestly, it's a bad idea to do that, and they're the first things to [get cut from a script] if they're remotely in the way. It is so hard to make one good movie — speaking as someone who's both succeeded and failed at making a good movie. There are so many ways to go awry. Thinking about the future is like the dumbest thing you can do. So it was: Let's make this work. If it works, people will like it. And then maybe there can be another one.


Going back to the first movie, two famous changes in the original film from the book is that both Ian Malcom and John Hammond live. I always thought Hammond arguably should have died. But curious, as the writer, did you agree with both those changes or were they Spielberg's? 


	I was in favor of both those. When we started discussing our tone at the very beginning, we decided our Hammond is a bit more of Walt Disney than the more selfish, dark character that he is in the book. You can kill him in the book because he's got it coming. The character in the movie is misguided. The worst thing he does is he's a bit doddering. Ian Malcolm I was never going to kill, because I love that guy. He's so useful — funny and smart and carries the science.

	











You're also the writer on Steven's intriguing new UFO project. What can you tease about that one? 


	I can say that we're going with a really snazzy title, Untitled, at the moment. It comes out in June. That's all I'm supposed to say.


Okay, let me ask this then: Did the events depicted in Close Encounters of the Third Kind also occur in the world of this film?


	Like I'm going to answer that. Sorry Woodward! You're trying to trick me into confirming something that I don't want to confirm. 


Fair enough. You also have the sci-fi movie Cold Storage coming up (which stars Liam Neeson, Joe Kerry and Georgina Campbell and is about security guards trying to stop a deadline fungus before it destroys humanity). 


	That I can talk about that. It's based on the first novel I wrote. Comes out in February. I think it turned out wonderfully and I'm very happy with it. It's horror movie that's very funny and rather sweet — that's a hard balance to hit. But the director, Jonny Campbell, and the terrific cast really got it.


Indiana Jones franchise. That's done, right? 


	Well, I don't see it continuing. Everybody made it pretty clear. Harrison was like, [Harrison Ford impression] “Yeah, I'm done.” So it would need to be somebody's brand new idea about how to come at that. I'd watch it as a streaming show. Streaming is perfectly suited to a serial adventure, which is what Indiana Jones was. He could have a season-long goal and you don't have to wrap up the story every week like with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. But I think their plan is to just let it be for a while. 

	











Speaking of being done: Tom Cruise suggests he's done with Mission: Impossible. You co-wrote the first movie. What do you think Paramount should do with that franchise? 


	This is something [the first film's director, Brian De Palma] and I have talked about. I know exactly what they should do, and I would be happy to write it. I think that they should make a film with Tom playing that character that opens with a great, big extended action sequence. He gets himself in a terrible pickle. He fell off a rocket. How's he gonna get out of this one? He's falling to Earth. He's pulling out Swiss Army knives. He's spreading his skin out to slow his fall. Doing all sorts of clever things. But it's all for naught because he smashes into the ground and dies. The film ends. It's a 16-minute film.

After punk duo Bob Vylan chanted ""death to the IDF"" live on air, the BBC has vowed to take action to ""ensure proper accountability"" for those found to be responsible for the broadcast.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	The BBC deemed punk duo Bob Vylan “high risk” before their outcry-sparking Glastonbury set, the U.K. public broadcaster said Thursday as it vowed to take action to prevent future controversies.


	The British act has drawn outrage for chanting “death, death to the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces]” on the U.K. music festival's West Holts stage.




	After widespread condemnation from the likes of Glastonbury organizer Emily Eavis and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who denounced the “appalling hate speech,” the BBC — Glastonbury's TV partner — released a statement expressing its “regrets” for not pulling the live stream of the set.

	Now, the BBC has vowed to take action to “ensure proper accountability.” BBC News reported that a number of staff members have been moved off their day-to-day duties from the music and live events team.

	BBC Chair Samir Shah said the decision not to pull the feed as it aired was “unquestionably an error of judgment.”


	Meanwhile, BBC Director-General Tim Davie has weighed in, saying he “deeply regrets that such offensive and deplorable behavior appeared on the BBC” and said he wanted to “apologize to our viewers and listeners, and in particular the Jewish community.”


	The BBC said Thursday that Bob Vylan were “deemed high risk following a risk assessment process applied to all acts appearing at Glastonbury,” and that seven acts were included in the category but deemed suitable for live streaming with “appropriate mitigations.”

	











	The statement added: “Prior to Glastonbury, a decision was taken that compliance risks could be mitigated in real time on the live stream — through the use of language or content warnings — without the need for a delay. This was clearly not the case.”


	The BBC explained that the live stream was monitored “in line with the agreed compliance protocols and a number of issues were escalated.” But when warnings appeared on the stream on two occasions, “the editorial team took the decision not to cut the feed. This was an error.”


	Davie was “subsequently made aware of what had happened and instructed the team that none of the performance should feature in further coverage.”


	Immediate changes being made to the BBC's live streaming of music events include those deemed high-risk not being broadcast live, and more detailed, practical guidance on the threshold for withdrawing a live stream.


	Shah apologized “to all our viewers and listeners and particularly the Jewish community for allowing the ‘artist' Bob Vylan to express unconscionable antisemitic views live on the BBC.”


The Hollywood Reporter reported earlier this week that the act has been dropped from Europe music festivals as well as from United Talent Agency, and their U.S. visas have been revoked.


	Bob Vylan responded to the controversy via Instagram on Tuesday, saying they felt like they'd been “targeted for speaking up.”


	“We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people,” Bob Vylan said. “We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine. We, like those in the spotlight before us, are not the story. We are a distraction from the story, and whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction.”

Christian Jungen and key partners acquire ZFF from NZZ Group, aiming to position it among Europe's top-tier film festivals.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


The Zurich Film Festival (ZFF) is set to enter a new chapter following a management buyout of festival owners the NZZ group, led by Zurich festival director Christian Jungen. The buyout, unveiled on Thursday, ends a decade-long partnership between the festival and the Swiss media group.


	Jungen is joined in the buyout by festival vice director Reta Guetg, Swiss entrepreneur and TV host Max Loong, long-time ZFF President Felix E. Müller, and finance expert Marek Skreta. The new owners plan to take the Zurich festival to the next level, elevating the event to the top tier of European film festivals.

	“I am excited to lead the ZFF into a new era together with our current team and new owners who love cinema and know the festival inside out,” said Jungen in a statement. “We are a Zurich-based solution that has the trust of our partners and the filmmaking community. We are thinking big and we are thinking internationally. Our goal is to position the ZFF as one of Europe's premier film events, where audiences can see the films and stars that will go on to win Oscars later in the season. We want to bring joy and a celebratory atmosphere to the city and host a festival that Zurich can be proud of. To achieve this, we will secure new private partners and expand support from foundations, donors, and public institutions.”

	NZZ, which acquired the Zurich film festival ten years ago, will remain a key partner for the next three years, the new owners said. NZZ CEO Felix Graf described the move as a step toward further professionalization while preserving the festival's existing framework.


	The new leadership team combines deep festival experience with international business acumen. Jungen has overseen the ZFF's artistic direction since 2019, after spending a decade as a journalist at NZZ. Guetg, who has led industry and programming at ZFF for ten years, brings strong ties to the international film community. Müller, also editor-in-chief of NZZ am Sonntag, authored a book on the ZFF's history and is a central figure in Swiss cultural life. Loong and Skreta add expertise in sponsorship, hospitality, and global festival strategy, with Skreta having ties to the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.


	The ZFF, which drew 140,000 visitors last year, will stage its 21st edition Sept. 25-Oct. 5.

The former Beatles drummer said that scenes depicting his first wife needed to be tweaked to make them more accurate.

Ringo Starr is all about peace and love. But the Beatles legend who has made mellow vibes his calling card for half a century had to share some tough love with director Sam Mendes when the pair met in London earlier this year to discuss the filmmaker's ambitious four-part Fab Four biopic project.

	Speaking to The New York Times, the drummer who will turn 85 on Monday (July 7) described sitting down with Mendes for two days in April to go over the script for the film in which Saltburn star Barry Keoghan will play the band's timekeeper. The paper reported that the pair went over the script for the Ringo film line-by-line, with Starr offering up “extensive notes” to Mendes in an effort to get the story closer to the real thing.

	In particular, Starr had some pointed suggestions about scenes depicting his family and his first wife, Maureen Starkey Tigrett. “He had a writer — very good writer, great reputation, and he wrote it great, but it had nothing to do with Maureen and I,” Starr explained. “That's not how we were. I'd say, ‘We would never do that.'” Starr and Tigrett were married in 1965 and had three children, former Oasis/Who drummer Zak Starkey, son Jason and and daughter Lee, before splitting in 1975; Starr married actress/model Barbara Bach in 1981.

	Starr said he's much happier with how he's portrayed in the script now, even though he's not sure how Mendes will manage the monumental task of shooting the four films at the same time. “But he'll do what he's doing,” Starr said, “and I'll send him peace and love.”


	In addition to Keoghan portraying Starr, the cast of the films includes Harris Dickinson (Triangle of Sadness, The Iron Claw), who will portray John Lennon, Paul Mescal (Gladiator II, Aftersun) taking on Paul McCartney and Joseph Quinn (Gladiator II, The Fantastic Four: First Steps) suiting up as George Harrison. No other casting details have been announced so far. The scripts will be written by Tony Award-winner Jez Butterworth (Ford v Ferrari, Spectre) Oscar winner Peter Straughan (Conclave, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and BAFTA- and Tony Award-winner Jack Thorne (Adolescence, Enola Holmes).


	At press time it was still unknown how the workload on the four films will be spread among the writers, or if they will collaborate on all four films that are currently being referred to as The Beatles — A Four Film Cinematic Event. The movies marks the first time that Apple Corps. Ltd. and the Beatles have granted full life story and music rights to a scripted film, with each movie slated to tell the story of one of the members. A press release also revealed that all four movies — due out in early 2028 — will intersect to tell “the astonishing story of the greatest band in history.”

Andrew Frelon, who calls himself an ""adjunct"" member of the group, owned up to using Suno for the project but gave conflicting answers about how much the service was relied upon.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


A band called The Velvet Sundown has made waves in the music industry over the last week due to allegations that the images and songs on its Spotify profile were AI-generated. Now, in a new conversation with Rolling Stone, a so-called “adjunct” member of the band, Andrew Frelon, admits to using AI music company Suno in the creation of some of its songs, calling the whole project an “art hoax.”


	“It's marketing. It's trolling. People before, they didn't care about what we did, and now suddenly we're talking to Rolling Stone, so it's like ‘Is that wrong?'” Frelon told the outlet.


	Frelon reportedly changed his story multiple times during the interview. First, he said Suno's tools were only used in the brainstorming of the writing process; later, he admitted to using Suno but “not in the final product.” Later in the interview, he again changed his position, saying at least some of the songs were generated by Suno, but that he didn't “want to say which ones.” Of the tools in Suno's suite, Frelon cited using Persona, a product released in October 2024 that allows users to remix songs on the Suno platform into new genres and styles.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Persona tool was also recently employed by Timbaland in the creation of his controversial AI artist TaTa, which is part of the artist and producer's new AI entertainment company Stage Zero. (Timbaland has been a strategic advisor for Suno since October 2024.)


	“Personally, I'm interested in art hoaxes,” Frelon added in the interview. “The Leeds 13, a group of art students in the U.K., made, like, fake photos of themselves spending scholarship money at a beach or something like that, and it became a huge scandal. I think that stuff's really interesting … We live in a world now where things that are fake have sometimes even more impact than things that are real. And that's messed up, but that's the reality that we face now. So it's like, ‘Should we ignore that reality? Should we ignore these things that kind of exist on a continuum of real versus fake or kind of a blend between the two? Or should we dive into it and just let it be the emerging native language of the internet?'”


	The Velvet Sundown became a viral sensation last week after the band's Spotify profile was posted to Reddit by a user who accused the band of being AI-generated. At the time, Sundown's top song had just over 100,000 plays on the platform, but after the Reddit post spurred widespread discussion about the band — and AI music in general — listens for its top song have climbed to 675,000 and counting.


	The band is just one example of many, however. French streamer Deezer reported this spring that 18% of songs delivered to them every day are now fully AI-generated, equating to about 20,000 new AI songs daily.


	Last month, “A Million Colors” by Vinih Pray became the first-known AI-generated song to rank on the TikTok charts. The song, which has since been removed from TikTok, peaked at No. 44 on the TikTok Viral 50 and was used by hundreds of thousands of users on the platform, including Kylie Jenner, who used the song to soundtrack a makeup tutorial with 1.7 million likes. To date, it has over 1 million plays on Spotify.


	So far, most streaming services, including Spotify, do not have policies specific to AI music on their platforms. Among the streamers, Deezer has taken the lead. Since January, the company has spoken out about how the company plans to regulate AI content on the platform. Now, anything that Deezer's proprietary AI detection tool flags as fully AI-generated is removed from its algorithm and is ineligible for playlisting, although users can still listen to the tracks via search. All AI songs on the platform are also tagged to ensure that users know what they are listening to. The Velvet Sundown's artist page on Deezer currently displays this tag.

	The BBC has admitted that controversial punk duo Bob Vylan were deemed “high risk” before Glastonbury took place over the weekend, while the board has thrown its weight behind Director General Tim Davie and the “swift actions” he took on the day.


	BBC Chair Samir Shah and Davie also apologized to “viewers, listeners and particularly the Jewish community” over the debacle.


	In a statement on Glastonbury and from Shah to both staff and press, the corporation noted that Bob Vylan were one of seven acts “deemed suitable for live streaming with appropriate mitigations,” despite being in a “high risk” category.

					Bob Vylan Responds To Glastonbury Firestorm: ""We Are Not The Story...We Are Being Targeted For Speaking Up""		
			








	“Prior to Glastonbury, a decision was taken that compliance risks could be mitigated in real time on the live stream – through the use of language or content warnings – without the need for a delay,” said the BBC. “This was clearly not the case.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Going forwards, any performance deemed high risk will now not be broadcast live or streamed live, the BBC said, while editorial policy support will always be available on site at major music festivals and events. Deadline understands that senior staff involved in the output have stepped back from their roles temporarily, with The Times reporting that Lorna Clarke, the BBC's director of music, is among those stood down.


	“Given the failings that have been acknowledged we are taking actions to ensure proper accountability for those found to be responsible for those failings in the live broadcast,” added the BBC. “We will not comment further on those processes at this time.”


	The BBC again expressed regret for not cutting the live stream of Bob Vylan, while saying that “warnings appeared on the stream on two occasions and the editorial team took the decision not to cut the feed.” It added that the team on the day had prioritized “stopping the performance from featuring on demand.” The duo chanted “death to the IDF” and complained about working for a “f***ing Zionist” during their set. They are now being investigated by the police, have been dropped by UTA and had U.S. visas revoked.












	Today's acknowledgement that Bob Vylan had already been flagged as “high risk” will likely only lead to more questions for Davie and his team. Since Glastonbury, it has emerged that Davie was present on the day of Bob Vylan and controversial Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap's performance, and it was Davie who took the decision to remove Bob Vylan's performance from iPlayer.


Shah backs Davie


	Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the BBC has a “problem of leadership” in the wake of Glastonbury but today Shah and the board communicated their full support for Davie.


	Shah said the board had met on Tuesday to hear what actions were being taken and the “executive have agreed to put in place a set of strengthened editorial practices and policies for live music programming.”


	“The Board fully supports the Director-General and the swift actions taken by him and his team to identify these errors and address them,” said Shah. 


	He apologized to “all our viewers and listeners and particularly the Jewish community for allowing the ‘artist' Bob Vylan to express unconscionable antisemitic views live on the BBC.”


	Davie this week offered to meet with Jewish staff, many of whom have expressed fury at the debacle. Meanwhile, he is awaiting the report into the controversial Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone documentary, as pressure mounts.


	In his note to staff, he also apologized for “offensive and deplorable behaviour appearing on the BBC.”


	“I want to say sorry – to our audience and to all of you, but in particular to Jewish colleagues and the Jewish community,” said Davie. “We are unequivocal that there can be no place for antisemitism at the BBC. I and everyone need to ensure that the BBC is a role model for inclusivity and tolerance and we all have a part to play. We are utterly committed to creating an environment where everyone is supported and can do their very best work. Please continue to treat each other with respect and kindness.”

This music is awful. This is just a cover for that.

They need to be arrested . no bail. Terrorism has consequences!

They shouldn't be apologizing to the Jewish community; we do not all agree with Israel or its actions. Stop mixing up Zionism and Judaism, they are not the same!

You're not the BBC…they don't have to cater to your antisemitism. Keep crying

Good grief

The IDF is not “the Jewish Community”!! The IDF is a terrorist organization operated by a militant state. The Jewish people deserve so much better than to be lumped into a forced apology alongside this oppressive regime.

	Before landing her breakout role on Abbott Elementary, Janelle James had her sights set on another show.


	The Golden Globe nominee recently revealed she once auditioned for Netflix‘s GLOW (2017-'19) a role she's still “so salty” she didn't land, nearly five years after the streamer un-renewed the series for a fourth and final season amid the COVID-19 pandemic.


	“I haven't thought about this in a while,” she prefaced on the Let's Talk Off Camera podcast. “Another thing I was excited about that I auditioned for once was GLOW. Do you remember that? The female wrestling.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, GLOW (Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling) was inspired by the 1980s syndicated women's wrestling show of the same name, starring Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin and a talented female-led ensemble as struggling actresses who audition for the wrestling show.

	











	“I really wanted that role,” she told host Kelly Ripa. “It was for one of the female wrestlers and we had to make up an '80s rap and perform it in the audition, and also do a fight scene with ourselves. I did this rap and then I did a round kick. And I remember leaving that audition like, ‘Nailed it.' And did not get that role.


	James added, “I have not watched one second of that show. I'm so salty. Maybe I'll watch it today.”


	The comedian is likely not as salty as fans of the show, after Netflix renewed it for a fourth and final season in 2019, filming two episodes before the streamer reversed its renewal, explaining the pandemic made “shooting this physically intimate show with its large ensemble cast especially challenging.”

One of the hardest things – you can nail an audition, and just really earn a role, but then still not be the right person for it – and thats a hard thing to take, a lot easier when you kow you messed it up or just werent right for the part.
Probably the most famous alternate reality casting is the whole ‘Tom Selleck was chosen for Indian Jones but then couldnt get out of Magnum' thing – and whilst he was actually given the role, it still would have hurt Selleck a lot to lose it – but a healthy thing is to remember-  Raiders wouldnt have been Raiders without Harrison Ford – it would have been good and Selleck would have been good – but Ford made it the classic it is.
But also, Ford would have not been as interesting had he been cast in Magnum, that role needed Sellecks specific brand of charisma to work.
Its a hard and often demoralising process, but you just have to role with it and hope you day come – and Janelle James got exactly where she was best suited to be.

This is a kind and truthful post. I'm not an actor but even I felt better reading it. This is a tough business and perspective is often a difficult thing to achieve.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","G/O Media sells Kotaku and says it's ""winding down""","https://www.avclub.com/g-o-media-sells-kotaku-winding-down","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 00:21:00 GMT","

[Note: The A.V. Club was owned by G/O Media from 2019 to 2024. The author of this article is a former member of The Onion Union.]

Earlier today, news broke that private equity profit generator G/O Media was doing video game journalism site Kotaku the favor of selling it, and the rest of us the favor of announcing that the company as a whole would soon be “winding down.” Kotaku will now be owned by Swiss tech news company Keleops, which bought Gizmodo from G/O back in 2024, around the time the media conglomerate was entering a period of serious de-conglomerating—selling off The Takeout, The Onion, Deadspin, and a small cadre of dyspeptic malcontents who would really like to tell you about the latest TV shows, music, video games, books, and films currently colonizing our brains in the span of about three months.

News of the sale, and G/O's pending dissolution, managed to rate mention in The New York Times, which notes that company CEO Jim Spanfeller published an “epilogue” to G/O's legacy on the company blog. To connoisseurs of the Spanfeller School Of Business Writing—previously confined to those lucky enough to wake up to periodic “State Of The Company” emails from him clogging up their inboxes—it's a clear paragon of the form: Over-long, highly defensive, and largely concerned with the assigning of blame to proper parties (media unions, mostly) and away from the innocent (G/O Media CEO Jim Spanfeller).

Among other things, Spanfeller addresses that time the entire workforce of sports culture site Deadspin resigned in protest after being ordered to curtail its more wide-ranging focus “to cover just sports, sports related issues, as well as sports adjacent stories,” described in the blog as “the slightest of changes.” “That was perceived as beyond the pale by the legacy team and as such they left en masse.  An outcome that the management team certainly did not want.” (If you'd like another perspective on these events, you may enjoy the formerly-hosted-on-Deadspin “The Adults In The Room,” written by former Deadspin Editor-In-Chief Megan Greenwell, now the author of newly minted bestseller Bad Company: Private Equity And The Death Of The American Dream.) Still, the Deadspin story did have a happy ending: “In the end, we sold the site for more than we bought it for.”

Elsewhere in the article, Spanfeller addresses various other bugbears that have impacted his time in the manager's chair, notably the hated specter of writers writing about the things they want to write about from positions of familiarity or expertise. (“Often now, the writer wants to choose topics and story angles to match their own specific world view.  A practice that often actually works against the very brand building that some would suggest supports such practices.”) But it's not all doom and gloom: Spanfeller takes a moment to herald some of his big successes, too, like G/O's innovative use of artificial intelligence to produce bold new experiments in online content, noting—in his blog post about his company no longer surviving or growing—that, “Innovation was always a constant, which was clearly a key reason for our survival and growth during these very trying times.”

The Times notes that G/O hasn't completely powered down, as it's still hunting around to find a buyer for Black culture and news site The Root. It's also not clear what's next for Spanfeller, whether he and his friends at Great Hills Partners will now seek out another set of sites to leave their lasting and undeniable impact on, or whether he might consider retiring, possibly to tend to a garden where he'd grow a variety of plants known for their properties in garnishing and flavoring food.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Poker Face's second season is nearing its end—and friends, it's getting good","https://www.avclub.com/poker-face-recap-season-2-episode-11-day-of-the-iguana","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

From the start, Poker Face has had a slippery relationship with its own premise. I'm not talking about the “human lie detector solves crimes” part of the show. I'm talking about the idea that Poker Face is meant to be a throwback to breezy, low-stakes, case-of-the-week TV mysteries like Columbo and Murder, She Wrote. Season one had a running subplot about gangsters trying to chase down Charlie. And even though season two quickly tossed that storyline aside, there has still been a fair amount of continuity between these episodes, as Charlie keeps getting increasingly bummed out over her inability to avoid murderers.

And you know what? Good for Rian Johnson, Natasha Lyonne, Tony Tost (this season), Nora and Lilla Zuckerman (last season), and the rest of the Poker Face writers and producers for being flexible enough to let their series find its own balance between the episodic and the serialized. As welcome as it has been to see a high-quality show present new, complete stories each week, Poker Face is—somewhat perversely—usually at its best when the tension gets raised and Charlie's history becomes plot-relevant.

That's certainly the case with this season's penultimate episode, the excellent “Day Of The Iguana,” which brings back a couple of characters who always seem to turn up whenever Charlie's own story is about to get crazier: the FBI agent Luca Clark and Beatrix Hasp, a former mob boss turned government witness. Also, for the third episode in a row, Charlie is palling around with Alex, who—much to Charlie's chagrin—is accused of a murder she didn't commit.

Similar to the season-two premiere, “Day Of The Iguana” has an ace guest star playing both a victim and a killer. In the opening scene, we see Justin Theroux as Todd “Mr. T” Telachi, a high-school teacher who has been invited to the upper-crust Long Island wedding of one of his former students: an ultra bro-y MLM mogul named Kirby Kowalczyk (Haley Joel Osment), whose main product is the energy drink “Ballzilla.” Mr. T gets a knock on his door from someone claiming to be his assigned chauffeur. But that driver turns out to be the notorious hired killer “the Iguana,” who strangles the teacher, liquefies the corpse, and then uses Mission: Impossible-level masks and appliqués to impersonate Mr. T.

So, from then on, the Iguana is played by…Justin Theroux.

That opening scene is a stunner: sick, strange, surprising. And what follows is one of this season's twistier and more unpredictable plots, the details of which are woven together so subtly that viewers may be one step behind throughout.

Here's the gist of it. The Iguana is impersonating Mr. T because no one would suspect the teacher, a fumbling goofball who was only invited to the wedding because he used to crack Kirby up in class by removing his glass eye and imitating Peter Falk. (Funnily enough, Kirby and his buddies have never seen Columbo.) As for the Iguana's target? It's Kirby! And why? Because he's secretly the son of Beatrix Hasp, and the other mob bosses want to flush her out of witness protection to take their revenge.

The Hasp connection explains why Luca is at the wedding. As part of her deal with the FBI, Beatrix asked for agents to livestream the ceremony for her. Luca is joined by two other agents, Darville (Lili Taylor) and Milligan (played by Lyonne's old Orange Is The New Black pal Taylor Schilling), both of whom think he has lucked into all of his recent promotions. Luca—who knows he has Charlie to thank for his many wins with the agency—quietly agrees with them.

Charlie being at this wedding is more of a coincidence. Alex is trying to start a new business, providing fresh-shucked oysters to fancy events. (The name? Yippee Ki-Yay Oystershucker.) She convinces Charlie to join her after mentioning how much they'll be paid for this one reception. And Charlie's presence—and Luca's, for that matter—proves fortuitous, because when Alex is found standing over a dead Kirby with a bloody oyster-shucker in her hand, shouting, “I didn't do it,” Charlie knows she's telling the truth, which means that Luca knows it too. (Darville and Milligan? Less convinced.)

“Day Of The Iguana” is a very funny episode—so much so that I'm going to have to consign most of the best lines to stray observations. And it features multiple kinds of terrible people. Sure, the Iguana is a ruthless assassin, but he's not the one serving wedding guests a signature cocktail made of vodka, botanicals, and Ballzilla. (“Tastes like balls,” the Iguana says.) It doesn't speak well of Kirby either that he resents his mother not because she abandoned him at birth or because she used to run a murderous, exploitative criminal organization, but because she wouldn't use her connections to help him sell his swill.

Still, it's uncool of the Iguana to agree to pin the murder on a patsy for double his fee. Alas, Alex proves to be a too-convenient puppet, since she keeps ducking out to a boat dock to pull more of her oyster supply out of the water. This makes the Iguana's plan easy and clear: Kill Kirby (by stabbing him through the eye with a shucker!) and stow his corpse in a boa. Then when Alex inevitably returns, she gets framed.

The episode ends on a cliffhanger, as Charlie helps Alex escape from the FBI. Alex is freaking out that the mafia is after her (Charlie: “Several mafias, actually…it's kind of a national consortium”), so Charlie uses Beatrix Hasp's super-private fake Instagram account to piece together the clues to where the Witness Protection Program has stashed her. The ladies end up heading to Indiana to ask for Bea's help. But as Luca back on Long Island quickly realizes, if the Iguana let Charlie and Alex get away, it's probably because the Iguana intends to follow them to Hasp's doorstep.

But who actually is the Iguana? We never actually see his (or her?) face. It seems highly unlikely, given the nature of this show, that the killer is someone entirely new to Charlie's orbit. Could it be Good Buddy? An unaccounted for Kazinsky sibling? Some rogue from season one or two who's neither dead nor in jail?

I haven't watched the finale yet, so I'm just making these guesses idly. No spoilers here. But I am definitely curious—nay, excited—to see how this all ends next week.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Netflix stops Pulse and evicts The Residence","https://www.avclub.com/pulse-residence-canceled-netflix","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 02:53:00 GMT","

Netflix handed down a couple of first-season cancellations tonight, ensuring that two of its freshman shows will now go in the dustbin of history—or, if you want to get even more obscure, “the dustbin of TV shows that were only on Netflix for a single season and will never be shown to anyone by the algorithm ever again.” Specifically, Deadline reports that the streamer has dropped the axe on its stab at the resurgent medical drama genre, Pulse, and Shondaland's quirky “What if Giancarlo Esposito got murdered at the White House?” series The Residence.

Of the two, we're far more sad to lose Pulse, which may not have been The Pitt or anything, but was at least serving up some soapy medical drama that didn't skimp on the drama part of the equation. The series, created by Zoe Robyn, starred Willa Fitzgerald and Colin Woodell as residents working in a Miami Hospital. Reviewing the series when it debuted what will now be its only ten-episode season back in early April, our own Saloni Gajjar wrote that, “Under the guise of a fast-paced procedural is a provocative dissection of toxic workplace romances and the intersection of ambition and love.”

The Residence, meanwhile, was just kind of a mess, attempting to riff on Only Murders In The Building murder-comedy vibes without half the Hulu show's fleetness, and forcing star Uzo Aduba to output near-toxic levels of quirk as the hyper-intelligent detective brought in to solve a murder that everyone involved wants quietly hushed up. Despite a few fun casting touches—including the ever-excellent Isiah Whitlock Jr. as the police chief who backs “Cordelia Cupp” every step of the way—the series will not come back for another season of solving a murder in some other extremely unlikely locale. Deadline suggests that the show got screwed, in part, by timing: It doesn't look great when your star-studded, lavishly expensive comedy gets completely overshadowed by the one-week-earlier release of a show like Adolescence, which crafted a far more mature and compelling narrative out of the tropes of the “murder mystery,” and on what was almost certainly a fraction of the budget.

Netflix has been pretty generous with freshman series renewals lately, having handed down new seasons of Man On The Inside, Running Point, The Four Seasons, Beauty In Black, Forever, North Of North, Bet, and Ransom County. But no luck for these two—or black comedy anthology series No Good Deed, which hasn't been canceled, but which also hasn't been given a new season, and is instead just sort of being kept in a “We're not making any more of this one” void.

Late last week, we reported on a story circulating in TMZ that was, roughly, 10,000 times less upsetting or scandalous than almost every other story you'll usually see on the pages of TMZ. Specifically, that It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and Mythic Quest co-creator Rob McElhenney had filed paperwork to legally change his name to “Rob Mac,” acting on a re-branding he'd floated a few weeks earlier in a Variety profile of himself and wife Kaitlin Olson.

Now, McElhenney/Mac has publicly confirmed that, yep, he's going through with the change, devoting exactly one minute to a video post he put on social media to address the switch—which he referred to as “mostly a stage name,” although the TMZ report suggested he was going for the full legal change. Mac sounds alternatively amused and annoyed that people have taken notice of this decision, admitting right up top that the move is “kind of douchey.” But, he says, he'd rather be that instead of spending the rest of his life correcting people on the spelling and pronunciation of his name, so here we are. (We won't lie: We've had to quadruple check the longer name every time we've typed it out here, and the shorter one zero, so fair cop to that.)

Also, he notes, while he wants to maintain connection with his family, a) most people in his life call him Rob Mac already apparently, and b) his current spelling of his name was the invention of an Ellis Island official anyway, so who even cares? It's only at the end of Mac's quick-running argument that he really loses us: First, with the suggestion that “there are so many things going on in the world, and this is a silly one to continue to waste your time with”—because, buddy, trust us, the more silly, non-harmful bullshit things we can find to fill our time with right now, the better. And then, the even more spurious suggestion that what he's done is no different from other famous artists adopting stage names, name-checking Gene Wilder, Cary Grant, Lady Gaga, and more—none of whom executed that change after they were already internationally famous, or had put their old name prominently on hundreds of episodes of television! It's apples and oranges, Rob Mac! We'll call you whatever you like, but it's apples and oranges!

Anyway: It's Always Sunny‘s season 17 premiere arrives on July 9. It's their half of the Abbott Elementary crossover! Rob Mac's in it, should be fun.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Foo Fighters release first new song since firing their drummer and Dave Grohl scandal","https://www.avclub.com/foo-fighters-new-single-after-firing-drummer","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 01:50:00 GMT","

It has not been an especially good few years for the Foo Fighters. The obvious point of misery is, of course, the 2022 death of the band's long-time drummer, Taylor Hawkins, an integral part of its musical formula (and a close personal friend of frontman Dave Grohl) since 1997. But even as the group tried to recover from Hawkins' loss, releasing new album But Here We Are in 2023, scandals and points of contention have continued to emerge—including Grohl admitting to long-term infidelity, and the decision to fire Hawkins' replacement, Josh Freese, just a few weeks ago.

None of which really gets addressed in a new essay Grohl posted online today, alongside the band's first new song in two years. He does namecheck Freese—specifically, in a rundown of former members, referring to his “thunderous wizardry.” But it's less a “state of the band in 2025” than a backwards-looking bit of woolgathering, including The Storyteller noting that “There comes a point when the word ‘band' supersedes the common, more popular definition of the term simply used to describe a group of musicians. The word can take on a whole other meaning. In time, it can become ‘something to fasten and reinforce.'”

﻿

Anyway, the group released a new song today, titled, uh, “Today's Song.” Notably, the track sees Grohl return to the drums, as he did for But Here We Are. Which can work in the studio, but not so much out on tour (what with Grohl also serving as the band's singer and co-guitarist), raising question marks over the band's upcoming shows in Asia, scheduled for October 2025.

DC Comics' The Sandman, written by Neil Gaiman, was a groundbreaking and surreal series. However, the Netflix adaptation remains content to paint by the numbers. Superhero movies often take inspiration from their source material, but the better ones usually avoid directly translating stories to the screen word-for-word or panel-for-panel. As a TV show, The Sandman struggles to exceed or even match the original's stunning visual landscape, and its characters often feel like unimaginative cosplayers reciting Gaiman's dialogue. 

The Sandman's first season offered some compelling reasons for viewers to sympathize with its lead, Morpheus of the Dreaming (Tom Sturridge). He was kidnapped and held prisoner for a century; and once he escaped, he set out to reclaim what he had lost, both physically and spiritually. Sadly, the first half of The Sandman's second and final season doesn't deliver many satisfying reasons for us to care about what we're watching. 

These six new episodes are based on Season Of Mists and Brief Lives—and unfortunately, those very different tales are loosely connected through a specific plot point that just wanders off midway through its run, as if left unattended. Ultimately, this batch of installments serves as a character study for Morpheus, also known as Dream, who mostly sleepwalks through the proceedings. 

As drawn by artists Kelley Jones and Jill Thompson, the original Dream boasts a thrilling, unconventional weirdness that is absent on the screen. Instead, Sturridge performs the part as if he's a supernatural Mr. Darcy—or worse, Prince Charles from The Crown. There's far too much of the preening aristocrat and not nearly enough of the unknowable eternal being, with Sturridge delivering somber lines that feel stiff and joyless. A relentlessly dour Dream roams around rooms that resemble vampire-themed nightclubs and speaks in ponderous, whispered tones. It all comes off at times like a Key & Peele parody. Yes, he's the lord of dreams, but his very presence shouldn't put viewers to sleep.

Critics have argued that the Netflix series is too faithful to Gaiman's work, but that's only true on the most superficial level. Overall, the TV series misses the mark on what made The Sandman so engaging and unique. Season Of Mists and Brief Lives were published in the early 1990s, and the Netflix adaptation exists in a seeming vacuum as if the past 30 years of TV fantasy and horror never happened. It's a curious choice. The Sandman is a clear spiritual ancestor to later genre entries such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Supernatural, and Gaiman's work shares (and perhaps even inspired) their quirky, tongue-in-cheek approach.

Dream holding a “dinner party” where he meets and greets the treacherous contenders for ultimate power could have played out like a timely spin on reality shows like The Traitors. Later, Dream and his (very odd) sister Delirium (Esmé Creed-Miles) embark on what is effectively a wacky road trip to find their estranged brother Destruction (Barry Sloane). The sight of the two on a commercial airline fight in the comic is a laugh-out-loud moment. But the Netflix series drains these situations of any trace of humor or sly wit. Simply put, the show is serious at a time when works of fantasy are confident enough to not take themselves so seriously. 

The first-season finale set up a potential epic war between Hell and the Dreaming that is never fully realized, so Gwendoline Christie's return as Lucifer is disappointingly anticlimactic. The series obviously struggles with Lucifer, the fallen angel who was the basis for the titular series on Fox (and later Netflix). Tom Ellis' crime-solving devil was a significant departure from the text, and apparently Netflix's The Sandman chose to distinguish between the two versions by eliminating most of Lucifer's puckish charm and Machiavellian edge. Christie's Lucifer is as mopey and sullen as Dream, so their scenes together lack the source material's tension. Gaiman's Lucifer, on the other hand, was openly based on David Bowie. It's a shame, as it feels like a waste of Christie's talent and a commanding presence. 



Kirby Howell-Baptiste's Death is a necessary departure from the comic's now-dated “pale goth girl,” yet the incongruity of a hip, perky, teenage embodiment of Death helped make her a fan-favorite character. Howell-Baptiste plays her as almost timeless, not really of this particular moment. She's more mature and somber than her on-the-page counterpart, so just what you might imagine from the personification of Death. And that brings up a big conundrum with the series: There are rarely any surprises. The comic was famously adventurous, frequently pushing the boundaries of its format, while the Netflix series is predictably straightforward, without the madcap nature of an actual dream.

But on the plus side, the show does make a change to a character from Brief Lives that is particularly relevant for today, with the story directly challenging the cruel prejudice some people can't escape even in death. This tweak also affords a rare moment of genuine compassion from Dream (something the show could have used more of). And in other good news, Mason Alexander Park remains something of a revelation as Desire, imbuing Dream's younger sibling with layers of complexity. They are simultaneously seductive and sinister—and luckily (given that this is such a predictable adaptation), Desire should play a larger role in the final half of season two, which adapts The Kindly Ones and Overture. 

In the end, the experience of watching Netflix's The Sandman is like listening to a cover band perform one of your favorite songs: It's a passable version of something you've long enjoyed, with familiar beats that are comforting—even if nothing new or original has been added. And for newbies, there is still enough left of the original's imaginative world to entertain.  

The Sandman season two, volume one premieres July 3 on Netflix

A new social media post is giving “Dancing With the Stars” fans a sneak peek into the private lives of their favorite “DWTS” pro dancers, including a look into their homes — well, for most of them.

A post shared by Britt Stewart (@brittbenae)

The video was originally shared by ‘DWTS' pro Britt Stewart. In the video, Britt happened to gather up some fan-favorite dancers and got them to take part in a fun video, which ended up showing off their pets, kids, and more.

Britt starts the video with a caption on the screen saying: “I asked the ‘DWTS' pros to send me a video of themselves pulling something totally random out of their fridge — and they delivered.”

Delivered is an understatement, as all of the pro dancers crushed it on this one.

The video kicks off with Stewart standing in front of her fridge, looking for something to “grab” out of it. She ends up pulling out her boyfriend, Daniel Durant.

We also get to see Peta Murgatroyd grab one of her sons out of the fridge, and not gonna lie, this transition was smooth, and it looks like she took him right from the refrigerator. More kids were present in the video, as we see Daniella Karagach and Pasha Pashkov pick up their toddler, Nikita, from the fridge.

A post shared by Alan Bersten (@alanbersten)

The fur babies of the ‘DWTS' pro dancers also make an appearance in the video. Sasha Farber pulls his dog out of the fridge, and we see Ezra Sosa bring out his cat.

We also got to see some of the dancers pull out some of the things they love, like Alan Bersten “grabbing” Emma Slater from the fridge, and Jenna Johnson and Val Chmerkovskiy pulling out their dancing shoes from a hotel mini fridge.

Stewart captioned the video: “My friends really came through.” Her friends definitely did, and they definitely came through in the comments as well.

Slater commented: “Haha this is such a vibe!! @brandonarmstrong nice skillz,” hinting at the fact that fellow dancer Brandon Armstrong pulled out a guitar from his fridge.

Meanwhile, Bersten admitted to fans: “Did I rearrange my fridge to try and make it look better?? Yes. Did I succeed, no.”

Fans of the show were loving the video and talked about how funny everyone was, but some were curious to know what was in some of these stars' fridges.

One commenter asked: “Am I the only one more interested in what they have on the shelves of their fridges lol,” while another wondered: “How much fridge space does Brandon have? I must know; this is great!!”

We all are curious, but for now, we just get to enjoy the sneak peek into their lives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Erin Cahill's Husband, Musician Welsh Wolf, Vulnerably Asks Fans for Help With Huge Goal","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/erin-cahill-husband-welsh-wolf-needs-votes/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 15:05:21 GMT","

Longtime Hallmark Channel star Erin Cahill is her husband Paul Freeman's biggest fan. But on July 3, 2025, she needs her fans — and music fans everywhere — to get behind the indie musician, who goes by the stage name and musical alter ego Welsh Wolf, and help him reach the final round of Global Citizen's “America's Next Top Hitmaker” Contest. 

Cahill shared a video from her husband via her Instagram Stories, urging people to watch his urgent request, in which he said, “I'm feeling really vulnerable, actually, saying this but I really need your help.” 

Voting ends on July 3 at 9 p.m. Eastern time. At the time of publication, Welsh Wolf was in third place. While supporters can cast one vote for free by logging into Facebook, they can cast more votes by making a small donation toward Global Citizen's mission of ending extreme poverty — a cause close to Cahill and Freeman's hearts. 

In his July 2 Instagram post, Freeman told his fans, “It's scary to ask for help but those who know me know I love a good charity gig and we are ALL global citizens!! Thank you a billion to everyone who's voted so far you are amazing, let's see if we can get this over the line and raise some money while we do!!”

Cahill and Freeman have built five schools in third-world countries with the nonprofit organization BuildOn, including in Senegal in early 2025. So they love that by rallying support for Welsh Wolf through Global Citizen's contest, they're also raising funds for families in need around the world. 

The winner of the “America's Next Top Hitmaker” competition will receive $50,000, appear in Rolling Stone magazine, and get to perform at the Global Citizen Festival in New York City. 

Freeman told the organization that if he wins, “My wife and I are currently raising money for another school so my first thought would be to make a large donation towards that project. After that, I would invest some of it into the development of myself and another Artist I work with. I feel so grateful to be involved with the community work that I do and to be able to do it because of music is such an incredible gift.”

A post shared by Erin Cahill (@theerincahill)

Cahill, who grew up in Virginia, and Freeman, who is from Wales, U.K., have been married since September 2016 and now split their time between Los Angeles and Nashville. 

Freeman told Nashville Voyager that he left home as a teen, moved to London, started and a band and was signed to Boy George's record label. After releasing a couple of albums, he wound up in Los Angeles when he signed a publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music, writing for multiple artists, and eventually signed a deal with legendary producer Clive Davis. 

But after that deal expired and Freeman began longing to spread his wings creatively, he came up with the idea for his musical alter ego, Welsh Wolf, he told the outlet. 

“It's not for the faint of heart,” he said. “To sing your own music is probably the most vulnerable of art forms as it truly comes from within you. To stand on a stage and bare your soul like that can leave you very open and not everyone can do it.”

Welsh Wolf's six-track debut album, “A Voyeur's Dream,” was released on June 6. Cahill has enthusiastically promoted its release, as well as the launch party they held in LA and other performances, always happy to cheer on her hubby. 

In April 2024, to celebrate Freeman's birthday, she wrote in a sweet Instagram post that he was “the love of all my lifetimes,” adding, “Every day with you is a gift. We have grown so much together and individually, and being on this journey with you has been better than I could've dreamt.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved ‘Star Wars' Actor Passes Away & Tributes Pour In","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/beloved-star-wars-actor-kenneth-colley/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:18:29 GMT","

Fans of the “Star Wars” series are in mourning as the news broke on July 3rd that Kenneth Colley had passed away. The 87-year-old actor appeared in the original “Star Wars” series, playing Admiral Piett. Kenneth Colley is also known for his roles in “Monty Python” and several other notable films. 

According to Deadline, Kenneth Colley passed away in his home on June 30, which is in Kent, England. This came after he tested positive for COVID and also developed pneumonia. Kenneth's agent, Julian Owen, announced his death. 

The agent said, “Ken Colley was one of our finest character actors with a career spanning 60 years. Ken continually worked on stage, film, and television playing a vast array of characters, from Jesus in Monty Python's Life of Brian to evil and eccentric characters in Ken Russell films, and the Duke of Vienna in Shakespeare's Measure for Measure for the BBC.”

Kenneth Colley is regarded as an international treasure due to his numerous roles throughout his extensive career. As a result, many fans have taken to social media to pay tribute to the beloved “Star Wars” actor. 

The fan account Star Wars Holocron posted about Kenneth's passing, concluding the statement with, “May the Force be with you, always.” A fan commented and highlighted Admiral Piett's importance to the series, saying, “Rip Kenneth Colley. Piett was the one Empire officer who was spared from Darth Vader's force chokes.”

Another fan on the X platform, who posts under the name Veers Watch, remarked, “Oh man, rest in peace to Kenneth Colley- a phenomenal presence in ESB and ROTJ who shares in some classic scenes with Veers, he's gonna be sorely missed.”

Finally, Thomas Murch from X said, “It probably says a lot about me that, even when I was young, one of my favourite things about Star Wars was watching Piett rise reluctantly through the ranks of the Empire. Rest in peace, Kenneth Colley. I'll be intensifying my forward firepower every day, in your memory.”

Kenneth Colley was born in 1937 in Manchester, United Kingdom. According to IMDb, he has 159 credits related to his time on both the big and small screens. Notably, Kenneth was also a theatre actor. His first television role came in 1961 when he appeared in an episode of “A for Andromeda.” 

Kenneth Colley made several television appearances throughout the 1960s and 1970s. However, he was then cast in “Monty Python's Life of Brian” in 1979. The following year came his role in “Star Wars: Episode V- The Empire Strikes Back.” He was later in “Star Wars: Episode V1- Return of the Jedi.” 

Kenneth's last credited role came in 2024 for “Dan Hawk Psychic Detective.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘It's Always Sunny' Star Reveals He Wanted to Leave the Show","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-leave/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 04:41:05 GMT","

“It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” has the distinction of being the longest-running American live-action sitcom. The show began in 2005, and many agree it's as funny as ever. However, Glenn Howerton, who plays Dennis in “It's Always Sunny,” recently opened up about wanting to quit the hit FXX series. 

According to Entertainment Weekly, Glenn Howerton was recently on a panel to celebrate the long-running series for its 20th anniversary. While reflecting on the show, Glenn said, “I was worried that maybe we had sort of peaked or something.”

He continued discussing “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” saying, “And I just was like, you know, we've been doing this for a long time, and I think I was also anxious. I had not figured out yet how to stretch myself and be able to do other things that I wanted to do with my career outside of the show.”

The actor continued, “I was aching to do other things, and so I was starting to feel a little boxed in, frankly.” Still, Glenn says he “never lost any appreciation for the show.” He went on, “I just thought like maybe we should, and then they were like, ‘We don't want to end it,' and I was like, ‘Oh, well I can't stop you.'”

“It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” is still one of the most talked-about shows on the air. Luckily for fans, Dennis and the rest of the characters from “It's Always Sunny” will return for a 17th season.

The show is scheduled to premiere on July 9th. According to IMDb, like most of the recent installments, the season will consist of eight episodes. Notably, the first episode will be the second part of the much-talked-about “Abbot Elementary” crossover. 

Fans will also be happy to know that the show has been renewed for an 18th season. 

“It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia” is a staple of comedy television. However, the cast has also done an excellent job of branching out. Regarding Glenn Howerton, he received rave reviews for his role in the 2023 movie “Blackberry” as well as his starring tenure in A.P. Bio, which ran from 2018 to 2021. 

Additionally, Kaitlin Olson has been in multiple television series. She has a recurring role in “Hacks” and also stars in the hit ABC show “High Potential.” Regarding Charlie Day, he played Luigi in “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” in 2023. Rob McElhenney starred in Apple's “Mythic Quest” from 2020 until 2025. 

Of course, Danny DeVito was an icon long before “It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.”

The following article is an excerpt from the latest edition of “In Review by David Ehrlich,” a biweekly newsletter in which our Chief Film Critic and Head Reviews Editor rounds up the site's latest reviews and muses about current events in the movie world. Subscribe here to receive the newsletter in your inbox every other Friday.

It's hard to remember now, but movies used to be funny. And not just funny as a means to an end, but funny as an end unto itself. Like, people would pay money to go see something explicitly because it promised to make them laugh, which is wild to imagine now that jokes are basically just something that Hollywood uses to hide the fact that it's given up on making comedies. What used to be a proud and reliable genre has since been reduced to an omnipresent tone — a tone so evenly distributed between every auditorium in the multiplex that “Lilo & Stitch,” “Thunderbolts*,” “Novocaine,” and “A Minecraft Movie” all feel like they have the exact same amount of humor. 
 








Related Stories Julie Bowen Says Adam Sandler Refused to Recast the Romantic Lead for ‘Happy Gilmore 2': ‘You're the Heart of the Movie' Celine Song Says Audiences Are ‘Scared' of Taking Rom-Coms Seriously Due to ‘Misogyny' 

Almost everything is “funny.” Almost nothing is a comedy.

 










Theatrical comedies are often chalked up as the first casualty of the streaming wars, but the start of their decline can be traced back to the rise of the IP era a few years earlier, when studios realized that laughter was less valuable as a source of fresh revenue than it was as a cheap foil it could wrap around rancid product to disguise the smell of week-old fish. Making “Bridesmaids” good is a lot harder than making “Thor: The Dark World” funny, and the blockbuster-or-bust economics that asserted themselves in the early 2000s helped justify the cost differential between a Kristen Wiig vehicle and a Marvel CGI-fest. We used to have Paul Rudd, Ryan Reynolds, and Chris Pratt. Now we have Ant-Man, Deadpool, and… well, I can't actually name any of Chris Pratt's recent characters, but you get the idea. We used to have Jack Black! Now we have Steve. 

Of course, it would be absurd to deny that streaming has also factored into the equation, as the lack of big-screen comedies has been answered by a rich array of boundary-pushing “TV” shows and an endless glut of non-existent Netflix/Hulu/Prime Video movies. The former tend to be more interesting than funny, but that's only because they privilege the sort of creative risk that the latter exists to avoid. Many streaming comedy shows mint new stars who are still willing to make themselves vulnerable for laughs; most streaming comedy movies protect established stars who'd rather satisfy an algorithm than hazard a chance at disappointing an audience. Why would Jerry Seinfeld confront his own irrelevance by releasing “Unfrosted” in 3,000 empty theaters — all of them quieter than the heist sequence from “Rififi” — when he could measure his success with “viewing hours” that allow him to imagine his Pop-Tart opus brought down every house in America? 

 










That's a rhetorical question, but it's also one that cinema's foundational comic filmmakers would struggle to answer. Take Preston Sturges, for example. He's dead. Straight up not alive anymore. In fact, he was six feet under five years before the Pop-Tart was even invented. Perhaps even more important, Sturges so fervently believed that humor is one of the purest and most life-affirming things people can share with each other that he made a movie about a shallow Hollywood director who goes on an epic quest in search of profound human truth, only to find it in the peels of laughter that a screening of Walt Disney's “Playful Pluto” inspires from the prisoners of a labor camp. 

Sturges, whose greatest hope for “Sullivan's Travels” was that a film critic would use it to prop up an internet rant about the state of American comedies in 2025, would surely be aghast at the fact that Hollywood has abandoned its highest calling. 

[Editor's note: A slight spoiler for “Materialists” follows in the next paragraph.]

Sure, he might lose his fucking mind at “Friendship” (something about Tim Robinson's face makes me feel like he'd be a real source of comfort for someone who's just time-traveled from the Great Depression), and howl at the narcotized screwball humor of “Materialists” (“Did that 35-year-old spinster really just reject a bionic millionaire!?”). But I think he'd be wounded to discover that both of those films — to one degree or another — were targeted at a self-selecting crowd of cultural elites instead of a mass audience. At the risk of turning this dumb thought experiment into an even dumber game of “what would a white guy born in 1898 think about ‘Girls Trip?,'” I'd also imagine that Sturges might be confused why it took almost eight years to follow that blockbuster success with another R-rated, Black-led female comedy, and that he'd question why a breakout hit like “One of Them Days” only prompted a sequel instead of a full-blown paradigm shift. (Though I suspect he might be able to provide his own answer to that one.)

 










For all of the (very understandable) handwringing over multiplex ticket prices at a time when kids have been conditioned to think that media should be free to consume for anyone who wants it, movie theaters remain among the cheapest venues for public entertainment, and one of the only places where people might still be able to lap up a shared experience with strangers across the socioeconomic and political spectrums. It would be a cringe-inducing stretch to map the climactic scene of “Sullivan's Travels” onto the troubles of the 21st century, but when you consider the extent to which Americans have been siloed into completely separate realities, I can't help but feel like the movies are depriving us of their most basic gift: The chance to sublimate ourselves into a single expression of collective enjoyment. Laughing at a TikTok on the toilet just doesn't have the same effect on the soul.

Of course, it would be delusional to suggest that a country screaming toward autocracy is just a few good jokes away from singing “Kumbaya.” It's not like “Barbie” managed to precipitate a new era of mutual understanding, and I'm not trying to say that any movie possibly could. That would be ridiculous. The dumbest thing I've ever heard. Stupid even by the standards of someone who was desperate to file a column in the final hours before a holiday weekend. I mean, it's not like a reboot of “The Naked Gun” starring Liam Neeson, directed by a member of The Lonely Island, and sold on the power of a scene involving Busta Rhymes and an incredible manslaughter joke is about to be released nationwide or anything. 

 










…OK, that is wild. In that case, I guess I owe it to the fates to entertain the idea. Consider this: The original “The Naked Gun” is one of the three best films ever made (the other two are obviously “The Naked Gun 2 ½: The Smell of Fear” and Raúl Ruiz's 1983 surrealist fantasy “City of Pirates”), and, as a spoof, it belongs to the purest of comedy subgenres, in that it basically exists for no other purpose than to make people laugh. It's reasonable to assume the new one operates by a similar principle, which should make it a uniquely valuable test case for the viability of big screen comedies. 

In other words, Hollywood wouldn't be able to qualify its success, nor would it be scared to replicate it — not if it delivers on its potential to appeal to red and blue states in equal measure. A good-natured piece of silliness that constantly makes fun of the police without disrespecting their authority, “The Naked Gun” might be the first movie of the Trump era that appeals to people with ACAB in their Twitter bios just as much as it appeals to people with Blue Lives Matter flags on their bedroom walls — the first movie of the Trump era to bridge the divide between activists and fascists. While I can't say that I'm overly invested in satisfying anyone who supports disappearing innocent people off the streets, I will admit that I'm curious to see if “The Naked Gun” might solve one of the more pressing mysteries about the MAGA demographic: Do they only watch a comedy like “Gutfeld!” because they're evil, or are they evil because “Gutfeld!” is the only comedy they watch? 

 










For a movie directed by a Jewish guy from Berkeley, “The Naked Gun” is going to be hard to paint as “woke.” Not only does the franchise have some established cred with the conservative movement (remember when Leslie Nielsen and David Zucker reteamed for “An American Carol”?), but its new installment co-stars Liam Neeson, whose vigilante films have made him something of a MAGA hero, whatever his personal beliefs, and “Baywatch” icon Pamela Anderson, who remains a living symbol of what right-wingers claim to want every time they cry over a studio's decision to cast an actress of color. 

Unlike “Barbie,” “The Naked Gun” won't be derided as a rallying cry against men. Unlike “Freakier Friday,” “The Naked Gun” won't largely depend on nostalgia to get people in the door. And unlike the audience for “Happy Gilmore 2,” those people won't all live in the same house. On the contrary, they will be strangers who've gathered together in the dark to go somewhere they've never been before. A place where they're not just entertained, but somehow reborn. A place they come to not just to cry and to care, but also to watch Liam Neeson desperately try and contain his explosive diarrhea while using his gun to commandeer the nearest toilet. After all, if laughter weren't the most sacred byproduct of going to the movies, then Nicole Kidman wouldn't have listed it first.

 










The facts speak for themselves: “The Naked Gun” is the only movie this summer that has the potential to heal America. To stop the bleeding. To bind every soul in this great land together in light and love.

Unless, you know… it's bad. In which case we're all fucked.

In the premiere episode of “The Sandman” Season 2, Dream (Tom Sturridge) asks his loyal subject Cain (Sanjeev Bhaskar) to take the express train to Hell so he can deliver a message to Lucifer (Gwendoline Christie). But before Cain can read his ruler's carefully chosen words, Lucifer cuts him off: “No, not the message,” she says. “Just the content.”

Rarely has a series so succinctly summed up its defective attitude toward storytelling, and rarer still has such a fast-tracked approach to plowing through narrative felt more welcome. As Season 2 swiftly makes evident, the sooner we put Netflix‘s adaptation of “The Sandman” behind us, the better.

Why? Well, first and foremost, the series is deeply unpleasant to sit through following the credible allegations leveled against its author Neil Gaiman, who remains an executive producer and co-creator on Season 2. The first season's bonus episode was stomach-turning enough — in which a self-described feminist author imprisons and rapes his muse not only for inspiration, but so he can better understand women(?!) — and the new batch of episodes only double down on unwelcome parallels between “The Sandman” and its author. 

 










In Season 2, Volume 1, Dream learns how to better empathize with humans (and his siblings, aka the Endless, which are personified forces of nature more powerful than gods). But in doing so, he also struggles to recognize his own fallibility — such as that time he confused love for “desire” and ended up banishing a woman to Hell for 10,000 years. Past mistakes like this one invite reality-invoking questions of consent and manipulation, while a fixed focus on Dream's absent compassion calls to mind Gaiman's continued denials of any wrongdoing and the legal action he filed against women accusing him of sexual misconduct. Ostensibly, Dream is slowly coming to realize even the Endless can change — that he, too, may care about people — but the evidence is so scant, so vague, and so hollow, it's all but impossible to separate the art from the artist, even if you can stay awake long enough to try.

Which brings us to the second key drawback: It can't be overstated, sans any outside context whatsoever, that “The Sandman” is a terrible show. Dreams spends these first six episodes examining old mistakes, moping around like an emo sad boy, and then proceeding to do whatever he wants. Season 2 again tells largely self-contained stories without sound episodic structure, yet it also lacks enough specifics to justify its main character's fitfully serialized development. 

 










Netflix's adaptation is maddeningly inert, and lest you think I'm just piling on now that Gaiman has made himself an easy target for criticism, I've got the receipts. “The Sandman” has always been a barren slog; now, it's just an upsetting one, too.

Side quests aside, the ongoing story dwells on two basic plots: 1. Dream hooked up with a mortal and must deal with the consequences, and 2. Dream goes looking for his lost brother, Destruction (Barry Sloane), who abandoned his realm, with his oddball sister Delirium (Esmé Creed-Miles). (In essence, he's on an apology tour, even if he doesn't always seem to know what he's apologizing for.) Along the way, he looks in on Hell, hosts a banquet, produces “A Midsummer Night's Dream,” stalks his ex, and seeks out the son he abandoned. (You can probably guess where the apologies come in.) 

Some episodes rely on flashbacks, others plow full steam ahead, and none leave much of a mark. Interacting with various anthropomorphic gods and animals, Dream's dilemmas are so devoid of friction there's nothing to grasp onto; if the rest of the show introduced engaging ideas to contemplate or whisked us away to a world worth admiring, perhaps “The Sandman” could work as an effective head trip. As is, it's not. Showrunner and co-creator Allan Heinberg prioritizes recreating what's already on the page while stitching those pages together to form a discernible plot. If that means everyone just kind of comes and goes, with no room for significant conflict, so be it. (It's staggering how little resistance Dream faces to any of his plans.)

 










Dream's discoveries about himself, his relationships, and his outlook on humankind are so basic and broad it's as if he's never once looked at any one of them until now, despite being older than the gods. Meanwhile, the season's overarching theme is focused on quitting and why it's OK to take a little time off (or a lot of time off). 

Who cares that pondering early retirement is at odds with Dream's previous plotline (he just got his realm back in Season 1 after being held captive for over a century), or that none of the other aspiring retirees ever seem to do any work? So long as Season 2 takes shortcut after shortcut in order to include as many of Gaiman's comic books as possible, it doesn't matter what other ugliness he's put into the world or that these stories feel as faint as a day-old dream; the fans can say they saw Delirium and Destruction on TV! Hooray!

Apparently, the content is all that counts.

“The Sandman” Season 2, Volume 1 premieres Thursday, July 3 on Netflix. Volume 1 is made up of six episodes, which will be released at once, but Volume 2 (made up of five episodes) will premiere July 24, and the series finale will premiere July 31.

Ari Aster may be synonymous with the horror genre, but the auteur is revealing what he finds most “frightening” in real life: The rise of AI. Aster told Letterboxd that the reliance on the technology, and the following of “disciples” it's amassed, could have disastrous effects on the world.

“I have a lot of fear regarding this,” the “Eddington” director said. “It's obviously already too late. We're in a race now. It's how the history of technological innovation has worked: If we can, we will. I have larger questions, you know? What did Marshall McLuhan say: ‘Man is the sex organ of the machine world,' right? Is this technology an extension of us, are we extensions of this technology, or are we here to usher it into being?”

Aster pointed to how those who are supportive of AI speak about the technology as though it were a deity as opposed to a tool. “If you talk to these engineers and the people ushering this AI in, they don't talk about AI as this great new medium; they don't even talk about it as technology. They talk about it as a god,” Aster said. “They talk like disciples. They're very worshipful of this thing. Whatever space there was between our lived reality and this imaginal reality — that's disappearing, and we're merging, and that's very frightening.” 

 










And just how “real” AI has become is also a worry to the “Beau Is Afraid” director. 

“The most uncanny thing about it, to me, is that it's less uncanny than I want it to be. I see AI-generated videos, and they look like life; they just look real. It goes back to that human capacity for adaptation,” he said. “The weirder things get, and the longer we live in them, the more normal they become. But something huge is happening right now, and we have no say in it. So, here we go. I can't believe we're actually going to live through this and see what happens. Holy cow.” 

Aster's latest feature “Eddington” has traces of the paranoia about technology. The film is set in 2020, but Aster explained how it “feels just as relevant — if not more relevant — now” with its 2025 release. 

“I wanted to make a film where everybody's alienated from each other and has lost track of a bigger world outside of themselves. They only see the dimensions of the small world they believe in, and distrust anything that contradicts this small bubble of certainty,” Aster said, citing the social effects of the COVID pandemic. “We've all been trained to see the world through certain windows, but those windows have just become stranger and stranger. Look at what's happened with the internet. It used to be this thing that we went to, but now it's something we carry on us. We live inside the internet now.” 

 










He added of the ensemble, “All these characters are cyborgs, the same way we're all cyborgs. While we were making this film, I kept referring to it as ‘Screens: The Movie.' With every scene, the question was, ‘Is there a way to incorporate screens here?' The problem is, the more ambient things become, the less obvious they are, and the less strange they seem. I wanted to underscore the strangeness of the situation: These people, despite being a community of people, are not a community. Despite being in the same rooms as each other, they are living on totally different planes. If anything, hopefully, the effect is that all these screens become queasy-making. I wanted them to be as pervasive as they are in real life.”

Director Victoria Mahoney knows a little something about stepping into a beloved franchise and coming out the other side. In between her lauded 2011 feature film debut “Yelling to the Sky” and a wide assortment of TV directing gigs (“Queen Sugar,” “Grey's Anatomy,” “Claws,” “You,” and many more), Mahoney was hired as the second unit director on J.J. Abrams' “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” 

A “Star Wars” gig? That sounds great for any director, but when Mahoney was hired in 2018, it came with some added weight: The position meant that she'd be the first woman to direct on a “Star Wars” film ever. 
 










So, yes, Mahoney knows a little something about stepping into a beloved franchise. For her second feature, Netflix's “The Old Guard 2,” Mahoney is once again taking an established (and adored) series and making it her own. Following Gina Prince-Bythewood's smash hit “The Old Guard,” Mahoney's film picks up where the superhero story ended, and follows the exploits of a talented group of immortal warriors, including Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, and Veronica Ngô, plus newbies Henry Golding and Uma Thurman, and returning (human) co-star Chiwetel Ejiofor.

The big question: What's her secret for putting her own stamp on everything from “Star Wars” to “The Old Guard”?

“Well, I think that I had a few bites at the apple on that,” the director said during a recent interview with IndieWire. “Coming into ‘Star Wars' and doing second unit on ‘The Rise of Skywalker,' I had this wonderful experience of being on a franchise that I knew and loved since I was a kid. It wasn't just like, ‘Oh, well, whatever, I guess I'll do this.' It was something I loved and I wanted to help protect. I wanted to be a part of it. It meant something. Characters meant something. Stepping onto the Millennium Falcon meant something.”

Mahoney still speaks of her experience on “Star Wars” with reverence. This was not just a job to her; even if it did help guide her next few years of professional choices, including boarding “The Old Guard 2.”

“I held it with great duty and responsibility, and when you step into something of that magnitude, you get an immediate, immediate education in what it means to honor what audiences want and to betray what they want,” the director said. “That's a crash course in how to navigate something that you want to do in a story that's so beloved. Between you and me and everyone who reads this article, nothing's going to compare to that. Nothing will ever compare to that level of reach.”

 










And while “The Old Guard” fandom isn't quite as large and devoted as that of “Star Wars,” the films — based on Greg Rucka's comic book series of the same name — do have plenty of devoted watchers and readers.

“On this, the amount of people who love the first one and love the characters, they're very serious,” Mahoney said. “How do you make sure that you are valuing and honoring each character and giving audiences their wishes? There's also something great about bringing people along with you to somewhere maybe they didn't know they wanted to go, and they arrive at that place realizing they were hungry for it the entire time. But it's all done with respect and care. I don't think you can thrust or demand. It's done with a very light, warm invitation.”

Mahoney's fan-centric bent — and her desire to tweak expectations along the way — is borne from something very simple: She's a fan, too. She's a fan first.

“There are different jobs that I've done where I'm asking a question or there's something that we're trying to figure out, and I present something in a certain way, and it's like, ‘Oh, no one will notice it,' but I will notice. I will notice,” she said. “I actually love this character, or I love this circumstance, or this story or whatever it is, and that'll bug the hell out of me. That's going to drive me crazy. And then I'm going to know you didn't care about me, and now I feel like, ‘Oh, all the love I've given you is nothing and it's small, so you don't value me, so why do I value you and I'm not watching anymore?'”

 










And, yes, Mahoney is also a dedicated fan of Prince-Bythewood's first film, which hit Netflix in July 2020, during some of the earliest weeks of the pandemic, and proved to be balm for film fans itching for original action. Mahoney is the first person to tell you: She watched it a lot.

“I did watch it, many times!” she said. “Some people think, ‘Oh, you're exaggerating,' but I really did. I thought the world was ending, and if I was going to die, I was going to die watching movies and TV shows and just watching stories and reading books and listening to music. I found the movie to have some kind of hope. There was a care and regard the characters had for each other, and the length of their care and regard blew me away … I found there to be a beautiful sense of hope in how they sustain those relationships.”

There was also something else that tickled Mahoney: taking those relatable, earthbound worries (how do you take care of the people you love?) and sticking them inside a wild framework (and, oh, you're also an immortal being who has lived for thousands of years?).

“Part of why I found it exciting was [the question of] how to play with something that could be in the superhero realm, held above us and far away from us, and how to bring that into a realistic purview,” she said. “Where I and anyone else who watched the movie could wonder what I would or wouldn't do if I were immortal. I thought the first film successfully did that and kept me curious in a way that I kept watching it.”

 










When Mahoney signed on to direct “The Old Guard 2” in 2021, she said she made a point to speak to Prince-Bythewood, who remained a producer on the project (the filmmaker was, at the time that the sequel was greenlit, just gearing up to make her “The Woman King”).

“I have her to thank greatly on this,” she said. “We talked, and a lot of what I wanted to know was how to sustain and preserve these incredible nuggets of truth and importance that she put forward in the first film. You can think, ‘Oh, we could change that. Oh, you could do that. Oh, that doesn't matter.' But stepping into a second installment and franchise that I enjoy, [I had] the honor and the collaboration of spitballing with the first director about why they did what they did and that this thing that might seem like nothing to someone was so important and valuable and how I can help protect that or grow it. I valued her guidance and input and clarity and insight.”

Mahoney's deep-rooted fandom is clear in every moment she talks about the film. Even a question wondering if she felt a particular sense of favoritism toward Layne's character, Nile (who really comes into her own in the sequel), was greeted with an unexpected answer. 

“I have no favorites and I'm not being polite or political, because they all mean so much,” she said. “They function as a whole. They're not individual entities. As far as storytelling goes, each one services a different need, and if you pull one out, the house of cards comes down. There's not one of them that services a lesser need. Each aspect of creative value, story value, character value that one of the nine [stars] presents at any given moment is the most important thing in the story. Whoever we're shooting that day, that minute, whatever shot, whatever aspect of story we're chasing, is the most important, right? Then we go to the next one, and then that's the most important. Wherever that camera is between action and cut, that's the most important thing in the world.”

 










Given how long Mahoney has been working on the film — after coming on board in late 2021, Mahoney shot the film in late 2022, gutted her way through some serious delays from Netflix, shot additional material in 2024, and finally sees it released this week — she completely understands the fan fervor. She feels it even more acutely.

“Well, for me, being in it in real time is different from anyone who's watching it and waiting and wondering,” Mahoney said. “I have that with movies, I have that with TV shows that I love, I'm like, ‘Where is the next one? What's the next season?' So I am right along beside fans in that aching and hunger for the thing that we love. … I was in it the whole time, from the moment I got hired to the moment that this film is released, it'll be three-and-a-half years. Other directors might have, at some point, moved toward another project because of the duration and just the hunger to get back on set. I did not want to abandon my post. I cared about the movie way too much. I wanted to see it through, and there was no other answer.”

Mahoney's film leaves things wide open for a third feature, though one has not yet been announced. During production, Mahoney said, “There were discussions just logistically, and rightfully so, about the what-ifs” that the second film might set up. 

 










As for a third film? “Whatever discussions they're having, I don't know,” she said. “And I will be a spectator along with everyone else, because I will be gone doing something else. Whatever happens on the third one, I will return to [it as] a viewer and a fan, and I will be waiting with bated breath for what comes next, and where they go, and how it plays out. I will be cheering everyone on.”

With “The Old Guard 2” under her belt and “Star Wars” behind her, I asked how Mahoney reflects on the truly ground-breaking nature of her “Rise of Skywalker” work, of being the first woman, let alone the first Black woman, to direct on a “Star Wars” film. Despite her characteristically upbeat and thoughtful personality, even Mahoney got a bit morose in thinking back. 

“It's interesting, because a lot of those factors that you just described are as poignant today on this movie as they were then,” she said. “I don't know how many women have big-budget movies coming out this year. It's challenging. So, unfortunately, that particular part of the discussion is identical to the discussion that was in the ‘Star Wars' press tour.”

Still, Mahoney remains awestruck by the devotion of “Star Wars” fans, and the born-and-bred New Yorker attempted to compare it to Knicks or Yankees fandom. “I'll say ‘Yankees' now, I'm going to lose people,” she said with a laugh. “They're going to be like, ‘Oh, she's a Yankee/Knicks fan. That sucks.' But when you went to the old Yankee Stadium, you sit down, and it's summer, it's warm weather, and the lights are going down and the sky is turning magenta, something magical happened. Even if you were jaded and you didn't like sports and you didn't believe in mystical moments and wonderment, you were taken over, and ‘Star Wars' does that.”

 










Even now, Mahoney said she's still struck when she sees little kids in airports sporting their “Star Wars” PJs for a flight or adults playing lightsabers in a park with friends. “There aren't words for what that does to your heart when you interact with people who have that kind of magic in them,” she said. “And then on [‘The Old Guard 2'], there's a feeling about immortality and living and loving the one you're with that has some version of magic to it. It kind of propels you into another space and mind.”

“And we're just talking about imagination here,” she added. “But ‘Star Wars' has a way of accessing one's imagination and putting you in this great what-if. What's fun for me about ‘The Old Guard' and why I find it exciting is there are aspects of ‘The Old Guard' that allow me, as a viewer and a storyteller, to access my imagination in a beautiful, welcomed what-if.”

“The Old Guard 2” is now streaming on Netflix.

Celine Song is speaking out on how rom-coms are written off by critics and audiences alike. The Oscar-nominated filmmaker was asked by the Southampton Playhouse Artistic Director Eric Kohn why there are fewer rom-coms made today (although Song's sophomore film “Materialists” is decidedly not one of them). Song told the Southampton Playhouse that the lack of romance genre films is in part due to “misogyny,” specifically by deeming the features merely “chick flicks.”

“There has been this diminishing of the genre by calling them ‘chick flicks,'” Song said. “I think about this in terms of what I'd consider the middle class of movies. Either you can make a movie for so much money that you have to make so much money back, or the movie is being made for festivals under $2 million where it's for some people and the goal is to go through the journey of accolades and all those other things.”

She continued, “Generally speaking, there are so few movies that fit into whatever category mine is. It's a theatrical film, not for streaming. It's an R-rated romantic dramedy and not based on a book. It's an original story. It has these great actors in it and the genre has been historically dismissed as chick flick.” 

 










That dismissal is in part due to the patriarchal undermining of films that are largely written and directed by women; Song also stated that people are also fearful of examining their own relationship to the idea of love, which is at the (literal) heart of the rom-com genre.

“A few reasons, one of which is misogyny. But there's another part of it. Romance is something that we're all embarrassed to be obsessed with,” Song said. “OK, fine, it's a chick flick. That's often said as if it's not a serious movie. I always think, well, that's sad in a couple of ways. You're saying chicks are not serious people. Secondly, it's not the concern of serious people to think about love and dating. But serious people do it, too. They're very troubled by love and dating. Ask any serious person. And so it's a genre that is dismissed. People are scared of it. […] True love is a difficult thing for people. When I say it, adults look at me like I'm Santa Claus. But true love is the only thing that is real. I don't know why true love is any less real than a Birkin bag or a Maserati. True love has endured throughout time. It's a thing that is so ancient.” 

Song cited how the American way of looking at (and for) love is starkly different from other cultures' approaches to courtship and self-worth. “As a Canadian, as a bit of an outsider, I see the way that Americans think of themselves as merchandise that is built into the DNA of the country,” Song said, with the theme of people as “merchandise” being throughout the aptly-titled “Materialists.”
 










“My actors were so beautifully attuned to this,” Song said of the cast, which consists of Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal, and Chris Evans. “Who [better] understands ‘I'm not merchandise, I'm a person' than Chris, Dakota, and Pedro. Pedro gets treated like he's ‘The Mandalorian' and Chris gets treated like Captain America. He's a different person. Dakota was in '50 Shades of Grey.' Talk about objectification!” 

She added, “They wanted to do this movie not because it's a fun rom-com. They get offered rom-coms all the time. They wanted to make this particular movie with me because they wanted to talk about the way we brutalize ourselves and don't treat ourselves like real people. Only when we're people are we actually capable of love.”

Put some respect on Karol G's name. Over the past two years, the Colombian superstar became the first Latina to headline a global stadium tour for her acclaimed 2023 album Mañana será bonito and its companion, Bichota Season, which transformed heartbreak into top-tier perreo. Her career spans nearly a decade of award wins and collaborations with nearly every major artist in old- and new-school urbano, Latin trap, R&B, and hip-hop. She even has her own Bratz doll.

Mañana será bonito and Bichota Season were sensitive and diaristic, recorded as she healed from a public breakup and decorated with Sharpie hearts and mermaid stickers. But they also showcased her artistic growth, using hope as fuel for high-octane urbano anthems. To follow up this monumental success, Karol G's new album Tropicoqueta roots itself in urbano's analog beginnings: Live instrumentation and Latina bombshells who captivated audiences with their confidence. Less drum packs, less clothing, more congas. “Más buena, más dura, más level.”

The essence of Tropicoqueta is the backpacking, Próxima Estación energy of “Viajando por el Mundo,” featuring cherished polyglot Manu Chao. Sidestepping urbano in favor of folkloric heart, Karol G ventures across Latin America with soul and precision. There are no attempts at genre reinvention; this album honors Colombian, Puerto Rican, Panamanian, Dominican, Mexican, Brazilian, and Cuban rhythms by delivering them at their purest. It's a tribute to the music that taught her how to feel before it taught her how to perform. Tropicoqueta isn't just Karol G's most expansive body of work—it's her most researched.

In form and concept, the album directly traces Colombia's musical lineage and the roles of Latin women in the global entertainment industry. Colombia's mainstream music history begins in 1934 with the founding of Discos Fuentes in Cartagena. While Eurocentric sounds dominated early radio, visionary label founder Don Antonio Fuentes set out to shape the nation's sonic identity by scouting the coasts and countryside for Black, Indigenous, and rural talent. His label championed Afro-Caribbean sounds from la costa like cumbia, vallenato, merengue, and salsa, along with those of the campesinos like parrandera and bambuco. In 1961, it broke through with the first volume of the highly successful compilation series 14 Cañonazos Bailables (14 Canon Shots for Dancing), which united a variety of genres under the umbrella of “tropical” music.

Karol channels this musical revolution in tracks like “Cuando Me Muera Te Olvido,” a technocumbia bathed in cosmic synths and echo. The way she draws out the word “cumbia” is a stamp of authenticity, transporting me to a bustling banquet-hall dancefloor with my primas. Sampling George Michael's 1984 hit “Careless Whisper,” Karol continues the custom of morphing English-language pop songs into unexpectedly great cumbias. (Was this an Uno Reverse for Wham!'s “Club Tropicana?”) Then there's “No Puedo Vivir Sin Él,” a stunning, accordion-laced vallenato where Karol's paisa accent feels right at home. Steeped in melodrama and misty-eyed melancholia, it's the kind of song that turns a bottle of guaro into a microphone. At just the mere thought of losing her lover, Karol sings, “Yo prefiero morir,” placing a gun to her heart. Oh, to be loved, Colombianly.

Though the Cañonazos compilations primarily featured male salseros (like Joe Arroyo and Fruko y sus Tesos), cumbiamberos (Pedro Laza and Gustavo Quintero), and vallenateros, their album covers were eroticized pinup imagery. Leading up to the release of Tropicoqueta, Karol G shared some of these historical covers via Instagram, as if to ask: What if the women on the Cañonazos album covers had performed the songs? What were their stories? Posing pinup-style atop conga drums, she uses the Tropicoqueta artwork to answer.

The album's historicism goes beyond strictly musical references. Last week, Karol brought iconic Cuban journalist Cristina Saralegui out of retirement to film a special episode of her eponymous talk show, which hosted the biggest Latin musicians from the '90s until 2010. She name-dropped @ficheraz, an archival project dedicated to preserving the fascinating history of Latin, Caribbean, and diasporic showgirls. Starting as early as the 1940s and continuing into the '80s, these vedettes—dazzling leading ladies who danced, sang, acted, and even clowned all within one show—took control of their own sensuality through cabaret, burlesque, and film. In the video for “Papasito,” Karol dances Brazilian lambada on a chintzy set reflecting this era of Latina entertainers. The album's only song partially in English, this galloping, flirty technomerengue evokes archetypal vedettes like Iris and Lourdes Chacón, muses who spoke to international audiences with over-the-top charm and enigmatic, at times absurd, performances. The sumptuous, smouldering bachata of “Ivonny Bonita” embodies these baddies of decades past: bold rumberas who, like Karol G, fell in love with the stage.

You could follow just about every song here into another musical genre or historical tangent. Even the contemporary-sounding songs have lineage, like the slow-whining, old-school flows of “Dile Luna,” an acknowledgment of how much Afro-Panamanians like Eddy Lover have done for reggaeton. Mariah Angeliq singing, “Ya tu sabes quienes son, en un makinon” (“You already know who it is, in a huge machine”) is a shoutout to Puerto Rico. Karol also references the legacies of several Mexican it-girls and artists, recreating Rossy Mendoza's glittering green two-piece in the “LATINA FOREVA” video and opening the album with a casual, honey-toned duet with Thalía, the “Queen of Latin Pop,” singing her classic “Piel Morena.” Later, Marco Antonio Solís, formerly of Los Bukis, conjures sweeping novela imagery with “Coleccionando Heridas”—picture a male protagonist riding a white horse on a beach at sunset, half-buttoned shirt rippling in the breeze. But the real showstopper is “Ese Hombre Es Malo,” where Karol's vocals soar over a breathtaking 57-piece mariachi symphony.

With Tropicoqueta, Karol G delivers an album for people who love Latin music and show business as much as she does. Her ambitious vision is shaped by those who've come before her and dedicated to the communities who lift her up. The album's studied combination of traditional and modern sounds underlines what makes today's urbano so addictive: The cultural references that the Latin diaspora recognize so easily. The way we know which steps to dance within a song's first five seconds. “¿Será que se quedó el amor en otros tiempos?” (“Could it be that love has stayed in the past?”) Karol asks in “Coleccionando Heridas.” Her fifth album asserts that it's inside of us at all times, if only you know where to look.

Genre:

Rap

Label:

July 3, 2025

If Young Scooter were holding in a sneeze, if Ralo stubbed his toe on a wall, if BabyDrill were electrocuted, they'd almost sound like Baby Mel. Harsh, screechy, and kinda hilarious, Mel's dehydrated melodies and rampant volume shifts might, on the wrong day, resemble pig squeals more than rapping. You may feel inspired to write off the Montgomery, Alabama native as a gimmick in the same class as Baby Kia's screamo-rap or 645AR's squeak-sing, and I wouldn't blame you. But unlike them, Mel never seems like he's waiting for you to ask, How crazy is this guy? Instead he turns up the dial on Boosie-style shrillness, the rambly deliveries sometimes found on late-'90s No Limit albums, and the mumbled country blues of Rylo Rodriguez for a form of deeply Southern trap music that is both familiar and way out there—and only a little annoying.

EL CHITO, Mel's second mixtape of the year, cranks up his strained-voice hustlenomics on top of beats that mash up multiple eras of trap production, from the heyday of Jeezy to post-Lex Luger Maybach Music tapes. A few of the instrumentals coast on mimicking popular sounds of the past, like “Trenches,” which has all the fixings of a Bankroll Fresh project (booming 808s, tinny hi-hats) except for the feeling that it was made by following a step-by-step YouTube tutorial. Better are the beats where you get the sense that the producer fell in love with a specific element of the vintage production style, such as the ominous Shawty Redd-esque synth on “Boyz 2 Men” or the brass-knuckled chants in the background of “Get Low” that call back to Three 6 Mafia's brawl music.

As a whole, though, the beats work as triumphant mood-setters for Mel's relentless barrage of rags-to-riches dope boy memories and Instagram caption-ready motivation rap. “The whole hood depending on me, I never stop,” he says on “My Pit,” with the trembling force of hitting a final rep on the bench press. He's not the most scenic or descriptive lyricist, but his quick-twitch raps and vocal acrobatics occasionally give life to cliché lyrics and phrases. He's so fired-up on “Find Exit Door” that his voice cracks, and if the intro feels raw and unfiltered, it's just because he seems to be half-muttering whatever thoughts come to him on the fly. He gets away with not really saying much because his voice sounds distinct and cool.

But you could say the same thing about plenty of good rappers with one-of-a-kind voices, and this isn't one of those hard-nosed Southern trap mixtapes where the lyrics are meant to make you feel the blood, sweat, and tears. It's way sillier, even if that's unintentional, considering that Baby Mel's main takeaway from getting rich is that he can't believe how much ass he's getting. He opens “Ion Need Ya” by coughing like he's having an asthma attack, then gets unusually quiet just to say, “I like the way she move it/I like the way she shake it.” He spots a woman so thick on “Aint My Fault” that he sounds like he needs an oxygen mask. On “Have My Child,” the best song on the tape, he's practically howling with joy because girls want to make babies with him now. In another life, he'd probably still be using his jarring wail-rap to drop provocative and trendy drill, instead of this hard-to-categorize mutant collage of horny celebration trap. I can't help but respect that choice even when he's splitting my ears in half.

Charley Crockett recently announced a new album, Dollar a Day, that comes out on August 8 via Island. The Texas country musician has now shared the lead single, “Crucified Son,” which you can check out below, along with the new album's trailer.

The 15-track Dollar a Day is Crockett's second album of 2025, following March's Lonesome Drifter. According to a press release, the albums are part of a trilogy called The Sagebrush Trilogy.

Like Lonesome Drifter, Dollar a Day was co-produced by Crockett and Shooter Jennings. They recorded the album at the storied Sunset Sound Studio 3 in Hollywood, California. “With Shooter, I've never felt more like myself in the studio,” Crockett stated in press materials. “I don't feel judged. At all. It's truly a partnership. Hell, I'd say he's my best friend, and you can't aspire to greatness without that kind of trust. With Lonesome Drifter, it felt like we opened the portal. With Dollar a Day, we stepped through and came out the other side.”

Beginning in September, Crockett will go on tour with Leon Bridges. He has shows coming up soon this summer, too.

A drive-by shooting outside a Mello Buckzz EP release party in Chicago last night (July 2) has left four people dead and 14 wounded, CBS News reports. Three people fired from a vehicle into a crowd outside the Artis Lounge nightclub, in the River North neighborhood, at about 11 p.m., Chicago police said. Two women, 26 and 27, and two men aged 24 and 25 died of gunshot wounds. Three of the wounded are in critical condition.

Mello Buckzz, who threw the party for the release of her Hollyhood EP, wrote in an Instagram Story, “Prayers up for all my sisters god please wrap yo arms around every last one of them.” She added, “ngl im fucked up… feel like everything just weighing down on me... all i can do is talk to god and pray.” Another Story read, “i dont wish this typa pain on nobody 💔 dam my fucking crew.”

Sources told NBC Chicago that Mello Buckzz's boyfriend and best friend were among those killed. Police are searching for the shooters. A nightclub at the same location, Hush Lounge, was the scene of a shooting in 2022, CBS News notes. Pitchfork has emailed Chicago police and Mello Buckzz's management for further comment.

	The Guyanese site of the Jonestown massacre, where over 900 people either died by mass suicide or murder in connection with the Jim Jones-led cult in 1978, has opened for tourism. 


	After decades of abandonment, a private tourism company in the South American country of Guyana announced plans to host guided tours of the former compound in late 2024, a decision that was met with controversy at the time.


	“We think it is about time. This happens all over the world,” Rose Sewcharran, director of Wanderlust Adventures, the tourism company providing the tours, told the Associated Press in 2024. “We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust Museum.”


	Months later, Wanderlust — with approval from the Guyanese government — is offering the Jonestown Memorial Tour to tourists, including flights to the Guyanese capital of Georgetown and an hour-long van trip to the sparse remains of the Peoples Temple settlement, the New York Times reports.

	











	Longtime congresswoman Jackie Speier, who survived a 1978 attack in Guyana — she was shot multiple times while serving as an aide to U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan, who was killed by Peoples Temple members when he traveled to Guyana to investigate claims of people being held against their will — was among those who protested Wanderlust's decision.

	“I was horrified because it doesn't deserve to be a tourist attraction,” Speier told KTVU in December 2024. “And for a company to think this is adventure tourism is missing the mark.”

	











	The inaugural tour of Jonestown included two of Sewcharran's own relatives, two journalists, and two tourists, the New York Times reported. Sewcharran added that the goal of the tour was not sensationalism but exploring “the dangers of manipulation, unchecked authority and the circumstances that led to this devastating event.”

	Angie Martoccio



	The BBC has issued a formal apology following Bob Vylan‘s controversial Glastonbury performance, in which they chanted “Free, free Palestine,” and “Death, death to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces].”


	“We deeply regret that such offensive and deplorable behaviour appeared on the BBC and want to apologise to our viewers and listeners and in particular the Jewish community,” the broadcaster said in a statement. “We are also unequivocal that there can be no place for antisemitism at, or on, the BBC.”


	The BBC admitted that “errors” were made “both in the lead-up to and during Bob Vylan's appearance,” claiming the London alt-rap duo was “deemed high risk” — alongside six other acts — following a risk assessment that was applied to all performers. Despite this classification, the acts were allowed to perform with “appropriate mitigations.”


	“A decision was taken that compliance risks could be mitigated in real time on the live stream — through the use of language or content warnings — without the need for a delay,” the broadcaster wrote. “This was clearly not the case. During the performance, the livestream was monitored in line with the agreed compliance protocols and a number of issues were escalated. Warnings appeared on the stream on two occasions and the editorial team took the decision not to cut the feed. This was an error.”

	











	The BBC went on to write that the Director-General instructed that the performance will not be featured in any future coverage, with no downloads offered via iPlayer or Sounds. But the livestream remained active until after 8 p.m., while they worked on a “technical solution.”

	











	They also announced immediate changes going forward: all future acts classified as “high risk” will automatically not be broadcast or streamed live, Editorial Policy support will always be on site at events “to improve compliance processes and the speed of available advice,” and they'll provide “more detailed, practical guidance on the threshold for withdrawing a live stream.”

	BBC Samir Shah released an additional apology “to all our viewers and listeners and particularly the Jewish community for allowing the ‘artist' Bob Vylan to express unconscionable antisemitic views live on the BBC.” 


	The BBC's statement follows several other developments that have occurred since the Bob Vylan controversy. Glastonbury itself issued a formal statement following the performance, with festival head Emily Eavis stating that the organizers were “appalled” by the comments. The U.S. State Department revoked the duo's U.S. visas ahead of their fall tour, while they were removed from upcoming European festivals (England's Radar Festival and France's Kave Fest). British police have also launched an investigation into their performance.

	“We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people,” the duo wrote on Instagram. “We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine,” the duo said on Instagram. “A machine whose own soldiers were told to use ‘unnecessary lethal force' against innocent civilians waiting for aid. A machine that has destroyed much of Gaza. We, like those in the spotlight before us, are not the story. We are a distraction from the story. And whatever sanctions we receive will be a distraction … the more time they talk about Bob Vylan, the less time they spend answering for their criminal inaction. We are being targeted for speaking up. We are not the first. We will not be the last.”

	During the latest episode of Call Her Daddy, Charlize Theron discussed why she won't name the director she alleges sexually harassed her when she was just starting her career. 


	When asked by host Alex Cooper about publicly sharing her story, The Old Guard 2 star recalled the incident. Theron first came forward with her experience during an interview on The Howard Stern Show in 2019, in which she claimed she went to a director's house for an audition late at night and he greeted her in his pajamas. At time, Theron said the director put his had on her knee, and that she got up and left after.


	“I didn't know what the audition process looked like,” Theron told Cooper. “The little voice inside me definitely said, ‘This isn't right.' But then, the other voice in me says, ‘Well, I don't know. Maybe it is right.'” 


	Theron said that after coming forward with her story, the director “got a little nervous for a while there.” She added, “I've never said his name because honestly, I don't want the story to be about him. It's not because I'm protecting him or anything, but he got nervous for a little bit.”

	She further explained, “Because he heard me tell the story, and he knew it was about him, and he wrote me a pretend letter trying to explain his behavior and how I must have misunderstood it, which is classic, isn't it?”


	“I think he started panicking,” she continued. “And I just realized, like, I won't even fucking say your name because you know you're the scumbag. You know it's you and if anybody ever asked me about him, I would be completely honest, and he knows that. And I kind of like that he's got to be on a hot seat. He doesn't know when it's going to come. I kind of like that a little more.”

	











	In her recent documentary Call Her Alex, Cooper detailed alleged sexual harassment she said began in 2013 while on the Boston University women's soccer team, and claimed that her then-coach, Nancy Feldman, developed a fixation on her that led to “deeply uncomfortable” interactions, including verbal remarks and physical touch.

It's really, really hard. It doesn't make it easy for us.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia described a harrowing account of his detainment during the nearly three months he was wrongfully imprisoned in El Salvador thanks to Donald Trump's administration, claiming he was beaten, deprived of sleep, and psychologically tortured.


	According to court papers filed by his lawyers on Wednesday, upon his arrival at El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, a prison official told detainees: “Welcome to CECOT. Whoever enters here doesn't leave.” Abrego Garcia was then allegedly forced to strip, struck in the legs, head, and arms to make him change faster, then was frog-marched to a cell while being hit with wooden batons along the way.


	The filing in Maryland district court claims that Abrego Garcia and 20 other Salvadorans in his cell were forced to kneel from approximately 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., with guards striking anyone who collapsed from exhaustion. “During this time, Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was denied bathroom access and soiled himself,” read the filing. “The detainees were confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation.”

	











	During his first two weeks at CECOT, his lawyers said that he lost 31 pounds.


	Abrego Garcia's legal team also claimed that he and four others were moved in April “to a different module in CECOT, where they were photographed with mattresses and better food — photos that appeared to be staged to document improved conditions.”

	











	Abrego Garcia was among hundreds of immigrants whom the administration shipped to El Salvador without due process back in March, in defiance of a court order. However, he had previously been granted a “protection of removal” order barring his deportation to El Salvador — and his deportation was found to be “illegal” by the Supreme Court.


	The Trump administration for almost two months publicly refused to comply with the Supreme Court's directive — as well as those from Maryland District Court Judge Paula Xinis and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. It finally complied with the directive in June, returning Abrego Garcia to the United States. But the Justice Department said that it had returned him to the U.S. only so that he could face a federal indictment, dated May 21, charging him with “alien smuggling and conspiracy to commit alien smuggling.”

	Last month, the magistrate judge in the Tennessee case, Barbara D. Holmes, ordered the Trump administration to release Abrego Garcia from federal custody on bail during the case. In a scathing order, she skewered the government's attempts to paint Abrego Garcia as a hardened criminal and gang member. Holmes wrote that the evidence bolstering the government's claims he allegedly smuggled minors was based largely on hearsay, and even contradictory testimony, from three individuals — two men in detention who were offered deals for their testimony, and a woman related to one of them. 


	Since then, the administration has said they plan to have Abrego Garcia arrested by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and that he could be deported to a third country, or one that is not his place of origin — forcing his lawyers to request he stay in Justice Department custody for now, a request the Tennessee court temporarily granted. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, meanwhile, previously wrote on X that Abrego Garcia “will be tried, jailed, and then deported again to El Salvador.”

	In a filing before Xinis in Maryland, Abrego Garcia's lawyers write that the Trump administration has “refused to identify which country they propose to remove him to, thereby denying him the opportunity to seek protection from removal to that country as required by law.”


	The lawyers request that the court order that “defendants may not remove Mr. Abrego Garcia from the continental United States without first providing him and his counsel with written notice of the specific country they intend to remove him to, and a reasonable period of time — which Plaintiffs respectfully suggest is ten days — to file an application for relief under, among other things, the withholding of removal statute and the Convention Against Torture with respect to such country.”

	The Republican-led House of Representatives is expected to vote Thursday on President Donald Trump's profoundly unpopular tax and spending bill. It has been called “the most regressive U.S. tax and budget law in at least the past four decades — and possibly ever,” according to researchers at Yale University. 


	Trump's christened it the “Big Beautiful Bill,” but it will cost the U.S. government $4.5 trillion to pay for massive tax benefits that overwhelmingly enrich big corporations and the wealthy by making draconian cuts to public spending and programs for everyone else. It also launches a frontal assault on environmental and climate justice.


	The nonprofit law firm Earthjustice calls it “the worst environmental bill in U.S. history.”


	The fossil fuel industry has been aggressively lobbying on the bill, winning hand-outs as the chief executives of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Marathon, and other companies personally rake in millions of dollars from Trump's first wave of tax cuts. Among the pounds of flesh the bill extracts are key climate and environmental justice provisions enacted by Congress to protect public health, reduce pollution and harmful greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthen the ability of communities across the country to go head-to-head with petrochemical and oil and gas giants amid the worsening climate crisis.

	











	For the people I met in Louisiana's rural communities and struggling inner-city neighborhoods last week, the expected toll of the Trump megabill is profoundly personal. They live in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country experiencing a double-whammy of fossil fuel and petrochemical pollution and climate devastation. They work in or are served by small local community-based organizations that received or hoped for grants from the federal government to support environmental and climate justice through programs established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022 under President Joe Biden.

	Their grants were early targets of Trump and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Over the course of four months, from February through May 2025, Trump's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) terminated every environmental justice grant awarded by the agency, totaling nearly 800 grants. It is one part of Trump's all-out-assault on environmental justice and racial justice more broadly. As Nikole Hannah-Jones explains, Trump has initiated “the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.”


	Lawsuits have challenged the grant terminations — including a new class action launched last week, and courts across the country have repeatedly found the Trump administration's actions to be illegal. U.S. District Court Judge Adam Abelson wrote, in an opinion on June 17, that in canceling a group of environmental justice grants, “precisely because they are environmental justice programs,” the “EPA contends that it has authority to thumb its nose at Congress and refuse to comply with its directives.” He ruled that EPA has no such authority.


Republicans are now trying to use the hopped-up, fast-tracked, and obnoxiously named “Big Beautiful Bill” to either eliminate these programs entirely or, if that fails, permanently zero out their funds to help pay for Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy. If the effort to wipe out these programs is successful, the impact will be deadly, particularly as Trump and the Supreme Court simultaneously gut regulations and oversight of fossil fuel, petrochemical, and other major polluters. 


	A current EPA employee confided with me anonymously that the result will surely be that more people get sick and die. “There's no way that couldn't happen,” she tells me. “There's just no way, scientifically, that there won't be an increase.”

	At 3 a.m. on May 14, Tish Taylor got the news of a lifetime. Phone calls and emails poured in, declaring, “Denka is closing!” 


	Taylor, 61, has grown up in the shadow of the massive Denka petrochemical plant in St. John the Baptist Parish. She joined her father, Robert Taylor, in his decade-long effort organizing against Denka's toxic pollution. First, she felt pure elation that the plant could be shutting down, then disbelief. “This can't be real,” she thought, “but it was wonderful.” She immediately told her father, then went outside, smelled her flowers, and let the news sink in. “It's real,” she said to herself. 

	











	In 2016, Robert Taylor, now 84, founded Concerned Citizens of St. John, a small, feisty, and until recently all-volunteer community organization going head-to-head against Denka. Like many other similarly situated groups I meet in Louisiana, Concerned Citizens has been aided in its efforts by federal dollars (and had hoped to apply for more) that would be eliminated by the Trump tax bill. The money was working, making them better resourced and effective, and thus a larger threat to the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry and its political allies.


	The Taylors live in Cancer Alley, an 85-mile stretch of communities along the Mississippi River congested with fossil fuel and petrochemical plants that are heavily concentrated in Black neighborhoods, their toxic emissions polluting the air and intensifying the climate crisis. St. John has the highest cancer risk in the nation from toxic air pollution at seven times the national rate. 


	St. John is home to a sprawling Marathon oil refinery that nearly encircles the graveyard where much of the Taylors' family is buried. There is the Evonik petrochemical plant and other facilities. But in 2018, EPA released data showing that 85 percent of the toxic air pollution in St. John can be traced to just one facility: the Denka Performance Elastomer plant, which uses chloroprene, a particularly toxic petrochemical derived from fossil fuels, to produce neoprene used in synthetic rubber production.


	Standing in her father's home, Tish Taylor shares photos with me of her mother who recently passed away after a long battle with cancer, and of her sister Raven, who has suffered decades of debilitating illness, experiencing three lumpectomies, the removal of her uterus, colon, and stomach, and a rare autoimmune disease, neuronal VGKC antibody syndrome. (Autoimmune disease has been linked to chemical exposure.) Tish's children and grandchildren suffer from respiratory ailments, including asthma.


	Robert Taylor has gained a good deal of recognition for his efforts against Denka. But he was still shocked when he received a phone call in 2021 from the administrator of the EPA, Michael Regan. The Biden administration had made environmental and climate justice a national priority, and Regan called to ask Taylor what he needed from the agency. “I said, ‘We desperately need to know what it is we're breathing,” Taylor recalls. “‘We're dying from it. We don't know what it is. We don't know how much it is. We need to have control. We need your help because the state is not working to help us.' And he said, ‘I will work on that,' and he did exactly as he promised.” Taylor also wanted regulation and enforcement to shut Denka down.

	











	Inflation Reduction Act funding includes grants for community air monitoring, which has supported the Taylors' organizing efforts. The funding for that program, like virtually all environmental and climate justice grants through the Inflation Reduction Act, has been targeted for elimination under the Trump tax bill, according to an analysis by Evergreen Action.


	In June 2023, the New Orleans-based nonprofit, Deep South Center for Environmental Justice received a federal grant through the air monitoring program and provided a two-year $82,000 subgrant to Concerned Citizens of St. John — a significant amount of money to the small organization. The Deep South Center explained that the grant would help build capacity of local partners that had already achieved some important milestones, but whose success in addressing “endemic issues will only grow if they are well-resourced.”


	Concerned Citizens continued to work with the Biden administration, which increased federal regulations on emissions from petrochemical plants, including Denka. The administration then sued Denka in 2023, charging that there was an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health and welfare of nearby communities due to the unacceptably high cancer risk posed by its excessive emissions. Trump dropped the suit, with his administration issuing a press release stating: “Justice Department Dismisses Suit Against Denka, Delivering on President Trump's Mandate to End Radical DEI Programs.” 


	On March 28, Concerned Citizens of St. John issued its intent to continue the suit against Denka independently (one of many legal actions it has taken to curb the plant's emissions). Six weeks later, on May 13, Denka announced that the plant had been shut down and would not restart production, citing “cost, production, and other challenges,” including the pollution control equipment required by Biden-era regulations (which remain active), inflation, and unscheduled plant outages associated with severe weather events.  


	Taylor tells me that he won't believe Denka is closing until the plant is closed. But he is cautiously optimistic. He points to his friend and ally, Larry Sorapuru, seated now at his side, the only local political official to support their efforts. Taylor says if Denka does follow through on its plan to fully shutter the plant, Concerned Citizens will be watching to ensure it does not leave an even bigger mess behind for the community to clean up. 

	











	He believes he has little choice. These facilities “are a serious threat to our survival here, and they proved that they didn't care whether we survived or not,” Taylor says.


	Dr. Beverly Wright founded the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in her native New Orleans in 1992. She is one of the foremost leading and foundational figures in the U.S. environmental justice movement. 


	In addition to the grant mentioned earlier, in 2023, the center also received a $13 million five-year grant to serve as an Environmental Justice Thriving Community Technical Assistance Center, one of sixteen groups selected nationally to receive a total of $177 million supported by the Inflation Reduction Act's Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant.


	The $3 billion block grant alone “is 80 times more than any federal investment in environmental justice in history,” Chandra Taylor-Sawyer, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, told me in North Carolina last October. The tax bill would gut the entire block grant, rescinding all unobligated funds, according to an analysis by Evergreen Action.


	With the award, the Deep South Center launched a Community Investment & Recovery Center. Its five-year plan was to assist 250 smaller local groups to build their capacity to apply for and hopefully receive federal and other sources of funding. The goal was to build a lasting, well-resourced movement of local frontline community-based organizations. One of the groups they hoped to support again was Concerned Citizens of St. John.


	“We've developed educational and training tools so communities could speak for themselves to build leadership on the ground,” Dr. Wright tells me, as we sit in her office in New Orleans East. The Deep South Center for Environmental Justice also focuses on research, but, Wright warns, “If data alone was all we needed to make change, we wouldn't have Cancer Alley. It takes data and advocacy, strong advocacy involvement in the political system so you can control who represents you.”


	When DOGE started identifying grants to cut, technical assistance centers were at the top of the list. In his ruling finding certain environmental justice grant terminations illegal, Judge Adelson references a series of internal emails, including from a DOGE appointee (with a proclivity for exclamation points) to EPA: “As you can imagine, the DOGE team has lawyers that are pretty experienced with grant and contract cancellation at this point, so that's what that is based on!” 

	











	“I understand why they took the [technical assistance centers] first,” Dr. Wright says. “The last thing you want is an educated populace, which is what I learned in civics seventh grade.”


	Another early casualty was the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which Trump has been trying to claw back for months. The tax bill rescinds the entire program and all of its unobligated funds. The bill will also go after the funding of the $5 billion Climate Pollution Reduction Program.


	The Deep South Center received the letter terminating its grant on February 21. “I read that letter over and over again, and I got angrier and angrier. But my first response is, we're going to sue,” Dr. Wright tells me. The organization is now a lead plaintiff in a new class action lawsuit challenging the legality of all EPA terminations of Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant recipients. Wright expects that the attempt by Congress to gut these programs in the tax bill will also result in legal action, at least, that's the plan.


	In Louisiana alone, over a dozen environmental justice grants, worth approximately $70 million, were terminated in just the first round of 400 grants, including a grant to the St. James Parish-based Inclusive Louisiana.


	Collectively, Gail LeBoeuf and Barbara Washington have gathered over one and half centuries of life in rural Louisiana between them. They have probably lost an equal number of friends, relatives, and neighbors to cancers and other diseases which they attribute to the pollution of the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry that took up residence within their communities well after each woman was born. Five years ago, they formed Inclusive Louisiana, a small nonprofit organization to support their efforts to hold the industry accountable and transition off of its operations. 


	They received a $500,000 grant with local partner organizations Louisiana Bucket Brigade and Rural Roots. It was awarded through an Inflation Reduction Act Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program that provides financial assistance to organizations working to address local environmental or public health issues in their communities. On May 1, the Trump administration terminated their grant. 


	Their $500,000 project, named after their campaign, “Imagine St. James Parish,” is modest given the stakes. It would help make local homes more habitable amid the climate crisis, funding a pilot project for weatherization, putting roofs on houses still draped with blue tarps four years after Hurricane Ida devastated the area; reduce energy bills; protect against worsening heat; and clean up dump sites that pose health and safety hazards, particularly in times of tornadoes, floods, and hurricanes. 

	











	I meet LeBoeuf and Washington at the “Village Hub” — the name they've given to a squat yellow brick house purchased by Inclusive Louisiana in 2023 that serves as a community center for the small town of Convent in St. James Parish. Just across the street and on the other side of the levee, the Mississippi River makes its way through the neighborhood, tracing a line through Cancer Alley. Washington lives just one lane over on land originally purchased in 1874 by her great-great-great-grandmother Harriet Jones, who had formerly been enslaved at a nearby plantation. 


	LeBoeuf is hunched over her hands, visibly tired, and impatient when I arrive. In 2023, at the age of 72, she was diagnosed with liver cancer for which she receives regular chemotherapy. 


	In a 2003 report, the National Academy of Public Administration found that cancer rates in Cancer Alley were significantly higher than in the rest of Louisiana and in the nation as a whole. It also found that Black residents had significantly higher rates of cancer and mortality than did white residents. A 2022 study found that from 2019 to 2021, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality permitted industrial emissions of pollution that were seven- to 21-times higher among Black communities than in predominantly white communities in Louisiana.


	LeBoeuf doesn't like to talk about her illness. She prefers to focus on the work that Inclusive is doing and the change they're trying to create. But she admits that the chemo is hard and there are good days and bad days. This is a bad day. She fans out her hands before me and says, “we call it alligator skin.” When I ask what that is, she replies, “haven't you ever seen an alligator?” Her skin is thick, blotchy, and scaly. 


	Inclusive is small, but along with many allied groups across Cancer Alley, such as Rise St. James, they've collectively scored significant wins, beating back the Formosa petrochemical plant, an expansion by Koch industries, new industrial operations in St. John, and in their ongoing fight to impose a full moratorium on any new fossil fuel or petrochemical operations in St. James Parish. The victories are sweet but also make them and their allies targets, the women argue.


	Washington and LeBoeuf firmly believe that the industry and the government (local, state, and federal) want them gone. “They just want to phase out the residents here and just have petrochemical plants here,” Washington says. 

	











	The women cite the recent resignation of a leading ally, research scientist Kimberly Terrell, who resigned in protest from the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic after being muzzled, she says, by the university's president due to her extensive research exposing myriad harms and inequalities of the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry in Louisiana.


	“The petrochemical industry and our captured politicians hate the law clinic because we're winning and they hate that,” Anne Rolfes, Executive Director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade, tells me.


	“They want you to leave. They want you to be disgusted and not know where to go, what to do, how to do it. All those things work for them,” adds LeBoeuf. “We are imagining the right to clean air, clean water, the things that will make people want to stay and come back, and that doesn't work for them.”


	About $2 billion of the Inflation Reduction Act's Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant funded Community Change Grants advancing local community-driven projects that address climate challenges and reduce pollution. These grants were not announced until December 2024, leaving much of the funding not yet obligated and at risk of being gutted by the tax bill. 


	The EPA received approximately 2,700 applications, totaling over $40 billion in requested funds and nearly 2,500 requests for technical assistance under the program. The Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association in central New Orleans had hoped to be one of those recipients.


	Raymond Sweet is the Climate Coordinator for the Hollygrove-Dixon Neighborhood Association. Hollygrove-Dixon is a low-income community of color sandwiched between several crisscrossing highways and major thoroughfares. I meet Sweet at the Life Transformation Community Center, which has as its backyard the busy Airline Highway. 


	The association is one of six community-based organizations that jointly submitted an application with the Water Wise Gulf South nonprofit organization for a $15 million grant to expand its popular climate mitigation effort (recently featured in The New York Times). The last they'd heard from EPA was that the grant was under consideration. That was before Trump's terminations began and before his tax bill threatened to gut the entire program.


	When I arrive at the community center, a youth program is underway, preparing to head out into the neighborhood to learn about local environmental stewardship. I join a group of Black women taking part in a senior program and the conversation quickly turns to flooding, as the women whip out their phones to share pictures and stories. The rains, they explain, are coming more often, heavier, the streets are continually flooding, and it is getting worse. 

	











	“It just seems the rain is different,” says Glenda Davis, 70, a life-long Hollygrove-Dixon resident. “It comes down really heavy for an hour and our drainage systems cannot handle what's been happening. So, I kind of stay in my house so I don't have to deal with it.”


	The actions of the fossil fuel industry are driving the climate crisis, bringing more frequent and severe storms and rising seas. “Climate change makes the roads and infrastructure decay and get brittle,” Sweet explains. Add neglect and a lack of resources for repairs, and even a simple rain can result in debilitating flooding, not only of the neighborhood streets, but also of the highway, which serves as a crucial evacuation route for the city residents, he adds.


	Sweet had high hopes for his small portion of the $15 million grant, which would expand efforts already underway to implement simple, low-cost, and efficient climate adaptation techniques utilizing nature-based projects to help reduce flooding. This includes increasing green and soil space and planting trees to naturally absorb water and creating clear routes for water to flow into storm drains. “You've seen what we can do with little to no money,” Sweet says.

	Sweet sees the attack on environmental and climate justice by Trump and the Congress as having a clear source: “They're targeting us because we've had win after win after win — and it's just that they have been losing.”

  Yesterday was World UFO Day – and we're remembering mystery objects in the sky and our enduring fascination with them.

  The day was chosen as it is the anniversary of the supposed UFO crash in Roswell, USA, in 1947.

  On this day, ufologists (yes, there really is such a thing) and curious people gather together to observe the skies in search of Unidentified Flying Objects. Those who observe this day also campaign for the government to declassify files on UFO sightings.

  Some people choose to commemorate the day on June 24, when Kenneth Arnold, an aviator, reported what is known as the first UFO sighting in the United States. 
  The founders of WorldUFODay.com are responsible for creating World UFO Day. The first celebration was organised in 2001 with the goal to bring everyone who believes in and has seen UFOs from across the world together.

  They wanted to exchange evidence and information and look into the skies for more UFO sightings. They also aim to spread awareness about UFOs to those who don't believe in them.

  In 1947, an Unidentified Flying Object crashed at a ranch in Roswell, New Mexico. The United States Army Air Forces quickly explained that it was a weather balloon.

  But in the 1970s, ufologists brought the crash back to the limelight, claiming that the object that crashed at the ranch was in fact an alien spacecraft and that the United States government had organised a cover-up.

  Now Roswell holds an annual UFO Festival with parades, live music, guest speakers and family-friendly activities – not to mention aliens, as shown in our picture. This year's takes place from Friday to Sunday and marks the event's 77th anniversary.

  The United States is one of the countries with the most UFO sightings, and some states have more than others, with the majority happening in Washington. This is closely followed by Montana, Oregon, Alaska, Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire.

NEW YORK: The last few times I wrote about unidentified flying objects, in the spring and fall of 2023, there had been a series of curious happenings — reveals and leaks and would-be whistleblowing — that convinced me that some group of people inside our government wanted Americans to believe that the national security state had secret knowledge about UFOs.

This was a deliberately circumspect take on an extremely weird situation, which had three notable features. First, the kinds of people coming forward with claims and the footage and accounts of mysterious flying objects being publicised (in The New York Times, among other places) were more serious-seeming, more difficult to eye-roll away, than what we'd seen in prior eras of UFO enthusiasm.

Second, the sudden bipartisan interest from senators and congressmen — not just eccentrics in the House of Representatives but also figures such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, who was then the majority leader, and Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. — was real and substantial, suggesting that a bit more was visible behind the curtain than we knew.

But third, at the same time, all the leaks and insider accounts fell consistently short of what UFO believers call, expectantly, “disclosure” — offering enough to feed speculation about secret government programs, but not nearly enough to overcome a basic sceptical default.

At the time, I argued that all the high-level political and media interest was removing the impediment that many believers argue stands between us and the truth — the alleged fear, among those with secret knowledge, of being jailed or killed if they speak out. If would-be whistleblowers with national security backgrounds such as David Grusch and Luis Elizondo were hale and well (and in Elizondo's case, publishing a bestselling book), then surely there was no better time to deliver the supposedly world-altering truth.

And if nobody stepped forward — well, you should be more inclined to assume that the truth was never really out there.

Eighteen months later, as you may have noticed, no Lockheed Martin employees have brought forward detailed plans of the alien spacecraft hidden in their corporate vault, and no former heads of the Department of Energy have confessed to keeping a great bureaucratic secret hidden since the dawn of the Atomic Age. Instead we've had more interviews and first-person accounts but no actual disclosure from a Trump administration that includes a few UFO-curious figures in its ranks.

And now, in a pair of articles last month by two Wall Street Journal reporters, we've been given one of the more comprehensive attempts at a non-extraterrestrial explanation of where some of the weirdness originates. Relying heavily on interviews with Sean Kirkpatrick, who ran the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, a Pentagon task force investigating the UFO evidence, the reporters reveal several possible mythology-forging projects inside the military-industrial complex: a combination of deliberate psychological operations aimed at covering up top secret technologies, possible bureaucratic pranks and hazing rituals that accidentally made midlevel personnel into UFO believers, and top secret experiments that the government allowed its personnel to interpret as possible close encounters.

The Journal reporters also follow Kirkpatrick through investigations that did not pan out: A purported piece of extraterrestrial material turned out to have prosaic origins, a claim about Russia reverse-engineering alien technology probably originated in the Russian version of our own UFO disinformation, and a larger pattern emerged where “evidence to support the whistleblowers' theories appeared to vanish just as Kirkpatrick got close to it.”

What's useful about the Journal stories is that they're more capacious than some prior debunking explanations. For instance, certain sceptics pinned the recent wave of UFO-related governmental signalling on true believers who were inserted into the national security loop by Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada (a UFO believer of some sort himself), and who then traded on those credentials to legitimate their theories. But as far as I could tell, this explanation didn't do justice to the apparent scale of UFO beliefs within the government.

Whereas what the Journal reporters suggest is that UFO belief could have been seeded in multiple different ways over many decades — creating not just a small group of obsessives circulating the same wild theories but also a broader culture in which both deception and misapprehension are at work, the former feeding the latter and the latter encouraging the former, such that parts of the national security state are conditioned to use “aliens” as cover for their secret operations and other parts are conditioned to assume there must be something real there.

This portrait of “deep state” deception and delusion hardly resolves the UFO question. It doesn't explain the weird aerial encounters that helped touch off the current age of interest — encounters which are, as far as I can tell from public and private information, still taken quite seriously as an unresolved problem by defense and intelligence officials. Nor does it tell us how to understand the phenomenon of personal paranormal encounters, the UFO-as-religious-experience zone where “aliens” seem to play angelic or demonic or faerie-adjacent parts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Did the Pentagon spread false UFO stories? We're skeptical.","https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/5381851-did-the-pentagon-spread-false-ufo-stories-were-skeptical/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

A recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggests that the Pentagon itself fueled much of the “mythology” surrounding UFOs. Citing current and former government sources, reporters Joel Schectman and Aruna Viswanatha write that a decades-long hazing ritual left “hundreds and hundreds” of Air Force personnel convinced that the Pentagon harbored a “secret alien project.”

The report also alleges that an Air Force colonel intentionally stoked UFO speculation at a Nevada bar in the 1980s as cover for the development of the first stealth fighter. Similarly, their sources claim that there is a “terrestrial explanation” for a prominent incident involving UFOs and nuclear weapons.

While each of these points merits close attention, the Journal's reporting must also be scrutinized for what it omits.

Schectman and Viswanatha suggest that “MAGA skepticism about the ‘deep state'” is motivating Republican members of Congress to investigate government involvement with UFOs. Yet they make no mention of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mike Rounds's (R-S.D.) bipartisan 64-page UAP Disclosure Act, which alleges that a secret government “legacy program” has recovered UFOs and “biological evidence of non-human intelligence.” 

In a recent interview on NewsNation, Rounds confirmed that he and Schumer will reintroduce the legislation in the coming weeks. Schumer alleged on the Senate floor in December 2023 that the federal government has “gathered a great deal of information about [UFOs] over many decades but has refused to share it with the American people” — and, per “multiple credible sources,” with Congress as well.

Moreover, the authors omit eyebrow-raising comments from lawmakers and officials describing individuals alleging “firsthand” knowledge of unreported UFO retrieval and reverse-engineering programs. This includes comments from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), former Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), current director of the Pentagon UFO analysis office Jon Kosloski, veteran congressional staffer Kirk McConnell and former intelligence official David Grusch.

The fact that multiple high-ranking officials have claimed firsthand knowledge of secret UFO programs does not square easily with a “bizarre hazing ritual” involving bogus “alien projects.”

According to the Journal, Sean Kirkpatrick, the former director of the Pentagon's UFO analysis office, uncovered broad hazing practices in which “thousands” of Air Force officers were briefed on secret “alien” activities over several decades. The prank apparently included requiring personnel to sign non-disclosure agreements that carried the threat of jail or execution, leaving officers “scared to death” if they revealed the nonexistent program.

But no evidence of such systemic, widespread hazing about extraterrestrials has yet emerged. Nor can Kirkpatrick and his former office keep their stories straight. A year after supposedly discovering such extensive hazing activity, Kirkpatrick and the Pentagon claimed that longstanding allegations of secret UFO retrieval and reverse-engineering programs are the product of “circular reporting” from a “small group” of alien believers. Yet now, supposedly, “thousands” of personnel were led to believe that such programs exist. Which one is it?

Kirk McConnell recently retired after serving 37 years on the congressional Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, where he held the highest, most compartmented security clearances. He was also one of the Senate's lead staffers on UFOs.

McConnell told us that he is “confident” that he “was never told by Kirkpatrick or anyone else from [the Pentagon's UFO office] or the Department of Defense that the Department had uncovered and documented a significant number of instances where Department of Defense officials actively and knowingly spread misinformation about UAP in order to provide cover for special access programs or to play jokes on their colleagues.”

Similarly, we know Air Force personnel who have observed UFOs, but none who have received any briefings on bogus “alien” programs. The Pentagon's UFO analysis program, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, must clarify the scope and scale of any such hazing rituals immediately.

At the same time, an Air Force colonel disseminating UFO pictures at a Nevada bar in the 1980s, ostensibly as a cover for the then-nascent Lockheed F-117A stealth fighter program, appears to violate prohibitions on domestic influence operations by the military.

Finally, Schectman and Viswanatha report that investigators discovered a “terrestrial explanation” for one of the better-known incidents involving UFOs and nuclear weapons. In March 1967, according to former Air Force missile and targeting officers, 10 nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles shut down from alert status as security guards observed a UFO hovering above the front gate of a missile facility at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The Journal's sources claim that an unannounced electromagnetic pulse test caused the “UFO” and subsequent shutdown of the missiles. 

But the government documents Schectman and Viswanatha cite in support of this supposed explanation in fact debunk it. The documents state that the “proposal for the design, development, fabrication, and testing” of the system supposedly responsible for the Malmstrom UFO incident was not submitted until 1971, four years after the event. How could this system, which was not developed and tested until 1973, cause an incident that had occurred six years earlier?

Moreover, Schectman and Viswanatha suggest that this electromagnetic generator created the object observed hovering over the missile facility's main gate. “When activated,” they write, “this device, placed on a portable platform 60 feet above the facility, would gather power until it glowed, sometimes with a blinding orange light.”

Let's set aside that the system apparently had not been tested, let alone proposed, when the Malmstrom incident occurred. The notion is preposterous that such a large electrical generator, requiring 10 3,250-pound concrete braces, could be constructed just outside the front gate of a Malmstrom Air Force Base's Missile Alert Facility undetected by the armed guards that patrol the area.

Similarly, it strains credulity to suggest that an electromagnetic pulse, which disables and destroys sensitive electronic equipment, would be tested against an active nuclear missile facility at the height of the Cold War. Additional documentation cited by Schectman describes testing such destructive electrical pulses only under meticulously controlled conditions and environments — and certainly not against nuclear weapons and unsuspecting Air Force officers.

Intentionally or not, Schectman and Viswanatha's reduction of the well-documented UFO-nuclear nexus to a single 1967 incident — with a questionable “explanation,” no less — does their readers a disservice. So does their failure to mention that the Pentagon now admits openly that it is stumped by “several dozen” “true anomalies” and “really peculiar” UFO incidents. 

The same unexplained phenomena perplexing the government today have been reported since at least the 1940s.

Weekly Shonen Jump continues its manga shuffle, with many series coming to a close and many more series kicking off. Today, we're taking a look at the new paranormal adventure Kaedegami, from Jun Harukawa. What happens when a demon raises a human boy? What does she really want from him? Join us as we find out!

 



Kaedegami weaves legends of fearsome demonic beings named Shenguai. These beings allegedly prey on humans, but an orphaned boy named Kou is living quite happily with one! A masked Shenguai named Chiyou has looked after Kou all his life. Kou laughs off the locals' stories, believing that his lovely benefactor is nothing but benevolent. But before long, her true reasons for raising him will become evident.

… or will they? Because on the one hand, Chiyou is absolutely a demonic being. But on the other, she's done the one thing you never do in situations like these: she got attached.

 



You see, Chiyou has a problem. Long ago, long before the events of Kaedegami, she suffered a defeat so absolutely that she lost her entire body. In order to exact revenge and fight to regain her body, she would need a vessel. And, at least at first, that was why she looked after Kou. But rather than following through on her plan, she chooses to let him go.

But just as he's become dear to her, she's become dear to him. Kou promises to help Chiyou fight to regain herself, starting with her face. So she does ultimately get what she wanted from Kou—but this time, it's an agreement rather than subjugation. And so, the two set out together, determined to put Chiyou back together one piece at a time.

 



First things first… Kaedegami is utterly gorgeous. The first chapter in particular has some stunning panels, including our first look at Chiyou's actual face. The care shown between the main cast—the young human and the monster who raised him—is also extremely compelling. The two have a surprisingly sweet relationship, and we're hoping this new manga has plenty of time to explore it.

The fights are important too, of course! Within two chapters, this series has already shown us two action-packed fight scenes. Together, Chiyou and Kou aren't just getting revenge; they're also helping the humans around them and making the world a better place. There are so many opportunities for worldbuilding, new characters, and character development. So our fingers are crossed that this series has a long life in Weekly Shonen Jump.

Kaedegami is now available to read from Viz Media.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=paranormal","Don't Look for Bigfoot When You Need the Church","https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/reviews/ghost-lab/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 04:02:00 GMT","

The world is a confusing place right now. We believe that faithful proclamation of the gospel is what our hostile and disoriented world needs. Do you believe that too? Help TGC bring biblical wisdom to the confusing issues across the world by making a gift to our international work.

Imagine a world in which more people believe in aliens than in the fairness of the criminal justice system. Where belief in telekinesis is more common than trust in the government. Where more people think ancient aliens visited Earth than think the local news is reliable.

We don't have to imagine, because that world is called New Hampshire, and the rest of the United States isn't far behind.

In his new book The Ghost Lab: How Bigfoot Hunters, Mediums, and Alien Enthusiasts Are Wrecking Science, freelance journalist Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling explores the connection between the implosion of institutional trust and the growing interest in the paranormal. His earlier book, A Libertarian Walks into a Bear, follows the disorder caused by the rejection of institutions in one small New Hampshire town. The Ghost Lab is an extended case study on the Kitt Research Initiative (KRI), one of dozens of paranormal investigation groups that operated in New Hampshire in the 2010s.

Hongoltz-Hetling intersperses accounts of séances, ghost hunts, and alien abductions with historical vignettes, commentary from scientists, and stories about the everyday triumphs and struggles of KRI members. The result is an alternately fascinating and disturbing portrait of a fraying, post-Christian culture, a portrait that nonetheless illustrates how the church can be a bulwark of truth and an incubator of social trust.

The Ghost Lab tells the astonishing story of the wild ecosystem of paranormal profiteers and consumers. But it also reveals how the twin scourges of declining scientific literacy and eroding trust in institutions have created space for armies of pseudoscientists to step into the minds of an increasingly credulous public.

Traditional institutions are crumbling, along with the trust we once had in them. But people haven't ceased to trust. Rather, they've transferred their trust to an eclectic mix of noninstitutional teachers, gurus, spiritual guides, and healers. People like the members of the KRI.

Traditional institutions are crumbling, along with the trust we once had in them.

Although his frustration with what he clearly regards as pseudo-scientific nonsense occasionally emerges, Hongoltz-Hetling is largely impartial as he chronicles the exploits of the KRI. He truly wants to understand the lives of “believers.” He explores how they think, how they feel, and how they reconcile their worldview with the disenchantment of modernity. He seems to like them.

Yet Hongoltz-Hetling makes it clear that the battle between science and the paranormal is “a zero-sum game.” He writes, “In order to believe that ghosts, aliens, and cryptids are real, one must believe that the lack of acknowledgement by science, government, and other institutions represents a massive failure of competence or corruption” (157). And that is exactly what organizations like the KRI and those that gather in them believe.

At the heart of the book is a question of epistemology: How do we know truth? Hongoltz-Hetling's answer is that science is the sole repository of universal, objective truth. He also laments the loss of trust in institutions, like the University of New Hampshire, which he believes represent the pursuit of pure science.

To his credit, Hongoltz-Hetling admits that “institutions themselves bear much of the responsibility” for declining public trust (143). In his view, their main problem is a failure of communication. Institutions have the truth, but they've done a poor job of conveying it to the public in a compelling, memorable way. He also grudgingly concedes that “institutional failures” have eroded public trust and names a handful of vague examples like rising income inequality and declining life expectancy.

At the same time, he ignores far more specific and egregious examples. Most notably, anyone concerned with institutional credibility has to reckon with the inestimable damage done by transgender ideology. When a 5-year-old can answer the question “What is a woman?” and the ACLU, the AMA, and a Supreme Court justice cannot, the problem doesn't lie with the 5-year-old. With so much confusion about observable reality, it's little wonder that many are seeking meaning in the paranormal.

Though Jesus promises that the gates of hell will not prevail against the church (Matt. 16:18), Satan is still prowling around seeking to devour (1 Pet. 5:8). Therefore, Christians shouldn't overlook the rising tide of spiritualism and paranormal belief that's at the heart of this book.

Hongoltz-Hetling reports on the misadventures of the KRI with affable indulgence, like a favorite uncle playing make-believe with his nephews and nieces. Indeed, for the first half of the book, I was shocked by how few of the phenomena appeared to be demonic. Almost all of the team's experiences could be chalked up to overactive imaginations or transparent charlatanism. And then in chapter 21, without warning, a tarot-card reader who'd visited the KRI brutally tortures, rapes, and murders a UNH college student.

This incident is disturbing, but Hongoltz-Hetling takes it in his stride. Yes, “Lex” believed he was possessed by four different interdimensional beings and was deeply involved in the occult. But the lesson drawn is that we need to “build a world in which such murders are less likely to happen” (186). Hongoltz-Hetling never considers that a spiritual realm might actually exist and that contact with it might be far less benign than Touched by an Angel reruns suggest.

I was reminded of C. S. Lewis's warning in The Screwtape Letters, where a demon says, “Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick.” Satan isn't as much interested in spectacular sins as in our slow, unremarkable, lifelong descent into hell. He doesn't need to employ overt spiritual terrorism if he can snare human souls with a few healing crystals, a blurry picture of Bigfoot, and the whispered assurance that we can forge our own spiritual path. Christians need to be aware that Satan is very real and very dangerous. And he's no less dangerous because he's sometimes subtle.

Regardless of what happens to our broader cultural institutions, Christians are uniquely positioned to build an “alternative trust economy.” Social media tends to sort people into ideological bubbles that amplify mistrust of other tribes. In contrast, the church is united around a common confession rather than a common cultural background or political goal. Consequently, it organically exposes us to different perspectives. This creates healthy epistemic friction and makes it much harder for us to simply dismiss those with whom we disagree.

Satan isn't as much interested in spectacular sins as in our slow, unremarkable, lifelong descent into hell.

The local church can be an incubator for relational trust. When a stranger on the internet gives me advice I don't like, I can always reject it on the grounds that he must have some ulterior motive. But when I speak to a doctor or a lawyer or a scientist from my church, I don't have that excuse. I know the person cares about me and wants what's best for me. He or she might still be mistaken, but I have no reason to doubt the underlying motives. In this way, churches can build up local trust networks that operate independently of institutional failure.

Pastors can encourage this kind of trust by resisting the temptation to issue authoritative proclamations on empirical questions. Public policy, scientific studies, and sociological trends may be upended or reversed in a few months. Biblical truths are unchanging. Therefore, extrabiblical topics should be addressed with an epistemic humility that resists overconfidence. Additionally, it's important that Christians on both sides of policy discussions feel represented, respected, and heard.

There's no doubt that Hongoltz-Hetling, a Pulitzer finalist, is an excellent writer. He ties together the problem of institutional distrust, which is familiar to many of us, and the growth of paranormal subculture, which is unfamiliar to many of us. This book is off the beaten path for many Christians, but it shows how valuable the church is for fostering trust and establishing truth. The Ghost Lab can help church leaders understand how to meet real spiritual needs in an uncertain, confusing, and demon-haunted world.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is not just a technological marvel; it's a symbol of humanity's quest to discover the unknown. Launched to explore the origins of life, the JWST offers the tantalizing possibility of detecting signs of life beyond our planet. While sensational headlines may suggest we've found extraterrestrial life, the truth is more nuanced. The telescope has identified chemical substances in the atmosphere of exoplanets, which on Earth, are typically produced by living organisms. This groundbreaking capability invites the question: Can the James Webb Space Telescope ultimately determine whether we are alone in the universe?

The search for extraterrestrial life hinges on identifying biosignatures, which are chemical indicators of life. Biosignatures provide evidence that life may have developed on planets beyond our own. On Mars, for example, rovers actively search for these signs by directly analyzing the planet's surface. However, detecting biosignatures on distant exoplanets presents a unique challenge. These planets are separated from us by vast distances, often measured in light-years, and can only be studied through telescopic observations.

The James Webb Space Telescope plays a crucial role in this endeavor by analyzing the atmospheres of these distant worlds. By identifying specific chemical compositions, scientists can infer the potential for life. This process relies heavily on spectroscopy, a method of analyzing light to determine the chemical makeup of an atmosphere. As our technology advances, the ability to detect and interpret these biosignatures becomes increasingly sophisticated, paving the way for future discoveries.

Detecting biosignatures is more than just a matter of capability; it's about reliability. The James Webb Space Telescope is equipped to identify these chemical traces, but the accuracy of its findings is subject to technical challenges. Scientists focus their search on habitable zones, regions around stars where conditions are right for life. Here, JWST analyzes atmospheric compositions, seeking out the subtle signs of life.

However, one of the main obstacles is the interference of starlight. The same light that illuminates a planet can also complicate spectroscopic readings, potentially leading to false positives. This challenge is particularly pronounced when studying planets orbiting stars larger than red dwarfs, as their intense light can distort the data collected. Consequently, JWST primarily targets planets around red dwarfs, whose dimmer light is less likely to interfere with observations. Despite its limitations, the James Webb Space Telescope remains a powerful tool in the search for life.

“Like the Birth of Everything”: Scientists Recreate First Microseconds of Universe to Unveil Wild Behavior of Quark-Gluon Plasma



The James Webb Space Telescope has transformed our understanding of the cosmos and redefined the field of astrophysics. While it may not be the ultimate solution in the hunt for extraterrestrial life, it represents a significant leap forward. The telescope has unveiled new cosmic structures and provided insights into the universe's formation, setting the stage for future discoveries.

Though it may not conclusively prove the existence of life elsewhere, JWST is laying the groundwork for future missions. As the first telescope to systematically explore the atmospheres of distant worlds, it has initiated a new era of exploration. Its contributions will be remembered as pivotal in the ongoing quest to answer humanity's most profound question: Are we alone in the universe?

“Space Won't Make You Pop—It's Way Worse”: Your Blood Boils From the Inside Out in Seconds Without a Suit



The capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope are just the beginning of a new era in space exploration. As technology evolves, so too will our ability to study the stars and the potential for life beyond Earth. Future missions will build on JWST's foundation, employing even more advanced technologies to continue the search for biosignatures. These endeavors will expand our knowledge of the universe and bring us closer to answering the age-old question of whether we are alone.

As we stand on the cusp of discovery, the James Webb Space Telescope remains a beacon of hope and inspiration. It challenges us to look beyond our planet and consider the limitless possibilities of the cosmos. What new revelations await us as we continue to explore the universe with ever-evolving technology?

DENVER (KDVR) — It is an age-old question: “Are we alone in this universe?”

A natural curiosity about other life forms has been further expanded by stories of inexplicable occurrences happening in the sky, or what has become commonly known as unidentified flying objects.

For those who want to experience the otherworldly feeling of spotting a UFO, looking into the Colorado skies might be a pretty good idea, as people around the state have reported 3,465 sightings, according to the National UFO Reporting Center.

The pattern is not recent, with the first official sighting date in Colorado logged as July 8, 1905, although there are several entries below that in chronological order, but without official dates.

The 1905 spotting was reported with information, including:

Each report contains a brief explanation of the events and an in-depth summary of the circumstances of the sighting.

“Lights over treeline, objects captured in photos and red spray or fumes being sprayed over the trees,” said the report.

The most recent Colorado sighting occurred about two weeks ago.

The sighting was reported with information, including:

The report also contained a brief explanation of the event.

“I recorded it shape shift, go dark and quickly disappear somewhere else,” stated the report.

There are places across the United States that have become notorious for their extraterrestrial reputation: Roswell, the Extraterrestrial Highway in Nevada, Area 51 — Even Colorado has its own UFO Watchtower in the San Luis Valley.

The states with the most reported sightings of UFOs include:

With 15 seasons under its belt, Supernatural was one of the most beloved sci-fi series of the 21st century. The show introduced Dean and Sam Winchester, a pair of brothers who make it their mission to hunt whatever demons cross their path. Not only did this show break the mold when it came to the Monster-of-the-Week format, but it also helped to make Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki household names.

Yet, a lot of audiences may be surprised to hear that Supernatural wasn't exactly Jensen Ackles' big break. In fact, he appeared in the hit soap opera Days of Our Lives for three years, allowing him to receive a ton of acclaim. Viewers may be even more shocked to learn that Ackles completed more episodes of Days of Our Lives than Supernatural, suggesting that the former was his most successful role.

Days of Our Lives is one of America's longest-running soaps and focuses on two families, the Hortons and the Bradys. The show obviously explores how both families cope with life's biggest hurdles, but it also welcomes in a bundle of secondary characters to help keep things fresh. The character of Eric Brady was first introduced in 1984 by child actor Rory Beauregard. As the son of power couple Roman Brady and Marlene Evans, it comes as no surprise that the boy has been involved in a ton of alluring storylines. For the first 10 years or so, Brady was played by a selection of child actors alongside his twin sister, Sami. But in 1997, the show's head writer, James E. Riely, decided that the character needed a major shakeup.

Everyone in Hollywood has to have gotten their start somewhere. For these big-named actors, it's on the small screen.

In this year, the show decided to rapidly age Eric Brady, making him around 2 years older. Despite having quite a bit of acting experience already, thanks to shows like Mr. Rhodes, Sweet Valley High, and Cybill, Jensen Ackles had to audition multiple times for the role of Eric Brady. Yet, once he got the part, he managed to really climb up the ranks. In 1998, he won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer and, for three years in a row, he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series. Thus, even though the audition process forced Ackles to have doubts about the longevity of his career as an actor, these accolades prove that he made the right decision.

Before being cast as Dean Winchester, Jensen Ackles originally auditioned for the role of Sam. He was the team's favorite to play the part until Jared Padalecki auditioned.

Admittedly, audiences may not be entirely impressed by these achievements, especially when they are compared against the actor's success in Supernatural. However, audiences need to remember that Ackles played Dean for 15 years in the main show and its spin-offs, The Winchesters and Supernatural: The Animation. But in just three years, Ackles appeared in 448 episodes of Days of Our Lives, compared to just 332 episodes across the Supernatural franchise. This minor detail often forces audiences to change their entire perspective on the actor's career. Supernatural seems like Ackles' biggest show because he played one of the main protagonists. Yet, it's clear to see that even as a secondary character, Eric Brady managed to garner much more attention and acclaim from critics and fans. Thus, while Supernatural will always be Jensen Ackles' strongest suit, it is evidently not his longest piece of work.

Soap operas are a tricky battlefield for a lot of actors to navigate. On the one hand, they offer creatives a long stretch of steady work, ensuring that they can keep the lights on while working in a very competitive industry. On the flip side, soaps are the perfect opportunity to gain more experience before taking the risk of landing bigger roles. That's exactly what Jensen Ackles did. In 2000, the actor announced that he was leaving Days of Our Lives after securing a promising development deal with ABC. The following year, the actor was asked to reprise his role as Eric Brady for the soap, but he politely declined.

In the original script for Supernatural, Dean was supposed to have lots of tattoos, but the budget couldn't accommodate it.

Two decades after Supernatural's release, the show remains one of Jensen Ackles' career-defining projects.

Quickly after leaving Days of Our Lives, Ackles starred in a string of immense shows. He played popular actor Eddie G. in a made-for-TV biopic about Marilyn Monroe called Blonde. Following that, he secured the part of Alec McDowell / X5-494 in James Cameron's hit sci-fi series Dark Angel. Although this series has since faded into obscurity, back in the early 2000s, it was a ground-breaking show. Alec McDowell was a fantastic character and was originally introduced as a super soldier who was given to the protagonist as a breeding partner. Thus, it wouldn't be a stretch to suggest that this high-energy character was the gateway to Ackles securing the role of Dean in Supernatural. In 2004, he received a part in Smallville as Jason Teague, one of Lana's biggest love interests. So, it's easy to see that while leaving Days of Our Lives would have been a big step for the young actor, it allowed Jensen Ackles to enter a new world of immense sci-fi and fantasy shows.

Of course, it would be almost blasphemous to talk about Jensen Ackles without giving a nod to Supernatural. The actor finally got the part of Dean Winchester in 2005 and went on to be one of the biggest assets to fandom culture during the 2010s. Even after the fall of The WB in 2006, the show carried on The CW and remained one of its best shows until its conclusion in 2020. Arguably, the character of Dean allowed Ackles to experiment with his comical side. As quite a goofy and eclectic character, Ackles managed to bring this man to life without distracting the audience from its alluring high fantasy moments.

 A lot of Jensen Ackles' more recent projects have referenced his work on Supernatural. Tracker showcases a lot of classic cars, one of which looks just like the Winchesters' 1967 Chevrolet Impala, which Dean kindly referred to as ""Baby."" The Boys also features a lot of the same actors from Supernatural, including Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The show also includes a lot of Supernatural Easter eggs, such as a monitor that displays January 24, which is Dean Winchester's birthday.

With over 200 episodes, Supernatural is a powerhouse series with more than a few episodes fans could easily call perfect.

Yet, nothing matches the meta references seen in Supernatural's ""The French Mistake."" In this episode, Sam and Dean are transported to an alternate reality where they discover that they are merely fictional beings portrayed by actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Aside from highlighting just how popular Supernatural really is, this episode made countless references to the actors' past work, such as showcasing Ackles as a baby-faced Eric Brady.

Even with so many episodes to choose from, ""The French Mistake"" is still a fan favorite because it shows off the cast's ability to laugh at themselves. Occasionally, actors feel embarrassed about their early work, especially on soaps, because they have the tendency to date quite quickly. However, this episode pokes a lot of fun at Ackles and his co-stars, but the fact that the men remain in character as Sam and Dean the whole time just makes the entire episode so much funnier.

The Tweets that Misha Collins was posting during ""The French Mistake"" were real. During filming, he would frequently pull out his phone and post them.

If anything, Jensen Ackles' success on Days of Our Lives highlights a massive shift in modern television. Back in the late 1990s, audiences were forced to tune into their favorite soap operas week after week because if they didn't, they would easily feel out of the loop. A similar thing could be said for the earlier seasons of Supernatural, but audiences still reminisce about their favorite episodes via streaming platforms.

Again, a similar thing occurs with Ackles' later projects, like The Boys and Big Sky, both of which can be watched via streaming platforms. Thus, while it's very easy for fans to only associate Jensen Ackles with Supernatural, his work as a soap star should also be celebrated. While the only demon Eric Brady faced was his possessed mother, the character allowed Ackles to show off his diverse skill set. As such, what started as a very prosperous role for Ackles back in 1997 seems to now be only a foot in the door for a very successful career.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","The evaluation of the psychological and existential damage","https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-evaluation-of-the-psychological-and-existential-damage-2/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 03:37:00 GMT","

For a while the legal approach to the person person takes into consideration the overall aspect. Also consider thepsychic integrity and the consequences that trauma can involve on the quality of life.

This consideration arises from a growing social and political attention on the subject. The right to health is a fundamental right of the person who must be constitutionally guaranteed.

Compensation for damage is sanctioned by art. 2043 of the civil code and the damage can be classified as asset or non -pecuniary.

The first judgments tended to compensate expenses as repair to the consequences of the harmful event, especially in the presence of compromise of working capacity.

This form of compensation has not been favorably accepted by the community. It was considered unwillingly, and unfair, considering the person damaged only with respect to his work and not also in reference to his complex relationship life.

This also led to an amplification of social discrimination due to pay differences. To the same injury suffered a more qualified profession, it received higher compensation.

In recent times we have witnessed numerous interventions in the legislative field on what concerns the non -pecuniary damage. We refer to a “injury of interests inherent to the person, not characterized by economic relevance“. That is, it concerns all those aspects that are not immediately monetizable that make up the life of each individual.

We slowly move away from a conception of exclusively organicistic health to go towards a bio-psycho-social vision of the individual.

For psychological damage We mean both what causes physical damage to the psyche of a person and the mental alteration that occurs regardless of physical injuries (Franzoni, 2004). The psychological injury would be a distorted disturbance of the person's psychic balance.

The possibility of obtaining compensation for psychic damagewhich now constitutes a precise category, is a recent conquest. This right has been recognized by the Supreme Court as an individual right exercisable in the private sector.

To confirm this, the same jurisprudence has often underlined the perspective according to which mental health cannot be limited to cases of nosographically classifiable disease, but contains the safeguarding of the “man value” and the related functions essential for individual realization (Voltorin, 2012).

It is important to underline that the damage is always caused by the correlation between the traumatic event and the psychic structure of the individual. It can manifest itself following three illegal events, such as: a specific physical injury (e.g. cerebral lesion); a non -specific physical injury (e.g. depressive state consequent to medical liability); “pure” psychic damage without any physical-organic substrate such as e.g. A mourning depression (of Angio, Recco, 2009).

This leads us to distinguish two dimensions of the psychic damage: a more strictly pathological of the reactive type, in which it is easier to identify the causal link, and a more elusive and less identifiable as in cases of pure damage.

There is therefore a picture of growing socio-cultural sensitivity towards the psychological component of the individual. It follows a regulatory and legal adaptation on the fundamental rights of the person. The conditions for the introduction of the psychological knowledge in the field of non -pecuniary damage to the person, as well as the need for the use of psychological knowledge within the legal field.

The assessment for biological damage of the psychological type can be requested by the judge, who will appoint a consultant – Office technical consultant (CTU) – Since the same does not have those specialist knowledge that determine an evaluation and assessment in this area.

It will therefore be necessary to tools such as the expert report, accompanied by a full -bodied documentation to achieve greater scientific knowledge on the presence and relevance of the damage.

Despite the importance of the psycho-diagnostic balance aimed at a greater scientific deepening, to date, this practice is not concretely respected in legal culture. In fact, a discussion relating to the evaluation of the damage to the person entrusted to the competence of a medical examiner or a psychiatrist persists.

In this way it is ignored that for a complete and exhaustive examination, for the purpose of ascertaining the non -pecuniary damage, A forensic psychological investigation is required.

Psychiatric evaluation is useful in order to establish what drug therapy is suitable for a certain syndrome. Often, however, some sectors of this discipline do not refer to theories on mental illness. Therefore the possibility of explaining the causal relationship between the harmful/traumatic event and the psychic damage.

In addition, the psychiatric classification prevents or makes the work of “personalization” of the damage difficult. The role of the coroner and psychiatrist are certainly important in ascertaining the clinical-medical and non-psychological aspect of the damage.

But it forensic psychologist It is indicated as the most suitable figure to evaluate the psychic damage. In fact, among its skills that of carrying out assessments on the basis of investigation tools such as the cynical interview, the appropriate tests, as well as the detection of the elements that causally connect the psychic distress with the traumatic event.

For all these reasons, the assignment to expert professionals, of assignments in the technical consultancy ordered by the Court is desirable.

For the evaluation of the biological damage of a psychological nature, the consultant must consider the factors that contribute to the evolution of the disorder. That is, what are the events concerning the harmful fact (gravity and time duration of the traumatic event), the antecedent events (cognitive deficits or pre-existing personality disorders and possible risk factors) and the events that follow the fact (access to economic, legal or therapeutic means and for emotional, social and relational resources).

This evaluation can also be carried out through the acquisition of information by witnesses or, in any case, of people informed on the facts (of Angio, Recco, 2009). This because it is necessary to check the content of the patient's statements/declarations And it is important to receive a description from reliable witnesses about the behavior of the subject.

Specifically, the determination of any psychic damage occurs through a relative investigation: to the psychic suffering that leads, in the case of its intolerance, in a psychic disorder; positive or negative psychic functions; to the realization of the personality.

The investigation method must therefore use a “cross method”, in which the type of psychic suffering, the functional decrease and compromise of the relationship life must be related in a non -contradictory way (Voltorin, 2012).

Essential element, regarding the assessment of the psychic damageis above all that of the causal link between harmful event and damage immediately.

Already in legal medicine, with reference to organic problems, criteria have long been identified that describe the link of causality (Gerin, 1954) chronological: the cause must be prior to the damage (necessary but not sufficient condition); quantity; qualitative; modal.

Furthermore, for the demonstration of the causal link It is necessary to refer to the link between the cause, concausal and occasion (d'Angegio, Recco, 2009).

Therefore according to the principle of equivalence of the causes contained in art. 41 of the Criminal Code, the illegal/unjust fact is cause if it has those qualitative and quantitative characteristics that can be determined by the damage by itself, even in the absence of other causal priests.

Finally, to evaluate the presence and severity of the trauma, an in -depth analysis of the subject is needed with various methodological tools. Among these, clinical interviews, level, personality, projective and neuropsychological tests, in order to evaluate alterations of mental functions, the emotional-affective states and defense mechanisms used.

The CTU must verify the existence or not of the psychic trauma Evaluating compromises, impairments, reduction of the ability to understand and accept reality. This proceeding through the collection of anamnestic data, the examination of the clinical documentation and the analysis of the depositions of the witnesses.

According to scientific literature, the most used tests are:

All tools including indicators that allow you to identify and unmask a possible simulation by the subject (Bohm, 1969, 1995). Atri more specific tests are used for in-depth analysis such as, for example, the caps for post-traumatic stress disorder.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","The real reason behind Trump's conspiracy theories","https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/trump-conspiracy-theories/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 11:55:00 GMT","

On June 15th, Donald Trump declared war on blue cities.

”[W]e must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, [which are] are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,” Trump posted to Truth Social, riffing on the interlocking conspiracy theories that define his second term. 

The next day, at the G7 summit, a reporter asked Trump about the post. Why was he singling out Democratic cities? Trump falsely claimed that Joe Biden let in 21 million migrants of whom “vast numbers” were “murderers, killers, and people from gangs.” Canadian prime minister Mark Carney's mouth fell. His eyes darted back and forth, as if he were scanning the back of the room for a rescue party. 

Trump continued. Most of those people are in Democrat-run cities, he claimed, “and they think they're going to use them to vote. It's not going to happen.” Before Trump could elaborate, Carney abruptly ended the press conference, but it was too late. 

Trump had tied the Big Lie to the Great Replacement on the world stage. He had voiced the astonishing lie that Democrats were deliberately importing illegal migrants to expand their political power through electoral and benefits fraud, and that he was bringing the might of the federal government against Democratic cities to stop it. 

Earlier, Trump's secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem boasted that the feds were occupying Los Angeles in order “to liberate” it from “socialists.” Noem was not speaking metaphorically, as Trump had already deployed the National Guard and the Marines to LA. 

Conspiracy theories have driven policy before. George W. Bush advanced the conspiracy theory that Saddam Hussein launched the 9/11 attacks to sell a war of aggression in the Middle East. Red scares have been used to justify deportations and political purges. But Donald Trump's second term stands out because his entire domestic policy agenda is driven by three interlocking conspiracy theories that form the core of MAGA ideology: The Deep State, the Big Lie, and the Great Replacement. These Big Three conspiracy theories drive Trump's brutal immigration crackdown, his assault on the welfare state, his purge of the civil service, and more. 

In MAGA mythology, the Deep State includes any part of government or civil society that checks Trump's power: civil servants, Democratic legislators, state and local officials, unions, scientists, judges, George Soros, Hollywood, the FBI, antifa, DEI, and any part of big business Trump happens to be beefing with. Sometimes, the Deep State is said to be communist, globalist, neoliberal, satanic, or Jewish. These players don't get along, but that's irrelevant. The Deep State is whatever maga needs it to be. One thing is certain. Whatever goes right is from Donald Trump's genius and whatever goes wrong is the deep state's fault. 

Trump clings to the Big Lie of a stolen 2020 election and blames the Deep State for his defeat. He also accuses the Deep State of deliberately engineering the recent influx of immigrants. It's not that the US attracts migrants because it's a beacon opportunity for people facing poverty, crime, climate catastrophe, or political repression at home. People aren't coming here because it's a wonderful place. No, according to MAGA, America is a dystopian hellscape that nobody would immigrate to if the Deep State weren't bribing migrants with welfare to commit election fraud. It's not just that borders were “left open,” Elon Musk claimed on X, “There was a massive, concerted campaign to usher in as many illegals as possible on an unprecedented scale in order to achieve permanent one-party rule. Treason.”

On the campaign trail, Trump claimed Times Square had been taken over by migrants with super-weapons and that migrant gangs were poised to overrun the state of Colorado and depose the governor. The media shrugged. In office, he seized extraordinary powers on the false pretext that the Tren de Aragua street gang was an invading arm of the Venezuelan military. 

An eccentric castle-dwelling French intellectual named Renaud Camus coined the term Great Replacement in a 2012 book by the same name. Camus argued that treacherous European governments were deliberately replacing their white citizens with Muslim immigrants in what he called a genocide of white people. More explicitly antisemitic variants of the same theory alleged that the Jews were behind white genocide through mass migration. 

The concept of the Great Replacement was popularized by mass shooters who name-checked the conspiracy theory in their manifestos. These include the Christchurch mosque shooter, the El Paso Walmart shooter, and the Buffalo supermarket shooter. The Nazis on the streets of Charlottesville chanted “Jews will not replace us,” as they marched by torchlight. 

In the last few years, the Great Replacement has jumped from mass murder manifestos podcast rants to mainstream Republican rhetoric. Last month, Elon Musk's Grok AI bot went nuts on X and tried to shoehorn the concept of white genocide into every conversation, leading many to wonder if the head of DOGE was putting his thumb on the scale to promote the concept. Then Donald Trump ambushed the president of South Africa with baseless allegations of white genocide during an Oval Office visit. 

ICE head Tom Homan breezily blamed a conspiracy by the United Nations and NGOs to manipulate Joe Biden into letting in so many migrants. “This was by design. Do I think Joe Biden had the expertise to do it? No, I think someone's pulling his strings,” Homan told Tucker Carlson. 

Trump and Musk are using the Big Lie and the Great Replacement to justify their extremely unpopular attacks on the welfare state. The vast majority of Americans want to see Social Security defended and even expanded. Trump is trying to convince his base to welcome its own impoverishment by painting the benefits they rely on as a Democratic conspiracy to enrich illegal immigrants. 

On Fox, Musk smeared Social Security and other entitlements as “a mechanism by which the Democrats attract and retain illegal immigrants by essentially paying them to come here and then turning them into voters.” 

Undocumented immigrants can't vote or collect Social Security. Migrants who use fake SSNs actually subsidize the program by paying for benefits they never collect. Trump's immigration crackdown is hurting Social Security by driving those hardworking taxpayers away. 

Last month, Trump reversed his prior opposition to Medicaid cuts on the grounds that the Republicans' plan to strip health insurance from 14 million low-income people will “kick millions of Illegal Aliens off of Medicaid to PROTECT it for those who are the ones in real need.” Meanwhile, 81 percent of Americans oppose Medicaid cuts to fund upperclass tax cuts, according to a 2025 poll by Navigator Research. 

Donald Trump's are so bizarre that they don't register mainstream media as political arguments. They are often dismissed as bluster or cognitive glitches. However, one can't understand Trump and his policy priorities until you accept that conspiracy theories dominate his worldview and that all his major initiatives are justified to his base in conspiratorial terms. Donald Trump has used conspiracy theories as a pretext to declare war on Democrats and shore up authoritarian rule.

[ccpw id=""39382""]

Written By: 





Well-known XRP advocate Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, claimed that every XRP conspiracy theory is playing out in real time.

His comments follow Ripple's official confirmation that it has applied for a U.S. national bank charter, something that once seemed unthinkable for a crypto firm, but the XRP community vehemently championed.

The approval could confirm Ripple's new status as a federally chartered bank. In addition, it could bring its stablecoin RLUSD under direct oversight from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

Ripple already holds a state license from the New York Department of Financial Services. This potential dual licensing could make RLUSD one of the most trusted stablecoins on the market.

In parallel, Ripple is pursuing a master account with the Federal Reserve through its subsidiary, Standard Custody. Such an account would allow Ripple to hold RLUSD reserves directly at the Fed, a privilege few non-banks possess.

Some experts believe this access would place Ripple in an elite tier. Specifically, American crypto correspondent Eleanor Terrett called a master account a “Diamond” compared to a bank charter's “Platinum” status.

Launched in December 2024, RLUSD is already the ninth-largest stablecoin, with a $470 million market cap and growing interest. Interestingly, Ripple executive Reece Merrick has claimed that RLUSD processes $10 billion in daily transaction volume.

However, many have disputed this figure, as the coin itself has a much lower market cap. Yet, the growth of RLUSD highlights its increasing prominence and adoption.

With Ripple making concrete moves toward offering banking services, Farina's earlier hypothetical theories about the XRP escrow are gaining new attention.

He previously speculated that the U.S. Treasury may have quietly gained control over part of Ripple's XRP escrow as far back as 2020. He theorized that key institutions like the BIS, IMF, and U.S. Treasury have already secured large holdings through private agreements for various internal operations, including reserve assets.

According to Farina, these arrangements may have coincided with the timing of the SEC lawsuit, suggesting a deeper strategy unfolding behind the scenes. 

While none of these claims can be confirmed on-chain, he argues that the true ownership of Ripple's escrowed XRP is no longer as transparent as it seems.

By this, he suggests Ripple may no longer be the sole owner of the 37 billion XRP in escrow. Meanwhile, this remains hypothetical and one of his conspiracy theories, which he hopes will become true someday.

There's absolutely no law preventing @Ripple from selling their escrowed $XRP.

I'm firmly convinced that the BIS, IMF, and U.S. Treasury have already acquired a substantial portion of escrowed $XRP, with the terms of the agreements established as far back as 2019.

The SEC… pic.twitter.com/jG3q2FXL46

— EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 27, 2025



Farina believes a time is coming when Ripple will reveal the “truth” about the escrowed XRP. When that moment arrives, he says, the window of opportunity to accumulate XRP will close for good.

“You laughed at us. Now you're watching history unfold,” he posted, implying that the long-dismissed XRP theories are finally becoming reality.

Essentially, Ripple's recent moves, such as its bank charter application, pursuit of Fed access, and stablecoin momentum, are lending new weight to narratives once considered far-fetched within the XRP community.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","Could Amelia Earhart's plane be in this lagoon? New expedition plans to find out","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/07/03/amelia-earhart-missing-plane-expedition/84457019007/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 15:46:47 GMT","

After nearly a century, the disappearance of Amelia Earhart while she was attempting to fly around the world remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the 20th century.

For decades, many top-dollar expeditions have attempted to locate Earhart's Lockheed Electra 10E airplane to no avail despite great advancements in technology. But a new expedition may just be what one official described as the ""greatest opportunity ever"" to finally bookend the enduring mystery.

On Wednesday, the Purdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute announced a joint-effort to locate Earhart's plane in a lagoon off a Pacific island between Australia and Hawaii, where a popular theory suggests Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, may have landed on May 20, 1937.

A field team of researchers on Nov. 5 will journey by sea to the island Nikumaroro, part of the Phoenix Islands in the western Pacific Ocean, to determine whether a visual anomaly known as the ""Taraia Object,"" seen in satellite and other imagery in the island's lagoon, is what remains of Earhart's plane.

The effort is the latest to try and confirm whether an object captured in satellite or sonar imaging is the missing plane. Last year, an ocean exploration company conducted a deep-sea search within 100 miles of Howland Island, where Earhart and Noonan were last expected to land, after spotting what they believed to be the wreckage of the Electra 10E. It turned out to be a rock formation.

But the search team conducting the upcoming expedition on Nikumaroro say they're optimistic, citing a ""vast amount of circumstantial evidence"" indicating the ""Taraia Object"" may just be the long lost aircraft.

""With such a great amount of very strong evidence, we feel we have no choice but to move forward and hopefully return with proof,"" said Richard Pettigrew, Archaeological Legacy Institute's executive director, in a statement. ""I look forward to collaborating with Purdue Research Foundation in writing the final chapter in Amelia Earhart's remarkable life story.”

The organizers of the expedition have pointed to the long-running theory that Earhart and Noonan did not crash into the ocean but instead landed on the uninhabited of Nikumaroro and later perished there.

Evidence of this theory includes radio bearings that converge on Nikumaroro, an analysis of human bones discovered on the island that are similar to Earhart's bone-lengths, and a number of artifacts including a woman's shoe, a compact case and a medicine vial that have also been discovered there, according to the Purdue Research Foundation.

Additionally, a photographic anomaly captured three months after the plane vanished in 1937 appears to show a landing gear on the Nikumaroro reef. More recently in 2020, researchers managed to again spot the ""Taraia Object,"" which has been in the same place on the island's lagoon since 1938.

For nearly a century, Earhart's disappearance has been subject to a wide variety of theories, the most widely accepted explanation being that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed in the ocean. Some of the more implausible and disputed theories posit that the flight was part of a secret spy mission, that Earhart assumed another identity or that Earhart and Noonan were captured by a foreign government.

The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, a nonprofit organization based in Pennsylvania, is responsible for collecting much of the evidence supporting the Nikumaroro hypothesis.

The upcoming expedition will depart from Majuro in the Marshall Islands on Nov. 5 and spend five days on Nikumaroro inspecting the ""Taraia Object,"" according to the Purdue Research Foundation. If the initial expedition proves successful, the field team plans to return in 2026 to uncover and help return what remains of Earhart's plane, the foundation said.

Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, on July 24, 1897. She rode in an airplane for the first time in 1920 and soon began taking flying lessons. Within a year, she obtained a pilot's license and went on to set a women's altitude record, reaching the height of 14,000 feet in October 1922.

A decade later, she became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, journeying from Newfoundland to Northern Ireland. She then ventured on a solo flight across the United States.

It was in 1936 that she began planning her most ambitious journey yet – a flight around the world.

According to the Purdue Research Foundation, Earhart, who was a visiting adviser and counselor at the university, had prepared for the historic trip with the help of Purdue's then-president Edward Elliott. The university's research foundation also helped fund the Lockheed Electra 10E plane that was specifically outfitted for Earhart's global trip.

Earhart had intended to give the plane to Purdue after her historic flight so it could be used to further scientific research in aeronautics, the foundation said.

Earhart and Noonan departed from Oakland, California, on May 20, 1937. According to the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, they made 29 additional stops, including their last known refuel stop in Lae, Papua New Guinea, on July 2 at 10 a.m.

Nearing the end of their historic trip, Earhart and Noonan were due on Howland Island – about 2,500 miles away from Lae and set between Australia and Hawaii – where U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca was waiting with fuel.

Itasca received intermittent voice messages from Earhart as her signal increased. But neither Earhart nor Noonan knew Morse code, so there was no two-way contact, according to the Smithsonian Institute's analysis of government records.

After losing contact, the Navy and Coast Guard searched about 250,000 square miles of ocean in search of Earhart and Noonan. On Jan. 5, 1939, they were declared legally dead.

Now, with the joint expedition on the horizon, university leaders and researchers are hopeful they'll be able to definitively answer the question, ""What happened to Amelia Earhart?""

“Based on the evidence, we agree with (Archaeological Legacy Institute) that this expedition offers the best chance not only to solve perhaps the greatest mystery of the 20th century, but also to fulfill Amelia's wishes and bring the Electra home,"" said Steven Schultz, senior vice president and general counsel of Purdue University.

Follow:


            Stocks, bond yields and the dollar gained on Thursday after a strong jobs report soothed nerves about how the economy is faring during the early stages of President Donald Trump's tariff campaign.
    


            After a shortened trading day in advance of Friday's July Fourth holiday, the Dow closed higher by 344 points, or 0.77%. The broader S&P 500 rose 0.83% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.02%.
    


            The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at fresh record highs. The Dow closed just 186 points away from hitting an all-time high.
    


            Stocks had jumped higher in the morning after new data showed the economy added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding expectations. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 4.1% from 4.2%.
    


            The strong headline numbers provided relief for investors who were nervous about a potential slowdown in the economy as the president's tariffs portend to impact business activity.

The hidden bad news in the June jobs report



            “The June jobs report is like a summer blockbuster — plenty of action and a surprise twist. Despite tariffs, DC drama and global headwinds, the US labor market just pulled off a better-than-expected performance,” Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, said in an email.
    


            While markets jumped higher, investors also noted caution. The breakdown of job growth showed a less rosy picture, with the private sector showing signs of weakness, according to Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
    


            “There was one cautionary note,” Baird said. “Private sector hiring was fairly weak. So, that's the asterisk that I would put on the report, and something to watch.”
    


            Job growth in June was not widespread across sectors. Meanwhile, the average duration of unemployment rose and the share of unemployed workers who have been out of a job for 27 weeks or longer edged closer to a three-year high.
    


            “Businesses are a little bit more hesitant to hire,” Baird said. “Lots of questions still related to the impact of trade, tariffs and the tax code making its way through Congress. I think there has been a cautious tone on the hiring front that we've been seeing and hearing about for some period of time. And I think that did show up in the numbers this month.”
    


            Treasury yields jumped higher as investors dialed back expectations for future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The 10-year yield rose to 4.34% and the 30-year yield rose to 4.86%.
    


            The US dollar index, which measures the dollar's strength against six major foreign currencies, gained 0.45%. The dollar index was set for its biggest daily gain in nearly two weeks.
    


            David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said in an email that the June jobs report was “good news for the economy and corporate earnings because there's no sign of a recession.”
    


            “Uncertainty around tariffs and trade have apparently not spooked businesses into shedding workers,” Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said in an email. “One note of caution: the administration is still actively negotiating details with several major trading partners and the eventual business impacts are unknown.”
    


            The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed the week in the green.
    


            The labor market continues to prove resilient, which gives the Fed more time to hold rates steady and focus on how inflation is developing.

Fed officials are starting to break rank and join Trump



            Traders now expect just a 4.7% chance the Fed cuts rates in July, down from a 23.8% chance yesterday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
    


            The Fed's rate-cutting path has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as Trump has continued a tirade against Fed Chair Jerome Powell, lashing out at him for holding rates steady. Some Fed officials in recent weeks had signaled an openness to cutting rates in July.
    


            Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email that the June jobs report signals rate cuts in July are likely off the table.
    


            “A few Fed speakers have shown their inclination to cutting interest rates as early as this month. Today's data of higher than expected payrolls, a drop in the unemployment rate and a fall in jobless claims completely dispels their case for imminent rate cuts and implies that there is absolutely no urgency for Fed support,” Shah said.
    


            Wall Street was also monitoring developments on Capitol Hill as lawmakers in the House try to pass Trump's “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” And investors were also keeping an eye out for developments on the trade front. Trump on Wednesday announced a trade deal with Vietnam.
    


            “The stock market is starting off the second half of 2025 on a strong foot, with stocks continuing to make record highs as investors start to price in fading tariff uncertainty and optimism over tax cuts and continued economic resiliency,” David Laut, chief investment officer at Abound Financial, said in an email.
    


            Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Northlight Asset Management, said in an email that while he has been encouraged by the recovery in the stock market in recent months, he is concerned about expensive valuations and the fact that a lot of good news has already been priced in, leaving the market “more vulnerable to negative surprises.”
    


            “Extreme greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN's Fear and Greed index. It was the strongest reading in over a year.

Details include how White House staff thought ex-president ‘was a prick' who disrespected and mistreated Biden

Barack Obama, the former US president, sounded the alarm about Joe Biden's ailing re-election bid almost a year before polling day, warning his former vice-president's staff “your campaign is a mess”, a new book reveals.

The intervention came amid tensions between the Obama and Biden camps as they braced for a tough fight against Donald Trump. In the end, the ageing Biden withdrew from the race in favor of his vice-president, Kamala Harris, who was defeated by Trump.

Obama's prescient anxiety is captured in the upcoming book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian.

The authors describe how Biden, trailing in opinion polls, kept hearing complaints from congressional Democrats that his campaign lacked a presence in their district. His staff in Wilmington, Delaware, were “despondent” and the president confided in one aide: “I have a leadership problem on the campaign.”

On 20 November 2023, Biden received a call from Obama wishing him a happy 81st birthday, and invited his former boss to the White House for lunch. Obama remained “slightly incredulous” that Biden was running for a second term, the book says.

When the pair met for lunch in December, Obama argued that dividing the campaign leadership between Wilmington and Washington was not suitable for the fast decision-making required by a modern presidential election.

“After the lunch,” the authors write, “Obama did not leave the White House right away. He stopped to visit with Biden's senior staff, many of whom used to work for him, and shared his account of what he and Biden had discussed. Obama was more blunt with the staff. ‘Your campaign is a mess,' he told them.”

Biden took heed of the warning and, in January, ordered the White House deputy chief of staff, Jen O'Malley Dillon, to fix his campaign. Soon after, Biden announced that O'Malley Dillon would move to Wilmington to become the campaign chair, with longtime adviser Mike Donilon remaining in Washington as chief strategist.

But Obama was resented by some in the Biden inner circle. Earlier in 2023, he had filmed videos to help the president with online fundraising. “In one clip, Obama reminded Democrats he had ‘won a couple of these' elections, causing some of Biden's aides to roll their eyes,” the book reports.

“There was a lot of overlap among aides to Obama and Biden, but to Biden loyalists, Obama was a prick. They thought he and his inner circle had constantly disrespected and mistreated Biden, despite his loyal service as vice president.”

Dawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf add: “They felt vindicated when for the first time during Biden's presidency, Obama publicly returned to the White House and began by saying ‘Thank you, Vice President Biden.' Obama was quick to claim he was joking, but to Biden's stalwarts it was merely the latest example of Obama's arrogance.”

Biden abandoned his bid for re-election after a disastrous debate performance, giving Harris just 107 days to run in what was the shortest presidential campaign in modern history. The book recounts how Trump survived criminal investigations, assassination attempts and Republican challengers to take on and beat Harris in the election.

Before, during and after the campaign, Trump has called Biden “crooked”, “a dummy”, “feeble”, “grossly incompetent”, “a loser”, “sleepy” and “the worst president in the history of our country”.

But when Biden called to congratulate him on his victory and invite him to visit the White House, Trump sang a different tune, according to the book. “In another life,” he told the president, “we would be friends and go golfing.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Messages over COVID vaccines have cast a shadow over Ursula von der Leyen's presidency of the European Commission and the Commission's commitment to transparency.

The European Commission under President Ursula von der Leyen will face a European Parliament no-confidence vote next week.

Parliament President Roberta Metsola informed parliamentary group leaders of the development Wednesday evening.

European lawmakers will debate the motion on Monday, with a vote scheduled for three days later.

Although the vote is largely symbolic, as most parties oppose the motion, it underscores growing frustration in Brussels following a series of contentious decisions. If the motion were to pass, the Commission would be required to resign as a whole, including its president and all 26 EU commissioners.

Right-wing Romanian MEP Gheorghe Piperea launched the motion of censure, criticizing von der Leyen for a lack of transparency regarding text messages exchanged with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla during the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to The New York Times, personal contact between von der Leyen and Bourla was key to securing the EU's multibillion-euro vaccine deal during the crisis.

The European Union's General Court recently annulled a European Commission decision that had denied a New York Times journalist access to those messages.

Piperea also accused the Commission of ""interference"" in Romania's presidential election, in which nationalist George Simion lost to pro-European Nicusor Dan.

However, the European Conservatives and Reformists group, which Piperea is a member of, has distanced itself from the motion.

""It's not an initiative of our group,"" an ECR spokesperson said.

For the motion to pass, it would require an absolute majority, at least 361 of the 720 votes.

While the current Commission is also led by von der Leyen, but following European elections in 2024, many of the commissioners are not those who served during the coronavirus pandemic.

When Donald Trump appointed his former spokeswoman and personal lawyer to be New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, few pundits expected Alina Habba to stay in the role for long.

Her fiery media appearances, close loyalty to Mr Trump and lack of experience as a prosecutor made her ill-suited to the role of US attorney, ran the conventional wisdom.

What they failed to recognise was her win-at-all-costs approach.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump moved to make her position permanent, setting Ms Habba on a collision course with Senate Democrats who have already said they will try to block her.

In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph on the day of her nomination, Ms Habba said she has deliberately quietened her social media feeds and moved away from outspoken Fox News appearances.

“I have intentionally taken a step away from TV. I have intentionally taken a step away from the press,” she said. “The things that I do post are strictly legal... cases that we are charging.”

She is also prepared to answer any questions about her record.

“I'm happy to answer them, because nobody asks them, right?” she said. “They spin about me, but nobody ever asks me directly.”

Her opponents have receipts, clips from dozens and dozens of controversial TV appearances.

Last year, she launched an unusual attack on Letitia James, the New York attorney general who prosecuted Mr Trump for civil fraud. She said the Democratic prosecutor was so comfortable in court that she even took off her shoes.

At other times she has talked up Mr Trump's chances of an unconstitutional third term, or shrugged off legal challenges to his policies setting out a controversial concept of the law: “It's what the White House counsel says and what our attorney general of the United States says.”

She also attracted controversy after suggesting veterans who had been fired by Elon Musk's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) were “not fit” to “have a job at the moment”.

It has won her admirers among Trump voters and in the tight-knit team around the president, but Democrats will be sure to use her words against her when it comes to her confirmation hearing.

That was her old job, she says now, when she was employed to defend the president.

Mr Trump appointed the 41-year-old as New Jersey's interim US attorney in March.

She wasted no time in revamping her personal office, putting in her own cream-coloured sofas and framed newspaper cuttings, making it clear she planned to be there long term.

And now she has a strategy for taking on the doubters, which she laid out in the course of the interview.

After three months in the job she has a track record to defend. She has wins in the form of major drug investigations as well as the fallout from protests at an immigration detention facility, where Ras Baraka, Newark's Democratic mayor, and Rep LaMonica McIver, were arrested.

Her office later dropped the criminal trespassing charges against Mr Baraka but is prosecuting Ms LaMonica for alleged assault.

The result is that New Jersey's two Democratic senators, who have extra sway in the confirmation process, have said they won't back Ms Habba for the full term.

She insisted that the detention centre case had been mischaracterised.

“There were also several people that we didn't charge that day, and I dismissed one of those cases,” she said. “Not because anyone told me to, because I chose not to pursue that. So when people tell me that, I frankly take offence to it.”

Yet her presence in Trump world and her once frequent appearances on Fox News make her a polarising figure.

Ms Habba was born and raised in New Jersey. She first made contact with the president when she joined his Bedminster club, close to her home and legal practice.

She quickly became a key figure in his legal team as he fought defamation lawsuits brought by Celebrity Apprentice contestant Summer Zervoce, and the journalist E Jean Carroll, as well as civil fraud allegations made by New York's attorney general.

A Washington Post cutting from 2021 hangs on the wall. Its headline reads “To sue the New York Times and his niece, Trump turned to a low-profile attorney from New Jersey,” and it has been signed with the president's jagged autograph.

“My first hit piece,” she says, then adds: “Oh wait. 2021? No, not my first.”

She was ever present when Mr Trump was convicted of business fraud in a New York court, and became his legal spokeswoman during the campaign last year.

After the election she was appointed counsellor to the president – the role filled by Kellyanne Conway in Trump 1.0 – giving her the ear of the president and a second-floor West Wing office beside his legal team.

“As counsellor to the president, it's a great job, because you can do whatever you want to sink your teeth into,” she said, “but at the same time, I think here I have a focus that is much more suited for me.”

After two months in the Washington swamp she moved back home to New Jersey.

Rumours, stoked by Democrats, hinted that she would never get beyond the 120 days of an “interim” US attorney and that Mr Trump would appoint someone else for a full term.

That did not stop Ms Habba preparing for a longer stint. One of the first things she did was order the official portraits of the president and JD Vance, his vice-president, to hang in the hallway, and bringing in her own soft furnishings for her personal office.

Her social media feed, once punchy and partisan, went quiet.

“You look at how much TV I used to do, and now, I won't go on unless there's something I really feel like has to be addressed,” she said.

She is under the weather with a cold but still manages a busy line in confessional chat. And she has just come from a succession of press conferences.

In the first she announced a major drugs bust, charging 24 members or associates of the “Sex, Money, Murder” street gang, affiliated with the notorious East Coast criminal Bloods gang for their alleged roles in a fentanyl, heroin and crack cocaine trafficking ring.

In the second, she announced the first charges stemming from her new “fentanyl precursor inception strike force”.

Making the streets safer is her only priority, she says.

“New Jersey has a little bit of an opportunity that I can really seize, which is that we are linked to so many major cities in this country, Philadelphia, for the south of New Jersey, New York City, right?” she says. “We have Newark Airport, we have the tunnels, we have bridges, we have ports.”

The corner office illustrates her point. The Manhattan skyline is visible to the west, and a steady stream of airliners can be seen landing at Newark Liberty International airport.

“You can be incredibly effective for the surrounding major cities as well as your state,” she says.

Her departure from the White House was reported in some circles as a demotion, an exiling of an ambitious figure with sharp elbows.

But in her telling – backed by insiders who say she remains tight with the president – it was an offer not an order, a chance to go back to her first career and be closer to her family who had stayed in New Jersey.

“I had the ability to say I wanted to stay so no, I chose to do this,” she says. “And honestly, at the time, I didn't realise how much I was going to love it, and I really do.”

Rather than saying goodbye to Chloe, nine, Luke, 11, and Parker, 18, on a Monday morning and flying to Washington for the week, she now drives the 45 minutes from home to the office each day.

A post shared by Alina Habba (@alina_habba)

Whether or not she will stay in the job is now up to the Senate, where she needs a simple majority to be confirmed to the role.

Democrats have a string of questions about whether she is politicising the office, starting with an interview in March.

“We could turn New Jersey red. I really do believe that,” Ms Habba told a conservative podcaster. “Hopefully while I'm there, I can help that cause.”

She points out that the interview was conducted before she was sworn in as interim US attorney, when she was still in the role of counsellor to the president.

And she is ready to be asked about her lack of experience as a prosecutor, explaining that previous office holders have had similar backgrounds to hers and that her office is packed with lawyers with years spent prosecuting cases.

“It's a silly talking point, to be honest with you,” she says. “I think that as long as you're surrounded by great people that will tell you exactly what the laws are, give you all the facts then all you have to do is apply law to fact and take out anything about politics.”

None of that might count, however, in the face of opposition from her two home state senators. “In her short tenure as an interim US Attorney, she has degraded the office and pursued frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions,” Senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim said.

Senate custom suggests that her nomination will not move forward if they oppose it, although there are other ways.

Either way, Ms Habba says she would relish the chance to defend her record and set out her case in front of senators.

“I'll tell you one thing, nobody's ever interviewed me and been like, Oh, she's so fake,” she says. “For better or worse, you asked me about going in front of the Senate... I will be genuinely me. I truly do not have the energy or care to be fake.”

Early-morning negotiations proved enough to persuade hardline House conservatives to back bill in 218-214 vote

US politics live – latest updates

The US House of Representatives passed Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill on Thursday, handing the president the first major legislative victory of his second term and sending to his desk wide-ranging legislation expected to supercharge immigration enforcement and slash federal safety net programs.

The 218-214 vote came after weeks of wrangling over the measure that Trump demanded be ready for his signature by Friday, the Independence Day holiday. Written by his Republican allies in Congress and unanimously rejected by Democrats, the bill traveled an uncertain road to passage that saw multiple all-night votes in the House and Senate and negotiations that lasted until the final hours before passage. Ultimately, Republicans who had objected to its cost and contents folded, and the bill passed with just two GOP defections: Thomas Massie, a rightwing Kentucky lawmaker, and Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents a Pennsylvania district that voted for Kamala Harris in last year's election.

“We've waited long enough, some of us have literally been up for days now, but this day – this day – is a hugely important one in the history of our nation,” the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, said, just before voting began.

“With one big, beautiful bill, we are going to make this country stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before, and every American is going to benefit from that.”

The legislation is expected to speed up and expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportations, and will probably make Trump's longstanding desire for a wall along the border with Mexico a reality.

It also strikes a blow against the US government's efforts to fight the climate crisis by phasing out tax incentives created under Joe Biden that were intended to spur investments in electric cars, wind and solar power and other green energy technologies.

The bill's centerpiece is a permanent extension of tax cuts made in 2017, during Trump's first term, as well as the creation of new, temporary exemptions for tips, overtime pay and car loan interest that the president promised voters during last year's campaign.

The government will lose trillions of dollars in revenue from those provisions, and to offset their costs, Republicans approved an array of cuts to Medicaid, the federal program providing health insurance coverage to poor and disabled Americans, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).

Those changes are expected to cost millions of people their benefits, but the bill remains expensive, with the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) saying it will add $3.3tn to the country's debt through 2034.

Massie explained his decision to vote against the bill in a post on X, writing that “it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates”.

Fitzpatrick issued a statement saying “it was the Senate's amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis” for his district and made him vote no.

Democrats blasted the proposal as “one big, ugly bill” that dismantles anti-poverty programs to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Analyses have shown that high earners benefited most from Trump's tax policies.

The Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, made a last-ditch effort to halt the bill's passage by delivering a floor speech that lasted eight hours and 44 minutes, the longest ever.

“This is extraordinary. This assault on everyday Americans, assault on children, veterans, seniors, people with disabilities. It's incredible to me, all of this in this one, big, ugly bill,” Jeffries said.

“Ripping food out of the mouths of vulnerable Americans – that's extraordinary that that's what we're doing, extraordinary. And all of this is being done, this unprecedented assault on everyday Americans, is being unleashed on the American people, Mr Speaker, on the most vulnerable among us, all of this is being done to provide massive tax breaks to billionaire donors. Shame on this institution. If this bill passes, that's not America. We're better than this.”

Trump has described the bill as crucial to the success of his second term, and congressional Republicans made its passage their top priority. It was a tall task – the GOP won small majorities in both the House and Senate in last November's election, and could afford no more than three defections in either chamber.

The party's lawmakers broadly support Trump but were divided on a host of other issues. There were lawmakers who wanted big spending cuts, rapid phase-outs of green energy incentives and an expanded deduction that would mostly benefit taxpayers in Democratic-led states. Their demands butted against others who sought to moderate the bill, but over the course of weeks, Republicans leaders managed to forge a compromise.

The bill is only able to affect revenue, spending and the debt limit, under the rules of budget reconciliation that allowed the GOP to avoid a filibuster by Democrats in the Senate. Under Biden, Congress's then Democratic majority had used the same procedure to pass legislation to spur the economy's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and curb US carbon emissions.

Trump's bill allocates $45bn for Ice detention facilities, $14bn for deportation operations and billions of dollars more to hire 10,000 new agents by 2029. An additional $50bn will go towards the border wall and other fortifications.

Enrollees of Medicaid and Snap will face new work requirements, and states will be forced to share part of the cost of the latter program for the first time ever. The CBO estimates the bill's Medicaid changes could cost as many as 11.8 million people their healthcare, and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities forecasts about 8 million people, or one in five recipients, may lose their Snap benefits.

The legislation also forces changes to provider taxes, which states use to finance their share of Medicaid spending. That is expected to further increase the financial stress of hospitals in rural areas, and when the bill was in the Senate, a $50bn fund was added to support those facilities.

Some in the GOP were openly nervous about the cuts to safety net programs that their constituents rely on. Thom Tillis, a senator who represents swing state North Carolina, refused to support the bill for those reasons, leading Trump to announce he would support a primary challenger when he stands for re-election next year. Tillis then made public his plans to retire, a potential boost for Democrats' hopes of claiming his seat.

“It is inescapable this bill will betray the promise Donald Trump made,” Tillis said on the Senate floor.

“What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding's not there any more, guys?”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

If you've lately been feeling that the “Jurassic Park” franchise has jumped an even more ancient creature — the shark — hold off any thoughts of extinction. Judging from the latest entry, there's still life in this old dino series.

Jurassic World Rebirth captures the awe and majesty of the overgrown lizards that's been lacking for so many of the movies, which became just an endless cat-and-mouse in the dark between scared humans against T-Rexes or raptors. Jurassic World Rebirth lets in the daylight.

Credit goes to screenwriter David Koepp, who penned the original Jurassic Park, and director Gareth Edwards, who knows a thing or two about giant reptiles as director of 2014's Godzilla. Together with director of photographer John Mathieson, they've returned the franchise to its winning roots.

Jurassic World Rebirth has nods to the past even as it cuts a new future with new characters. It's a sort of heist movie with monsters that's set on the original decaying island research facility for the original, abandoned Jurassic Park.

Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali — both very unshowy and suggesting a sort of sibling chemistry — play security and extraction specialists — OK, mercenaries — hired to get what everyone wants from dinosaurs in these movies: DNA. In return, there's US$10 million.

The movie is set five years after Jurassic World Dominion and some three decades after dinosaurs were reanimated. They've lost their public fascination — a subtle nod perhaps to the films in the franchise — and have struggled with the climate, gathering at the equator.

The Big Pharma company ParkerGenix has come up with a blockbuster idea: Take DNA from three colossal Cretaceous-period creatures — the flying Quetzalcoatlus, the aquatic Mosasaurus and the land-based Titanosaurus — to cure cardiac disease. Wait, how does that work? Don't ask us, something about hemoglobin.

The trick is this: The dinos have to be alive when the DNA is extracted. Why? Because then there'd be no movie, silly. It would be a 10-minute sequence of a guy in a white coat and a syringe. This way, we celebrate three kinds of dinosaurs in three separate chapters.

It may seem a little far-fetched, but may we remind you about the last movie, which involved a biogenetic granddaughter, a global pharma conspiracy, the cast members from both trilogies, a Giganotosaurus, giant locusts on fire and had the ludicrous decision to have Chris Pratt make a promise to bring home a baby dino — to its mother.

The three-part quest at the heart of Jurassic World Rebirth is interrupted by a family — a dad, his two daughters and a sketchy boyfriend — in a 45-foot sailboat that is capsized and need rescuing. They bring a dose of not-always-working humor and humanity to the extraction team, which also includes a too-easily-telegraphing baddie played by Rupert Friend — “I'm too smart to die” — and a museum-based paleontologist played by Jonathan Bailey.

The filmmakers include clever nods to other blockbusters — Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Jaws and ET — and thrillingly create a dinos-hunting-in-a-convenience-store sequence like a tribute to the original film's dinos-hunting-in-a-kitchen sequence. The shots overall are beautifully composed, from silhouettes on a boat in twilight to almost feeling the burn of the ropes as actors rappel down a 500-foot cliff face.

The creatures here are made glorious — from a dozing T-Rex along a river bed to the ones twisting in the sea, pure muscle and heft. A highlight is a pair of long-tailed Tyrannosauruses entwining their necks as John Williams' familiar score plays, two lovers with thick, knotted skin utterly oblivious to the pesky humans who want some DNA.

For some reason, candy is a touchstone throughout the movie, from the opening sequence in which a stray Snickers wrapper causes incalculable harm, to licorice fed to a baby dino and one character's fondness for crunching Altoids.

Edwards' pacing is perfect, allowing dread to build with just the rustling of trees, and letting characters deepen between breathless, excellently filmed action sequences. The gorgeous landscape — Thailand's waterfalls, grassy plains, shoreline caves and mangrove swamps — should be used for a tourist campaign, well, as long as they remove the rapacious dinos.

As if all this wasn't enough, there's a bonus bit at the end. The research facility that was abandoned years ago was cross-breeding dino species and making “genetically altered freaks” that still roam around. Some look like a turkey-bat-raptor hybrid — gross and scary — and one is a 20,000-pound T-Rex with a misshapen head and a horrible roar. It's like getting a free monster movie.

In many ways, the folks behind Jurassic World Rebirth are trying to do the same thing as their mercenaries: Going back to the source code to recapture the magic of Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster original. They've thrillingly succeeded.

During a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on July 3, Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""Russia will continue to pursue its goals"" in the war against Ukraine, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said.

The hour-long conversation between the two presidents focused on Russia's war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, according to Ushakov.

""Trump once again emphasized the need to end military hostilities as soon as possible. Vladimir Putin noted that Russia continues to seek a political negotiated solution to the conflict,"" Ushakov said.

""Our president said that Russia will pursue its goals, specifically addressing the root causes that led to the current situation, and will not back down from these objectives.""

The Kremlin aide added that the two leaders discussed cultural diplomacy, specifically the exchange of films promoting what Ushakov described as ""traditional values close to Russia and the U.S. presidential administration.""

Putin's message came amid a surge of Russian drone and missile attacks across Ukraine that have killed and injured hundreds of civilians in recent weeks. 

The strikes have destroyed numerous infrastructure as Russia intensifies its assault despite repeated calls from Kyiv, Washington, and European leaders for an unconditional ceasefire.

The phone call also came just a day after the U.S. Defense Department paused shipments of key weapons systems to Ukraine, including Patriot air defense missiles and precision-guided munitions. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has warned that the delay undermines defense efforts and risks emboldening Russia to escalate further.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking from Denmark earlier in the day, said that achieving peace would require direct talks between national leaders. 

The president described Trump and Putin as ""completely different people"" but emphasized that only Putin makes decisions in Russia.

""In Russia, only Putin makes decisions, which is why we need a meeting at the leadership level if we want to have peace,"" Zelensky said.

According to Ushakov, the presidents did not discuss the possibility of a meeting, but ""the idea is in the air,"" and they agreed to continue communication.

Moscow and Kyiv have held two rounds of face-to-face talks in Istanbul this year, first on May 16 and again on June 2, following more than three years with no direct negotiations. 

The meetings resulted in several prisoner exchanges, but no steps toward a ceasefire.

While Trump has expressed frustration with Russia's continued aggression, his administration has not imposed new sanctions nor taken steps to pressure the Kremlin directly.

Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Based in Warsaw, he is pursuing studies in International Relations, focusing on European Studies. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Russia launched a wave of drones attacks across Ukraine late on July 3, striking a residential building in Kyiv, officials reported.





""The conditions for Sputnik Azerbaijan to continue its activities in this country are not in place,"" Russia Today media group CEO Dmitry Kiselyov said.

Ukraine does not currently recognize same-sex marriages or partnerships, and this court ruling may serve as a critical legal milestone in expanding rights for LGBTQ families.

The ruling orders Russia to pay more than $1.5 billion in damages and an additional 300,000 euros ($330,000) in legal costs to Ukraine's largest state-owned bank, according to a press release.

The hour-long conversation between the two presidents focused on Russia's war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, according to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov.



Ukraine signed a major deal with U.S. company Swift Beat to co-produce various types of drones, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 3 during his visit to Denmark.

Major General Mikhail Gudkov also led a brigade involved in combat operations against Ukraine. His death reportedly occurred during a Ukrainian attack on a Russian command post.

""We will continue to strengthen our army, train our troops, and involve more people in defense to deliver a strong response to the enemy,"" said Ground Forces spokesperson Vitalii Sarantsev.

Manolis Pilavov had been wanted in Ukraine since 2015 on charges including attempting to violently overthrow the constitutional order and violating Ukraine's territorial integrity.

The alleged spy, arrested during a special operation in Lviv Oblast, was reportedly recruited through his ex-wife, a former military officer now cooperating with Russian forces in occupied Melitopol.

The Energia plant in Yelets produces parts for ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as batteries for drones and glide bombs. The factory was previously targeted multiple times this past May. 

If the Strait were mined, Iran could block one-fifth of global oil demand and spike world energy prices — a boon for Russia's oil-dependent economy. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Eight years ago, at the peak of the #MeToo movement, it seemed, for a brief moment, like progress was imminent. Women from around the world were sharing their extensive – and oftentimes painful – experiences of sexual abuse and violence, and lawmakers and corporations alike were pledging to make change.

But in the years since, that progress has been stuttered. Harvey Weinstein, the film mogul whose case served as the rallying cry for the #MeToo movement, saw one of his convictions overturned. Donald Trump, who in 2023 was found liable for rape, was re-elected as President of the United States. 

And here in Canada, the recent Hockey Canada trial has reignited a conversation around what constitutes consent.

The Globe and Mail spoke with a group of five teenaged girls, all of them 12th-graders from Kitchener, Ont., to get their thoughts on the current state of things: what it's like to be a young woman growing up in the post-#MeToo era, what sexual harassment looks like today and what they wish they'd been taught about consent. 

Have you all been following the Hockey Canada trial?

Samira Nur

[All of them shaking their heads no]

Samira Nur, 17: It wasn't on my radar. But it does sound similar to a lot of stories I've heard, whether it's from people I know, or stories from the news.

The case centres around consent – whether the young woman at the centre of it felt pressured and coerced into a situation she couldn't handle. 

How does that land with all of you? Have any of you had experiences where you felt pressured into uncomfortable situations?

Samira: I work at a grocery store, so I encounter a lot of creepy men. There are a lot of older guys who are like, “Oh, how old are you?” “Let me take you home.” Or comment on my body while I'm picking something up from the floor. I've had a couple guys follow me home.

I had another man ask me my ethnicity. When I said I was Somali, he was like, “Oh, girls your age are married with kids by now. I'm going to ask your mom for your hand in marriage.”

Technically speaking, I'm at work, and under the expectation that I still have to treat these people with kindness, despite the fact that I'm being, like, fully disrespected.

Anna De Sousa

Anna De Sousa, 18: I've been working since I was 12 at a bakery. There's this one [older male] customer I encounter every year. He comes in every summer, and asks me my age. And he always says, “Oh, don't worry, I'll wait until you're 18.” 

Last year, he was like, “You're 17 now. Next year, I'll be back. We're gonna go out.” I know he's going to show up this summer. Every time I see his face, my body literally starts shaking. 

As a teenager in the 1990s, I don't remember learning about consent or body safety in high school. What kind of sexual education were you given?

Nishtha Tomer, 18: In Grade 9 health class, I think we only had, like, one or two classes about sex ed, and that's about it. It was mostly just sexual health – pregnancy, STDs and a lot about that. I also heard we learned a lot more than the guys did. 

A mistrial, jury dismissal, excluded evidence: Key moments in the Hockey Canada trial

What about consent?

Nishtha Tomer

Loyd Gebreselassie, 18: I know that they mentioned briefly things about consent – like what are your personal boundaries? And how do we make sure that's expressed? But it wasn't very in-depth.

Samira: I think they used the “tea” scenario. Like, if you don't want tea, you say you don't want tea. [Everybody laughs] 

It was like a YouTube video. It wasn't really treated very seriously.

What do you wish you'd been taught?

Samira: I wish we could have learned more about how much of a grey area consent can be. Consent can be removed. It can be coerced. It can be [the result of] abuse. Consent isn't as simple as yes or no.

Not in terms of sexual situations, but I think a lot of us have said yes [to things] because of pressure, and not because we felt freedom or liberation to choose. 

I think that can apply in a lot of young women's sexual encounters – like because they're scared of losing someone. 

Anna: That's one thing I wish we explored more at school: Being able to say no in a way where you feel protected, you feel safe, but it's also respectful. 

So where do you turn to for advice on handling these situations?

Loyd Gebreselassie

Shantelle Carrion, 18: I learned more from my mom. But it's kind of scary knowing that my knowledge of consent and relationships – everything comes from my parents. Thankfully, I'm in a very loving family, but that's not the case for everyone.

Nishtha: I do have a close relationship with my parents. But it's still a brown household, and an immigrant household [Nishtha's parents are immigrants from India]. So it is a very stigmatized topic. So I mostly learned, like, from my amazing friend group about these things – and online as well.

What about the role of alcohol or other substances when it comes to consent? What kinds of conversations are you girls having with your friends and families about that?

Shantelle: Underage drinking is so normalized. I've had a personal experience where I went to a party [inebriated] my very first time – my only time. I regret it a lot. Thankfully I had a bunch of my girls with me.

I bring this up because this is what happened in the Hockey Canada trial. It gives me chills, imagining the situation I could have gotten into if nobody else was there. It's so scary.

We've been talking about it a lot [as friends], because we're going to be freshmen soon – how there's going to be a big party culture at university. 

As a teenager in the 90s, sexual harassment meant, for the most part, harassment on the street, or at school. What does it look like for you today?

Nishtha: Honestly, I think it's gotten worse. With Instagram and Snapchat, it gives guys the ability to be anonymous when they're saying things. It switched from, like, being in the hallways to, like, texting your account, adding you to group chats. They will not say a word to you in real life, but online, it's the meanest things.

And what does it look like when you try to have conversations about this stuff with your male peers?

Shantelle Carrion

Loyd: I think this trend is growing with younger men – this Andrew Tate, red-pill sort of mentality. “You have to be jacked. Your woman has to be submissive.” All these ideologies they've gathered and almost try to force onto women – and especially teenagers. 

Samira: It's gotten more hostile with the digital era. A lot of men do take women speaking out about these situations as hatred. I see that a lot.

At the height of the #MeToo movement, many of us had hoped that things would be better, and safer for the next generation of young women. Has that been the case? 

Shantelle: I feel like the #MeToo era was amazing in the sense of spreading awareness, and bringing solidarity between women. More so that than actually really solving anything. 

Nishtha: It removed a lot of stigmatization, and helped to destigmatize conservations around sexual assault. And it helped remove a lot of shame that women carry.

But I feel like legally, or even politically, there hasn't been real recognition or actual change for victims.

Women did learn to cope with that together, and did build more of a sense of community. But also, it's something we shouldn't be having to cope with. There should be consequences.

The issue of consent was raised in the trial of five former members of Canada's 2018 world junior hockey team, who are accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a London, Ont., hotel room in 2018. Robyn Doolittle and Standards Editor Sandra E. Martin discuss the issue, particularly a video recorded by one of the accused. In the video the woman appeared to give consent, however, she testified that her words in the recording did not reflect how she truly felt at the time. The accused players have all pleaded not guilty.

Airlines have had to cancel hundreds of flights as airport staff went on strike, leaving tens of thousands of passengers in the lurch as the summer travel season gets under way.

Strike action by French air traffic controllers on Thursday has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights, leaving tens of thousands of passengers in the lurch at the start of the summer season — one of the busiest times of the year for travel.

France's civil aviation authority DGAC said airlines needed to revise their schedules, including at Paris' Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport — one of Europe's busiest travel hubs.

A little after 10 am (0800 UTC/GMT) on Thursday, AFP news agency reported that flights were experiencing significant delays, including an average of 1.5 hours for arrivals and 1 hour for departures in Nice, France's third-largest airport.

Europe's largest airline Ryanair said that it had been forced to cancel 170 flights over Thursday and Friday, impacting over 30,000 passengers.

""Once again European families are held to ransom by French Air Traffic Controllers going on strike,"" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said.

""It makes no sense and is abundantly unfair on EU passengers and families going on holidays,"" O'Leary said. 

Another popular budget airline, Easyjet, said it would be cancelling 274 flights over the same period.

The Airlines for Europe association, which includes Ryanair, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways and EasyJet, described the action as ""intolerable"".

Air traffic controllers' union, UNSA-ICNA, said members were taking action over understaffing, outdated equipment and a toxic management culture.

""The DGAC is failing to modernise the tools that are essential to air traffic controllers, even though it continues to promise that all necessary resources are being made available,"" UNSA-ICNA said in a statement.

 France's transport minister Philippe Tabarot said the unions' demands are unacceptable.

""The demands made by minority unions are unacceptable, as is the decision to hold this strike at the start of the holiday season,"" Tabarot said on Wednesday.

International law experts are describing Israel's Monday attack on a Gaza café as a potential war crime after an investigation in The Guardian revealed that the attack was carried out using a 500-lb bomb supplied by the U.S. government.

Reporters photographed fragments of the bomb left behind in the wreckage of the al-Baqa Café. Weapons experts identified them as parts of an MK-82 general purpose bomb, which it called “a US-made staple of many bombing campaigns in recent decades.”

The attack killed anywhere from 24 to 36 Palestinians and injured dozens more. Casualties included women, children, and the elderly. A prominent photojournalist and artist were also killed.

Experts have called the use of such a weapon on an area full of civilians wildly disproportionate and a likely violation of the Geneva Convention, which outlaws military operations that cause “incidental loss of civilian life” that is “excessive or disproportionate” to the military advantage to be gained.

“It is almost impossible to see how this use of that kind of munition can be justified,” said Marc Schack, an associate professor of international law at the University of Copenhagen in comments to The Guardian. “If you are talking about 20, 30, 40 or more civilian casualties, usually that would have to be a target of very great importance.”

After the attack drew heavy criticism, an army spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the strike had killed “several Hamas terrorists” and that “prior to the strike, steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians using aerial surveillance.”

Gerry Simpson of Human Rights Watch criticized that defense.

“The Israeli military hasn't said exactly whom it was targeting, but it said it used aerial surveillance to minimize civilian casualties, which means it knew the café was teeming with customers at the time,” Simpson told The Guardian. “The military would also have known that using a large guided air-dropped bomb would kill and maim many of the civilians there. The use of such a large weapon in an obviously crowded café risks that this was an unlawful disproportionate or indiscriminate attack and should be investigated as a war crime.”

Since Monday's bombing, the attacks against civilians in Gaza have only intensified. According to a Thursday report from the Gaza Government Media Office, more than 300 Palestinians have been killed within the last 48 hours in “26 bloody massacres.”

According to reporting Thursday from Al Jazeera, these have included attacks on “shelters and displacement centers overcrowded with tens of thousands of displaced people, public rest areas, Palestinian families inside their homes, popular markets and vital civilian facilities, and starving civilians searching for food.”

At least 33 people were killed Thursday at a Gaza Humanitarian Fund (GHF) aid distribution site, adding to the hundreds of aid seekers who have been killed in recent weeks. In a Haaretz investigation last week, soldiers described these aid sites, administered by the U.S. and Israel, as a “killing field,” where they have routinely been ordered to fire on unarmed civilians who posed no threat.

Two American contractors at a GHF site told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that their colleagues fired their guns wildly, including in the direction of Palestinians. They provided a video which shows hundreds of aid-seekers crowded between metal gates, being assaulted with stun grenades and pepper spray, while gunshots echo in the background.

On Tuesday, Amnesty International and hundreds of other humanitarian NGOs called for an end to the Israeli government's blockade of food and other necessities entering the Gaza Strip. They also called for an end to the “deadly Israeli distribution scheme” and for a return of aid distribution to the United Nations and other international organizations.

“This devastating daily loss of life as desperate Palestinians try to collect aid is the consequence of their deliberate targeting by Israeli forces and the foreseeable consequence of irresponsible and lethal methods of distribution,” said Agnès Callamard, the secretary general of Amnesty International, on Thursday.

            The visitors who trek to America's national parks are already noticing the changes, just months after President Donald Trump took office.
    


            “I've been visiting national parks for 30 years and never has the presence of rangers been so absent,” one visitor to Zion National Park wrote in National Parks Service public feedback obtained by CNN.
    


            The visitor said they saw just one trail crew at the iconic Utah park. There were no educational programs offered at any of the five parks they visited on their trip.
    


            “Hire back park staff. We need them,” the visitor wrote.
    


            At Yosemite, another visitor said there were no rangers at the Hetch Hetchy reservoir entrance station, preventing visitors from picking up wilderness permits.
    


            “More staff would be a BIG and IMPORTANT improvement,” that visitor wrote.
    


            America's most treasured national parks are getting crunched by Trump's government-shrinking layoffs just as the summer travel season gets into full swing.
    


            Top officials vowed to hire thousands of seasonal employees to pick up the slack after the Trump administration fired around 1,000 NPS employees as part of wide-ranging federal firings known as the “Valentine's Day Massacre.” Department of Interior officials said in a February memo they would aim to hire 7,700 seasonal workers at NPS, and post listings for 9,000 jobs.
    


            But those numbers haven't materialized ahead July 4th — the parks' busiest time of the year. Internal National Park Service data provided to CNN by the National Parks Conservation Association shows that about 4,500 seasonal and temporary staff have been hired.
    


            Full-time staff numbers are down, too; as of June, the parks service had 12,600 full-time employees, which is 24% fewer staff than they had at the beginning of the year.
    


            That's the lowest staffing level in over 20 years, according to Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association.
    


            Some parks, including Yellowstone, have increased their staff this year. But with low staffing levels at other parks unlikely to meaningfully improve this year, Kym Hall, a former NPS regional director and park superintendent, told CNN she worries park rangers and other staff could hit a breaking point later this summer.
    


            “By mid-August, you're going to have staff that is so burned out,” Hall said. “Somebody is going to make a mistake, somebody is going to get hurt. Or you're going to see visitors engaging with wildlife in a way that they shouldn't, because there aren't enough people out in the parks to say, ‘do not get that close to a grizzly bear that's on the side of the road; that's a terrible idea.'”
    


            The National Parks Service did not respond to CNN's request for comment on its staffing levels.
    


            Meanwhile, visitors are arriving in droves. Last year set a new record for recreation visits at nearly 332 million, smashing the previous record set in 2016.
    


            Hall said the process of hiring thousands of seasonal workers for the summer takes months, typically starting in the previous fall or winter to fully staff up.
    


            “Even if the parks had permission, and even if they had some funding, it takes months and months to get a crew of seasonal (workers) recruited, vetted, hired, boarded into their duty stations, trained and ready to serve the public by Memorial Day,” Hall said.
    


            Compounding the staffing issue is the fact that many park superintendents, some of whom oversee the most iconic parks like Yosemite, have retired or taken the Trump administration's deferred resignation offers. That leaves over 100 parks without their chief supervisor, Brengel said.
    


            And amid the staff losses, staffers normally assigned to park programming, construction, and trail maintenance, as well as a cadre of park scientists, have been reassigned to visitor services to keep up with the summer season.
    


            Questioned by both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill about the low staffing numbers, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has brushed off concerns, testifying in May that slightly less than half of permanent NPS employees work on the ground in the parks, while other staff work at regional offices or at DC headquarters.
    


            “I want more people in the parks,” Burgum said. “I want less overhead. There's an opportunity to have more people working in our parks … and have less people working for the National Park Service.”
    


            But internal NPS data tells a different story, Brengel said, showing that around 80% of National Park Service staff work in the parks. And regional offices play an important supporting staff role, with scientists on staff to help maintain fragile parks ecosystems, as well as specialists who monitor geohazard safety issues like landslides.
    


            Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska recently pressed Burgum to provide a full list of staff positions that have been cut at the National Parks Service, Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service since the Trump administration took over. The Interior Department has not provided the list, a Senate staffer said.
    


            The regional offices within the Parks Service are on edge, waiting to see how courts rule on a Trump administration reduction in force plan they fear could gut their ranks, a National Park Service employee in a Western state told CNN.
    


            “If they greenlight the RIF plan, then it's going to be a bloodbath,” the employee said.
    


            In addition to probationary workers that were fired in February, early retirements are also culling the agency's ranks, and the continued $1 spending limit on federal workers' credit cards is making it extremely difficult to do field work in the parks, with a simple overnight trip needing to be requested 10 days in advance, the employee added.
    


            The lack of superintendents and NPS supervisors creates more of a headache, they added.
    


            “These times, when it's all about fighting for scarce resources, you really need those upper-level people with clout working the system,” the employee said.
    


            Hall, the retired NPS regional director, said losing rangers, maintenance professionals and park superintendents could profoundly alter American landmarks.
    


            “What you've lost with all this attrition – you've lost all this knowledge that's going to take years to build back up,” Hall said.

            President Donald Trump has promised that the “big, beautiful bill” passed by Congress will be one of the most successful pieces of legislation in American history.
    


            Of course, the ultimate beauty of this sweeping legislation is very much in the eye of the beholder.
    


            The bill could end up boosting some workers and industries, while others may be left worse off.
    


Corporate America



            Big business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable, applauded the Senate's passage of the bill on Tuesday.
    


            Corporations are betting they will benefit from the legislation making permanent the tax breaks in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
    


            The package would restore a tax break from the 2017 tax package that allowed businesses to fully write off the cost of equipment in the first year it was purchased. The incentive has been phasing out since 2023.
    


            Also, the legislation would once again allow businesses to write off the cost of research and development in the year it was incurred. The TCJA required that companies deduct those expenses over five years, starting in 2022.
    


Manufacturers



            Manufacturers are especially happy that the bill would make significant changes to how the US tax code treats the construction of new manufacturing facilities.
    


            Businesses will be allowed to fully and immediately deduct the cost of building new manufacturing facilities. This temporary provision is retroactive to January 19, 2025 and continues for construction that begins before January 1, 2029.
    


            And in a bid to incentivize more chipmaking in America, the legislation would enhance tax credits for semiconductor firms building manufacturing facilities in the United States.
    


Small businesses and partnerships



            The National Federation of Independent Business, the leading small business lobbying group, praised the legislation for making permanent a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay businesses taxes on their individual tax returns.
    


            That deduction, which applies to small businesses and partnerships formed by lawyers, doctors and investors, would get increased in the House version of the bill from 20% to 23%. The Senate bill kept it at 20%.
    


High-income Americans



            The net income for the top 20% of earners would increase by nearly $13,000 per year, after taxes and transfers, according to an analysis of a near-final version of the Senate bill by Penn Wharton Budget Model.
    


            That amounts to a 3% average increase in income for those households.
    


            For the top 0.1% of earners, the average annual income gain would amount to more than $290,000, according to Penn Wharton.
    


            Americans living in high-tax states should also benefit because the bill temporarily increases limits on deductions for state and local taxes for householders making up to $500,000 annually to $40,000 per year for five years.
    


            However, millionaires who lose their jobs will not be able to collect unemployment benefits, according to a recent provision added to the Senate bill.
    


Workers who receive tips and overtime



            Certain workers will receive an extra tax break through 2028.
    


            Employees who work in jobs that traditionally receive tips could deduct up to $25,000 in tip income from their federal income taxes, while workers who receive overtime could deduct up to $12,500 of that extra pay.
    


            However, highly compensated individuals, who make more than $160,000 in 2025, would not qualify.
    


Low-income Americans



            Many people at the lowest end of the income ladder would be worse off because the package would enact historic cuts to the nation's safety net program, particularly Medicaid and food stamps.
    


            Among the many changes to these programs would be the addition of federally mandated work requirements to Medicaid for the first time in its 60-year history and the expansion of the work mandate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. Parents of children ages 14 and up are among those who would have to work, volunteer, take classes or participate in job training to keep their benefits.
    


            Millions of low-income Americans are expected to lose their benefits because of the work requirements and the bill's other measures affecting Medicaid and food stamps. Notably, few of those dropped from Medicaid coverage would have access to job-based health insurance, according to a Congressional Budget Office report about the House version of the package.
    


            Those in the lowest-income group, earning less than $18,000 a year, would see a $165 reduction in their after-tax, after-transfer income, once the safety net cuts are taken into account, according to Penn Wharton. That's a 1.1% decrease.
    


            The next level, who earn between $18,000 and $53,000, would get a $30 bump in income, or 0.1%.
    


            Middle-income households would see their income rise by $1.430, or 1.8%. They earn between $53,000 and $96,000.
    


            The health provisions won't only hit low-income Americans. The Senate is also tightening verification requirements for the Affordable Care Act's federal premium subsidies, which could also leave some middle-income Americans uninsured.
    


            All told, the bill could result in more than 10 million more people being uninsured in 2034, according to a CNN analysis of the bill and CBO forecasts.
    


Hospitals



            Hospitals are not happy with the health care provisions of the bill, which would reduce the support they receive from states to care for Medicaid enrollees and leave them with more uncompensated care costs for treating uninsured patients.
    


            “The real-life consequences of these nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts – the largest ever proposed by Congress – will result in irreparable harm to our health care system, reducing access to care for all Americans and severely undermining the ability of hospitals and health systems to care for our most vulnerable patients,” said Rick Pollack, CEO of the American Hospital Association.
    


            The association said it is “deeply disappointed” with the bill, even though it contains a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals contend with the Medicaid cuts, which hospitals say is not nearly enough to make up for the shortfall.
    


Clean energy and EVs



            The Senate removed a last-minute excise tax on wind and solar that experts warned would have been a “killer” for the clean energy industry.
    


            However, the Senate bill still strips tax incentives for wind, solar and other renewable energy projects by 2027 and gives developers stringent requirements to claim them.
    


            The American Clean Power Association slammed the legislation as a “step backward for American energy policy” that will eliminate jobs and raise electric bills.
    


            Electric vehicle makers could also be left worse off because the GOP bill ends EV tax credits of up to $7,500 at the end of September. Previously those tax credits were scheduled to last through 2032, providing a powerful incentive for car buyers.
    


Deficit hawks



            The Senate version of the package would increase the deficit by about $3.4 trillion over the next decade, according to CBO.
    


            Adding trillions to the debt risks lifting already elevated interest rates. That in turn will make it more expensive for Americans to finance the purchase of a car or a home and for businesses to borrow money to grow.
    


            Not only that, but higher rates would force the federal government to devote even greater resources to finance its own mountain of debt.
    


            The CBO expects US federal government interest costs to surpass $1 trillion per year.
    


            US spending on interest has already more than tripled since 2017, surpassing what the federal government's entire defense budget.

The Supreme Court decided Thursday to review state bans on transgender athletes participating in public school sports.

Oral arguments will likely be heard later this fall regarding two cases in Idaho and West Virginia. Both cases are focused on state laws that prevent biological males from competing on girls' and women's sports teams.

West Virginia, which enacted the ""Save Women's Sports Act"" in 2021, is appealing a lower-court ruling that allowed transgender athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson to compete on the school's cross-country and track teams. This past year, Pepper-Jackson qualified for the West Virginia girls high school state track meet, finishing third in the discus throw and eighth in the shot put in the Class AAA division.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Pepper-Jackson, who has been taking puberty-blocking medication, in an April 2024 ruling based on the Constitution's equal protection clause.

""It's a great day, as female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard,"" West Virginia Attorney General John McCuskey said in a statement. ""The people of West Virginia know that it's unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that's why we passed this commonsense law preserving women's sports for women.""

""We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women's Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX,"" McCuskey added. ""And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair.""

Idaho, which became the first state in the country to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports in 2020, asked the Supreme Court to hear its case involving Lindsay Hecox, a trans athlete wanting to compete on Boise State's women's track team. 

SCOTUS RULES ON STATE BAN ON GENDER TRANSITION 'TREATMENTS' FOR MINORS IN LANDMARK CASE

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld an injunction blocking Idaho state law in 2023. 

""Idaho's women and girls deserve an equal playing field,"" Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador said in a statement. ""I am thrilled the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear our case. 

""For too long, activists have worked to sideline women and girls in their own sports. Men and women are biologically different, and we hope the court will allow states to end this injustice and ensure men no longer create a dangerous, unfair environment for women to showcase their incredible talent and pursue the equal opportunities they deserve.""

Thursday's news followed a major victory for the Trump administration's battle to safeguard the protections of girls' and women's sports. The University of Pennsylvania agreed to adhere to the resolution agreement reached with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights after an investigation found that UPenn violated Title IX during the 2021-22 season because of the inclusion of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas.

As part of the resolution, UPenn agreed to restore titles previously held by Thomas and issue an apology to female athletes impacted by the university's policy, which the Education Department found had violated Title IX.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) tried to appeal to House Republicans who were hesitant to vote for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by invoking the late Sen. John McCain's vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act.

The Arizona Republican, who died in 2018, famously voted against his party in a shocking move that kept the ACA from being repealed.

“All we need are four Republicans to join us in support of their constituents, have John McCain-level courage and stand up in defense of the healthcare of the American people,” Jeffries said before blasting the bill for stripping Medicaid benefits.

“What type of party would bring a bill to the House floor that rips away Medicaid from those in need? What kind of party would bring a bill to the House floor that literally robs food from the mouths of children, veterans, and seniors? And all of this is being done to provide massive tax breaks to their billionaire donors. It's unconscionable. It's unacceptable. It's un-American. And House Democrats are committing to you that we're gonna do everything in our power to stop it. And all we need are four Republicans. Just four to show John McCain-level courage. Just four. There are 220 of them,” he added.

Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Warren Davidson (R-OH) have signaled that they remain “no” votes on the bill, which is coming back to the House after Vice President JD Vance broke a 50-50 tie in the Senate.

Several other House Republicans, like Reps. Ralph Norman (R-SC) and Marlin Stutzman (R-IN), have indicated they'll vote “no” unless significant changes are made. If Norman and Stutzman join Massie and Davidson to vote “no,” the House would tie 216-216 on the bill, if all Democrats vote against it.

“The changes the Senate made to the House passed Beautiful Bill, including unacceptable increases to the national debt and the deficit, are going to make passage in the House difficult,” Stutzman said, expressing his willingness to work past the July 4 deadline to make it acceptable. “We cannot in good faith pass a bill through our chamber that hinges on cut corners and earmarks. The American people won't stand for it.”

THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO COULD DEFECT TO SINK TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Democrats allege the bill, which would pass many items on Trump's agenda, will strip Medicaid benefits away from citizens. Republicans have said the bill will kick illegal immigrants off the plan.

McCain voted against repealing the ACA in 2017 because there was no viable alternative, even though he opposed the plan. “While the amendment would have repealed some of Obamacare‘s most burdensome regulations, it offered no replacement to actually reform our healthcare system and deliver affordable, quality healthcare to our citizens,” he said then.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries‘s (D-NY) “magic minute” speech on Thursday surpassed the record for the longest House floor speech in history. 

His speech was the Democrats' final effort to oppose and stall President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” passing through the House. Upon its conclusion, the House will proceed to final passage of the GOP's massive tax and spending bill.

Jeffries took the House floor at 4:53 a.m. and wrapped up at 1:37 p.m. for a total of eight hours and 44 minutes. The effort surpassed the record held by then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. He used his magic minute to speak for eight hours and 32 minutes before the passage of then-President Joe Biden's Build Back Better Act in 2021.

Jeffries was joined on the House floor by fellow Democrats, including one who fell asleep on camera. He started in the early morning hours after House Republican leadership worked through the night to flip several holdouts during a procedural vote, to blast the GOP's bill before the chamber votes on its final passage. He dubbed the GOP legislation the “one big, ugly bill” and said he would tell stories of people who could be hurt by its passage.

WHAT MADE IT INTO THE SENATE'S FINAL ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AND WHAT DIDN'T

“I'm going to take my time and ensure that the American people fully understand how damaging this bill will be to their quality of life,” Jeffries said early in his speech. 

During the House's first passage of the legislation in May, the minority leader spoke for approximately 40 minutes. “Magic minute” is a procedural rule in the House that comes after the bill is debated and before final passage, allowing leadership of both parties to have unlimited speaking time.

Jeffries's speech came after a long day in the House. The floor remained open for more than seven hours, making history as the longest continuous vote, before GOP leadership was met with its first victory of the day.

Jeffries signaled early on that he intended to take his “sweet time” to read personal stories from Americans who could be hurt by the changes to the bill regarding Medicaid funding and eligibility requirements.

“As a result of the all-out Republican assault on healthcare in the U.S., people will die,” Jeffries said.

“I never thought that I'd be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene,” he added.

House Republicans muscled the “big, beautiful bill” through a procedural hurdle on the floor overnight Thursday, voting 219 to 213 to adopt the rule, with one Republican joining all Democrats to vote against the procedural measure. The sole dissenter was Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA).

The rule vote was dramatic, starting at 9:33 p.m. on Wednesday and lasting until 3:24 a.m. Thursday. During the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) called into Sean Hannity's show on Fox News to say the floor will stay open until he can flip the votes needed. “I'll keep it open as long as it takes,” Johnson said.

Jeffries accused the GOP of jamming the bill through “every step of this journey” as it rushed to meet the self-imposed deadline of July 4.

“If Republicans were so proud of this one big, ugly bill, why did debate begin at 3:28 in the morning?” Jeffries asked. 

Concerns surrounding Medicaid have cropped up throughout the GOP's budget reconciliation process, which has taken place over the last several months and includes cuts in funding as part of Republicans' effort to offset spending to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent. 

“I rise today in strong opposition to Donald Trump's one big, ugly bill,” Jeffries said. “This disgusting abomination, the GOP tax scam that guts Medicaid, rips food from the mouths of children, seniors, and veterans and rewards billionaires with massive tax breaks.”

REPUBLICAN ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' CLEARS HOUSE HURDLE, SETS UP FINAL PASSAGE

Democratic leadership in the House has searched for ways to counter the trifecta in Washington, with Medicaid being a unifying area of messaging in the 119th Congress. 

The massive tax and spending bill includes Medicaid work requirements for single, able-bodied adults.

During his speech, Jeffries called the work requirements within the bill a “smokescreen,” claiming that the provision is a “paperwork” requirement.

Beyond Medicaid, the legislation cuts into Planned Parenthood by stopping Medicaid funds from being allowed to reimburse health clinics that provide abortions, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, would be cut through work requirements and other eligibility changes.

It also includes a phase-out of green energy credits passed under Biden's administration.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon don't speak for Trump or his base. So why do people think they do?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

To hear Tucker Carlson tell it, an American attack on Iran wasn't just likely to precipitate World War III. It would do something worse: destroy Donald Trump's presidency. “A strike on the Iranian nuclear sites will almost certainly result in thousands of American deaths at bases throughout the Middle East, and cost the United States tens of billions of dollars,” the conservative commentator wrote on X on March 17. “Trump ran for president as a peace candidate,” Carlson added on June 4. “It's why he won. A war with Iran would amount to a profound betrayal of his supporters. It would end his presidency.”

“We can't do this again, we'll tear the country apart,” declared Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist and 2016-campaign CEO, when asked on June 18 about potential war with Iran. “Worth noting how rare this crossover actually is,” observed Curt Mills, the anti-war executive director of The American Conservative, after Carlson joined Bannon's podcast to oppose American intervention, dubbing the pair the “two largest intellectual architects of the Trump years other than the president.” The implication: Trump was risking his base if he didn't stay out of the Israel-Iran conflict. “I'm very concerned based on every[thing] I've seen in the grassroots the last few months that this will cause a massive schism in MAGA,” wrote Charlie Kirk, the head of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. “This is a White House that is responding in real time to its coalition,” which is “revolting to show it's disgusted with the potential of war with Iran,” Mills told ABC News on June 21. That night, Trump bombed Iran.

The U.S. strike may or may not have obliterated the country's nuclear facilities, but it has certainly obliterated the notion that any of the self-proclaimed MAGA intellectuals, such as Carlson and Bannon, speak for the Trump movement. Far from shattering the president's coalition, Trump's strike on Iran brought it together, despite the loud protestations of some of its supposed elites. “This is Donald Trump's Republican Party,” CNN's chief data analyst, Harry Enten, said three days after the attack on Iran, referring to polls showing that 76 percent of GOP voters approved of Trump's action, compared with just 18 percent who didn't. “Republicans are with Donald Trump on this, Tucker Carlson be darned. The bottom line is he does not speak for the majority of the Republican base.”

Robert Kagan: American democracy might not survive war with Iran

The conservative pollster Patrick Ruffini, whose 2023 book, Party of the People, predicted the shape of Trump's victorious 2024 coalition, offered a similar conclusion. “Polling has been consistent that Republicans remain more committed to a posture of military strength—and MAGA Republicans more so, not less so, than other Republicans,” he told The Dispatch. Indeed, surveys before and after the attack found that self-described “MAGA Republicans” were more likely than other Republicans to back the president on Iran. In other words, Trump's decision to strike the country's nuclear sites didn't just expose the Iranian regime's empty threats of massive retaliation. It also exposed prominent commentators who have postured as tribunes of Trumpism to be pretenders to power, purporting to speak for a movement that has little interest in their ideas.

Watching the president dispense with his critics, the conservative influencer John Ekdahl quipped, “Props to President Trump for being able to manage a two front war against Iran and Tucker Carlson.” But neither of these was ever much of a contest. Few jobs in Trump world are more farcical than the position of “architect” of “America First”: There are no MAGA intellectuals, just Trump and opportunistic ideologues attempting to hitch their pet projects to his brand. The self-styled thought leaders of the Trump movement are merely political entrepreneurs trying to appropriate the president for their own purposes and to recast his chaotic and idiosyncratic decisions as reflections of their personal worldview.

“Considering that I'm the one that developed ‘America First,' and considering that the term wasn't used until I came along, I think I'm the one that decides” what it means, Trump told my colleague Michael Scherer a week before the bombs dropped. The president was wrong about being the first to claim the mantle of “America First,” but right about everything else. “Trumpism” is not “anti-war” or “pro-worker,” “neoconservative” or “neo-isolationist,” or any other ideologically coherent category; it is whatever Trump says it is.

This has always been the case, notwithstanding the pretenses of Trump's alleged intellectual allies. Back in 2017, Trump took office for the first time and brought along Bannon, who set up shop in the West Wing with a whiteboard full of goals for the new administration. Less than seven months later, however, Bannon was cast out of the White House. Not long after, Trump began publicly deriding him as “Sloppy Steve.”

Carlson has followed the same trajectory. The conservative podcast host spoke before Trump on the final night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and was seen as one of the big winners when the president returned to power. But again, Trump quickly tired of his ally's antics. “I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,” the president said in response to the commentator's criticism of his Iran policy. “Let him go get a television network and say it so people actually listen,” he added—a reference to Carlson being fired from Fox News. Trump then mocked his longtime associate as “kooky Tucker Carlson” on Truth Social, and later claimed that Carlson called to apologize, something the latter has not denied, because whether it happened or not, he knows exactly where he stands.

The simple truth is this: There is Bannonism and Tuckerism, and perhaps, in a quiet corner of the Naval Observatory that has been repeatedly swept for bugs to ensure that the boss isn't listening, J. D. Vance–ism. But there is no Trumpism without Trump. People in the president's orbit are not his confidants—they are his chumps, to be used or discarded when doing so suits the principal's purposes.

Carlson seemingly knows this—and resents it. “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,” he texted his producer after the president lost reelection in 2020. “I truly can't wait.” After the January 6 riot, Carlson texted: “He's a demonic force, a destroyer. But he's not going to destroy us. I've been thinking about this every day for four years.” Off the record, people like Carlson not only know that they do not represent Trump, but hold him in contempt. Why, then, do so many still take them seriously as reflections of the president's perspective and coalition? And why does the myth of the Trump whisperer persist despite its manifest failure to explain events?

For enterprising conservatives, the utility is clear. Trump may not subscribe to any of their ideas, but he can be prodded to act on them, and in any case, he is 79 years old and serving his second term. Once he departs the scene, his base will be up for grabs among those who have managed to position themselves as its champions.

For some anti-Trump liberals, people like Bannon, Carlson, and Vance provide a perverse sort of reassurance. Trump's opponents may find the ideologies of these men to be odious, but at least they suggest a method to the president's madness. The presence of even a rough philosophical framework provides the false hope that what Trump will do next will be predictable and follow from first principles, rather than from haphazard impulse. Better, some may feel, to live in the realm of an evil but explicable king than in that of a demented one.

Read: The MAGA coalition has turned on itself

Finally, Bannon and later Carlson may have played into the media's desire for an intellectual from their own class who could domesticate and interpret Trumpism in conventional terms. Rather than a boorish outsider winning the presidency on his own scattershot instincts, one could suppose there was a Svengali behind the scenes who had masterminded the whole affair. This belief imposed order on what appeared to be chaos, imputed logic to what otherwise looked like a personality cult, and thus rescued the prognosticating profession from a situation where its skills might no longer be of use.

The only problem with this arrangement was that the pro-Trump intellectuals and influencers were making it all up. They were the political equivalent of the Wizard of Oz, shadows behind a curtain trying to fool people into thinking that they spoke for the president and his movement. But like Oz's projection, they were nothing more than an intimidating illusion. All it took to make them disappear was for Trump to turn on the lights.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

On finding the line between ogling and empathizing

This is an edition of Time-Travel Thursdays, a journey through The Atlantic's archives to contextualize the present. Sign up here.

The writers of The Atlantic have a long history of fretting about the youths.

Take one 1925 article, which began with a call for reason: a promise to judge fairly whether modern young adults were truly as delinquent as everyone seemed to be saying. “They are under suspicion on the counts of, briefly, dancing, drinking, kissing, motoring alone and often at night (‘alone' means two together),” the author, identified only as “A Professor,” declared. “In the case of girls, dress is included, or rather, going about with legs and arms bared.”

Of the drinking charge, young people seemed to be absolved. Certainly they were imbibing, but less than their elders—and they'd developed new etiquette to keep things under control. (“A really nice girl may drink cocktails in public,” the writer explained, “but not whiskey and soda.”) On the other counts, unfortunately, the Professor didn't let them off so easily: “Legs are no more interesting than noses” when young ladies wear skirts this short. “The sad truth is that the human frame has ceased to be romantic.” Oh, and this new generation, in addition to diluting sex appeal, reportedly lacked intellectual curiosity. Also emotion: “There seems no doubt that these young things feel less, on the whole, and do more, than once did we.”

That was just one story in a whole canon of writing, published here and elsewhere, that has professed concern for young people—but with an undercurrent of condescension, even disdain. In a 1975 classic of the genre, the conservative journalist Midge Decter described the young hippies around her as coddled to the point of incompetence, having used the idea of a countercultural movement to get away with doing nothing much at all. “Heaped with largesse both of the pocketbook and of the spirit,” she wrote, “the children yet cannot find themselves.”

All those writers who peer at the youths, squinting through their binoculars and scribbling in their notepads, make up an embarrassing lineage. Recently, I've been wondering if I'm part of it. I write fairly often about Gen Z, sometimes worriedly—but I'm a Millennial. I didn't have iPads around when I was a child; I wasn't scrolling on Instagram in middle school. I'd already graduated college and made new friends in a new city when the pandemic hit. I'm still examining contemporary young adulthood from the inside, I've told myself. But a few days ago, I turned 30. Technically, I'm in a new life phase now: “established adulthood.”

Where's the line between ogling and empathizing? And how do you describe trends—which are broad by definition—without using too broad a brush? The young people of the 1970s arguably were, on the whole, more interested in challenging norms than their parent's generation had been; that seems worth documenting. Any dysfunction that came along with that may have been worth noting too. (Joan Didion clearly thought so.) Likewise, the Professor wasn't wrong that social mores were transforming with each successive generation. Legs were becoming more like noses, and that's the honest truth.

The task, I think, is to write with humility and nuance—to cast young adults not as hopelessly lost or uniquely brilliant and heroic, but just as people, dealing with the particular challenges and opportunities of their day. In 1972, The Atlantic published a letter from a father who jokingly wondered how the youths described in the papers could possibly be the same species as his children. “Not long ago the president of Yale University said in the press that when the young are silent it means they are feeling ‘a monumental scorn' for political hypocrisy,” he wrote. “When my son, Willard, Jr., is silent, I am never sure what it means, but I believe that he has his mind considerably on sexual matters and on methods of developing the flexor muscles of his upper arms.” Readers have always been able to tell the difference between real curiosity and zoological scrutinizing. They know when a stereotype rings hollow.

Just rifle through the five pages of responses to Decter's story, which The Atlantic published with headlines such as “Sentimental Kitsch,” “Hideous Clichés,” and—my personal favorite—“Boring and Irrelevant.” One reader told Decter, with bite, not to worry so much about those wild children who weren't settling down in their jobs and houses like good boys and girls. “Rest assured,” he wrote, “my generation will be like hers—led by the silent, nervous superachievers, intent on their material goal, lacking the time to question the madness of their method.”

The characterization is cutting. But that letter also raises another good point: Young people are not immune to oversimplifying, either. They'll eventually get old enough to write about their elders, and to include their own sweeping generalizations and nuggets of truth. “I wonder what will be written in 1995 about our children. I get the feeling we will make the same mistakes,” another reader wrote to Decter. “For isn't that the American way?”

To feel good, do good.

I do a lot of public speaking for business leaders about how using the science of happiness can improve their organization and make life easier for everyone. But there's one question I get very frequently: “What about when I have to do hard things that make people unhappy?” For example: having to fire someone, or asking people to make sacrifices. How do I think about this common scenario?

This quandary is as old as time, and no one addressed it better than Marcus Tullius Cicero, the Roman philosopher and statesman who lived more than two millennia ago. For much of his career, Cicero lived a comfortable, uncontentious life of the mind, respected by all. But after Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 B.C.E., he felt a civic duty to speak out about a threat to the republic in the person of Mark Antony, who was vying for power. Cicero denounced Antony as a tyrant in a series of speeches called the Philippics. It was a risky move, one that made a powerful enemy, but Cicero honestly believed that by doing the right thing as he understood it, he was making no sacrifice at all.

In a book written around the same time as the Philippics, titled De Officiis (“On Duties”), Cicero explained exactly why he believed that doing what is difficult but morally correct is also what most reliably and enduringly brings the rewards we seek in life. Despite our flawed instinct to take the path of least resistance, he reasoned, we will always be better served by choosing to do the right thing. In this masterwork, Cicero created a guide for how to have a successful life through honorable behavior. Take that to heart, and you have a guide for living a happier life as well.

From the September 1865 issue: Life and times of Marcus Tullius Cicero

De Officiis was written in the form of a very long public letter to Cicero's son, Cicero Minor, who was a philosophy student in Athens at the time. College life then being not so different from what it is today, he appears to have sorely needed advice on his duties. According to what the philosopher Seneca wrote some years later, the young man “was not gifted with a good memory, and drunkenness was gradually destroying any that he had.”

Cicero's book is in three parts, beginning with a study of what is honorable in life. He asserts that “all that is morally right rises from some one of four sources,” which he lists as truth, justice, nobility, and moderation. These are, essentially, a variation of Plato's four cardinal virtues of wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance, and Cicero argues that these traits are the foundation for a life of integrity and rectitude.

His letter offers limited encouragement to people who write advice columns. Modern research demonstrates that virtues are indeed most effectively transmitted by parents and peers, whereas outside interventions to teach virtue show only modest effectiveness. But as far as paternal influence goes, the book perhaps had some effect: Though Cicero Minor did not enjoy the illustrious career that his father did, he went on to hold a series of official positions in the Roman Republic.

The second part of De Officiis discusses the worldly rewards people naturally want. Cicero focuses on honor, wealth, and power—prizes bound up with a desire for status that is encoded in our genes. As evolutionary biologists have long argued, these rewards correlate with both reproductive success and resource acquisition. Our ancestors' drive to succeed has surely passed on to us a craving to be superior to others in money, power, and prestige. Cicero acknowledges this reality, but notes that there are morally better and worse ways to acquire these rewards. Less honorable ways include disloyalty toward others and dishonesty in our dealings. The morally superior means for doing so include generosity, courtesy, and excellence—the virtues from part one, above.

Part three of De Officiis is the most important because he argues that the honorable route to worldly rewards is also the most expedient and effective way to get them and keep them. In other words, there is no conflict between doing well and doing good. Back in part two, he realizes that people tend not to believe this, because they operate on the zero-sum assumption that someone must “take something from his neighbour” and so “profit by his neighbour's loss.” But in part three, Cicero rejects this completely. “For a man to take something from his neighbour and to profit by his neighbour's loss is more contrary to Nature than is death or poverty or pain or anything else that can affect either our person or our property.”

Cicero makes three arguments to bolster his claim that virtue is more profitable than vice. First, using Stoic reasoning, to behave unethically degrades your character, making any success that you realize not worth having. Second, any short-term gain by taking advantage of others will harm your reputation and therefore your long-term worldly success. Third, to use a not very Roman word, karma. Bad behavior, Cicero believed, disrupts the universe's natural harmony, with negative consequences for the perpetrator.

Arthur C. Brooks: How my struggle with Wittgenstein can make you happier

Cicero's argument—that lasting worldly success is not possible without virtue—can apply to happiness as well. In an effort to raise their well-being, at least temporarily, people constantly engage in behaviors they may not be proud of. People may cheat on their spouse for a thrill or to feel romantic love again. They may steal for an easy gain or lie for personal advantage. They may act selfishly by looking after their own interests and ignoring other people's.

Few of us would brag about being disloyal, dishonest, or selfish. As Cicero notes, people act in these ways because they evidently believe that happiness in life “will assuredly clash with moral rectitude.” People think that you can't always feel good by being good, so you may have to sacrifice the former for the latter. Predictably, Cicero says this is bunk—a “sorry state of servitude” and mere “pandering to sensual pleasure.”

By the same logic that the exercise of virtue ultimately delivers worldly success, Cicero believed it also brings true happiness. Modern social science shows that he was spot-on. For example, a happy marriage is not simply linked to conjugal fidelity; that loyalty is itself a central ingredient in marital contentment. Similarly, honesty in one's personal dealings reliably raises life satisfaction. And generous behavior has been found again and again to increase happiness. In the long run, then, the best way to feel good is to do good, despite any temptation to cut corners.

This dictum offers a reassuringly simple formula for a happier life. That doesn't mean it will always be easy to follow, but instead of asking, “What will make me happy right now?,” consider how to answer the question “What is the virtuous path in this situation?” That correct path may involve tough decisions, but it will ultimately lead you to the greatest happiness in life.

Arthur C. Brooks: The key to critical self-awareness

To return to the leader's quandary I began with: How should we think about a situation when, in acting properly, we inflict unhappiness? Cicero's answer was unambiguous: Do your duty—even when doing so may harm your own and others' short-term happiness.

In Cicero's case, this was not hypothetical. Mark Antony came to power in a three-man dictatorship and sought to eliminate all of the dictators' opponents, starting with Cicero. With a warrant out for his execution, Cicero attempted to flee his villa for Macedonia, but was captured by Roman soldiers. As legend has it, seeing that the arrestee was the famous, noble Cicero, a tribune named Popillius hesitated in carrying out the execution. Cicero, the man of honor, did not plead for his life, but rather schooled the centurion on his duty: “Approach, veteran soldier,” he said, “and, if you can at least do so much properly, sever this neck.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Republicans are at varying levels of misleading, avoidance, or denial about this.

A strange thing happened on the way to Republicans' passage of their big Medicaid-cutting bill: We learned that President Donald Trump seems unaware the bill will cut Medicaid.

Trying to line up support for the bill in a private call Wednesday with House Republicans, Trump offered his advice that, if they want to win elections, they shouldn't touch Medicare or Social Security — or Medicaid. His comments were reported by Riley Rogerson and Reese Gorman of NOTUS.

This is a bizarre thing to say, because Medicaid is the single program being cut the most in the bill. Estimates suggest that its spending could end up cut by as much as 18 percent, causing about 8 million people to lose Medicaid coverage.

And this isn't a one-off thing. For months, Trump has publicly promised to protect Medicaid, and reports have described him as queasy about Congress's plans to do otherwise. 

This puts Vice President JD Vance, who has talked a big game about changing the GOP to appeal more to low-income voters, in an awkward place. On X this week, he attempted to change the subject from the bill's Medicaid cuts, arguing they were “immaterial” and “minutiae” compared to the immigration enforcement money that really matters.

Privately, many Republicans know differently. “Group texts are blowing up and frantic phone calls are being exchanged among GOP lawmakers alarmed about the Senate Medicaid provisions,” Politico reported this week.

It would be no surprise if Trump and Republicans misled about these cuts in public — GOP officials have been claiming that the Medicaid cuts are purely about limiting waste, fraud, and abuse. But the fact that Trump misstated this so blithely in private, to a friendly audience, is more strange. It suggests he truly is unaware what his “big, beautiful bill” will do.

To at least try to understand what's going on here, it's worth grappling with why this bill cuts Medicaid in the first place.

Trump's priorities for his bill were tax cuts, immigration enforcement money, and raising the debt ceiling. This is all very expensive, and most of it will just add to the debt. 

But conservatives in the House insisted that at least some spending cuts had to be included, to partially offset the bill's cost. So GOP leaders searched for cuts that would be sizable — in the hundreds of billions of dollars range. Joe Biden's clean energy subsidies were one obvious target. 

It's hard, though, to come up with big cuts that aren't politically toxic. As budget wonks know, the real money in the federal budget is in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and defense. Trump had no desire to cut defense, and the Trump-era GOP has deemed the senior-focused Social Security and Medicare politically untouchable.

Medicaid, aimed at low-income people, is a different story. Conservatives have long viewed it, along with food stamps and welfare, with suspicion, arguing that government benefits like these disincentivize work and get exploited by the lazy and undeserving. Medicaid beneficiaries are also believed to be less likely to turn out at the polls. 

These longstanding conservative arguments have been slow to adjust to the news that Medicaid recipients have been an increasing share of the Trump coalition, as he's helped the GOP gain among low-income voters. Many low-income whites in rural areas are on Medicaid, as are low-income Latinos in areas where Trump has done well, such as California's Central Valley.

That dissuaded congressional Republicans from even more extreme Medicaid cuts some had wanted — but they still hit the program hard. The Medicaid cuts that made it into the bill were, however, crafted in roundabout ways that Republicans argued were just aimed at waste, fraud, and abuse. 

These included new work reporting requirements. In theory, a requirement to document your working hours in exchange for coverage may not sound like a cut; in practice, the process will likely be arduous and error-filled and result in many working people losing coverage. 

The bill also limits the “provider tax” states may change — a key way many states help finance Medicaid, since provider taxes are reimbursed with federal matching funds — among other changes. 

All that added up to hundreds of billions in savings, on paper. But behind those savings is 8 million people losing their Medicaid coverage, as well as a potentially devastating impact on rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid payments.

Trump may not be aware of this, but many in the party are — that's why they set the most painful Medicaid cuts to happen only after the 2026 midterms. And eventually, many Medicaid recipients will feel the pain, too.

The public tends to dislike big budget bills, and the way they're passed.

It cuts taxes, slashes the safety net, funds deportations, harms the clean energy industry, and sends the debt soaring.

The $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts will be felt by all Americans.

California Democrats finally stopped outsourcing their policy judgment to their favorite lobbies.

Despite the Democratic nominee for NYC mayor being labeled a communist, his agenda actually promises something much more ideologically modest.

Republicans have just passed President Donald Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, which will cut taxes, slash programs for low-income Americans, ramp up funding for mass deportation, and penalize the solar and wind energy industries.

Oh, and it adds enormously to the nation's debt — but who's counting? (Independent analysts are, and they estimate it will add at least $3 trillion.)

The sprawling, 887-page bill, which Trump is expected to sign into law Friday, contains far too many provisions to name here. But to get a better sense of the bill's impact, it's worth running down what it does in a few key areas. 

The big picture, though, is that Trump is targeting Democratic or liberal-coded programs and constituencies — programs for the poor, student borrowers, and climate change — to cover part (but nowhere near all) of the cost of his big tax cuts and new spending.

The bill makes a variety of changes to tax law, some of which are about keeping tax breaks set to expire soon, others of which are adding new goodies in the tax code.

1) Making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent: In Trump's first term, Republicans lowered income and other tax rates with his 2017 tax law. However, in a gimmick to make that law look less costly, the new lower rates they set were scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 — meaning that, if Congress did nothing, practically everyone's taxes would go up next year.

So the single most consequential thing this bill does, from a budgetary perspective, is making those 2017 tax levels permanent, averting their imminent expiration. 

That saves Americans from an imminent tax hike, but notably, it just keeps the status quo tax levels in place. So, in practice, many people may not perceive this as a new cut to their taxes.

2) New “populist” tax cuts: The bill also creates several new tax breaks meant to fulfill certain Trump 2024 campaign promises, such as “no tax on tips.” There will be new deductions for up to $25,000 in tip income, $12,500 in overtime income, $6,000 for seniors, and a deduction for interest on loans for new US-made cars. The bill also creates savings accounts for children called “Trump accounts,” in which the government would invest $1,000 per child.

3) Tax cuts for the wealthy and businesses: Wealthy Americans wanting to pay less in taxes have the most to be happy about from this bill, because they benefit hugely from making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. 

Other wealthy winners in the bill include owners of “pass-through” businesses (partnerships, LLCs, or other business entities that don't pay the typical corporate income tax); they get their tax cuts in Trump's 2017 bill made permanent. Some wealthy heirs stand to gain too, as the exemption from the estate tax was raised to inherited estates worth $15 million).

Affluent blue state residents got a big win. The 2017 Trump tax law had sharply limited a deduction that typically benefited them — the state and local (SALT) deduction, which it capped at $10,000. (People in blue states tend to have more state and local taxes they can deduct.) The new bill raises that limit to $40,000.

Businesses also get some big benefits, as the bill makes three major corporate tax breaks permanent: bonus depreciation, research and development expensing, and a tax break related to interest deduction. 

All this, combined with the cuts for programs for poor people, is why many analysts calculate the impact this bill would be regressive overall — it will end up financially harming low-income Americans, and benefiting the rich the most.

Trump has repeatedly promised that he wouldn't cut Medicaid, and this bill breaks that promise bigly. Its new work reporting requirements and other changes (such as a limit to the “provider tax” states may charge) could end up cutting Medicaid spending by as much as 18 percent. The bill also makes changes to the Affordable Care Act individual insurance marketplaces. Altogether, these provisions would result in 12 million people losing their health insurance, per the Congressional Budget Office.

Food stamps are another target. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could be cut by as much as 20 percent, due to new work requirements and new requirements states pay a higher share of the program's cost. One bizarre last-minute provision, aimed at winning over swing vote Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), seemingly gives states an incentive to make erroneous payments, because states with higher payment error rates get to delay their cost hikes.

Student loans also come in for deep cuts, as the bill overhauls the existing system, ending many repayment plans, requiring borrowers to repay more, and limiting future loan availability. 

Three years ago, with the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats enacted a swath of new incentives aimed at making the US a clean energy powerhouse. Trump's new bill moves in the exact opposite direction. It repeals many of Biden's clean energy benefits, but it doesn't stop there – it goes further by singling out clean energy, particularly solar and wind, for harsh treatment.

Under the bill, new Biden-era tax credits for electric vehicles and energy efficiency will be terminated this year. Biden's clean electricity production tax credits, meanwhile, will be gradually rolled back, though solar and wind will see their credits vanish more quickly. The bill also requires clean power projects to start using fewer and fewer Chinese-made components, which much of the industry heavily relies on. 

Things could be worse, though. A recent draft of the bill included far harsher policies toward solar and wind, which could have had truly apocalyptic consequences for the industry — but some of them were dropped or watered down to get the bill through the Senate.

Counterbalancing some of these spending cuts on the safety net and clean energy, Trump's bill also spends a bunch more money on two of his own top priorities: immigration enforcement in the military.

About $175 billion will be devoted to immigration, including roughly $50 billion for Trump's border wall and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, $45 billion for expanding the capacity to detain unauthorized immigrants, and $30 billion for enforcement operations. This is a lot of money that will now be devoted to Trump's “mass deportation” agenda, and the question will now be whether they can put it to use.

The military, meanwhile, will get about $150 billion from the bill, to be used to start construction on Trump's planned “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, as well as on shipbuilding, munitions, and other military priorities.

In the end, Trump's spending cuts were nowhere near enough to balance out the enormous cost of the tax cuts in this bill. So, estimates suggest, at least $3 trillion more will be added to the debt if this bill becomes law.

Every president this century has come in with big deficit-increasing bills, dismissing concerns about the debt, and the sky hasn't yet fallen. But all these years of big spending are adding up, and interest payments on the debt are rising. This could make for a significant drag on the economy in future years and make even more painful cuts necessary.

Republicans are betting that the tax cuts in this bill will juice business and economic activity enough to keep the country happy in the short term — and that the cuts, targeting mainly low-income people or Democratic constituencies, are unlikely to hurt them too much at the ballot box.

A Columbia grad who was one of Google's youngest engineers and a serial entrepreneur who built hundreds of homes starting at age 16 have their sights set on disrupting the construction industry with AI.

Roop Pal and Puneet Sukhija launched construction startup Bild AI in February and on Thursday announced a $3.1 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Mission Street Capital, Ryan Sutton-Gee, and Ooshma Garg.

Bild uses AI to read blueprints and estimate the materials and costs associated with a project. This is currently a timely and error-prone process done by hand, Pal said.

The company, which consists of just Pal and Sukhija, will use its seed to hire engineers aggressively in order to expand its technology, Pal told BI.

The duo came up with the idea for Bild at a Hack for Social Impact event in San Francisco, and were accepted into Y Combinator within days of meeting.

""I was really mostly keen on the issue of affordable housing,"" Pal, who also previously worked at Waymo, told BI. ""There's an opportunity to apply my knowledge in computer vision and AI to really make an impact.""

The startup's early clients are material suppliers in the framing, flooring, and door businesses, predominantly for multifamily residences. The company makes money by charging subscription fees.

By cutting down on presconstruction costs, Pal said Bild could also spell savings for renters. ""If you have elastic housing markets,"" he said, ""this cost passes through and people save on rent.""

Material analysis is just the first layer of Bild's vision, as it incorporates new sub-trades — such as windows and roofing — one by one.

As its blueprint-reading technology becomes more sophisticated, it will ultimately be used in the permitting process, Pal said, to catch compliance issues and cut down on the costly and bureaucratic back-and-forth for residential and non-residential projects alike.

""If you reduce 1% of the cost of a hospital, that's another hospital that we have budget to build,"" he said. ""It can really make a big difference broadly.""

In addition to Bild, AI is also infiltrating other aspects of the construction industry, with firms like Shawmut and Suffolk relying on the technology to shore up worker safety.

Charlize Theron, 49, has zero regrets about doing motherhood solo.

During an appearance on Wednesday's episode of ""Call Her Daddy,"" Theron spoke about her life as a single mother of two. She adopted her daughters Jackson and August in 2012 and 2015, respectively.

The ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" actor told podcast host Alex Cooper that her parents' relationship was a ""cautionary tale"" that helped her realize she didn't want to be in one. Theron was 15 when she witnessed her mother fatally shoot her alcoholic father in self-defense.

Theron said it was a ""layered and complicated"" decision driven by two factors: not wanting what her parents had and recognizing that she ""did not have the capability of being healthy in a relationship.""

""Those two things I had to acknowledge when I decided to be a parent, and I think it's probably one of the healthiest decisions I ever made,"" she said.

However, she acknowledges that there's still a stigma being placed on women who choose to be single.

""With women, it's always like, something must be wrong with her. She can't keep a man. And it's never part of the discussion of like, 'Wow, she's really living her truth. She's living in her happiness. This is actually a choice that she made,'"" Theron said.

""I want to look at them, and just be like, 'Do you know how fucking great it is to live exactly how I want to live?' To experience motherhood exactly how I wanted to experience it,"" she added.

Theron says some people might question whether her decision was fair to her children, but in the end, only they can speak to their own experience.

""I can only tell you that this is the best way that I know how to be a mother to them,"" she said.

""I love every single day of it. I love that I don't have to share them with somebody. I love that I don't have to run every fucking thing by a guy,"" she added.

Theron said she ""broke the cycle"" by knowing exactly what she didn't want in a relationship and what she had to offer.

""And who I am at the time that I wanted to be a parent was not somebody who should be having kids with another person,"" Theron said.

Theron isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about being a single parent.

Lucy Liu told The Cut in 2023 that the decision to have a child in her late 40s via surrogacy — as a single woman — was largely unplanned. ""I didn't do a lot of research, I just pulled the trigger,"" Liu said.

In a March interview with Parade, Connie Britton — who adopted her son from Ethiopia as a single woman at 45 — said she always wanted to be a mother.

""I knew that I hadn't achieved the kind of partnership that I was looking for to have a spouse and a child together. And so I thought, 'This is the time, I'm going to start the adoption process,'"" Britton said.

A representative for Theron did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill is one step closer to becoming law — and reshaping policy from Medicaid to taxes.

The House passed the massive spending bill on Thursday afternoon in a 218-214 vote.

Every Democrat voted against the bill, along with two Republicans: Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.

The final passage came after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke for roughly eight hours and 45 minutes in opposition to the bill, breaking the record for the longest House floor speech in American history.

The bill now heads to Trump's desk for signing, which could happen as soon as Friday, July 4.

The bill underwent a number of changes since the House passed an initial version in May. That included the eventual removal of a provision aimed at preventing states from regulating AI for 10 years. The bill passed the upper chamber on Tuesday, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote after three GOP senators opposed it.

The bill will have a sweeping impact on Americans' wallets and the country's fiscal health. In addition to extending the 2017 tax cuts, making cuts to Medicaid, and repealing student loan forgiveness, the bill is also expected to add trillions to the deficit over the next ten years.

In May, Moody's Analytics downgraded the US's credit rating, citing rising federal debt. This could lead to higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, and more down the road.

Republicans passed the bill despite vehement opposition from Elon Musk, the former face of DOGE.

Musk had criticized the bill's impact on the deficit and its phase-out of green energy tax credits, some of which benefit Tesla. That led to his epic feud with Trump, which remains ongoing to this day.

On Monday, Musk vowed to support primary challengers against any Republicans who supported the bill and said that if it passed, he would form a new political party, called the America Party.

Republicans have largely brushed all of that off.

""Similar threats have been made before, and I'm unsure if anything's come of those threats,"" Rep. Brian Jack of Georgia told BI on Wednesday.

This legislation promises to become a poster child of Congress working against the country's interests and in stubborn opposition to economists' advice.

What have they done?

Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and is sending it to President Donald Trump for his signature so it can become law. Any hope that enough Republicans would have the courage to put the needs of the economy and America's fiscal position before tax cuts for the richBloomberg Terminal was met instead with callow cost fiddling.

The damage this bill will inflict has been laid bare by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office in its estimates for how much it will add to the country's already bulging debt and deficit while exposing the accounting gimmickry underpinning Republican forecasts. It's important to know that the methods used by the CBO for estimating the cost of any policy needs a counterfactual to compare against. It has always used the laws currently in force, such that a bill's cost equals revenue and spending under the current law less the revenue and spending under the proposed law. But Republicans say current law (which has the 2017 tax cuts expire) isn't right, current policy (in which the 2017 tax cuts are in place) is. And with that, the trillions of dollars the CBO says the bill would add to deficits in coming years just… disappeared!","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

What if you could use your Bitcoin (BTC) to buy a house, fund a child's education or invest in a new business, without ever selling it? 

In the latest episode of the Clear Crypto Podcast, the CEO of Lever, Jullian Duran, makes the case for a new kind of financial firepower; using Bitcoin not to cash out, but to unlock opportunity.

Duran, who previously worked at Bridgewater and Marathon Digital, said his mission is rooted in personal experience and in the unrealized potential of Bitcoin-rich users who find themselves asset-rich but liquidity-poor.

The idea behind Lever, according to Duran, is that Bitcoin is turned into “pristine collateral” that opens doors in the real world, especially in industries and communities that have been historically underinvested.

“The idea is to have your foot in a lot of different places at once,” Duran said. “There's a run on Bitcoin? You're protected. There's a run on real-world industries? You're protected.”

Unlike speculative DeFi protocols or meme tokens, Lever is designed to generate returns from what Duran calls “boring industries,” otherwise known as sectors like utilities, housing and infrastructure. These sectors, he argues, offer dollar-based yields that are uncorrelated with crypto markets.

And for many Bitcoin OGs, that flexibility is more than financial. It's personal.

“I was at a Bitcoin billionaires party in Puerto Rico... an OG looked at this mansion and said, ‘I could afford this, but I'd have to sell Bitcoin,'” Duran recalled. “That scene replays in my head. You have here somebody who is a multi-millionaire, but who really can't use that to just live life ambitiously.”

According to Duran, that's what he's seeking to solve. “Firepower, it's an exercise of freedom,” he said.

 Bitcoin charts show bearish divergences across multiple timeframes, a hint that price rallies above $110,000 could be a trap. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin shows bearish divergences on multiple time frames, signaling weak bullish momentum and a potential pullback.

Some traders anticipate a rally above $112,000, but increasing sell pressure and liquidity sweeps suggest the breakouts are traps.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied to $110,500 on Thursday, but the cryptocurrency is encountering a ceiling as multiple bearish divergences flash across different timeframes. 

On the 15-minute, one-hour, and four-hour charts, technical analysts have flagged divergence signals, where the price continues to rise while momentum indicators, such as the relative strength index trend lower. This suggests a weakening bullish drive, raising the risk of a near-term pullback.

Zooming out to the one-day chart reinforces the cautious outlook. In May, a clear bearish divergence emerged between price and momentum indicators, aligning with Bitcoin's all-time high of $111,800. Although BTC briefly dipped below $100,000 since then, the divergence remains intact, suggesting that underlying bearish pressure could still exert influence. The immediate target below remains between $107,500 and $106,000.

This bearish bias was reinforced after Friday's US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which came in hotter than expected. While the labor report initially helped push BTC toward $110,000, bulls failed to maintain that breakout. The rejection at this key psychological level may signal exhaustion at the current range highs.

Interestingly, funding rates remain neutral. In an X post, Vetle Lunde of K33 Research pointed out that the perpetual futures funding rate remains flat even with BTC brushing against its all-time high range. This lack of aggressive long positioning shows traders may not be fully convinced of a sustained breakout, which aligns with the current technical divergences.

As Bitcoin consolidates just below the $110,000 level, traders remain split on the next big move. 

Pseudonymous trader Byzantine General shared a chart noting that Bitcoin may be coiling for a $112,000 break based on futures data. The setup suggests open interest breaking out with the price, which historically has led to a higher target. 

While market order books are beginning to reflect increased sell pressure. A cluster of high-taker sell volume appeared around the $110,000 zone, typically a sign that investors could be closing positions at resistance. This aligns with recent behavior near previous all-time highs, where rejection zones often draw liquidity for exits.

Meanwhile, trader KillaXBT pointed out that Bitcoin has been executing liquidity sweeps above resistance levels and below supports, only to reverse swiftly. These fakeouts are often designed to flush out leveraged positions before a real directional move unfolds.

When Vitalik Buterin speaks, the blockchain world listens. This time, he didn't unveil a new protocol nor announce a technological revolution. No, what he raised at ETHCC 2025 was an existential doubt. A red alert. Web3, meant to free us from the chains of centralized institutions, seems to be replicating their flaws. And Ethereum, the flagship of the crypto world, could well become an empty shell if its founding principles are forgotten.

In a packed room at the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, Vitalik Buterin, true to his stripped-down style, set a stark scene: Web3 is at a tipping point. It is no longer enough to wave the word “decentralization” as a banner to claim it. Resilience must be proven.

Here are the three tests every crypto project should pass:

These criteria are not theoretical. They aim to uncover flaws in L2s that can be updated with a click, or in app interfaces that give users an illusion of control while keeping the keys to the house.

If we lose this, Ethereum will just become a generational phenomenon, disappearing like many others.

Vitalik Buterin didn't stop at a technical audit. He also offered a historical interpretation of the moment. For him, the crypto world has left the artisanal era. Gone are the “geeks in a garage.” The giants and heads of state have taken the stage.

He even cites Donald Trump, who recently converted to the crypto cause. For Vitalik, this is a sign that the underground is dead. And if the crypto space becomes a marketplace driven by the same logics as traditional finance, what remains of the original dream?

He warns: Android democratized Linux, but at the cost of an ecosystem riddled with spyware.

The default Android phone is full of spyware… a very mixed ecosystem.

Should we accept that the blockchain becomes an exact copy of this model, without the promise of emancipation?

But not all is bleak. For Buterin, solutions exist. He advocates for native privacy: no more “privacy” as an option, every leak is a bug. Front-ends must be static, hosted via IPFS, resistant to attacks.

He also criticizes DAOs with buyable votes, these false democracies disguised as decentralized governance. And asks this simple question: “Does what you build make your users freer?“

Some figures and realities:

That is why Vitalik advocates a shift in technical and ethical direction.

Ethereum moves forward, driven by challenges of privacy, lowering gas fees, and fairer governance. On all fronts, the 31-year-old genius plays both engineer and philosopher. But meanwhile, across the river, Cardano's Charles Hoskinson isn't holding back: he calls Ethereum a dictatorship controlled by Vitalik Buterin, denouncing hypocrisy over decentralization. The battle of visions is just beginning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Trader Says the Time To Be Bullish on Altcoins Is Here, Updates Outlook on Bonk and One Other Solana-Based Memecoin","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/03/trader-says-the-time-to-be-bullish-on-altcoins-is-here-updates-outlook-on-bonk-and-one-other-solana-based-memecoin/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 18:06:10 GMT","

A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader is suddenly turning bullish on altcoins.

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Bluntz, tells his 322,200 followers on social media platform X that the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) metric is flashing a bearish divergence, setting the stage for alts to outperform the flagship crypto asset.

A bearish divergence occurs when the price is recording higher highs and higher lows while an indicator such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recording lower highs. The RSI indicator is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions.

“The three-day BTC dominance bear divergence ended up rolling into a weekly bear divergence, too. The time to be long alts is here in my opinion.”

BTC.D is a metric that calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to Bitcoin. A bearish BTC.D chart indicates that altcoins are printing gains faster than BTC.

BTC.D is 65.34% at time of writing.

Next up, the trader says that the Solana (SOL)-based memecoin Bonk (BONK) may more than double in price after breaking out of a descending trendline on the five-day chart.

 “Really not too sure about ATHs, but pretty confident BONK is going at least 100-130% higher.”

He also says that alts similar to BONK are starting to enter uptrends as well.

“BONK ecosystem coins going pretty crazy right now to be honest… 

Can't be long BONK ecosystem without being long BONK to be honest.” 

BONK is trading for $0.00001614 at time of writing, up 9.7% in the last 24 hours.

Lastly, the trader says Useless Coin (USELESS), a SOL-based memecoin, could hit the level around $0.50 as it remains in a strong uptrend.

“USELESS dips still getting bought up every day constantly despite already being up big. $500 million market cap looks within reach.”

USELESS is trading for $0.248 at time of writing, down 7.6% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $247.5 million, the memecoin is the 256th largest crypto project.

 After an incident of this scale, the same recommendations resurface:Use strong, unique passwords for every service.Adopt a password manager like 1Password or Bitwarden.Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.Switch to passkeys, using biometrics like fingerprints or facial recognition.Monitor for dark web exposure through tools that flag leaked credentials tied to your email.While helpful, this advice hasn't changed in years.

 With billions of passwords now exposed, the more urgent question isn't how do you protect them, but rather, why are you still relying on passwords at all? A growing number of developers, institutions and privacy advocates believe blockchain digital identity might offer a long-overdue alternative.What digital ID with blockchain actually solvesAt its core, a decentralized identity system flips the current model. Instead of entrusting your digital identity to centralized databases — targets that can and do get breached — it gives users full ownership through self-sovereign identity on blockchain.Here's what that changes:No central point of failure: Traditional login systems keep millions of credentials in centralized vaults. Hack one server, and attackers gain access to everything. In contrast, blockchain identity solutions use decentralized identifiers (DIDs), unique, private keys stored onchain that belong solely to the user. There's no central vault to compromise.Minimal data exposure: Using Verifiable Credentials, users can confirm specific details, like their age or degree, without handing over a complete ID. Zero-Knowledge Proofs are even more advanced, allowing you to prove eligibility (e.g., “I'm over 18”) without revealing any underlying documents.Tamper-resistant and auditable: Once credentials are issued to your digital identity wallet, they're cryptographically signed and time-stamped. That makes it nearly impossible to forge, backdate or alter them without detection.This system, collectively known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), replaces the foundation of today's approach entirely.Who is already trialing blockchain identity solutions?Though it may sound futuristic, Web3 identity management is already gaining ground.The European Union is implementing eIDAS 2.0 and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) to issue tamper-proof digital diplomas, certifications and credentials across member states.Furthermore, Germany and South Korea are piloting blockchain-based digital ID systems that could eventually serve as nationwide replacements for physical identity documents.Also, startups like Dock Labs, Polygon ID and TrustCloud are building platforms where individuals can create, manage and selectively share their credentials, whether for accessing a government portal, opening a bank account or proving educational qualifications online.

Here's what that changes:

This system, collectively known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), replaces the foundation of today's approach entirely.

Though it may sound futuristic, Web3 identity management is already gaining ground.

The European Union is implementing eIDAS 2.0 and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) to issue tamper-proof digital diplomas, certifications and credentials across member states.

Furthermore, Germany and South Korea are piloting blockchain-based digital ID systems that could eventually serve as nationwide replacements for physical identity documents.

Also, startups like Dock Labs, Polygon ID and TrustCloud are building platforms where individuals can create, manage and selectively share their credentials, whether for accessing a government portal, opening a bank account or proving educational qualifications online.

 Despite the promise, blockchain identity isn't ready for mainstream adoption yet, and the roadblocks are as much about infrastructure and law as they are about technology.The UX gap: Now, recovering access to your digital ID with blockchain isn't as easy as clicking “forgot password.” If you lose your device, your credentials could go with it. Experimental methods like multiparty recovery exist, but they haven't been widely implemented.Regulatory friction: Privacy laws like the GDPR require the ability to delete personal data, but blockchains are immutable by design. Developers are working on privacy-preserving layers and offchain storage, but these tools are evolving faster than most legal frameworks.Lack of platform integration: While the tech is advancing, the internet hasn't caught up. Most platforms still rely on email-password logins. Until websites, apps and governments adopt DIDs and blockchain security for identity, users are stuck juggling old and new systems.Network effect problem: For a decentralized identity system to work at scale, it needs participation from issuers (like governments or universities), verifiers (banks, employers) and wallet providers. Without ecosystem-wide buy-in, these identities don't have much practical use. 

Despite the promise, blockchain identity isn't ready for mainstream adoption yet, and the roadblocks are as much about infrastructure and law as they are about technology.

 In short, a lot, but nothing that's out of reach in the coming years. For example, platforms need interoperability standards that allow digital credentials to function seamlessly across different platforms and jurisdictions. Then, just as importantly, user onboarding must become frictionless (setting up a blockchain ID should feel no more complicated than creating an email account). There's also a pressing need for legal clarity, so that decentralized identities can be used in official processes like voting, licensing and employment. And finally, real-world pilots are essential, moving beyond test environments to full-scale implementations that demonstrate blockchain identity systems in action.The future of online authentication may no longer rely on passwords. Still, turning that vision into reality will require coordinated action across developers, regulators and global platforms with a shared commitment to giving users complete control over their digital identity.

Crypto traders are exhibiting bearish behavior despite bitcoin BTC$109,821.73 trading above $110,000 and possibly taking aim at a new record high above $112,000.

Data from Coinalyze shows that during bitcoin's move this week from $106,000 to $110,000, the long/short ratio fell from 1.223 in favor of longs to 0.858 in favor of shorts.

It's worth noting that the long/short ratio in this case is analyzing the percentage of accounts that are long or short, which is typically an indicator of retail sentiment. The long/short ratio has been negative numerous times during the recent move above $100,000 despite staying positive throughout the previous bull market in 2021.

Open interest also rose from $32 billion to $35 billion during this period, indicating that significant capital is being pumped into shorting bitcoin. However, funding rates remained positive throughout this rise, indicating that traders are also entering long positions.

Bitcoin has been trapped in a relatively tight range since early May, trading between $100,000 and $110,000 with three tests of each level of support and resistance.

Technical indicators like relative strength index (RSI) continue to paint a bearish image with several drives of bearish divergence, with RSI weakening on each test of $110,000.

The recent influx of short positions could well be lower timeframe traders capitalizing on the range, shorting resistance before reversing their trade at each test of $100,000.

This rang true on June 22 when the long/short ratio shot up to 1.68 as bitcoin momentarily slumped through $100,000 before bouncing.

There is a potential bull case with the increase in short positions: a short squeeze. This would occur if bitcoin begins to trigger liquidation points and stop losses above a record high, which would cause an impulse in buy pressure and continuation to the upside.

UPDATE JULY 3, 16:21 UTC: Adds context about long/short ratio and a sentence on the funding rate remaining positive.

Bitmine Immersion (BMNR), the ether treasury strategy firm helmed by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, is the latest red-hot crypto proxy play in town.

The company's shares more than doubled on Thursday topping $140, now rallying over 3,000% in less than a week since the firm announced the raising of $250 million by selling shares to acquire ETH.

The private placement offering, priced at $4.50 per share and due to close today, attracted institutional investors including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG.

At its core, Bitmine is positioning itself as a publicly traded proxy for ether exposure, similar to how Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) became a leveraged bitcoin bet. The approach has gained traction recently as investors look for new ways to access crypto through public equities.

The firm originally focused on crypto mining using immersion cooling and held $16 million in bitcoin prior to the fundraising.

But a similar crypto treasury stock's rapid rise and fall may offer a cautionary tale.

The parabolic rise in BMNR mirrors the trading behavior of Sharplink Gaming (SBET), another public company that repositioned itself as an ETH treasury firm last month under the leadership of Consensys co-founder Joseph Lubin.

Sharplink soared as much as 4,000% in days following its $450 million fundraising announcement. Shares since plunged over 90% from peak as the firm closed its ETH acquisition and early investors in the private placement sold stock locking in their profits.

Bitmine's valuation, with a market capitalization over $800 million at current prices, already prices in aggressive assumptions about the firm's future ETH gains.

Retail investors chasing the momentum should tread carefully.

 XRP could rally to $2.65 as a bullish trading pattern, and investors' excitement over Ripple Labs' US banking license application boosts interest in the altcoin. 

Key point:

Ripple Labs' application for a US banking license has acted as a catalyst for XRP, paving the way for a potential rally to $2.65.

Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a post on X that the company “is applying for a national bank charter” from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). 

Garlinghouse added that the firm would come under federal and state oversight if the license is approved. That would create a “new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.”

Could XRP (XRP) benefit from the news and break out of its overhead resistance? Let's analyze the charts to find out.

XRP rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average ($2.19) on Wednesday and broke above the 50-day simple moving average ($2.23). That suggests the bulls are trying to gain the upper hand.

The XRP/USDT pair could rise to the $2.34 level, which is likely to pose a strong challenge. If the price turns down from $2.34 and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that bears are selling on rallies. That may keep the pair inside the $2.34 to $2 range for a while.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price pierces the $2.34 level, it opens the doors for a rally to the overhead resistance of $2.65. Sellers are expected to defend the $2.65 level with all their might because a break above it could start a new up move toward $3.

The pair has formed a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline. If that happens, the pair could rally to $2.42 and then to the pattern target of $2.76.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down from the neckline and breaks below the $2.14 support. That increases the risk of a fall to $2.07.

How Massive Medicaid Cuts Will Harm People's Health

Evidence shows that Medicaid improves people's health and is particularly vital for babies, older people in need of long-term care and people in rural communities

Editor's Note (7/3/25): The House of Representatives passed the budget bill in a 218–214 vote today. It will now go to President Donald Trump for signature.

Money can't necessarily buy an individual good health—but for a society, it can.

On July 3 the House of Representatives will vote on the Trump administration's new budget bill, which incorporates massive cuts to Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that serves more than 70 million low-income people. The bill, which passed the Senate on July 1, would cut $930 billion from Medicaid, Medicare and Affordable Care Act funding combined over 10 years, with more than 11 million people losing coverage by 2034. Experts have calculated that, taken together, the cuts will lead to more than 51,000 additional deaths per year by decreasing people's access to health care.

Experts say the evidence shows that gutting Medicaid will have dramatic effects on health far beyond people enrolled today—some of whom may not even realize they use Medicaid because the program goes by different names in different states. Even those with private insurance will be affected.

“When you slash $1 trillion from the health care system, you can't expect it not to have far-reaching harms,” says Megan Cole Brahim, a health policy researcher at Boston University. “It will really affect everyone, including people who aren't enrolled in Medicaid.”

The bill includes two main Medicaid-related provisions. One increases the requirements people must meet to qualify for and remain on Medicaid: This would drive down the total number of people who receive benefits, Cole Brahim says, leaving more people without coverage. The second provision reduces the amount of money the federal government sends to the states to fund Medicaid coverage. This will cause great variability in how different states handle the cuts, she notes, because each state will have authority to make its own choices about whether to try to scrounge up the funding from other sources to close the gap and maintain Medicaid access.

Medicaid “covers about one in five people, and the majority of people in the United States will have had Medicaid at some point in their life.” —Megan Cole Brahim, health policy researcher, Boston University

Cuts to Medicaid at the scale proposed in the House and Senate bills are unprecedented, Cole Brahim says, but scientists still have plenty of data to work from to predict the effects of such a massive cut. Researchers have tracked differences in health outcomes in states where Medicaid was expanded, particularly after the passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. That legislation gave states the option of extending Medicaid coverage to more people, up to those with an income of 138 percent of the federal poverty level, with federal support. So far, 40 states and Washington, D.C., have opted for expansion—and researchers have monitored health outcomes over time in those states compared with states that did not.

“Medicaid expansion was really a natural experiment,” says Brian Lee, a transplant hepatologist at the University of Southern California, who was co-author of a 2022 study in the Lancet that evaluated death rates in conjunction with Medicaid expansion across the U.S. When Medicaid coverage was offered to more people, overall death rates fell by nearly 12 per 100,000 adults per year on average. Where states were home to more women or more Black people, the decline in death rate was larger.

And Lee notes that the 2022 findings are just the bird's-eye view of the way Medicaid access shapes people's health. For example, studies have found that more people get diagnosed with chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease in Medicaid expansion states. Earlier diagnosis permits earlier treatment, which, logically, would reduce mortality rates over the course of decades.

“Medicaid expansion, in relative terms, is pretty new,” Lee says; the earliest states began implementing the program in 2014. “A lot of people think that, actually, the best benefits are to come” —or at least, they thought that they were to come.

The new policy changes won't just affect the people who lose access to Medicaid in the short term. “This isn't a small program for a fraction of our population,” Cole Brahim says. “It covers about one in five people, and the majority of people in the United States will have had Medicaid at some point in their life.”

One key area in which Medicaid is crucial is older adult health services and other long-term support, including both home-based care and residential facilities, says Jasmine Travers Altizer, a researcher at New York University who studies aging. Two out of three people in the U.S. will require some form of long-term health services at some point in their life, she says.

Even after people reach the age of 65, Medicare—a companion federally run insurance program for older adults—only covers nursing home and daily home health care services for 100 days, she notes. Many people don't have independent long-term care coverage, which can cost thousands of dollars a year in premiums, leaving them with no real alternative to Medicaid. And when people can't access proper medical care, they often need to rely on relatives for support, including full-time care—which comes with its own economic consequences for families and society at large.

Our youngest populations also depend on Medicaid, Cole Brahim says. More than two in five births are paid for by the service—a proportion that rises to more than half for Black and Hispanic births.

And although proponents of the Trump administration's Medicaid cuts say that these changes wouldn't affect pregnant people and kids, Cole Brahim notes that they would absolutely prevent some people from having coverage before pregnancy. “Making sure people are connected to care before they become pregnant is really critical for maximizing health outcomes, both for the mom and the baby,” she says.

All three experts emphasize a universal risk to Medicaid cuts: the reduction of health care facilities and personnel. Federal Medicaid funds are used to directly cover care of individuals on Medicaid, but this money indirectly keeps practitioners' and hospitals' doors open.

The steep cuts to federal funding will ultimately mean doctors and hospitals have more trouble making ends meet. As facilities begin to close, people in affected communities—regardless of their insurance provider—will face longer wait times for appointments and longer travel times to facilities that are still in operation. People in more rural communities, which are already underserved, may lose care access entirely, even while remaining insured.

Cole Brahim is particularly worried that obstetric and pediatric care will see more closures, noting that these departments are often less profitable because insurance providers already reimburse these services at lower rates, she says.

Travers Altizer is also concerned about the cuts' effects on nursing homes, which are in crisis as well. In one recent survey of nursing home providers, 27 percent said they would have to close their facilities if Medicaid cuts occurred. Even more—58 percent—said they would need to reduce current staffing; 44 percent they would slow new hires. For Travers Altizer, those possibilities mark a return to the early days of COVID, when staffing shortages left some nursing home residents unable to get out of bed or otherwise meet basic needs.

She also notes that people whose lose Medicaid coverage because of cuts will still need to seek care; they'll just do it in different ways—ways that are ultimately more expensive overall. Rather than primary care visits, people will lean on emergency rooms. Without skilled medical support, people will rely on friends and family. Without federal money, people will continue turning to online fundraising platforms such as GoFundMe at ever increasing rates.

“There's this big idea that we need to cut Medicaid [because] we need to save money, and Medicaid is this big federal government program,” Travers Altizer says. “But taking away this support won't save money; it's going to shift costs.”

New Interstellar Object Stuns Scientists as It Zooms through Solar System

All eyes are on Comet 3I/ATLAS as astronomers worldwide chase the exotic ice ball through our solar system

By Nora Bradford edited by Lee Billings

A diagram shows the trajectory of interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system. It will make its closest approach to the sun in October.

NASA/JPL-Caltech

Late in the evening on July 1, a telescope in Chile that is part of the global, NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) picked up on a new moving dot in the sky, an object traveling past the orbit of Jupiter. When Larry Denneau, a software engineer at ATLAS, alerted the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center to the observation, “it looked like a completely routine discovery,” he says. That would soon change. To his surprise, the object—provisionally named A11pI3Z—turned out to be the third interstellar visitor known to science.

Now, mere days after its discovery, frenzied follow-up work by astronomers around the world to further scrutinize A11pI3Z and look for additional apparitions in archival observations has given the object a new, more official name—Comet 3I/ATLAS—for the telescope that first discovered it. What seems to have been the clinching evidence for its interstellar nature emerged from the efforts of a group of amateur astronomers, called the Deep Random Survey, who were the first to track the object down in images other ATLAS telescopes had captured in late June.

“We had quite a bit of confusion from the get-go,” says Sam Deen, a member of the group. “Our systems are usually tuned to expect that a new discovery is an object firmly stuck inside the solar system,” but 3I/ATLAS was playing outside of those rules. The earlier observations—which soon also included “prediscovery” sightings from the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, as well as other telescopes—allowed a more precise calculation of 3I/ATLAS's trajectory. Whatever it was, the object was zooming toward the inner solar system at almost 70 kilometers per second, relative to the sun.

That's “far faster than any solar system object should be able to move,” Deen notes, because such speeds ensure objects will slip through the sun's gravitational grasp. Anything moving so quickly simply can't hang around long; rather than following a typical parabolic orbit, 3I/ATLAS's blistering speed is carving out a hyperbolic orbit, a path that takes the object swooping through the inner solar system before it soars back to the interstellar void. It most likely came from the outskirts of some other planetary system, where it was ejected from its tenuous twirling around some alien sun by gravitational interactions with a giant planet or another passing star. Exactly where it came from and when it began its galactic journey, however, no one can say.

There is no threat to Earth: during its brief sojourn in the solar system 3I/ATLAS is projected to come no nearer than about 240 million kilometers from our planet. The object will make its closest approach to the sun around October 30, reaching a distance of about 210 million kilometers, just within the orbit of Mars. As it approaches in coming months, astronomers will intensify their studies, hoping to learn more about this mysterious visitor.

What's already relatively clear, however, is 3I/ATLAS's cometary nature; more than 100 observations have now trickled in from telescopes around the globe, including some that show hints the object is enveloped in a cloud of gas and dust and trailing a tail of debris as ices on its surface warm in the sun's radiance. Astronomers normally use a distant object's brightness as a proxy for its size, with brighter objects tending to be bigger as well. But a comet's ejected material is usually bright, too, which interferes with such crude estimates.

Consequently, “right now we really don't know how big it is; it could be anywhere from five to 50 kilometers in diameter,” Denneau says. Closer looks with more powerful observatories, including the keen-eyed, infrared James Webb Space Telescope, should soon help clarify 3I/ATLAS's dimensions and composition.

“I am interested in whether the comet looks like objects from our own solar system,” Denneau says. “The answer is interesting either way. If it has the same composition as a normal comet, it means that other solar systems may be built similarly to ours. If it's completely different, then we might wonder why that is.”

The first interstellar object observed, 1I/‘Oumuamua, appeared on the scene in 2017 and perplexed researchers with its oddly elongated shape and bizarrely accelerating trajectory. Those strange features led some researchers to propose an idea—now convincingly debunked—that ‘Oumuamua was a derelict alien spacecraft adrift in the Milky Way. Then, in 2019, came the second observed interstellar object, 2I/Borisov, which bore all the hallmarks of a run-of-the-mill comet and thus inspired few, if any, outlandish claims of alien involvement.

“[Comet 3I/ATLAS] will be a tiebreaker of sorts,” says Mario Jurić, an astronomer at the University of Washington and discovery software lead at the recently completed Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile. “[Will it] give us a sense ‘Oumuamua was the odd one out, or is the universe a lot more interesting than we imagined?”

Rubin—a unique telescope with a panoramic view that will survey the entire overhead sky every few days—is seen as especially critical for solving the lingering mysteries of these first emissaries from interstellar space. As the observatory's survey progresses in months and years to come, it should uncover many more visitors from the great beyond, allowing astronomers to begin studying them as a population rather than scattered, isolated one-offs.

Ultimately, if Rubin or another facility manages to spot an interstellar object fortuitously poised to pass relatively close to Earth, astronomers might even be able to gain an extremely close-up view via a spacecraft rendezvous. The European Space Agency (ESA) already has such a mission in the works, in fact—Comet Interceptor, a sentinel spacecraft set to launch as early as 2029 to await some inbound comet or other object. “There is a small chance that Comet Interceptor might be able to visit an interstellar object if one is found on the right trajectory, and the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory should give us an increased rate of discovery of these objects,” says Colin Snodgrass, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh, who is part of the ESA mission.

All of that has astronomers on the edge of their seat, eager to dive deeper into a new frontier in our cosmic understanding. “This is probably the most excited I've been about any astronomical discovery in years,” Deen says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","America Is Racing to Build the World's Most Fearsome Hypersonic Missiles—Because They Will Win Wars","https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a65010390/us-hypersonic-missile-programs/","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:08:00 GMT","

After years of setbacks, the U.S. has a healthy range of hypersonic programs inching toward deployment. The only question is: which will fly first?

The armored doors of a hidden underground base slide open and giant military vehicles emerge, a convoy of mobile ballistic missile launchers. At the most tense moment of an international standoff, an adversary decides to unleash weapons of mass destruction on U.S. forces. This adversary knows their movements are being watched via satellite, but is counting on being able to get their missiles off long before the Americans can react.

But the response comes much faster than expected. The launch vehicles have barely taken up firing positions before hypersonic missiles streak out of the sky at more than a mile per second, obliterating them one by one. The force of the impacts scatters flaming debris over a wide expanse.

Though this situation is hypothetical, it demonstrates why war planners now see hypersonic weapons as a non-negotiable for the U.S. military: the Army and Navy must be able to carry out fast, precision strikes on mobile, time-critical targets at long range. And the threat is only growing. If American adversaries learn from the June strikes that U.S. B-2  stealth bombers carried out against the Iranian nuclear site at Fordow—which failed to destroy the underground bunker and its enriched uranium despite using 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs—hypersonics may be the only way to engage targets hidden underground and protected by state-of-the-art concrete.

All this to say: there is a new arms race underway between Russia, China, and the United States—this time for hypersonic weapons—and the prize is a weapon which will win wars. 

Hypersonic missiles fly beneath the radar cover, which gives warning of ballistic missiles, and they maneuver unpredictably, making them difficult to intercept. Their particular appeal is in what the military likes to call “Anti-Access/Area Denial scenarios,” in which missile defenses keep U.S. aircraft and ships out of a combat zone. Being able to suddenly strike high-value targets like ships or airbases at long range makes the hypersonic weapon a potential game changer.

But decades of research and $8 billion spent since 2019 have not given America a lead. In fact, the U.S. has yet to deploy a hypersonic weapon, while Russia has already used its hypersonic Kinzhal missile against Ukraine, and China's famed “carrier killer” DF-ZF hypersonic is in service and alarming Western analysts. Despite previous program failures, the U.S. does have several active hypersonic programs in the running that could soon see deployment. One weapon in particular, known as “Dark Eagle,” is expected to enter service by the end of the year.

“I'd imagine [the Americans] get a minimal viable capability into service,” says Samuel Cranny-Evans of the British military think tank RUSI. Still, he is cautious, predicting no more than a minimal capability in hypersonics due to a myriad of Pentagon projects that have previously failed. 

The immediate challenge is just to get something, anything into service that works. With defense industry giants like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon seeing new challenges from tech startups like Anduril and Kratos, there has never been a more promising moment for American hypersonics. The question is: which weapon will enter service first?

The first six hypersonic weapons on our list—Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (Dark Eagle), Conventional Prompt Strike, Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, Anduril's secret hypersonic, and Kratos Defense's secret hypersonic—are all in active development. These are the programs worth watching.

We also chose to include three canceled hypersonic programs at the bottom of this list—including Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon, Hypersonic Air Launched Offensive Anti-Surface, and Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept—because in most cases, technology from one killed program is transferred to a newer program. Take, for instance, the Air Force's Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon; after it was canceled in 2020, resources from that program were used to support the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, which was itself canceled in 2024 and revived once again just last month.

Service: U.S. Air Force | Status: Active after a short cancellation | Duration: 2018–2024, revived in June 2025 | Contractor: Lockheed Martin

In 2018, the U.S. Air Force awarded a $480 million contract to Lockheed Martin for the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW). This was a boost-glide weapon, accelerated by a rocket motor and then gliding at hypersonic speed. It built on work dating back to DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which started the Force Application and Launch From Continental United States (FALCON) project. 

With a range of 1,000 miles, ARRW was intended to provide a rapid strike capability to hit targets like command bunkers fast—and with no warning. In tests, it was launched from a B-52, but in action it might have been carried by a B-1, F-15E, or other aircraft. ARRW was likely the “super-duper” missile President Trump referred to in 2020. 

ARRW was due to enter service in 2022, but after a series of failed launches it was delayed and finally canceled in 2023. Of the seven ARRW launches made public, four were complete failures. Some analysts have argued that the failures had nothing to do with the design of the missile itself, but were caused by the program being rushed. 

ARRW seemed to out of the race—that is, until the Air Force unexpectedly brought it back in the budget documents  released in June 2025. No details have been released for plans going forward.

Service: U.S. Army | Status: Active | Duration: 2019–present | Contractor: Lockheed Martin

The U.S. Army's Dark Eagle, also known as the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW), is a virtual twin of Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike (see below). The two share many components including the rocket motor and glide vehicles. You could see them as the ground- and sea-launched versions of the same weapon. 

Dark Eagle will be fired from mobile transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) vehicles, similar to those that fire ballistic missiles. One battery will comprise four TELs with eight missiles plus a command vehicle. 

However, achieving launch has not been easy, with a series of failures over two years before success was finally achieved in 2024. As of February, the plan was to field Dark Eagle by July, but no plan has yet been announced, and it is still not clear when the system will be fully operational. 

“There are a lot of challenges, like guidance, especially for a conventionally armed weapon,” says Cranny-Evans. “If it's nuclear, or really big—like the [Chinese] DF-17—then they can get away with lower precision.”

Questions also remain over the costs, previously quoted at $41 million per missile, or about 20 times as much as a Tomahawk cruise missile. With so many other demands, Congress may balk at funding a small stockpile of niche weapons. 

Service: U.S. Navy | Status: Active | Duration: 2019–present | Contractor: Lockheed Martin

The Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), its equivalent of the Dark Eagle, is slated to arm Zumwalt-class destroyers and will later be carried on Virginia-class subs. The missile is ejected by a cold-gas launch, throwing it well clear of the ship before the two-stage rocket motors cut in and accelerate it to high speed, followed by an extended glide phase. 

CPS will have a kinetic rather than an explosive warhead. That means it inflicts damage by sheer impact, slamming into the target at a mile per second or more. This should make it an extremely effective ship killer.

No specifications have been released for the CPS, though the range for both this and the Dark Eagle is given as a weirdly precise “exceeding 1,725 miles,” presumably because this is enough to qualify as a long-range weapon under international arms treaties. 

One of the major differences between CPS and Dark Eagle is that cold launch, and this has proven challenging. However, after earlier problems, the Navy announced in May a successful cold launch and the program looks set to proceed. 

Service: U.S. Air Force | Status: Active | Duration: 2022–present | Contractors: RTX Corporation and Northrop Grumman

While the Army and Navy are working on the low-tech boost-glide approach, the Air Force is pressing ahead with the more futuristic Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM), another hypersonic scramjet building on the earlier Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (see below).

HACM will be test launched from an Australian F/A-18, as Australia is partnering in the project, but it will be deployed on a range of aircraft. Potentially one B-52 could carry 20 missiles, while F-15s and F-35s could also carry the missile, greatly extending their reach. HACM will reportedly have a range of over 1,100 miles and a speed of Mach 8. 

However, HACM is further from the finish line than the Army and Navy projects. The initial test launch has been delayed, and 13 test flights are planned through March 2027. A few failures could see HACM going the way of the canceled Hypersonic Air Launched Offensive anti-surface (see below).

Service: Unknown | Status: In development | Duration: 2023–present | Contractor: Anduril

Palmer Luckey, the flamboyant co-founder of billion-dollar startup Anduril, has publicly announced his goal of transforming the U.S. defense sector. He wants to see a World War II model in which weapons are inexpensive and can be made faster than they are used. His company is already making waves with low-cost interceptors, cruise missiles, attack drones, and robot submarines.

The company recently announced the static test firing of an 18-inch hypersonic booster at its 450-acre production and test facility in McHenry, Mississippi, calling it “a significant step forward in delivering affordable, advanced hypersonic propulsion systems at a critical time for the United States.” 

This is a long way from a ground test to a full system, but Anduril's track record of rapid development using technology like 3D printing could give the firm a lead in the next round of the hypersonics race. 

Service: Unknown | Status: In development | Duration: 2023–present | Contractor: Kratos

This past March, the CEO of Kratos, a San Diego, California-based defense contractor, announced that the company is working on a privately-funded hypersonic program. The vehicle is expected to be “orders of magnitude less costly than any other hypersonic system or concept in existence today,” and is thought to be based on an air-breathing engine like the scramjet-powered Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile.

Back in January, Kratos received a $1.5 billion Pentagon contract for a low-cost hypersonic testbed. The firm has also successfully flown a hypersonic missile called Erinyes in a Missile Defense Agency experiment, so it's clear the company has significant experience in this arena.

Like Anduril, Kratos is not involved in the current round of hypersonic developments, but has its eyes fixed on providing large numbers of hypersonic weapons for future programs. 

Service: U.S. Air Force | Status: Canceled | Duration: 2018–2020 | Contractor: Lockheed Martin 

The Air Force's Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon – HCSW, pronounced “Hacksaw”— was cancelled in 2020. The reason given was budget pressure. In essence, the Air Force had to choose between HCSW or the competing ARRW program.

“The military deliberately chose to let some number of flowers bloom,” says hypersonics expert Mark Gubrud. “When it comes down to committing billions for production, they have to ask whether the bang will be worth the bucks, so that's where a lot of programs stop.”

No details were released of HCSW, which would have been ready for service by 2021. Despite meeting all its project milestones, HCSW was cut in favor of its more promising sibling, the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon.

Service: U.S. Navy | Status: Canceled | Duration: 2023–2025 | Contractor: Raytheon Missiles & Defense and Lockheed Martin

Another boost-glide weapon, the Hypersonic Air Launched Offensive anti-surface (HALO) was to be the U.S. Navy's next-generation anti-ship missile. It would replace the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, a stealthy, subsonic weapon. Carried by the F/A-18 Super Hornet, HALO would have greater range and, crucially, much higher speed, giving opponents little time to react, striking with phenomenal power.

However, there were warning signs that all was not well in April 2023, when Rear Adm. Stephen Tedford, who headed the program, cautioned that HALO might not actually reach hypersonic speed.

And in April 2025, HALO was axed. As usual. The Navy quoted rising costs and budget constraints. Bang for buck matters. According to one estimate,  the missiles would cost about $31 million each or around ten times as much as the Navy's current missiles, and did not offer enough improvement to be worthwhile.

While HALO and ARRW both aimed to produce working weapons in one go, DARPA's Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HWAC) was always just a prototype. This was way more ambitious than boost-glide: it was an air-breathing system, with a special type of jet engine, known as a scramjet, able to function at hypersonic speed. This is more efficient than a rocket, with potentially far greater range.

DARPA's goals for HAWC were to create an airframe capable of sustained flight at more than Mach 5, a hydrocarbon-powered engine, and ways of managing the tremendous heat from high-speed fiction. 

DARPA carried out four successful test flights. A planned follow-up program, known as More Opportunities with HAWC program, or MOHAWC, did not win funding. But the development effort was not wasted and fed directly into the Air Force's Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile.

“Knowledge is often passed on to other programs if those are ongoing,” says Gubrud. “It's when there's a gap of many years that knowledge is lost.”

As DNA variants accumulate in somatic stem cells, become selected or evolve neutrally, they may ultimately alter tissue function. When, and how, selection occurs in homeostatic tissues is incompletely understood. Here, we introduce SCIFER, a scalable method that identifies selection in an individual tissue, without requiring knowledge of the driver event. SCIFER also infers self-renewal and mutation dynamics of the tissue's stem cells, and the size and age of selected clones. Probing bulk whole-genome sequencing data of nonmalignant human bone marrow and brain, we detected pervasive selection in both tissues. Selected clones in hematopoiesis, with or without known drivers, were initiated uniformly across life. In the brain, we found pre-malignant clones with glioma-initiating mutations and clones without known drivers. In contrast to hematopoiesis, selected clones in the brain originated preferentially from childhood to young adulthood. SCIFER is broadly applicable to renewing somatic tissues to detect and quantify selection.

Normal stem cells accumulate somatic variation throughout development1 and postnatal life2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Over time, stem cell clones vary in size owing to genetic drift9,10, or selection4,5,6,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Quantifying proliferation, differentiation, somatic mutation and selection dynamics in tissue stem cells is fundamental to our understanding of somatic mosaicism.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the expansion of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones, is a paradigm for somatic mosaicism. CH, detected with increased frequency as humans age, is associated with known driver events: either somatic variants in genes recurrently mutated in myeloid cancers (for example, DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1), or chromosomal copy number alterations18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. CH drivers not only provide a selective advantage to HSCs15,27, but also generate proinflammatory myeloid cells28,29. CH with known drivers is associated with a heightened risk of blood cancer19,20,22,30, excess cardiovascular mortality31, chronic pathology and infection32,33,34,35,36. Mathematical analysis of somatic variant distributions predicts that CH is far more prevalent than suggested by known drivers14; expanded clones without known driver events are possibly more frequent than those with known driver events12,13.

These observations raise the following questions: (1) Do CH drivers emerge by chance, or does increased turnover and/or somatic mutation rate facilitate their acquisition? (2) Do stem cell clones with known and unknown drivers differ in their frequency and clinical phenotypes? (3) When do selection events occur in life, and (4) how fast do the selected clones grow? These questions are best addressed with an affordable, scalable method to identify clonal selection and quantify stem cell dynamics.

Here, we present a method to detect clonal selection and quantify stem cell parameters without knowledge of the driver event, using a bulk primary sample from any tissue. The method applies population genetics theory for the accumulation and spread of somatic variants in development and subsequent homeostatic tissue renewal, and a Bayesian inference framework to discriminate clonal selection from neutral evolution and, moreover, quantify stem cell parameters. We validate our method with synthetic data and published experimental data and then apply it to a new cohort of human nonleukemic bone marrow (BM) samples and a published dataset of brain tissue samples.

We reasoned that the distribution of somatic variants in stem cells provides information on the dynamics of genetic drift and selection. To derive the expected variant allele frequency (VAF) distribution of a renewing tissue, we modeled expanding stem cell numbers during development, followed by an adult phase in which stem cell numbers are balanced (Fig. 1a and Methods). We focused on somatic single-nucleotide variants (SSNVs) acquired during both phases. In early life, stem cell numbers are small and few SSNVs are acquired, which will be at high VAF (Fig. 1b; variants A and B). Later, when stem cell numbers are larger, more variants are acquired in total but at lower VAF (Fig. 1b; variants C, D and E). Neutral SSNVs drift with time; some randomly increase their VAF (Fig. 1b; variants B, C, D and F) while others decrease or are extinguished (Fig. 1b; variant E). We model neutral clonal dynamics during development and homeostasis by linking expanding (supercritical) and homeostatic (critical) birth–death processes (Methods, ‘Population genetics model'). We find an analytical solution for the VAF distribution as a function of time that lends itself to parameter inference from experimental data.

a, Modeled processes and associated parameters in the model of drift. Stem cells either divide symmetrically with rate λ, or exit the stem cell compartment by differentiating (or dying), with rate δ. The stem cell count (N) increases in development (λ > δ) until reaching steady-state numbers (Nss) and remains constant during adulthood (N = Nss and λ = δ). On average, cells acquire μ neutral variants during each cell division. b, Schematic illustrating variant accumulation during development and subsequent homeostasis. c,d, Cumulative number of SSNVs versus VAF in development (c) and in adult life (d) (the scaling of the x axis is transformed to \(\frac{1}{\rm{VAF}}\) to spread out low-frequency variants). e–g, Simulated cumulative VAF distribution of SSNVs at selected ages between 0 and 100 years for 5 × 103 stem cells (λ = 5 per year, μ = 10 per division) (e); for 5 × 104 stem cells (λ = 5 per year, μ = 10 per division) (f); and for 5 × 105 stem cells (λ = 5 per year, μ = 10 per division) (g). h, Model of clonal selection. A selective driver event reduces the loss rate (differentiation or death) by a factor s, causing selective outgrowth of the mutant clone (red); the remaining parameters are defined in a. The VAF of the selected clone increases exponentially with the age at measurement, a. i, As b, but here an acquired driver mutation (D) causes selective outgrowth of the mutant clone (red). j, All variants in the selected clone's cell of origin are inherited by its progeny and hence reach a high VAF during clonal expansion, reflected in a shoulder in the cumulative VAF distribution. k, Simulated cumulative VAF distributions when a driver mutation is acquired at different ages, and the SSNVs are measured 45 years later, when the clone has reached a size of 32%. In the simulation, the selected clone grows by 22% per year (s = 0.02, λ = 10 per year, μ = 1 per division, Nss = 25,000). l, Simulated cumulative VAF distributions measured at varying ages after a driver mutation was acquired at 20 years of age. As k, the selected clone grows by 22% per year (s = 0.02, λ = 10 per year, μ = 1 per division, Nss = 25,000).

Our model suggests that during development genetic drift is negligible, resulting in an invariant linear relation between cumulative SSNV count and \(1/\rm{VAF}\) (Fig. 1c)37,38. During homeostasis, genetic drift alters the cumulative VAF histogram by increasing the number of SSNVs with low VAF (Fig. 1d). The extent of homeostatic drift depends on the number of stem cells and their self-renewal rate. With 5 × 103 stem cells dividing five times per year, drift increases the count of variants with high VAF over time (Fig. 1e; we assume that the transition from development to homeostasis occurs around birth). For 5 × 104 stem cells and the same division rate, the variant count will increase with age at lower VAFs and remain stable at high VAFs (Fig. 1f). Finally, with 5 × 105 stem cells, the distribution is nearly stable with age for all VAFs >1% (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Previous work inferred that 4 × 104 to 2 × 105 HSCs divide 0.6–6 times per year2. With these values, our model suggests that the VAF histogram is insensitive to genetic drift during life at high (≥10%) but not low VAF. Including extensively self-renewing progenitors in the model, as observed in mice39, only marginally modifies the distribution of somatic variants with ≥1% VAF (Supplementary Note 1), supporting our focus on stem cell dynamics to interpret measured VAF histograms.

Next, we modeled how clonal selection alters the VAF distribution. We consider that the leading selected clone, born at time ts with selective advantage s, expands while displacing normal stem cells (Fig. 1h,i). With clonal selection, neutral variants may have originated: (1) in normal stem cells before the driver event, (2) in the selected clone, or (3) in nonselected stem cells after the driver event occurred. We find analytical expressions for the evolution of all three types of variants, which together yield the cumulative VAF distribution of SSNVs (Methods). Expansion of a selected clone increases the VAF of the founding driver mutation (mutation D in Fig. 1i) and of all other neutral SSNVs in the founding cell, which generates a shoulder in the cumulative VAF distribution (Fig. 1j). Thus, the shape of the distribution discriminates between selection and neutral evolution, whereas total variant count may fail to do so (compare the VAF histograms in Fig. 1k, shaped by selection, with Fig. 1e,f, shaped by drift).

The shoulder height increases with the age at which the selected clone originated, ts, (Fig. 1k), because the number of neutral variants in the clone's stem cell of origin is the higher the older the individual. As the selected clone expands, the shoulder reaches higher VAFs (Fig. 1l). Thus, the VAF reached between clone origin and sample acquisition yields the selective advantage s (Fig. 1h, lower panel). Collectively, the shoulder in the cumulative VAF distribution provides a robust signature of clonal selection agnostic of driver identity. Moreover, its height and position allow inference of the clone's age and time-averaged selective advantage (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c).

Sufficiently deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) measures VAFs with approximately binomially distributed error40. To understand how this error influences detection of clonal selection in bulk WGS data, we simulated WGS data with our models of neutral evolution (Fig. 1a,b) and selection, focusing on a single selected clone (Fig. 1h,i). We performed repeated stochastic simulations, generating 10 datasets with neutral evolution and 70 datasets with selection (2.5% ≤ VAF ≤ 37.5%). To model measurement error, we drew variant reads from binomial distributions for sequencing depths of 30×, 90× or 270× (Methods and Supplementary Table 1). We then used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to fit both the model of neutral evolution and of selection to each dataset (Extended Data Fig. 1d), yielding posterior probabilities for both models to reproduce the noisy data.

To determine sensitivity and specificity in detecting selection, we used the posteriors to compute receiver operating curves (ROC) for identifying clones of different sizes. At 90× sequencing depth, we found that selected clones with VAF ≥ 5% were detected reliably (Fig. 2a; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96 for VAF = 5% and AUC ~ 1 for VAF = 7.5%), whereas smaller clones were not (Fig. 2a; VAF = 2.5%; AUC = 0.4). Discrimination between selection and neutral evolution was optimal at a threshold of 15% for the posterior probability of the selection model (Fig. 2a, operating points correspond to the 15% threshold, achieving ~100% sensitivity and 90% specificity for clone size 5% VAF and ~100% sensitivity and specificity for clone size 7.5% VAF). Exemplary selection posteriors for simulated 90× WGS datasets show discrimination between neutral evolution and selection of clones ≥5% VAF (Fig. 2b). Further, our ROC analysis predicts that 30× WGS will allow detection of large, selected clones >20% VAF, while deeper WGS enables detection of smaller clones with VAF > 1% at 270× (Fig. 2c).

a, ROCs quantifying the detection of clonal selection by SCIFER for different clone sizes (color-encoded). ROCs were generated by applying SCIFER to simulated data, generated with a stochastic birth–death process with (s = 0.02, corresponding to a selective advantage of 2% increase in birth versus death) or without (s = 0) selection of a clone initiated at 20 years of life (λ = 10 per year, μ = 1 per division, Nss = 25,000, and assuming sequencing with an average coverage of 90×). In total 63 cases, with selected clone sizes of VAF 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 25% and 37.5%, were generated. Models with, or without, clonal selection were fit to the data using ABC. True positives and false positives were evaluated for varying posterior probability thresholds of clonal selection. For selected clones with VAF ≥ 5%, the difference between true positives and false positives was maximal for a selection threshold of 15% (operating points, shown in red). b, Posterior probability for clonal selection (colored bars) and neutral evolution (gray bars) conditioned on selected clones with VAF ≥ 5% for six simulated cases with varying clone size. The dashed line marks the selection threshold at 15% conditional posterior probability. c, Accuracy of SCIFER to distinguish clonal selection from genetic drift in simulated WGS data. Shown are AUC computed from the ROCs shown in a and from ROCs obtained in analogy for simulated sequencing depths of 30× and 270×. The simulated data were generated as in a. For 270× sequencing depth, an additional 17 cases with selected clone sizes of 0.5% VAF and 1% VAF were used for model evaluation. d, Model scheme for two selected clones (red and orange) that compete with normal cells (blue). The two selected clones are born at times ts1 and ts2, and expand due to decreased loss rates (δs1 and δs2); the total cell count remains constant over time. e, Selection of two sequential clones manifests itself in two subclonal shoulders whose heights scale with the time points of driver acquisition.

Taken together, our method for selected clone inference, termed SCIFER, is suitable for detecting clonal selection in bulk WGS data.

Next we extended SCIFER beyond a single leading selected clone to study two competing clones, born at times ts1 and ts2, and conferring a selective advantage of, respectively, s1 and s2 (Fig. 2d). Considering branched (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and linear evolution (Extended Data Fig. 2b), we found that, in both cases, the VAF distribution has two subclonal shoulders, generated by the two competing clones (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). As with a single clone, the shoulders have heights proportional to the clonal birth dates that increase in VAF according to the fitness of the selected clones (Fig. 2e). We found that the two-clone inference model is particularly appropriate for the resolution of deeply sequenced WGS data (270×).

We benchmarked SCIFER with published WGS data from human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) single-cell clones2,12,13. Previously determined HSC parameters of neutral hematopoiesis (HSC number, self-renewal rate and rate of somatic variants acquisition)2 provided a quantitative reference for SCIFER. Because variant calling is a source of error in WGS, we used a stringent approach intersecting the results of two callers, Mutect2 and Strelka41 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). To examine the robustness of SCIFER with respect to variant calling, we also performed our analyses on the original variant calls obtained with Caveman2, which included substantially more SSNVs (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Reconstructing the phylogenetic tree with our calling approach recapitulated the original work (Fig. 3a). Applying SCIFER to pseudo-bulk data generated from single cells (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 3d) detected neutral evolution, irrespective of the variant calling algorithm, in agreement with the published findings (Fig. 3c). The inferred HSC number (Fig. 3d) and rate of self-renewing divisions (Fig. 3e) were similar for the two variant callers (6 × 104 to 2 × 105 HSCs dividing 3–8 times per year using Caveman; 2 × 104 to 5 × 104 HSCs dividing 0.4–6 times per year using Mutect2 and Strelka; ranges are 80% credible intervals). Both estimates overlapped with the previously published numbers (4 × 104 to 2 × 105 HSCs dividing 0.6–6 times per year)2. The rate of SSNV acquisition inferred by SCIFER using Caveman caller (3–5 SSNVs per cell division; Fig. 3f) overlapped with the original estimate (3–28 SSNVs per division). As expected, this rate was smaller (0.6–1 SSNV per cell division) with our more conservative calling approach (intersecting Mutect2 and Strelka).

Dashed line, 15% selection threshold. j, Age of leading selected clones in the cases shown in i, estimated by SCIFER and by phylodynamic modeling in the original publications (points, median; error bars, 80% credible intervals, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples). k,l, Estimated clonal growth rates (k) and stem cell parameters (l) for the samples shown in i (points, median; error bars, 80% credible intervals, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples). m, Single-cell phylogenies of published sample KX003 (ref. 13). n, As h but for the sample shown in m. o, As i, but for sample KX003 (ref. 13). p, Estimated stem cell and selection parameters for the sample shown in m. Shown are median and 80% credible intervals, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples.

SCIFER infers HSC number, self-renewal rate and mutation rate separately (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f), which is based on: (1) using both expansion and homeostatic phases (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2), assuming a homogeneous mutation rate throughout; and (2) the use of absolute variant counts, because many rapidly dividing stem cells accumulate more variants than few rarely dividing stem cells (although the ratio of stem cell number and self-renewal rate may remain unchanged2,15). Thus, SCIFER detected neutral evolution and quantified HSC number and division rate from a single pseudo-bulk sample.

To further validate SCIFER, we generated additional pseudo-bulk data from three neutrally evolving, published human HSPC single-cell WGS datasets (AX001, KX001 and KX002)13 (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). In all cases, SCIFER detected neutral evolution (Fig. 3c) and inferred similar HSC parameters (Fig. 3d,f). Interestingly, for the oldest individual (AX001, 63 years old), the inferred HSC division rate was higher than for the other individuals (29 and 38 years old) (Fig. 3e).

Next, we asked whether SCIFER detects clonal selection in pseudo-bulk WGS data from single HSPC clones from two published samples, KX0004 (ref. 13) (DNMT3A mutation, ~6%–8% VAF; Fig. 3g) and id2259 (ref. 12) (SF3B1 mutation, nearly 50% VAF; Extended Data Fig. 3i). SCIFER identified the leading DNMT3A (VAF 6%) and SF3B1 (VAF 49%) clones (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 3i) as selected (Fig. 3i). Moreover, using the two-clone model, SCIFER also detected the second largest clone in KX004 (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k). The original studies estimated that the SF3B1 mutation arose 25–30 years before tissue sampling, and the DNMT3A mutation 45–50 years before tissue sampling. SCIFER determined very similar clone ages (Fig. 3j). The estimated clonal growth rates (Fig. 3k) were concordant with previous data suggesting stronger selection of SF3B1 mutant clones42. Inferred stem cell parameters (Fig. 3l) were similar to individuals without CH (Fig. 3d–f). Finally, we applied SCIFER to a published sample without known CH driver, KX003 (ref. 13), having the largest expanded clone with ~17% VAF (Fig. 3m). SCIFER detected a leading selected clone at this VAF (Fig. 3n,o). Stem cell and selection parameters were similar to the samples above with known CH driver mutations (Fig. 3p, compare with Fig. 3j–l).

In summary, SCIFER robustly identified and quantified neutral evolution and selection in pseudo-bulk WGS data of human HSPCs, without previous knowledge of a driver event.

Next, we generated genuine bulk WGS data from BM HSPCs of 22 humans, aged 30–89 years (Supplementary Table 2). Based on targeted sequencing (with VAF ≥ 1% sensitivity; Supplementary Table 3)27, we selected 12 individuals with known CH drivers (6 with DNMT3A, 4 TET2, 1 ASXL1 and 1 with both TET2 and ASXL1 mutations), and 10 individuals without known drivers. The samples are labeled 1–22, followed by letters for the clones detected (D, T, A or U, for, respectively, mutations in DNMT3A, TET2 or ASXL1, or unknown drivers; N for neutral evolution). If SCIFER detected two clones, the larger clone is indicated first. All individuals had normal blood counts and blood films, without an antecedent history of blood or inflammatory disorder27.

We performed WGS of Lin–CD34+ HSPCs (Extended Data Fig. 4a–f) at 90× for all cases, and for 19 cases with sufficient DNA at 270×; hair follicle DNA at 30× WGS served as a germline control. A comparison with WGS data from 14 BM MNC samples is given in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3. WGS data were concordant with panel sequencing. Somatic single base-pair substitution profiles indicated similar age-related variant accumulation across all individuals (Extended Data Fig. 5)2,13,43. We found no copy number aberrations (CNAs) in driver genes (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Table 4).

We first applied SCIFER to the 12 individuals with mutations in known CH drivers (in total 14 such mutations, with 2 samples containing two, 17-TT and 12-AT). SCIFER identified a selected clone in all samples (both at 90× and 270×), associated with a shoulder in the VAF histogram (Fig. 4a–c and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). In all but one case, the clone detected by SCIFER, without knowledge of a putative driver, agreed with the VAF of the CH driver detected by panel sequencing (Fig. 4d). Only for 21-DU, SCIFER did not detect the DNMT3A clone, but instead a subclone without a known CH driver (Extended Data Fig. 7b). The DNMT3A clone originated from a founding cell with only six SNVs (Extended Data Fig. 7b), likely during embryogenesis. This case indicates a practical detection limit for clones of very early origin. Taken together, SCIFER reliably detected selected clones with known drivers originating in postnatal life.

a, Model fit to the cumulative VAF distribution measured in CD34+ HSPCs of samples 7-T and 10-D with 270× WGS (points and error bars, measured data and their standard deviation, which, assuming Poisson-distributed measurements, is the square root of the measured data; purple area, 95% posterior probabilities of the model fit, estimated from simulations using 100 posterior samples; gray area, 80% credible interval of the clone size, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples; red points and error bars, mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the VAF of known CH drivers, based on binomial distributions with sample size and success probability values of 267 and 0.08, and 205 and 0.06, corresponding to read coverage and measured VAF in 7-T and 10-D, respectively). b, Model support for clonal selection (conditioned on clones ≥5% VAF) and neutral evolution based on 90× WGS data in 12 cases with selection and with at least one CH driver mutation in AXSL1, DNMT3A and TET2. Dashed line, 15% selection threshold. c, As b, but based on 270× bulk WGS data, where available (model support for selection conditioned on clones ≥2% VAF). d, Estimated sizes of the selected clones (median and 80% credible intervals, computed from 1,000 posterior samples, for 270× WGS, where available, and 90× WGS else) versus measured VAF of known CH driver (mean and 95% CI according to binomial distributions with sample size taken as read coverage and success probability taken as measured VAF; for the 13 mutations, read coverage and VAFs are as follows: 249 and 0.03, 246 and 0.04, 205 and 0.06, 194 and 0.08, 267 and 0.08, 127 and 0.09, 264 and 0.14, 242 and 0.15, 275 and 0.16, 272 and 0.18, 230 and 0.20, 270 and 0.26, and 260 and 0.28). e, As in a, but for sample 12-AT (selected clones in blue and green; 95% CIs of the VAFs of mutations in ASXL1 and TET2 based on binomial distributions with sample size and success probability of 242 and 0.15 and 246 and 0.04, respectively). f, As in b, but for a second selected clone. g, Estimated stem cell parameters for the cases shown in c, showing median and 80% credible intervals for each sample, based on 1,000 posterior samples. h, As in g, but showing the ratio between stem cell number and division rate. y, years.

Applied to the 270× data, SCIFER found second clones in seven of ten samples, associated with a second shoulder in the VAF histogram (Fig. 4e,f; Extended Data Fig. 7c). Two secondary clones were associated with mutations in TET2 (included in Fig. 4d), whereas five had no known driver (Supplementary Table 5 and Methods). Thus, clones without known drivers were abundant and, in all but one case (20-UT), had lower VAF than clones with known drivers.

We next asked whether HSC dynamics varied with mutations in different driver genes. The total number of HSCs, their division rate and the rate of SSNV acquisition were in similar ranges across the three common CH driver genes (Fig. 4g). Allowing for TET2 mutations to increase the murine HSPC pool44,45 did not change the inferred parameters (Extended Data Fig. 7d–f). Moreover, parameter estimates did not depend on sequencing coverage (Fig. 4g), or whether the leading-clone or two-clone SCIFER models were used (Extended Data Fig. 7g). For 5-DU and 10-D, HSC numbers were inferred with 90× data to be smaller than for the other cases. For 10-D, the selected clone was at the lower end of identifiable VAFs, and deeper sequencing made its stem cell number agree with the majority of cases. The 5-DU parameter estimates, by contrast, were consistent outliers for 90× and 270× and also had a consistently smaller N to λ ratio (Fig. 4h). Apart from this case, we inferred that 1.6 × 105 to 1 × 107 HSCs divided 1.4–14 times per year, acquiring 1–5 SSNVs per division. Moreover, the N to λ ratio, giving the timescale over which neutral evolution will cause a variant to reach fixation, ranged from 1.4 × 104 to 22 × 106 years (Fig. 4h), confirming that large clones arose by selection, not drift. Taken together, SCIFER identifies up to two selected clones and quantifies the stem cell parameters from bulk WGS data.

Next we studied the ten cases in which targeted sequencing did not detect known CH mutations, at 90× and 270× (Fig. 5a) (30–76 years of age).

Dashed line, 15% selection threshold. c, As in b, but for the leading (left) or second selected clone (right) at 270× WGS, where available (posterior probabilities conditioned on clones with VAF ≥ 2%). d, Model fit to the cumulative \(\frac{1}{\rm{VAF}}\) distribution for samples 1-N and 16-UU at 270× WGS (points and error bars, measured data and their standard deviation, which, assuming Poisson-distributed measurements, is the square root of the measured data; purple area, 95% posterior probabilities of the model fit computed from simulations using 100 posterior samples; blue and green areas, 80% credible intervals of the estimated sizes of the selected clones, computed from 1,000 posterior samples). e,f, Inferred ratio between HSC number and division rate (e) and stem cell parameters (f) for neutrally evolving samples. Shown are median and 80% credible intervals for each sample, computed from 1,000 posterior samples; estimates obtained from 90× and 270× WGS are shown side by side. g,h, as in e and f, but for samples with unknown drivers. i,j, Estimated number of newly acquired SSNVs per HSC division (i) and number of HSCs contributing to hematopoiesis (j) in the 4 neutrally evolving cases compared with the 12 cases with selection for a known CH driver (introduced in Fig. 4) and the 6 cases with selection for an unknown driver (introduced in this figure; points and error bars, median and 80% credible intervals for each sample, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples for 270× WGS data, where available, and 90× WGS data else; boxplots, median and interquartile range, whiskers extend to the largest and smallest value no further than 1.5 times the interquartile range). k, Left, as in j, but showing the estimated HSC division rate. Right, estimated division rate versus age at sampling. Gray, neutral evolution; red, clonal selection.

At 90×, SCIFER found clear evidence for clonal selection in three cases, and borderline evidence in one sample (3-N; Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Probing at 270× ruled out selection in 3-N (Fig. 5c), and identified three additional samples with selection (11-UU, 13-U, 14-U), as well as additional smaller clones in 8-UU, 11-UU and 16-UU (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 8b). None of the leading and secondary clones had known drivers (Supplementary Table 5). Thus, in six of ten cases without known CH drivers, SCIFER discovered one or more selected clones.

Although all three samples with a large SSNV count (11-UU, 13-U, 16-UU; 500–800 SSNVs) contained selected clones, several samples with one or two selected clones had SSNV counts indistinguishable from those of the four neutrally evolving samples (1-N, 3-N, 4-N, 15-N). This suggests that using bulk SSNV count alone is insufficient to detect CH.

For all neutral samples, SCIFER inferred the N-to-λ ratio to be ~5 × 104 to 106 years, further supporting the notion that clones do not drift to large size in normal human hematopoiesis15 (Fig. 5e). Moreover, we inferred 105 to 3 × 106 HSCs, an HSC division rate of 1–14 times a year and a rate of acquired SSNV per cell division of 1–4 (Fig. 5f). These parameter estimates were insensitive to sequencing depth and consistent with our inferences from neutral phylogenetic trees (Fig. 3d–f), and from the cases with selection of unknown drivers (Fig. 5g,h). However, the division rate of the whole HSC population showed more variation in cases with selection (compare the middle panels in Fig. 5f and h). Hence, we compared HSC parameters in all samples with selection (including the cases in Fig. 4) versus neutrally evolving samples. The rate of SSNV acquisition and HSC numbers were overall very similar (Fig. 5i,j). The HSC division rates were more varied, and 11 of 18 individuals with CH had a high inferred division rate (Fig. 5k). Hence, HSC division rate appears to be more variable between individuals and, in some cases, clonal selection was associated with high division rate.

Phylogenetic reconstruction has previously suggested that expanded clones originate before 40 years of age13. SCIFER estimated that clones typically emerge several decades before BM sampling (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b) with no significant differences between clones with and without known drivers (Fig. 6a). Secondary (smaller) clones generally emerged later (Fig. 6b). The time-averaged clonal growth rates showed substantial inter-individual variation, especially in cases with unknown drivers (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). Combining all individuals with selection, we found that selected clones were born at approximately constant rate from early childhood to about 50 years of age (Fig. 6d; the leveling-off at 50 years likely reflects a technical limit of clone detection), suggesting that selection events in HSCs occur uniformly across life.

a, Estimated age of the selected clone (for the 12 cases introduced in Fig. 4 and the 6 cases introduced in Fig. 5; points, median; error bars, 80% credible intervals estimated from 1,000 posterior samples; parameters were estimated with the two-clone model from 270× WGS data, where available, and from 90× WGS data else; boxplots, median and interquartile range, whiskers extend to the largest and smallest value no further than 1.5× the interquartile range). b, Age of the second selected clone estimated with the two-clone model (for the ten cases introduced in Figs. 4 and 5; points, median; error bars, 80% credible intervals, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples; boxplots, median and interquartile range, whiskers extend to the largest and smallest value no further than 1.5× the interquartile range). c, Estimated growth rates for the 28 selected clones introduced in a and b (points, median; error bars, 80% credible intervals, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples; estimates were obtained with the two-clone model from 270× WGS data, where available, and from 90× WGS data else; boxplots, median and interquartile range, whiskers extend to the largest and smallest value no further than 1.5× the interquartile range). d, Cumulative distribution of estimated age at CH driver acquisition (median); shaded area, lower and upper bounds of the cumulative distribution of estimated age at CH driver acquisition based on 80% credible intervals of the estimated parameters; points and error bars, median and 80% credible intervals for the per-sample estimates, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples. Data are from the 28 selected clones introduced in a and b (estimates were obtained with the two-clone model from 270× WGS data, where available, and from 90× WGS data else).

We applied SCIFER to bulk WGS data (average coverage 175× ± 70) for 185 human brain samples from 131 individuals aged 4–95 years17. This cohort comprised samples from different brain regions (cortex, striatum, hippocampus) from 44 normal (neurotypical) individuals and 87 individuals with neurological disorders (autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome; Extended Data Fig. 10a).

First, we applied SCIFER to two cases (LIBD82 and NC7-CX-OLI) in which brain tumor-initiating driver mutations had been identified, despite no histological indication of malignancy17. In LIBD82, trisomy 7 and monosomy 10, characteristic of IDH-wild type glioblastoma40, were detected in the hippocampus, but not cortex. SCIFER detected a selected clone of a size concordant with the CNA allele frequency (Fig. 7a). In NC7-CX-OLI, the R140Q IDH2 hotspot mutation associated with IDH-mutant glioma46,47 was detected in cortical oligodendrocytes (NeuN–/Sox10+) and striatal interneurons (NeuN+/CITP2−). In both samples, SCIFER inferred selected clones, consistent with the VAFs of the IDH2 mutation (Fig. 7b). The striatal clone contained additional cancer-associated driver mutations (NRAS G12D and DNMT3A splice donor variants). Interestingly, SCIFER inferred that the striatal clone was both larger (~15% VAF) and younger (acquired at age 55 years) than the cortical clone (~7.5% VAF and acquired at age 35 years) and had a faster growth rate. Although SCIFER cannot distinguish whether all driver mutations co-occurred in the same cells, or whether different clones with indistinguishable sizes coexisted, the large clone size in striatal interneurons suggests that a subclone with additional driver mutations replaced the ancestral clone. In summary, SCIFER detected selected clones in brain samples associated with known driver mutations.

a, SCIFER fit to SSNVs measured in the hippocampus of LIBD82 (points and error bars, measured data and standard deviation, which, assuming Poisson-distributed measurements, is the square root of the measured data; purple area, 95% posterior probabilities of the model fit computed from simulations using 100 posterior samples; gray area, 80% credible interval of the clone size, estimated from 1,000 posterior samples; SCZ, schizophrenia). Red point, reported VAF of trisomy 7 and monosomy 10 (ref. 17). b, As in a, but for cortical oligodendrocytes and striatal interneurons of NC7 (red points, mean VAF; red lines, 95% CI based on binomial distributions with sample size and success probability of 26 and 0.15 and 29 and 0.07 (NC7-CX-OLI); 30 and 0.1, 33 and 0.06, 32 and 0.22, and 32 and 0.16 (NC7-STR-INT), corresponding to read coverage and measured VAF, respectively)17. c, As in a, but for LIBD87 (cortex) and TS1 (striatum). d, Model support for clonal selection (conditioned on clones with ≥5% VAF for <150× WGS and ≥2% VAF for ≥150×) and neutral evolution across 185 brain samples from 131 individuals. Dashed line, 15% selection threshold. e, Left, average incidence of clonal selection versus age (summarizing ages into 10 year-bins; in total, 36 of 131 individuals with selection; line and shaded area, LOESS regression with 95% CI). Right, age of individuals with (n = 36) and without selection (n = 95; boxplots, median and interquartile range, whiskers, largest and smallest value no further than 1.5× the interquartile range; P = 0.00002662, Wilcoxon test statistic W = 2,525, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). f, Median posterior stem cell parameter values by location (cortex, n = 128; hippocampus, n = 17; striatum, n = 40; boxplots, median and interquartile range, whiskers, largest and smallest value no further than 1.5× the interquartile range; points, outliers; P values, one-way analysis of variance with Kruskal–Wallis test). g, Estimated stem cell division rate versus age for 185 samples (median and 80% credible intervals computed from 1,000 posterior samples each; blue line and shaded area, LOESS regression with 95% CI). h, Cumulative distribution of estimated age at driver acquisition (median values of 44 samples with selection); lower and upper bounds based on 80% credible intervals (based on 1,000 posterior samples for each sample).

Across the cohort overall, SCIFER detected selected clones in 24% (44 of 185) of all samples (36 of 131 individuals; Fig. 7c,d). To independently validate these results, we compared the sizes of selected clones with the VAFs of CNAs reported in the original publication17 (which are not used by SCIFER). Three individuals harbored duplications on chromosome 2 (AN09412; chr. 2: 96200001–102400000) or chromosome 3 (TS1, chr. 3: 113070000–113240000 and NC6, chr. 3: 60800001–61300000); their VAFs agreed with the selected clone detected by SCIFER, thus corroborating the SCIFER results. The presence of selected clones increased with age (Fig. 7e) and was not significantly associated with clinical phenotype, sex or sample location in the brain (based on a generalized linear model taking into account age, location and phenotype; Extended Data Fig. 10b). SCIFER inferred ~105 stem cells, in cortex, striatum or hippocampus, that divide on average two or three times per year (Fig. 7f and Extended Data Fig. 10c). Because human brain consists of hardly renewing neurons and glia cells that renew and have a shorter lifespan48 we performed stochastic simulations to mirror this situation. These simulations suggest that VAFs measured in unsorted brain tissue report on the average renewal rate of these two subpopulations (Supplementary Note 1). Interestingly, the division rate of neural stem cells appears to decrease in the first 25 years of life, after which it remains constant (Fig. 7g). Between two divisions, they acquired typically fewer than two SSNVs (Extended Data Fig. 10c). SCIFER estimates that the vast majority of selected clones began to grow in the first 25 years of life (Fig. 7h). Consequently, elderly individuals had older clones (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Moreover, the clonal growth rate decreased with age (Extended Data Fig. 10d). The focused age incidence of clonal selection in the brain contrasts with the constant rate in hematopoiesis.

Here, we present a population genetics approach to detect clonal selection and quantify tissue stem cell dynamics from snapshot WGS data. Akin to recent approaches to cancer evolution37,38,40,49,50,51, our theory delineates how neutral evolution versus selection shape the somatic VAF spectra. Compared with previous work in tumors38,49, SCIFER explicitly treats genetic drift and its interplay with clonal selection, which is key for nonmalignant, homeostatic tissues. SCIFER identifies selection without knowledge of the underlying driver, detects whether more than one selected clone is present, and quantifies their age and selective advantage(s).

At 270×, SCIFER has a sensitivity of detecting clones at 2% VAF in a single bulk sample at a fraction of the cost and effort of single-cell colony-derived phylogenetic reconstruction. Recently, analysis of bulk WGS of blood samples aimed to identify CH, assuming selection increases total detected somatic variants52. Here, we found that this is not necessarily the case and hence would like to caution against using large SSNV count in a WGS sample as a sign of selection.

Agreement of HSC parameters inferred from one phylogenetic tree with neutral evolution2 and SCIFER from the 22 BM samples studied here is remarkable, because SCIFER strongly relies on variants with higher VAF emerging relatively early, whereas the phylodynamic inference uses low-VAF SSNVs generated later. This may indicate that HSC dynamics are rather uniform across time. Nevertheless, it is important to note that our inferred parameters are time-averaged. Because analysis of driver VAF in serial blood samples suggests that expansion rates may change over time12, it would be valuable to apply SCIFER to serial samples to quantify stem cell dynamics over time.

Our parameter inference suggests variation in HSC division rate between individuals. Indeed, mean telomere length has been shown to decrease faster in individuals with CH53, and longer telomere length is a causative risk factor for CH54,55, suggesting that long telomeres allow CH HSCs to undergo enhanced cell division. It should be kept in mind that our parameter estimates rely on the assumption of a constant mutation rate in HSCs along the human lifespan. During adult life, HSC mutation rate appears constant56; whether this is true in fetal development is unclear.

Consistent with previous studies12,13,14, we identified pervasive clonal selection in the absence of known drivers. However, in three cases selected clones were at the limit of detection, and were not found in the 90× data. Such clones just below the detection limit may affect the measured VAF distribution at low frequencies, and bias SCIFER to show an erroneously increased drift effect. This potential problem can be addressed by deeper sequencing, and potentially extending SCIFER to more than two clones (for which the online code provides an option).

Although the statistical power of the current study is limited, we observed several structural variants (SVs) previously described as recurrent somatic mutations57,58, associated with increased risk for hematological cancer21,58 (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Moreover, in-depth analyses of the genome-wide SSNV profiles revealed potential candidates for driver mutations (Supplementary Table 5), one of which had significantly higher ratios of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous SSNVs in ~200,000 UK Biobank blood samples25. By applying SCIFER to large cohorts it may be possible to more accurately determine the frequency of individuals with unknown driver events, and their clinical phenotype.

Applying SCIFER to brain tissue, we found clonal selection in ~25% of the samples. The prevalence of unknown drivers was even more pronounced than in hematopoiesis. Moreover, in two individuals, we found pre-malignant selected clones with characteristic brain tumor-initiating driver mutations without histological evidence of malignancy. This raises the question of how frequent pre-malignancy in the human brain is and whether the situation is similar to blood19,20. Selected clones in the brain were largely born in the first 25 years of life, coinciding with the period of extensive postnatal brain development59. Brain cell-type heterogeneity (neurons and glia cells) precludes a more accurate quantitation of the stem cell dynamics, which will require analysis of purified cell populations. Nevertheless, stochastic simulations suggest that VAFs in tissues composed of heterogeneous cell types reflect on average cell turnover (Supplementary Note 1). We envisage that SCIFER will be useful to study clonal selection in other solid organs in humans.

Patient samples were collected with informed consent under the Mechanisms of Age-Related Clonal Haematopoiesis (MARCH) Study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Yorkshire & The Humber – Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee (REC Ref17:/YH/0382).

Participants were recruited from individuals undergoing elective total hip replacement surgery at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Exclusion criteria were history of rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthritis, history of septic arthritis in the limb undergoing surgery, history of hematological cancer, bisphosphonate use and oral steroid use. Patient characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. At the time of surgery, trabecular bone fragments and BM aspirates were obtained from the femoral canal and collected in anticoagulated buffer containing acid–citrate–dextrose, heparin sodium and DNase. Samples of peripheral blood were collected in EDTA vacutainers. Hair follicle samples were collected from participants as a germline control. Peripheral blood and BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and viably frozen. Peripheral blood granulocytic cell pellets were frozen for later DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted from BM MNCs, peripheral blood granulocytes and hair follicles using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen).

Thawing media was prepared with IMDM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 110 µg ml−1 DNase. BM samples were thawed at 37 °C in a water bath, 1 ml of warm FBS was added and the suspension was then diluted by dropwise addition of 8 ml of thawing media. The suspension was centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min, cells were resuspended in flow cytometry staining medium (IMDM with 10% FBS and 10 μg ml−1 DNase), filtered through a 35-μm cell strainer and placed on ice.

Cells were stained with the following antibodies: anti-CD34-PE (1:160, BioLegend, clone 581), anti-CD3-PE/Cy7 (1:100, BioLegend, clone HIT3a), anti-CD2-PE/Cy5 (1:160, BioLegend, clone RPA-2.10), anti-CD4-PE/Cy5 (1:160, BioLegend, clone RPA-T4), anti-CD7-PE/Cy5 (1:160, BioLegend, clone CD7-6B7), anti-CD8a-PE/Cy5 (1:320, BioLegend, clone RPA-T8), anti-CD11b-PE/Cy5 (1:160, BioLegend, clone ICRF44), anti-CD14-PE/Cy5 (1:160, eBioscience, clone 61D3), anti-CD19-PE/Cy5 (1:160, BioLegend, clone HIB19), anti-CD20-PE/Cy5 (1:160, BioLegend, clone 2H7), anti-CD56-PE/Cy5 (1:80, BioLegend, clone MEM188) and anti-CD235ab-PE/Cy5 (1:320, BioLegend, clone HIR2). Following antibody incubations, cells were washed with 1 ml of flow cytometry staining buffer, centrifuged at 350 g for 5 min and resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer containing 1:10,000 Hoechst 33342 live–dead stain.

Cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria Fusion or Sony MA900 equipped with a 100-µm nozzle or sorting chip. Unstained, single-stained and fluorescence-minus-one controls were used to determine background staining and compensation in each channel. Doublets and dead cells were excluded. The following populations were sorted with a mean purity >95%: Lin–CD34+ HSPCs, Lin+CD3+ T cells and Lin+/–CD34–CD3– MNCs. Genomic DNA from sorted cell populations was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen).

Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit (cat. no. 20018704) and Nextera DNA CD Indexes (cat. no. 20018707) according to manufacturer's guidelines. The Qubit HS DNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, cat. no. Q32854) and a tape station run with the Agilent HS D5000 Assay Kit (cat. no. 5067-5593) were used for quality control. Thereafter, libraries were diluted to 10 nM, pooled and sequenced on either HiSeq X PE150 or on NovaSeq 6000 PE150.

Low-quality bases on raw sequencing reads were trimmed using Trim Galore v.0.5.0 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) with cutadapt v.2.8 (ref. 60) with the following settings: --quality 30, --illumina --length 32 --trim-n --clir_R1 2 --clip_R2 2 --three_prime_clip_R1 2 --three_prime_clip_R2 2. Trimmed read pairs were mapped to the human reference genome (build 37 with the GRCh37.75 genome annotation) using bwa mem v.0.7.12 (ref. 61). Mapped reads were coordinate-sorted with samtools sort v.1.5 (ref. 61), followed by marking duplicate read pairs with gatk MarkDuplicates v.4.0.9.0 (ref. 62) and indexing with samtools index.

Somatic SNVs and small insertions–deletions (indels) in BM and blood samples were called with Strelka v.2.9.2 (ref. 63) and Mutect2, GATK v.4.2.0.0 (ref. 62), using the matched hair follicle samples as the germline control. Variants in repeat regions and simple repeat regions (downloaded from UCSC table browser, setting the assembly to hg19, the track to ‘RepeatMasker' or ‘Simple Repeats'; accession date: 5 December 2018) were filtered using bedtools intersect v.2.24.0 (ref. 64). Only variants that passed the default filters of both Strelka and Mutect2 were retained. To identify remaining germline variants, variants were looked up in dbSNP (v.150) and the population frequency of reported variants was annotated based on the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD v.2.1.1; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). Variants were then filtered to exclude potential contamination of germline variants based on the global allele frequency (AF) of gnomAD (retaining variants with AF < 0.001). In a few cases, a CH driver was identified by panel sequencing at low VAF, but not recovered by Strelka and Mutect; here, we re-examined the respective position using bcftools mpileup v.1.10.2 (ref. 65). All variants were annotated with ANNOVAR (v.May2018; http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/)66 according to the human genome build v.19. For SSNVs, VAFs were recalculated directly from the BAM files using alleleCounter v.4.0.2 (https://github.com/cancerit/alleleCount; with default base and mapping quality thresholds) and MaC (https://github.com/nansari-pour/MaC).

Genome-wide subclonal CNAs were identified with Battenberg (v.2.2.10; https://github.com/Wedge-lab/battenberg), which has been described in detail previously67.

SVs from whole-genome data were identified using Manta v.1.6.0 (ref. 68) with default tumor–normal pair settings comparing samples with the germline controls. We kept variants that passed Manta's default filter, had a minimal SOMATICSCORE of 30, were not classified as IMPRECISE, had at least three variants and a VAF of 5% in the blood sample, and at most two variant reads and VAF < 5% in the control sample. SVs previously described in somatic tissues57,58 and associated with hematological cancer21,58 were classified as putative drivers (Supplementary Table 7).

To comprehensively search for candidate driver mutations, we concatenated published lists of putative driver genes in CH and leukemia from Intogen69 (subsetting genes described in ‘ALL', ‘AML', ‘CLL', ‘CML' or ‘MM' from release 2020.02.01, and the CH gene list from ref. 70), Cosmic71 v.94 (subsetting on genes with annotation in leukemia), ref. 13, and a curated list of CH-associated mutations compiled from five large studies19,20,27,30,72,73.

Mutations identified by Strelka and targeting any of these genes were looked up in ClinVar74 (v.20221231) and annotated accordingly. Using the R package drawProteins75 v.1.18.0 we collected information on the protein domain targeted by each variant. Moreover, we manually annotated variant information (involvement in disease, functional evidence for mutations at this site, SNP identifier (SNPID), association with genetic disorders and whether the variant targets a functional domain) using the manually curated variant information ‘homo_sapiens_variation.txt' from Uniprot76 (downloaded 4 April 2023) and variant information provided on www.uniprot.org. Thereafter, we computed SIFT77 and Revel78 prediction scores for each substitution. We kept variants causing a ‘stopgain', ‘stoploss', ‘frameshift_insertion' or ‘frameshift_deletion', or with 'Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity', ‘Likely pathogenic', ‘Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic' or of ‘uncertain significance' according to ClinVar, or annotated to a related disease (based on uniprot.org) or annotated as pathogenic (uniprot.org) or with a REVEL score ≥0.75 or targeting either ASXL1, or DNMT3A or TET2.

This yielded a set of variant positions, which we merged with curated positions in known CH drivers27. Based on this set, we re-called variants in all blood and control samples with bcftools mpileup65 v.1.10.2, using the option -p, and bcftools call, using the option -mA. Variant calls were performed in batches and merged using bcftools merge. In the final set, we kept variants targeting any of ASXL1, DNMT3A or TET2 and variants that were found on at least three reads in the sample and on fewer than five reads in the controls.

We tested our population genetics model on published single-cell WGS data from refs. 2,12,13. To this end, we computed pseudo-bulk VAFs from the single-cell phylogenies as

where nvariant cells is the number of cells harboring a variant and ncells is the total number of sequenced cells; the factor 2 accounts for diploidy.

We fit our population genetics model to the cumulative VAF distribution truncated at 0.01, as detailed below and using the prior probabilities outlined in Supplementary Table 7.

To assess differences in variant calling pipelines, we re-called SSNVs and indels in the data from ref. 2. To this end, we intersected the results between Mutect2 (ref. 62) and Strelka2 (ref. 63), filtered remaining germline variants using gnomAD (retaining variants with AF <0.001) and recalculated VAFs directly from the BAM files using alleleCounter v.4.0.2 (https://github.com/cancerit/alleleCount; with default base and mapping quality thresholds) and MaC (https://github.com/nansari-pour/MaC). We filtered the remaining variants as stated in ref. 2. In brief, we removed variants occurring in >120 of the 140 colonies, variants that fell within 10 bp of each other and variants with a coverage <6 on autosomes or <3 on sex chromosomes in more than five samples. Moreover, we retained only variants with a mean VAF > 0.3 across all samples with at least one mutant read. Finally, we excluded sites at which >10% of the samples with at least one mutant read had a VAF < 0.1.

We reconstructed single-cell phylogenies based on the re-called SSNVs and indels from ref. 2 by converting the mutation table into a fasta file, learning the phylogenetic tree using MPBoot v.1.1.0 (ref. 79) and plotting the tree using custom scripts from ref. 13 (https://github.com/emily-mitchell/normal_haematopoiesis/).

SSNVs of 457 human brain samples were downloaded from ref. 17. Of these, we analyzed 177 samples with an average coverage >100×, as well as 8 samples from individual NC7 (NC7-CX-ASTMIG, NC7-CX-INT, NC7-CX-OLI, NC7-CX-PYR, NC7-STR-ASTMIG, NC7-STR-INT, NC7-STR-MSN and NC7-STR-OLI) that contained multiple known driver mutations but had average coverage between 32× and 40× (Supplementary Table 8). Both tier1 and tier2 variant calls were used for analysis.

We modeled the evolution of VAFs mechanistically, accounting for accumulation, drift and selection of somatic variants in a homeostatic tissue. The model is parametrized with the rate at which HSCs divide during adulthood, λ, the number of SSNVs acquired between two cell divisions, μ, the number of HSCs during adulthood, Nss, as well as the time of origin of the selected clone, ts, and its selective advantage expressed by r. We bundled the model functions in an R package, SCIFER, available on https://github.com/VerenaK90/SCIFER.

The time-dependent site frequency spectrum Si(t) gives the number of variants with clone size i, where i ranges from some minimally observable clone size (owing to WGS sequencing depth) up to the total number of stem cells N(t). We derive analytical expressions for the site frequency spectra (SFS) resulting from neutral evolution and clonal selection and compare these with measured VAF histograms.

To begin with neutral evolution, we develop a stochastic model for accumulation and drift of neutral somatic variants during developmental expansion and subsequent homeostasis of the stem cell pool. The model assumes that stem cells proliferate via symmetric self-renewing divisions, with rate λ, and are lost by differentiation and cell death, with rate δ. Between two subsequent stem cell divisions, on average μ new variants are introduced. These variants are inherited to daughter cells and, depending on the dynamics of the corresponding stem cell clone, may either go extinct or drift to variable frequencies. The SFS generated by these dynamics is:

describing the generation of new variants at time t′, in a population of size N(t′), and their drift to clone size i up to the time of measurement t with probability P1,i(t,t′). To compare Si(t) with measured VAF histograms, we transform from clone size to VAF:

To describe developmental expansion of the stem cell pool followed by homeostasis, we concatenated linear birth–death processes. During development, the division rate will exceed the loss rate, λexp > δexp, hence defining a supercritical birth–death process. At time t1, the system reaches its steady-state with a constant number of active stem cells, Nss. The cellular dynamics are now appropriately described by a critical birth–death process with steady-state rate λss = δss.

To compute the SFS during developmental expansion, we consider the probability that a cell acquiring a new variant will expand to a clone of size a in time t (ref. 80):

with

The measured VAF histograms report on the number of variants with a given frequency. To calculate variant number in the model, we note that between time t′ and t′ + dt′ on average μλexpN(t′)dt′ variants are generated. Hence,

variants introduced at time t′ each occur in a cells at time t.

During tissue homeostasis, when stem cell division and loss will occur both at steady-state rate λss, drift is described by the critical birth–death process. A variant in a cells at t1 (when the homeostatic stem cell number is reached) will drift to occur in b cells within time t with probability80

with

Thus, at t ≥ t1, the number of variants occurring exactly in b cells is

for variants generated during developmental expansion (t′ < t1).

Finally, we consider variants acquired during homeostasis, which evolve according to the critical birth–death process entirely. Hence, the number of such variants occurring exactly in b cells is

where t′ ≥ t1. Combining the contribution of both phases, we arrive at the SFS of neutral variants in a homeostatic tissue without selection:

Equation (8) generalizes a result by Ohtsuki and Innan81 for expanding tissues.

Modeling a single selected clone in a homeostatic tissue. Clonal selection will modify the SFS. Consider that a positively selected mutation is acquired at time ts and reduces the rate of stem cell loss by the factor r < 1 (the alternative for imparting selective advantage, an increase in the rate of stem cell division, yields very similar results). The cell number of mutated stem cells, n2(t), expands at the expense of the number of normal stem cells, n1(t) = Nss − n2(t), according to the competition model

The ρ parameters denote phenomenological competition coefficients between and in the mutant clone and the normal stem cells, maintaining homeostasis. We have no further growth if either normal or mutated stem cells fill the entire compartment, g(Nss, 0) = 0 = h(0, Nss) and g(0, Nss) = 0 = h(Nss, 0), implying that \({\rho }_{{n}_{1},{n}_{1}}=1={\rho }_{{n}_{2},{n}_{2}}\). Moreover, \({\rho }_{{n}_{2},{n}_{1}}=r\) and hence

The number of mutant stem cells n2(t) will remain much smaller than the number of normal stem cells for extended periods, and hence we approximate equation (11) by

Equations (10) and (12) will be used when computing the SFS.

With clonal selection, the SFS has three principal contributions for somatic variants originating: (1) before the positively selected mutation occurred, Si,1; (2) after this mutation occurred and happening in the mutant clone, Si,2; and (3) after the mutation occurred but happening in normal stem cells, Si,3:

We specify each contribution in turn. The SFS in the mutant clone, Si,2, is

where Pexp,1,i is given by equation (1).

The SFS in normal stem cells, Si,1 and Si,3, are shaped by the decline in the number of normal stem cells after tS (equation (10)). We approximate this process with a subcritical birth–death process with division rate λss and effective loss rate δeff(t). The loss rate is chosen such that the expectation of the decline of normal stem cells in the linear birth–death process equals the number of normal stem cells lost by the competition dynamics, D. Equation (10) implies that

Therefore, the effective loss rate δeff(t) is defined by

The SFS of variants acquired in normal stem cells after ts, Si,3, is the superposition of (Nss − 1) independent linear subcritical birth–death processes and is given by

Finally, we compute the SFS of variants acquired before ts, Si,1. These variants may be inherited to the selected clone, in which case they will be present in all selected cells and, additionally, in some of the normal cells. Alternatively, they may be present in normal cells only. To distinguish the two cases, we consider a variant that was acquired before ts and is present in k cells at ts. Assuming that the driver mutation is acquired in a random cell, the probability of this variant being inherited to the selected clone is \(\frac{k}{{N}_{\text{ss}}}\), while the probability of this variant being exclusively present in normal cells is \(\frac{1-k}{{N}_{\text{ss}}}\). In the former case, all n2(t) selected cells will harbor the variant at the time of measurement, t; in addition, the k − 1 normal stem cells harboring the variant at time tS may reach a clone size between 0 and Nss − n2(t), according to the drift dynamics of normal stem cells. In the alternative case, the variant does not end up in the selected clone and hence solely drifts in the normal cells. Taken together, this yields

where Sk(ts) is the SFS at ts and Pexp,a,b is the clone size distribution generated by a subcritical birth–death process initiated by a cells80:

Thus, we have specified the contributions to the SFS of a stem cell population containing a selected clone, Si(t) = Si,1(t) + Si,2(t) + Si,3(t).

Modeling a single selected clone without size compensation. We here develop a version of our model in which the selected clone expands unrestrictedly. We assume a constant number Nss of normal stem cells, whereas the selected clone exponentially expands. Hence, the population dynamics of normal (n1) and mutant (n2) stem cells now read

As before, the SFS comprises variants that originated (1) before the positively selected mutation occurred, Si,1; (2) after this mutation occurred and happening in the mutant clone, Si,2; and (iii) after the mutation occurred but happening in normal stem cells, Si,3. Si,2 is the same as in the competition model and is modeled by equation (14). Si,3 is now the superposition of Nss independent linear critical birth–death processes and reads

Likewise, Si,1 is now governed by genetic drift according to a critical birth–death process in the founder cell population, in addition to selection of the mutant clone. It reads

Modeling multiple selected clones in a homeostatic tissue. In the following, we generalize our model to account for the selection of multiple competing clones in a homeostatic tissue. We use τc to denote the time at which a particular clone c was born, where c = 1 identifies normal cells and 1 < c ≤ C identifies the C − 1 selected clones. For each clone the variable vc reports the identity of its mother clone. We assume that all clones compete for a limited space with carrying capacity Nss. As with the one-clone model, we implement clonal selection as a reduction in the loss rates, while leaving division rates unchanged. Denoting the competition coefficient between clone c and other clones in the tissue with \({\rho }_{c\bullet }\), we model the expected number of cells in clone c, nc, with a system of ordinary differential equations,

with conditions

The competition matrix ρ is defined by the selective advantages, and, requiring Σjnj = Nss at all times, is given by

where rc models a reduction of cell loss in clone c at τc and takes values 0 < rc < 1. Ultimately, we are interested in Si(t), the expected number of variants that are found in a clone of size i at the time of measurement, t. As in the one-clone model, Si(t) has contributions from variants acquired in normal cells and variants acquired in the selected clones. In the following, we denote the SFS of variants acquired in a particular clone with Si,c(t). Hence,

To evaluate Si,c(t), we denote with \({\phi }_{c}\) the set of subclones generated by a mutation in clone c, in the following termed ‘daughters' of clone c, and with \(\varphi \subset {\phi }_{c}\) the set of all possible combinations of \({\phi }_{c}\). Finally, the set Ψc denotes the entire progeny of clone c, including daughters, granddaughters and so on. Consider a variant that was acquired in clone c and is present in k cells at time t′. This variant will, on average, be inherited to the daughter clone \(d,d\in {\phi }_{c}\), with probability

where H is the heavyside step function and τd is the birth date of clone d. Considering a particular subset of daughters of clone c, \({\varphi }_{j}\in \varphi\), the probability of inheriting the variant to all daughters in this subset is, on average,

We compute Si,c(t) by considering all possible combinations of daughters that may inherit variants acquired in clone c. This yields

where Pc(1,i,t′,t) is the probability that a variant acquired in clone c has drifted to i cells within a time span t − t′. Specifically, Pc(1,i,t′,t) is defined by nonlinear birth–death processes, because the division and loss rates in clone c change with time, subject to the dynamics in equation (23). In analogy to the one-clone model, we approximate this nonlinearity by modeling Si,c(t) with linear birth–death processes in a step-wise fashion, considering time intervals between clonal birth dates, τ turning points in n(t) (as determined by numeric evaluation of equation (23)) and the end point as time points of interest. Specifically, we modeled the drift of somatic variants in each time interval using linear birth–death processes, which we parametrized with an effective loss rate of cells in clone c, \({\delta }_{\text{eff},c,{t}_{a}\le t < {t}_{b}},\) and which we evaluated for an effective time span \({\varDelta }_{\text{eff},{c,t}_{a}\le t < {t}_{b}}\), where ta and tb denote the start and end point of the interval. To define \({\delta }_{\text{eff},c,{t}_{a}\le t < {t}_{b}}\) and \({\varDelta }_{c,\text{eff},{t}_{a}\le t < {t}_{b}}\), we distinguished the case when the number of cells in clone c increased (nc(tb) > nc(ta)) from the case when it decreased (nc(tb) < nc(ta)) during the time interval (ta,tb). If nc(tb) > nc(ta), we defined \({\delta }_{\text{eff},c,{(t}_{a},{t}_{b})}={r}_{c}{\lambda }_{\text{ss}}\) and, to avoid overshooting the actual clone size, \({\varDelta }_{{\rm{eff}},c,(t_{a},{t}_{b})}=\frac{\log {n}_{c}({t}_{b})/{n}_{c}({t}_{a})}{{\lambda }_{\text{ss}}(1-{r}_{c})}\). By contrast, if nc(tb) < nc(ta), we parametrized \({\delta }_{\text{eff},c{(,t}_{a},{t}_{b})}\) such that the expected decline in a linear birth–death process equals the number of cells lost by competition dynamics. Hence, \({\delta }_{{\text{eff}},c({t}_{a},{t}_{b})}\) is defined by

where the right-hand side gives the number of death events in clone c according to the competition dynamics in equation (23) and the left-hand side gives the number of death events according to a linear birth–death process. Moreover, if nc(tb) < nc(ta), we defined \({\varDelta }_{c,{\rm{eff}},({t}_{a},{t}_{b})}={t}_{b}-{t}_{a}\). We then approximated Si,c(t) by recursively evaluating

until tb = t. Here, terms (A) and (B) compute the drift of variants acquired before ta, of which some (A) will be inherited to subclones of clone c, whereas others (B) will be found exclusively in clone c. Finally, term (C) computes the drift of variants newly acquired in the time interval (ta,tb).

Model fits were obtained for each donor separately. In a first step, clonal selection was distinguished from genetic drift by applying the one-clone model of SCIFER to the data. For blood samples classified as selected and sequenced at high resolution (≥150× WGS), subsequent refinement was achieved by applying the two-clone model in a second step. Here, both possible topologies between two selected clones (linear and branched evolution) were tested, using prior distributions that were informed by the initial one-clone model fits (Supplementary Table 10; note that constraining the prior distributions based on the one-clone model fits facilitates the detection of additional subclones). All model fits were performed using ABC based on sequential Monte Carlo as implemented in pyABC82 (posterior sample size of 1,000 and termination criterion εmin = 0.05). Briefly, ABC samples parameter sets from user-defined prior distributions (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10) and simulates the expected VAF distribution for each parameter set. The simulated VAF distributions are compared with the measured ones and the 1,000 parameter sets by minimal distance between measured and simulated data are selected. In each of the following iterations, the parameter set is expanded by adding random noise to the current parameter set, and the distance between model and data is reassessed. ABC is terminated once the distance between model and data is smaller than a defined threshold, εmin, yielding an estimate for the posterior distributions of the model parameters. We performed the following steps in each ABC iteration:

[Experimental data]: Determine the cumulative VAF distribution at time t for the experimental data. For 90× bulk WGS data from human BM or peripheral blood samples, include variants if they are supported by at least 3 reads, absent in the germline control sample, and if the locus is covered by at least 10 and at most 300 reads. For 270× bulk WGS data from human CD34+ HSPCs, include variants if they are supported by at least 3 reads. For pseudo-bulk WGS data, include all variants. For bulk WGS data from human brain, include all tier1–tier2 variants from ref. 17. Compute the cumulative number of VAFs ≥f, defined as \({M}_{\text{experimental},\;f}={\sum }_{\text{VAF}=f}^{1}{\;S}_{\text{experimental},\text{VAF}},\) where Sexperimental denotes the measured SFS and Sexperimental,VAF is the number of variants with a particular VAF. We evaluated Mexperimental,f for bins with width 0.01, spanning 0.05 ≤ f ≤ 1 for bulk WGS data with an average coverage <150×, 0.02 ≤ f ≤ 1 for bulk WGS data with an average coverage ≥150×, and 0.01 ≤ f ≤ 1 for pseudo-bulk data.

[Model]: Sample parameters from their prior distributions (Supplementary Table 9, one-clone model; Supplementary Table 10, two-clone model).

[Model]: Simulate the expected cumulative VAF distribution, Msim,f(tdata), where tdata is the age of the patient and f the minimal VAF (for numerical implementation of the model see Supplementary Note 4). The bins are as with the experimental data. Depending on the following criterion, based on the prior parameter sample, the cumulative VAF histogram is simulated with either the neutral model or the selection model: if a selected clone could grow above the detection limit with the prior parameter sample, the selection model is used; otherwise the neutral model is used. Formally, if \(\frac{1}{2}{\rm{e}}^{{\lambda }_{{\rm{SS}}}^{{\rm{prior}}}(1-{r}^{{\rm{prior}}})({t}_{\text{data}}-{t}_{{\rm{S}}}^{{\rm{prior}}})}\ge \gamma {N}_{{\rm{SS}}}^{{\rm{prior}}}\) (one-clone model) or if any \(\frac{1}{2}{n}_{c,c > 1}\left({t}_{{\rm{data}}}|{\lambda }_{{\rm{SS}}}^{{\rm{prior}}},{{\tau }^{{\rm{prior}}},r}^{{\rm{prior}}},\phi ,\psi {,N}_{{\rm{SS}}}^{{\rm{prior}}}\right)\ge \gamma {N}_{{\rm{SS}}}^{{\rm{prior}}}\) (two-clone model) then the selection model is used. The detection limit is set to ɣ = 0.025 for 90× and 30× WGS data, and ɣ = 0.005 for pseudo-bulk and 270× bulk WGS data. Importantly, note that the selection model can return a posterior corresponding to neutral evolution.

[Model]: Add the number of variants present in the founder cell of the hematopoietic system, \({\varDelta }_{{\rm{clonal}}}^{{\rm{prior}}}\), to Msim,0.5 (corresponding to mutations acquired during early development).

[Model]: Simulate experimental error of sequencing. To this end, generate the expected SFS for the jth frequency bin, Ssim(fj) = Msim(fj) − Msim(fj+1). For bulk WGS data, sample for each simulated variant a sequencing coverage ϑ from a Poisson distribution with mean \(\hat{\vartheta }\) corresponding to the average sequencing depth. Thereafter, sample VAFs for each variant according to \(\frac{B\left(f,\vartheta \right)}{\vartheta}\), where B denotes the binomial distribution and f is the true VAF in the tissue. Discard variants supported by less than 3 reads. For pseudo-bulk WGS data, sample VAFs for each variant according to \(\frac{B\left(2f,{n}_{\text{cells}}\right)}{(2{n}_{\text{cells}})}\), where \({n}_{\text{cells}}\) is the number of sequenced single-cell clones. Compute the sampled cumulative VAF distribution, Msim,f,sampled.

[Model versus Experimental data]: Determine the distance function for ABC

We classified pseudo-bulks and samples sequenced at <150× as selected if at least 15% of the posterior samples report a selected clone size ≥0.1. These thresholds were defined based on in silico generated test data, and correspond to the WGS depth of 90× (Fig. 2). WGS data with ≥150× coverage allow for higher resolution and hence, we classified cases as selected if at least 15% of the posterior samples report a selected clone size ≥0.04 according to the one-clone model, and as harboring two selected clones if at least 15% of the posterior samples report a size ≥0.04 for both selected clones. Upon sample classification, we computed the 80% highest density intervals for each parameter on the parameter subsets supporting neutral evolution or clonal selection, respectively.

We validated the population genetics model with simulated data, generated according to stochastic birth–death processes (see Supplementary Note 5 for a description of the simulations and https://github.com/VerenaK90/SCIFER for their computational implementation).

Simulations used to evaluate model performance (Fig. 2) were run for stem cells only. Simulations of neutral evolution were parametrized with Nss,S = 25,000, μ = 1, λss,S = 10 per year, δss,S = 10 per year and with τ = 250 (that is, summarizing 1% of the reactions occurring in 25,000 stem cells). Simulations of clonal selection were parametrized with Nss,S = 25,000, μ = 1, λss,S = 10 per year, δss,S = 10 per year, ts = 20 years, s = 0.02 and with τ = 2,500.

Simulations of neutral evolution used to assess the effect of differentiation into a single progenitor cell population on the VAF histogram were parametrized with Nss,S = 1,000, μ = 1, λss,S = 1 per year, δss,S = 1 per year, Nss,P = 2,500, λss,P = 4.6 per year, δss,S = 5 per year and τ = 2,500.

Simulations of neutral evolution in a heterogenous tissue where stem cells differentiate into two progenitor cell types during development, but continue to produce only one of them during adulthood were parametrized with Nss,S = 1,000, μ = 1, λss,S = 1 per year, \({\delta }_{\text{ss},\text{S} > {P}_{1}}\) = 1 per year, \({\delta }_{\text{ss},\text{S} > {P}_{2}}\) = 0 per year, \({N}_{\text{ss},{P}_{1}}\) = 6,000 \({\lambda }_{\text{ss},{P}_{1}}\) = 3 per year, \({\delta }_{\text{ss},{P}_{1}}\) = 3.167 per year, \({N}_{\text{ss},{P}_{2}}\) = 4,000, \({\lambda }_{\text{ss},{P}_{2}}\) = 0 per year, \({\delta }_{\text{ss},{P}_{2}}\) = 0 per year and τ = 1,000.

To infer the dynamic stem cell parameters (μ, δexp, λss,S, Nss,S, ts, r) (Fig. 2), we subsampled 10,000 cells from the simulated trees at time points specified in Supplementary Table 1 and computed the simulated VAF distribution from subsampled trees. To account for technical noise, we simulated sequencing by sampling for each variant a sequencing coverage \(\vartheta \propto {Pois}(\hat{\vartheta })\), where ϑ is the average sequencing coverage and thereafter sampling mutant reads according to B(VAF,ϑ), where B is the binomial distribution. We simulated VAFs for average sequencing coverages of 30×, 90× and 270×, and fitted the population genetics model to the simulated bulk WGS data as described above for the real data.

To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the out model, we analyzed the posterior probability of clonal selection. In accordance with the minimal clone sizes used in the inference setup (see above), we computed the probability of clonal selection as \(P\left({\rm{selection}}\right)=\frac{{\sum }_{i}\frac{{n}_{2}({t}_{\text{data}}|{\theta }_{i})}{{N}_{\text{ss},i}}\ge 0.05}{{\sum }_{i}1}\) for 30× and 90× sequencing depths, and as \(P\left({\rm{selection}}\right)=\frac{{\sum }_{i}\frac{{n}_{2}({t}_{\text{data}}|{\theta }_{i})}{{N}_{\text{ss},i}}\ge 0.01}{{\sum }_{i}1}\) for 270× sequencing depth, where \({n}_{2}({t}_{\text{data}}|{\theta }_{i})\) is the size of the selected clone at the patient age, tdata, given the ith parameter sample, θi, and Nss,i is the ith estimate of the stem cell number. Among all parameter sets reporting a clone size ≥0.05 (30× and 90× coverage) or ≥0.01 (270× coverage), we determined median clone size and, if they were at least 5% in size, rounded it with 5% accuracy, or else rounded them with 1% accuracy. Thereafter, we computed the sensitivity and specificity of our approach, by classifying cases as selected if P(selection) ≥ β, varying the threshold β between 1% and 100%. For each of the true clone sizes (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 50%, 75%; Supplementary Table 1), we computed the number of true positives as the number of cases where the actual clone size was correctly inferred (we classified inferred clone sizes between 0.5 and 1.5 of the actual clone size as correct). Conversely, we computed the number of false positives as the number of cases in which SCIFER erroneously reported a particular clone size, albeit the actual clone size was zero.

The difference between true positives and false positives was maximal for β = 15%. At this threshold, clones of size ≥5% VAF were reliably inferred (90×).

Shown are the VAF distributions for selective advantages (s) ranging between 0.05 and 0.95, and stem cell numbers ranging between 5,000 and 1 M. d, Parameter estimation with approximate Bayesian computation. First, the expected variant allele frequency histogram is analytically computed. Then, sequencing noise is simulated by drawing from a binomial distribution with average 90x coverage. The modelled cumulative distribution is compared to the measured data for varying VAFs (1% step size).

Senate Republicans on Tuesday passed President Donald Trump's sprawling tax and spending package, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” paving the way for a major overhaul of the country's Medicaid program. If passed by the House, which could happen before the July Fourth holiday, millions of people stand to lose their health insurance.

The number of people without health insurance in the United States nearly halved from 2013 to 2023, falling from around 14 percent to a record low of less than 8 percent, largely driven by coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act. That rate has held relatively steady over the past few years, with around 26 million people in the US currently without health insurance.

But the Republican budget bill making its way through Congress would likely cause those numbers to surge, adding millions of people to the rolls of the uninsured. A review from the end of June by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates cuts of nearly $1 trillion from the Medicaid program and a loss of coverage for almost 12 million Americans by 2034 under the Senate version of the bill. (The legislation could still undergo last-minute changes before being passed.)

“Cuts to federal health care spending of this magnitude are likely to have consequences for hospitals and could lead some to lay off staff, offer fewer services, or close altogether. On top of that, with nearly 12 million people projected to lose health insurance, many would have a harder time affording needed care,” says Zack Levison, a health policy expert at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research, polling, and news organization.

The White House says the cuts will help root out “waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs to preserve and protect them for those who rely most on them.”

One of the ways the bill would restrict access to coverage is by imposing a work requirement to enroll in Medicaid, which provides health coverage for 72 million low-income and disabled Americans. There has never been a federal work requirement for people to receive Medicaid benefits—only assessments of a person's income and disability status—and the majority of adults in the program are already working or looking for work.

Under the bill, adults would be required to work or volunteer 80 hours a month to qualify for enrollment. Disabled and pregnant individuals would qualify for exemptions, and the Senate-passed version would allow parents with children under the age of 14 to apply for exemptions. The House version would have allowed all parents of dependent children to do so.

Deborah Greenhouse, a pediatrician in South Carolina and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, worries about parents navigating the new exemption system. “This bill will be catastrophic for children with Medicaid,” she says. It could impose bureaucratic red tape for those who do qualify for exemptions, and some parents may not be able to meet the work requirement if they have older children with special needs.

The bill would also require states to determine Medicaid eligibility redeterminations at least every six months, instead of the current annual check. It means individuals would need to reapply to the program more often to make sure they remain eligible, which could be a hurdle to non-English speakers, people with low literacy, and others.

Another way the GOP plan would limit access to coverage is by making it harder to buy health plans through the insurance marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. The bill shortens the open enrollment period by a month and also doesn't allow plans to be automatically renewed. Policyholders would instead be required to update certain personal information in order to retain coverage.

In a letter to the Senate, Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, says the loss of coverage resulting from the bill “will result in additional uncompensated care for hospitals and health systems, which will affect their ability to serve all patients.”

The GOP's plan would also limit a mechanism states use to help fund their Medicaid programs, called provider taxes, which are levied on hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers. Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states, with the federal government paying for a certain percentage of state Medicaid expenditures. Higher provider taxes increase state Medicaid spending, which often results in increased federal reimbursement. The Paragon Institute, a conservative health think tank, has called the practice “legalized money laundering.”

The Congressional Budget Office expects that states would need to modify their Medicaid programs by taking measures such as reducing provider payment rates, reducing the scope or amount of certain health care services, and reducing Medicaid enrollment.

Jake Haselswerdt, associate professor of government and public affairs at the University of Missouri, who studies Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, says the bill will have broad implications for the Medicaid program. “States are basically going to have to figure out other ways to pay for the things they've been paying for,” he says.

United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is asking tech companies to pitch digital forensics tools that are designed to process and analyze text messages, pictures, videos, and contacts from seized phones, laptops, and other devices at the United States border, according to documents reviewed by WIRED.

The agency said in a federal registry listing that the tools it's seeking must have very specific capabilities, such as the ability to find a “hidden language” in a person's text messages; identify specific objects, “like a red tricycle,” across different videos; access chats in encrypted messaging apps; and “find patterns” in large datasets for “intel generation.” The listing was first posted on June 20 and updated on July 1.

CBP has been using Cellebrite to extract and analyze data from devices since 2008. But the agency said that it wants to “expand” and modernize its digital forensics program. Last year, CBP claims, it did searches on more than 47,000 electronic devices—which is slightly higher than the approximately 41,500 devices it searched in 2023 but a dramatic rise from 2015, when it searched just more than 8,500 devices.

The so-called request for information (RFI) comes amid a string of reports of CBP detaining people entering the US, sometimes questioning them about their travel plans or political beliefs, and at times collecting and searching their phones. In one high-profile incident in March, a Lebanese professor at Brown University's medical school was sent back to Lebanon after authorities searched her phone and alleged she was “sympathetic” to the former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in September 2024.

In the RFI, CBP said that the digital forensics vendor it chooses will sign a contract in the third fiscal quarter of 2026, which runs from April through June. CBP has eight active contracts for Cellebrite software, licenses, equipment, and training—worth more than $1.3 million in total—that will end between July 2025 and April 2026. CBP appears to use tools other than Cellebrite. The agency said in the recent listing that it uses “a wide variety of digital data extraction tools,” but it doesn't name these tools.

CBP did not respond to requests for comment. Cellebrite spokesperson Victor Cooper tells WIRED that the company is “unable to comment on active requests for information proposals.”

Three federal contract listings mention that CBP pays for Cellebrite's Universal Forensic Extraction Device 4PC, software designed to analyze data on a user's existing PC or laptop. The listing for the “license renewal” doesn't mention a specific product but may be referring to the Investigative Digital Intelligence Platform, which is Cellebrite's “end-to-end” suite of tools of analyzing data from devices.

Across Cellebrite's intelligence platform, users have a wide range of capabilities. It can sort images based on whether they contain certain elements, like jewelry, handwriting, or documents. It can also go through text messages, as well as direct messages on apps like TikTok, and filter out messages that mention certain topics, like evidence obstruction, family, or the police. Users can also unveil photos “hidden” by a device owner, make social maps of friends and contacts, and plot the locations where a person sent text messages.

A blog on Cellebrite's website about the January 6 insurrection cites a Washington Post report claiming that Cellebrite produced “more than 12,000 pages of data,” “2,600 pages of Facebook records,” and 800 photos and videos from a single person. (On his first day in office, President Trump gave clemency to every person who was charged in connection to actions on January 6, which amounted to nearly 1,600 people.)

Cellebrite also has a controversial history. The company launched a tool in February that lets customers use AI to summarize chat logs and audio from phones. In December, Amnesty International claimed in a report that Serbian police had confiscated a journalist's phone, used Cellebrite to extract data from it, and then used it to infect the phone with malware. Cellebrite said in February it would limit the use of some of its technology in Serbia.

For its part, Cellebrite says in a “fact” page on its website that it “has strict licensing policies and restrictions” for customers, and that before it sells to anyone, it considers “a potential customer's human rights record and anti-corruption policies.” The company also says that it “vigorously supports the democratic ideals of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.”

“We do not condone the use of Cellebrite's solutions to access the personal information of journalists, activists or others who are working against the interests of repressive regimes and doing so outside the bounds of a legally sanctioned investigation expressly violates the terms of our licensing agreements,” Cellebrite says on the fact page.

Legally, CBP has the authority to search anyone's phone at the US border without a warrant. If a person refuses to hand over their password, US citizens can remain in custody temporarily, but can't be denied entry. However, non-citizens may be denied entry if they refuse.

If border patrol officers have the password to someone's phone, they can conduct a “basic search” and manually scroll through the phone on the spot. However, officers may then choose to download the entirety of a phone's data, or keep it to conduct an “advanced search,” at which point digital forensic tools like Cellebrite may be used. Of the approximately 47,000 device searches Customs and Border Patrol conducted in 2024, about 4,200 of them were advanced searches.

CBP has the right to keep a phone for several days to conduct an advanced search, but if the agency cites “extenuating circumstances,” it could have the phone for weeks or months. CBP says that when it takes data from a device, it may be shared with “other agencies” or with “other federal, state, local, and foreign law enforcement agencies.” CBP also has the right to store the data in its Automated Targeting System, which it uses to determine if someone presents a risk of terrorism or criminal activity, for up to 15 years.

As the popularity of ICEBlock, an app where people can share sightings of immigration enforcement officials, has soared in recent days, Trump administration officials have threatened to prosecute its developer and CNN for reporting on the platform. But legal experts tell WIRED that there is nothing illegal about the app and prosecuting its creator would be unconstitutional.

The app, which launched in April, allows users to anonymously share the locations of ICE agents within a 5-mile radius. Joshua Aaron, the app's developer, says ICEBlock is quickly growing, with more than 241,000 users. As of this writing, it's the third-most-downloaded free iPhone app in the United States, after the Love Island app and ChatGPT.

US attorney general Pam Bondi was on Fox News Monday talking about ICEBlock, when she spoke directly about Aaron, the app's sole developer. “We are looking at him,” she said. “And he better watch out.” Speaking alongside President Donald Trump outside a migrant detention center known as “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida on Tuesday, Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said the government was looking into prosecuting CNN.

“What they're doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities and operations and we're going to actually go after them and prosecute them,” she said. “What they're doing, we believe, is illegal.”

ICEBlock allows users to alert each other when ICE agents are nearby.

But legal experts tell WIRED that ICEBlock falls under protected speech. “That is as basic and uncontroversial a First Amendment principle as they come,” says Alex Abdo, the litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “So, it's pretty shocking to see federal law enforcement officials suggesting that there's anything here to investigate.”

Scott Hechinger, a civil rights attorney, says prosecuting the app's creator would be illegal.

“Threatening people, in this case companies and projects, with arrest and retaliation for exercising their First Amendment rights is profoundly illegal and unconstitutional,” he says. He points to past media appearances from border czar Tom Homan, where Homan condemned congresswoman  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for sharing information about the immigrants' legal rights, as emblematic of the administration's lack of respect for constitutionality.

A spokesperson using ICE's general press email referred WIRED to a statement issued by acting director Todd M. Lyons on June 30, but did not provide further comment. The White House did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.

In the statement, Lyons called CNN's coverage of the app “reckless and irresponsible.” When reached for comment, Emily Kuhn, senior vice president of communications at CNN, pointed WIRED to a statement from the network saying that reporting on the existence of an app is neither illegal nor an endorsement.

The Trump administration's rebukes of the app have also focused on the idea that it's placing ICE agents in danger. Responding to a question about a CNN report on ICEBlock Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Surely, it sounds like this would be an incitement of further violence against our ICE officers.” She went on to say, “there's been a 500 percent increase in violence against ICE agents, law enforcement officers across the country who are just simply trying to do their jobs and remove public safety threats from our communities.”

On June 20, the Department of Homeland Security put out a press release citing the purported 500 percent increase, however its link for the statistic directs users to a Breitbart article that just quotes the DHS without providing in-depth details to support the number.

“ICE and the Trump administration are under the misimpression that law enforcement in the United States is entitled to operate in secret,” says Seth Stern, director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. Stern points to ICE agents wearing masks while operating in public and accusations by the administration targeted at journalists who report on ICE as examples of this “misimpression.”

Aaron tells WIRED the app is about “informing, not obstructing.” He describes a potential user interaction as someone walking around their neighborhood, then getting an alert on their phone saying that ICE has been spotted a few blocks away—with directions for safely getting home. By tapping the plus button in the ICEBlock app, anyone can report a new sighting.

“We're pushing back against authoritarianism. We're pushing back against fascism,” he says. “They're gonna fire off hate rhetoric at you. They're gonna demonize everything you're doing. They're gonna threaten you.”

The app is part of a larger trend of people using social media and apps to resist the Trump administration's ramping up of immigration arrests. In early June, as protests began to swell in Los Angeles, multiple grassroots groups shared emergency alerts to local residents as ICE raids were happening across the city.

According to the Apple listing for ICEBlock, the app does not store any data on its users. Since it does not collect user data, Aaron doesn't know how many people have used the app in Los Angeles, for example, or even where past sightings have been posted. Individual users can only see what's been reported within a 5-mile radius and the sightings auto-delete after four hours.

The app is currently only available on iPhones. Based on his past interactions with Apple during ICEBlock's approval process, Aaron feels confident that it will remain available in the app store. “They've already reviewed it,” he says. “That's why they approved it.” Apple did not respond to requests for comment.

Aaron says ICEBlock will never have ads or a button asking for donations. For him, the simplicity of the app's interface is an intentional choice. “This is literally an early-warning system,” he says. “So, how much do you want going on in that early-warning system? Except to say, ‘Hey, something's coming up within your 5-mile radius. Get the fuck out.'”

OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever says he is stepping into the CEO role at Safe Superintelligence, the AI startup he launched in 2024. In a post on X, Sutskever confirmed Thursday that Daniel Gross, the startup's co-founder and CEO, departed the company as of June 29. Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Levy is becoming president of the startup, according to Sutskever.

The announcement follows weeks of reporting that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in advanced talks to hire Gross, as well as his longtime investing partner, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. At one point, Zuckerberg reportedly attempted to acquire all of Safe Superintelligence, a startup most recently valued at $32 billion. Sutskever addressed those reports as well.

“You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through,” said Sutskever. “We have the compute, we have the team, and we know what to do. Together we will keep building safe superintelligence.”

I sent the following message to our team and investors:—As you know, Daniel Gross's time with us has been winding down, and as of June 29 he is officially no longer a part of SSI. We are grateful for his early contributions to the company and wish him well in his next…

Naturally, Gross' departure may raise questions around the startup. If Safe Superintelligence was close to its goal — surely a groundbreaking technology, as it's described — why would its co-founder leave to start something new, seemingly at Meta?

Notably, Safe Superintelligence describes itself as the world's “first straight-shot SSI lab,” meaning the company has no other products or ambitions outside of developing, well, safe superintelligence. That's the name, that's the product, that's its whole thing. Sutskever started Safe Superintelligence shortly after leaving OpenAI, where he played a role in the brief ousting of CEO Sam Altman.

Meanwhile, it seems likely that Meta Superintelligence Labs will develop technology that powers lots of the company's products. In Zuckerberg's memo announcing the new unit, he referenced Meta's expertise in building and growing products that reach billions of people, and cited the early wins Meta has had in AI wearables.

That means Gross, who previously led AI teams at Apple after the iPhone maker acquired his startup, could have a more familiar role at Meta, should he join. Zuckerberg has also nabbed some top researchers from OpenAI and Google DeepMind to fill out his new AI team.

Nevertheless, Sutskever may have his hands full as Safe Superintelligence's CEO. While he's held previous high-ranking positions, such as OpenAI's chief scientist, the CEO role may come with new challenges — such as raising new capital from investors and recruiting top talent. Sutskever notes in his post that he'll continue to oversee Safe Superintelligence's technical team.

Investing in Y Combinator startups can lead to significant returns to investors.

“If you look at the data: 6% of YC companies become unicorns, and of that 6% a quarter become decacorns,” Kulveer Taggar told TechCrunch. Taggar is a two-time YC alum best known for founding Zeus Living, a property management startup that raised over $150 million in funding.

Taggar is so confident in the continuing return potential offered by the famed accelerator that he established Phosphor Capital, a venture firm dedicated solely to investing in YC companies. Since launching last year, Phosphor has raised $34 million in capital across two funds.

While Phosphor isn't the only venture capital firm focused on YC startups — Pioneer Fund and Rebel Fund employ similar strategies — the firm is the only dedicated YC fund led by a solo general partner. And because of Taggar's long relationship with YC, he also nabbed YC CEO Garry Tan as an investor in the fund, he says.

Taggar's relationship with Y Combinator began in 2007 when he, his cousin Harj Taggar, and future Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison brought their startup, Auctomatic, through the program. Although Auctomatic was sold just a year later, that experience was key to forging a strong connection with the top accelerator. 

He went through Y Combinator again in 2011, this time with Zeus Living, a startup that bought homes to offer furnished accommodations with flexible terms for business and personal travel. Initialized Capital, co-founded by current YC chief Garry Tan, led Zeus Living's Series A funding and Tan joined its board. 

At its peak, the startup was valued at over $200 million and had an annual revenue run rate of about $120 million, according to Taggar. 

However, Zeus encountered significant headwinds when interest rates surged earlier this decade and the startup was sold to competitor Blueground in late 2023 for undisclosed terms.

Taggar launched Phosphor mere months after leaving Zeus. He told TechCrunch he was particularly excited by the opportunity to invest in young AI startups and by Garry Tan's leadership of the prestigious accelerator. “You could view this as a bet on Garry. I think he is taking Y Combinator to new levels,” Taggar said.

Unlike many emerging managers, Taggar had a relatively easy time raising capital. Beyond Tan, he says his other LPs include Zeus' investors. “I had a relationship with them and a track record, so they knew me, and they knew how hard I work,” he said. 

Others include family offices and a large asset manager who are taking a bet on Taggar in large part because of his deep connection and long-standing ties to Y Combinator.

“Kulveer is what you might call an OG alum from the early days of YC,” said YC partner Jared Friedman. “He's close to me and to many of the folks who now run YC.”

Taggar's background as a YC alum and a founder was also a part of the draw to Phosphor for LPs and a benefit for founders. “Zeus was a really hard company to run. He has a tremendous number of battle scars from doing this hard thing in the physical world,” Friedman said. “I hear this from founders that he has incredible empathy for what they are going through, because he went through it all himself.”

Phosphor writes checks ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. The firm has already backed over 200 YC companies, with several going on to raise Series A funding, including workflow automation platform Gumloop and AI meeting manager Circleback.

Hypersonic weapons startup Castelion is raising a $350 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Altimeter Capital, according to sources and documents viewed by TechCrunch.

The round, which values the company in the billions, is anticipated to close in a matter of weeks. A term sheet has been signed. The new round comes on the heels of $100 million in Series A funding that closed in January. That round was composed of about $70 million in equity and $30 million of debt. Lightspeed also led that round. 

Castelion declined to comment. 

It is notoriously difficult for nontraditional players to break into the sizable government defense market, but Castelion has made notable strides since it emerged from stealth in late 2023. The company, which was founded by former SpaceX executives, wants to transform the production of hypersonic missile systems, a critical national security technology.

Despite the U.S. Department of Defense's massive budget, military leaders are sounding the alarm on China's ability to rapidly develop and field hypersonics. These weapons travel above Mach 5 — and China's capabilities are starting to outpace the United States. 

Castelion is proposing a solution. The business takes a similar approach to SpaceX: build quickly, test frequently, and vertically integrate to drive down costs. It has already won grants and awards from a suite of DoD offices, including the Air Force Research Laboratory and the Naval Air Systems Command. The company tested its hypersonic vehicle for the first time in the Mojave Desert in March as it looks to prove to the government that it can field low-cost hypersonic missiles at scale. 

Castelion appeared in the U.S. Army's fiscal year 2026 budget request published in June. In the budget, the military branch has requested $25 million under an initiative called Project HX3 to support the development and testing of an “affordable, mass-produced hypersonic weapon” called Blackbeard Ground Launch (GL). As the document explains, Blackbeard GL will have around 80% of the capability of a long-range hypersonic weapon variant currently being developed by aerospace primes. But through the contract, the Army is saying it is willing to trade a little bit of speed and range for a lower-cost product. 

The forthcoming contract, which is essentially a done deal once President Trump signs the budget into law, has two phases: The first will see Castelion deliver a “prototype proof-of-concept” that it will demonstrate in early 2026. If that is successful, the second phase will include the delivery of 10 prototype missiles in 2027 for additional testing using a standard launcher platform called High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. Blackbeard is also being designed to be compatible with a new launcher system that will have autonomous capabilities. 

All of Castelion's previous wins with the DoD are a pittance compared to the possibilities afforded by the lucrative hypersonic-weapons market. If the Army field testing goes well, Castelion could ink a larger contract and begin delivering Blackbeard missiles in early 2028. 

Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman may want to watch their backs.

For example, in the usecase of providing a proof-of-age to a website: who provides the verification data (the government?); what form does that take (a file in a standard format?); who holds/owns the verification data (the user?); who runs the verification software (the end-user's web browser?).Can the user use any implementation to provide the proof, or must it be a ""blessed"" implementation such as Google Wallet?

In other words, does the protocol give the wallet access to information about the relying party?  For example, could this wallet that I don't control tell its owner, or the government, that I am using it to access a certain website?

(2) One of the goals of this project was to layer ZK on top of current identity standards that DMVs already issue, so that gov orgs don't have to change what they currently do to support the strongest user privacy. One example format is called Mdoc.(3) The user holds the identity information on their device only. No other copies.  The user's device makes the zkp proof on-device. This was one of the major technical challenges.(4) The relying party (eg a website) runs the zk verification algorithm on the proof that is produced by the device to ensure soundness.(5) Yes, the user can use any compatible implementation to produce the proof. We have open-sourced our implementation and we have a spec for the proof format that others can also reimplement.

Virtually everyone gets their internet from an ISP that is regulated in the country that the user lives in. There are no technical barriers to implementing a permitting system in the United States.Linking connections to real people is self-enforcing when there is a usage-based tax.[1] https://www.africanews.com/2018/04/13/uganda-s-social-media-...

Somehow we've inappropriately shifted responsibility away from parents/guardians in some areas like internet access.In other areas, like letting your kid go outside by themselves, we've criminalized reasonable caregiver actions.It's a wild world.

For example, on Discord, all your messages are scanned for such. On Cloudflare as well (for over 5 years).For now it means they have no interest to remove such content unless coerced or affected by the public opinion.This would destroy all content though, not just for minors.Absurd, but it works, in North Korea (death penalty), Iran (death penalty), China (10 year prison), and also protects victims from rape, or ""rape"" under financial pressure.The alternative is to let responsibility of the parents to install web filter to their kids, and let others live freely on the internet, without sharing their history or IDing them.In reality, TikTok also has really traumatizing content, yet is engaging tons of kids and teenagers, and IDing won't solve that, but good parents can.

I just pushed this idea as a ""solution"" to see what others think, but I don't know. Again perhaps educating the parents about how to educate kids about the dangers of internet, and perhaps a web filter for kids.This is actually one place where AI could be useful, to do dynamic local content classification (instead of a blocklist), especially if integrated directly in Android / iPhone.Like https://support.apple.com/en-us/105121 but more dynamic.

CP is an edge case but that's because it's almost impossible to make CP without abusing children and you could view CP as an incitement to violence -- as incitement to abuse children.Parents should ultimately monitor what their kids do. I have a pi-hole that subscribes to lists with millions of porn domains, but I'm a technical person. Non-technical parents are helpless, and kids can easily access it at friends' houses etc. The industry has not empowered non-technical parents to do this, probably because there's a conflict of interest. Lots of parents would use such options to keep kids off social media, and like all addictive things social media wants to hook them early. (I think kids should be off social media too, but it's not quite as nuts as letting them watch fetish porn.)Porn is different now too. It's worse in a way. Like everything else it's subjected to a pressure to get ""edgier"" to maximize engagement. So today's porn is loaded with simulated incest, simulated rape, extreme BDSM, etc., things that young children are not equipped to properly contextualize. (Some adults aren't either, but at least with adults you can say it's their fault not the porn's fault. The line cuts differently with children which is why children can't smoke, get tattoos, buy alcohol, get credit cards, etc.) If you want to see the consequence of young kids (mostly boys) being raised with unfettered porn access go visit any women-coded space on the Internet (like Reddit) and search for threads discussing why so many men want to choke their girlfriends. Where did this sudden choking fetish come from?

It's also an unfathomably complex solution [1] which only a few people in the world will grok, and far more complex than  existing solutions such as Idemix or BBS+, which lack such a hardware binding on existing hardware.Age verification in a privacy preserving way is a really hot topic at the moment, but it will always be possible to bypass it – as will any commonly held anonymous boolean – in quite trivial ways. For example by setting up an open proxy to disclose genuine attributes. There are some privacy preserving mitigations, for example cryptography that'll make you linkable when disclosing more than k times per time period, or detecting slower-than-near-light-speed disclosure in an face-to-face disclosure scenario.However, these mitigations will never be completely secure. That might not be a problem if it's admitted beforehand so expectations are correctly set: it's a barrier to protect the naïve, not an impenetrable fortress. However, if the expectations are that only age verification that cannot be bypassed is ""adequate"", we only have to wait for the first incidents in production apps after which the open source and privacy story will be abandoned in the name of security.[1] https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/2010.pdf

The context is the US mobile drivers licenses and the forthcoming digital identity documents in the EU.  The government gives you an electronic document stored in your device, and now the problem is, why would you ever want to give a copy of your document to a third party.
This code solves the problem via zero-knowledge presentations of the document.  This is real stuff already integrated in Google Wallet, not vaporware. See also the paper linked from GitHub.

The whole field of zero-knowledge mathematics was, if not non-existent, but certainly marginalised, before the crypto investment has hit the scene; this is facts. Yes, Shamir et al. go back to 90s, but it's a far-cry from zkSNARK, zkVM stuff we have nowadays. It has also popularized many applications, like provable auctions (see kyber[1] library in Go as nice starting point...) and opened the door to homomorphic stuff.[1] https://pkg.go.dev/go.dedis.ch/kyber/v4/shuffle

It was before the Unitree G1 came out so the cheapest option at the time costed over $50k, but I figured I could build one for about $10k using COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) components, which would be a much better price point for indie hackers and developers.We built the first version using some 3D printers and parts that I bought off of Amazon and Alibaba. It was not great, but it let us build out the full pipeline, from designing and building the hardware to training control policies in simulation. We actually did most of this in about two months, and had a standing, waving robot by YC Demo Day (although it wasn't good for much else!).Since then, our focus has been on figuring out how to go from a hobby-grade robot to a consumer-grade robot, without inflating our BOM (Bill of Materials, i.e. cost of all the parts) or having to set up our own factories. This is surprisingly difficult. A lot of the supply chain for robotics components currently goes through China, but tariffs have made it difficult to rely on Chinese suppliers for components. Also, even a $10k price point is pretty expensive for most customers, for a humanoid robot that has fairly limited capabilities.Our solution to this is to open-source our hardware and software. This makes it easier for us to navigate tariffs and manufacturing challenges. By making our reference design public, our suppliers have a much easier time figuring out how to offer us competitive solutions, and our manufacturing partners are able to more easily adjust our design for their production processes.On the demand side, the basic problem with humanoid robots is that they're mostly useless right now, and it will probably be a long and fairly capital-intensive journey to make them useful. My expectation was that there is a large pool of latent interest from people like me who are interested in hacking on humanoids, and that this customer segment is a much better customer segment to sell into than more traditional business-focused robotics applications. As someone in this customer segment myself, I felt that open-source software and hardware would be a strong value proposition, particularly for developers exploring bringing humanoids into their own business verticals.More philosophically, I think it is important that there is a good, open-source humanoid robot. I think the technology is likely to mature much more rapidly than many people currently expect, and the idea of armies of humanoids owned by some single company walking around is pretty dystopian.Right now, we're selling our base humanoid robot, K-Bot, for $8999. The main reason we're selling it now, instead of waiting to do more R&D, is because we're trying to negotiate volume prices with our own suppliers before we do final DfM (Design for Manufacturing). For example, we are able to negotiate better volume pricing for actuators and end effectors than what the average indie developer would be able to get for low-volume orders.However, a lot of the people who want to buy a humanoid robot today do so because they want a completely autonomous robot to do all their chores, which is a pretty hard (although exciting) thing to build. To square this circle, we're offering a ""Full Autonomy"" option - it is the same robot hardware, but we will provide free hardware and software upgrades until we are able to make the robot fully autonomous. This way, we can have some extra cash upfront to kickstart development, and start to build a core group of people who are aligned with helping us improve the robot's capabilities across a diverse set of environments. From our customers' perspective, it's a way to de-risk buying a first-generation product from a young hardware company, and to have a bigger influence on how the technology unfolds.The best part about building open source software and hardware is getting torn apart by people smarter than us, so we'd love your feedback!

We actually did most of this in about two months, and had a standing, waving robot by YC Demo Day (although it wasn't good for much else!).Since then, our focus has been on figuring out how to go from a hobby-grade robot to a consumer-grade robot, without inflating our BOM (Bill of Materials, i.e. cost of all the parts) or having to set up our own factories. This is surprisingly difficult. A lot of the supply chain for robotics components currently goes through China, but tariffs have made it difficult to rely on Chinese suppliers for components. Also, even a $10k price point is pretty expensive for most customers, for a humanoid robot that has fairly limited capabilities.Our solution to this is to open-source our hardware and software. This makes it easier for us to navigate tariffs and manufacturing challenges. By making our reference design public, our suppliers have a much easier time figuring out how to offer us competitive solutions, and our manufacturing partners are able to more easily adjust our design for their production processes.On the demand side, the basic problem with humanoid robots is that they're mostly useless right now, and it will probably be a long and fairly capital-intensive journey to make them useful. My expectation was that there is a large pool of latent interest from people like me who are interested in hacking on humanoids, and that this customer segment is a much better customer segment to sell into than more traditional business-focused robotics applications. As someone in this customer segment myself, I felt that open-source software and hardware would be a strong value proposition, particularly for developers exploring bringing humanoids into their own business verticals.More philosophically, I think it is important that there is a good, open-source humanoid robot. I think the technology is likely to mature much more rapidly than many people currently expect, and the idea of armies of humanoids owned by some single company walking around is pretty dystopian.Right now, we're selling our base humanoid robot, K-Bot, for $8999. The main reason we're selling it now, instead of waiting to do more R&D, is because we're trying to negotiate volume prices with our own suppliers before we do final DfM (Design for Manufacturing). For example, we are able to negotiate better volume pricing for actuators and end effectors than what the average indie developer would be able to get for low-volume orders.However, a lot of the people who want to buy a humanoid robot today do so because they want a completely autonomous robot to do all their chores, which is a pretty hard (although exciting) thing to build. To square this circle, we're offering a ""Full Autonomy"" option - it is the same robot hardware, but we will provide free hardware and software upgrades until we are able to make the robot fully autonomous. This way, we can have some extra cash upfront to kickstart development, and start to build a core group of people who are aligned with helping us improve the robot's capabilities across a diverse set of environments. From our customers' perspective, it's a way to de-risk buying a first-generation product from a young hardware company, and to have a bigger influence on how the technology unfolds.The best part about building open source software and hardware is getting torn apart by people smarter than us, so we'd love your feedback!

I'm not super active in the humanoid robot space anymore, however I did my PhD about 9 years ago in HRI.
That was the time of Boston Dynamics, DARPA robotics challenge, and Aldebaran's Pepper and Nao robots.You mentioned you are building everything open source. What happened with ROS and related projects? Do you build on top of that, or is that all super outdated that a reboot was needed?Another question I have is: why are you choosing a two-legged human over a four-legged one?My experiments with two legged robots were mostly bad. Not only did they fall basically all the time but they also had a big drift. So far, I have not seen any large improvements. But again, I might be very outdated.I always said to my colleagues. The main point stopping robots from picking up is a stable platform. And with the platform I mean walking.

For two legged - I think it will eventually be quite a bit cheaper, it's mostly a software problem to get them to be stable. RL based control has gotten much, much better. For example, I was talking to Trevor Blackwell a few weeks ago, and he was saying the IMU on the original Anybots robot was over $2k, whereas if you throw a noisy IMU into sim, you can get away with something basically from a cellphone. So yea, personally I'm a big believer in needing to solve the robotics intelligence problem, and once you solve that, humanoids will make the most sense as a form factor.

Human feet have metatarsophalangeal joints connecting the toes to the rest of the foot. But humanoid robots don't have these (at least, the vast majority don't). Why? These joints are very useful.Also, the bottom of the human foot is soft and has thousands of nerve endings. Can we really expect robots to get anywhere near human mobility performance without this level of compliance and sensory sophistication?

In general, I think the best way to think about the differences between human muscles and robot actuators is that human muscles are simultaneously incredible in terms of strength and power density, and also incredibly fragile. Robot actuators are fairly robust, but comparatively poor. Humans are essentially falling apart at all times, but the repair mechanisms in the body do a good enough job that it doesn't matter (although you probably know someone with a ""career-disruptive/ending"" sports-related injury that shows these mechanisms have limits). Robotics is a long way away from making actuators that can be fixed online in such a process. Even cable stretching in cable-driven mechanisms remains hard to handle effectively, and that's one of the simplest types of mechanism wear.

For walking, the most important thing is that the robot can be simulated well, so in our case, we tried to model the foot contact with the ground in simulation quite accurately. In fact, we found that force sensors in the foot probably help but they're not necessary in simulation, and we wanted to shave off anything that wasn't necessary. I am not sure how close we will get to human mobility - it's definitely a learning process - but you can get much further in simulation than you'd expect.

a) some of these definitely look they could be done without hardware or with light hardware support from a staff member?b) if you do a) and are open source completely I bet you don't even need to do bounties. The increased participation could mean some great community generated solutions quick.

But on the long-tail of autonomy options? Implementing the latest papers, trying cutting edge solutions, I bet a thriving open-source community could be very helpful ala PR2, given that the hardware is already open-source.Nothing stopping you from picking and choosing from the various implementations to build into a streamlined product offering on the front end.

I basically think our goal is to solve all the boring stuff and make it work reliably, so that other can people can try out the cool ML stuff more easily

Personally, I think the first real use cases will mostly be entertainment. Humanoids have a high ""coolness"" factor. Also, I think there's a long tail of random problems which you don't want to buy a new robot to solve, but which, if you have a robot lying around that isn't perfect but is ""good enough"", might be possible to solve imperfectly. For example, I just had a newborn baby, and I was thinking it would be nice if I had a static arm that could hold his bottle for me. There's a lot of tail end problems like that in your day to day life. But I think the really interesting capabilities will come once there's very good end-to-end models running on-device.

I think at volume the price for a good set of hands should settle somewhere around $300-500. Most of it comes down to meeting suppliers where they're at and negotiating mutually beneficial deals. It's not magic but it does require having a good understanding of the hardware in order to negotiate well.

Congratulations guys! The technical stuff is above my paygrade, but you have a cracked team and with open source you will have a great chance to be close or at SOTA level at your price point.However, it looks to me that your core thesis is yes, when the autonomous robots get good enough, even at a medium family car price range they will sell like candies. Sure. But since you also want to have the cash now, to who exactly are you selling? Yes you promise that you will support the full autonomy option, but this sounds weirdly similar to Tesla selling cars promising the FSD, which we all know how that story went.I'm not saying you won't deliver, I'm just saying you might need to a bit more careful in your story selling/narrative for this. For example, i would be super interested to get one for like 2k if it's not useful now, but paying 10k for essentially promises and possible upgrades is a bit iffy. Hence i would like to at least see some plug in and play current usecases? Even if they are just for fun.

I think this kind of ""promise the future, pay now"" model does alienates some people, especially when the tech is not ready today. That's why we're open sourcing everything, to avoid the feeling of overpromising on what is ready today. The core idea is that the people who bought FSD early on were very invested in it's success, and that feedback loop is very important for improving machine learning models at scale. The problem happens when actually delivering on the tech takes a long time, but I think we have a fairly clear technical roadmap to make our robot useful. At least, I think there are a lot more intermediate benchmarks for driving value for a humanoid robot than there are for self-driving cars, so I think people who buy it will have a stronger feeling that it is constantly improving.

> that feedback loop is very important for improving machine learning models at scaleOh will you have your own feedback loop with let's say user's data? Or you meant as an example?> * That's why we're open sourcing everything, to avoid the feeling of overpromising on what is ready today*I agree here, it helps the today, but I dont think it helps the feeling of overpromising on what is ready today, its more like, even if it's open source  , it does not increase the chances of it being ready/autonomous in the future.  (im just playing devils advocate here)I also agree with the intermediate  benchmarks for sure, this is more to what i was referring to, it would be nice to see some more short term usecases/fun applications that are realistic to hit today or in the nearer future, that would drive a lot of sales value, at least for me, rather than go from now to full autonomy. Good luck!

(im just playing devils advocate here)I also agree with the intermediate  benchmarks for sure, this is more to what i was referring to, it would be nice to see some more short term usecases/fun applications that are realistic to hit today or in the nearer future, that would drive a lot of sales value, at least for me, rather than go from now to full autonomy. Good luck!

That's more or less the idea - obviously since it's open source we wouldn't scrape peoples' data without their consent, but I would hope that people would contribute to the project in some form. Like, the core idea of the open source ethos is that building something like this collaboratively is a better / cheaper way to scale data collection / experience than us trying to collect all the data ourselves.> it does not increase the chances of it being ready/autonomous in the future.Yea that's true. At the end of the day it's just technical execution, so it's pretty risky. I just prefer that if people sign up for something risky, it's pretty transparent what exactly it is they're signing up for :)

Does/will this include the training data, hyperparams, and weights for the models?People will be reluctant to buy an ""open source"" robot if the key ML magic to make it work is closed off, e.g. if you charge a subscription for it.

I basically believe that in a world where humanoid robots are actually useful, we will not have any trouble monetizing. Probably we will verticalize manufacturing at some point in the future. I think the bigger risks for our business model are not from people copying us or something, but from not making progress fast enough.

We are planning to release a similar-size robot later this year (calling it M-Bot) that will be closer in height and price, but our current focus has been on launching the full-size humanoid.Mechanically, I think Berkeley Humanoid Lite is pretty similar to the 3D printed one we made last year. Our main focus with the K-Bot redesign was to make it not break so much. 3D printed components break a lot and repair time can be quite long. Also, having the wiring routed internally makes a huge, huge difference. So there are some benefits to doing QA on a manufacturing line in terms of quality and consistency.

I have to push back here, I think this is objectively untrue. By definition a system or piece of code on where you add a condition where something else happens (cache) that behaves differently than the uncached path increases complexity.I'm not saying it's wrong to cache things or that they aren't useful, but I think they absolutely are an abstraction and an optimization at the cost of complexity. Good code bases hide complexity from the devs all the time, so it's not a question of whether you can code it away, but rather how difficult is it to troubleshoot the internals of the system.

Look at how CPU cache line behaviors radically change the performance of superficially similar algorithms.Look at how query performance for a database server drops off a cliff the moment the working cache no longer fits in memory.Hiding complexity can be a simplification, until you exceed the bounds of the simplification and the complexity you hid demands your attention anyway.

All software has to name things, and count.  Caching (including invalidation) is best understood as a liability.  If you can foist it off on your CPU and OS and DB, good for you.  Programming whatever you're actually trying to get done is already hard enough.

Both are not that difficult, honestly.Aren't there a lot harder things out there

Heck you can probably prove that any system for naming things is either inconsistent or incomplete.

When code has abstract interfaces for data access, introducing caching can be simpler (but not simple) by localizing it in the abstraction implementation which has or doesn't have caching.But it is not an abstraction (you can perfectly well do caching without any abstractions, and it's frequently done exactly that way).

reply

The concern you're talking about is about the actual access to the data. My understanding of the article is that it's about how caching algorithms can abstract the concern of minimising retrieval cost.So in some ways you're coming at it from opposite directions. You're talking about a prior of ""disk by default"" and saying that a good abstraction lets you insert cache layers above that, whereas for the author the base case is ""manually managing the layers of storage"".

Which is why solving the ""I want my data in fast storage as often as possible"" problem may be counter-productive on the whole: you ain't the only client of the system; let it breath and server requests from others.

Samsung needs chip buyers for it to start running its Texas chip fab.

Samsung is reportedly delaying the launch of its Taylor, Texas, fab, citing difficulties in securing customers for its output. Sources told Nikkei Asia that even if the South Korean chipmaker brings in the necessary equipment to produce chips at the new plant, the company cannot do anything with them due to the lack of demand. Aside from that, the original planned process node for the Taylor plant is no longer aligned with current demand, highlighting the rapid pace of semiconductor technology.

The chip maker started construction on the Taylor fab in 2022, with an initial investment of $17 billion. By 2024, the company decided to double this to $44 billion, with the addition of another advanced fab and expanded R&D operations. This move is supported by a $6.6-billion CHIPS Act subsidy, which was finalized in December last year, despite multiple delays and setbacks.

Samsung C&T, the primary contractor for the Taylor fab, states that construction of the site is progressing. Documents from the company show that the site is almost 92% complete as of March 2024. Work on the site was originally scheduled to finish the following month, but regulatory filings indicate that this was moved to October.

No reason was given for the delay, but multiple sources indicate that it occurred due to a lack of demand. It was initially planned for the Taylor Fab to produce chips for the 4nm process node, but this has since been upgraded to 2nm, to compete with TSMC and Intel.

A supply chain executive told the publication that there is little demand for the originally planned 4nm process node at the site. ""Local demand for chips isn't particularly strong, and the process nodes Samsung planned several years ago no longer meet with current customer needs,"" the executive said to Nikkei Asia. ""However, overhauling the plant would be a major and costly undertaking, so the company is adopting a wait-and-see approach for now."" Although it has already declared its intention to upgrade the site to manufacture the 2nm process node, that is a resource-intensive task in terms of time, effort, and money.

This is in stark contrast to TSMC, which now manufactures the 4nm process node at Fab 21 in Arizona for U.S.-based customers like Apple, AMD, Broadcom, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. And, despite being priced higher than chips made in other sites outside North America, its capacity is already sold out through 2027.

The Taiwanese chip maker currently holds the number one spot in global contract chip manufacturing, with a market share of nearly 68%. On the other hand, Samsung comes in second place with 7.7%, according to Trendforce.

Samsung has already been operating a mature-node fab in Austin, Texas, since 1996. Despite that, the Taylor Fab shows the challenges that a chip maker faces when setting up shop at a new location. Aside from needing to build the facility, the company must also build a new supply chain, recruit skilled labor, and find buyers for the fab's output.

However, most importantly, the next phase of setup, named equipping, has astronomical costs attached to it. Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography machines, which print circuit patterns onto silicon wafers, are extremely temperamental and require careful setup. This is in addition to other processes, such as etching, deposition, and many more complex and delicate processes required for Samsung's goal of achieving a 2nm process node fabrication at the site.

The costs associated with the equipping phase are large, with some of TSMC's astronomical $42 billion investment into expansion dedicated solely toward the purpose of equipping several facilities.

Furthermore, Samsung's chip-making arm is reportedly struggling with yield, resulting in the recall of several key personnel from the site. Because of this, there's only a limited number on site at the Samsung plant as it's continually refining its advanced process nodes.

The company is facing more than just yield issues, though. Recent geopolitical changes have thrown a wrench in the global expansion of several semiconductor manufacturers, including TSMC and Samsung. Despite resilient growth in AI and data center markets, demand for consumer goods and commodities remains subdued.

""Although yields have since improved, U.S. restrictions on high-end chip production for China have further weighed on the company, keeping its capacity utilization below the industry average,"" Trendforce analyst Joanne Chiao said to Nikkei Asia.

President Trump's announcement of far-reaching tariffs has caused widespread uncertainty, but it has greatly impacted consumer electronics and automobiles — key sectors that order the most chips. The Chinese market is continuously growing despite that, but the ongoing trade war between the East and the West is making it difficult, if not impossible, for Samsung to deliver to customers in the country.

Moreover, Beijing's realization that its dependence on Western companies for its chip needs has led it to push for semiconductor self-sufficiency. Even though it still lags behind the U.S. in cutting-edge chips, the Chinese government's policies are resulting in the arrival of several new players that might make it the biggest provider of chip-making capacity by 2030.

Despite these factors, Samsung says that it will proceed with the opening of the Taylor Fab by 2026. Nikkei Asia says that the company did not give a specific timeline for the opening of its factory, nor did it comment about equipment installation or the lack of customers. Nevertheless, it makes sense for the company to have the fab up and running, especially since it needs to have the plant operational to receive its CHIPS Act funds.

Even though it might not have clients for the Taylor Fab at the moment, the company can only delay its opening for so long. If it doesn't push through with operating the fab, it risks falling behind rival TSMC and wasting billions of dollars already invested in the site.

It took an hour to get the GPU to be recognized in the VM again.

An extremely unfortunate and hilariously misguided PC user has gone viral on Reddit after accidentally ""ejecting"" their GPU from their PC via Windows like it was a memory stick. The unlucky user was lured in by a fairly standard Windows ejection screen because of their virtual machine configuration. Curious, they clicked eject on their GTX 1050Ti, accidentally breaking their PC in the process. Thankfully, the user was able to restore functionality, but only after an hour of fumbling around with settings. The tragedy is made all the more poignant by the user's faint cries of 'Oh merde,' which broadly translates as French for ""Oh bother.""

If you've never seen the option to eject your PC's GPU, you aren't alone. This feature of Windows is only seen in a few very specific situations. In YnosNava's case, they were running “a Virtual Machine with PCIe passthrough under Proxmox.” PCIe passthrough is a technique to benefit from improved video acceleration in a virtual machine. It basically speeds up GPU-sensitive operations in the virtual machine by providing direct access to the graphics card hardware. YnosNava appears to have been “playing around” with this feature in a Proxmox open-source server install, on the quest for improved performance.One of the peculiarities of PCIe passthrough in a VM — in this case, at least — is that the GPU you have decided to directly access is listed among attached devices that are available to be ejected with the click of the mouse.

Learn from YnosNava's mistake and save yourself some time — possibly a whole hour or more — if you are dabbling with a similar setup: Resist clicking ‘eject.' That said, if you're unable to resist the urge, or if you accidentally click ‘eject' using a similar setup, there's a simple set of steps you can follow to get things back up and running.“I deleted the GPU on my VM options, restarted the Windows VM. Then I added it again before restarting the machine again,” YnosNava explained in a follow-up comment to their thread. “From there, Windows detected it with problems and asked me to restart to fix the problem. After restarting, I reinstalled the drivers and voila!”I can't recall seeing an option to eject my GPU in Windows in all my computing years, but I also haven't dabbled much in VMs. I have seen a similar option to ""Safely Remove Hardware"" or ""Disconnect GPU"" when testing out eGPUs attached by USB4, though. However, I've never been tempted to use this feature for switching the active GPU without restarting.

Bianca Bach, MD

 July 03, 2025  

Despite the rising incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), extra-articular manifestations have become rare in the era of modern treat-to-target therapy. However, they still present clinical challenges — particularly in the case of rheumatoid nodules. In addition to the need to rule out serious differential diagnoses and address potential complications, especially those involving the lungs, these recurrent inflammatory granulomas can affect daily life not only cosmetically but also functionally.

Christopher Edwards, MD, professor of rheumatology at University Hospital Southampton in Southampton, England, discussed the clinical relevance and management of rheumatoid nodules during the 2025 Annual Meeting of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology.

When Edwards began his career in rheumatology, the presence of rheumatoid nodules was considered a key diagnostic criterion for RA. If not found on the hands, clinicians often examined the elbows and Achilles tendons, which are also common sites. Histologically, rheumatoid nodules are granulomatous inflammatory lesions that evolve through multiple stages. While often subcutaneous, they can also be found on the sclera, larynx, heart valves, and — most significantly — in the lungs.

Pulmonary nodules can present diagnostic difficulties. “I've seen patients who were initially told they had lung metastases,” Edwards recalled. Waiting for further imaging and biopsy can be highly distressing for patients. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can also resemble rheumatoid nodules, further complicating the diagnosis.

It is especially important to distinguish these nodules from infections such as tuberculosis. Patients with RA are at increased risk for infection due to both the underlying disease and immunosuppressive treatment. Like tuberculomas, pulmonary rheumatoid nodules can undergo central necrosis when exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, leading to cavitation or even pneumothorax. “Any cavity in the lung can become infected,” Edwards cautioned.

Diagnosing peripheral rheumatoid nodules is usually straightforward. These nodules typically feel rubbery on palpation and are movable relative to the underlying tissue. Important differential diagnoses include gouty tophi, lipomas, epidermoid cysts, infectious granulomas, sarcoidosis, and neoplastic lesions.

Imaging tools such as ultrasound or fine-needle aspiration can help clarify the diagnosis, particularly when gout is suspected. “Biopsy is rarely required — only if there's concern about a neoplastic or malignant process,” Edwards explained.

“In my practice, I see very few nodules these days,” said Edwards. Epidemiological data support this trend: The 10-year cumulative incidence of subcutaneous nodules in RA patients decreased from 30.9% between 1985 and 1999 to 15.8% between 2000 and 2014.

Multiple factors likely contributed to this decline, including the earlier initiation of more effective therapies and a reduction in smoking rates. Smoking remains a major risk factor for nodule development, along with long-standing, severe RA, male sex, and seropositivity for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. “Patients with nodules are almost always seropositive,” Edwards noted.

These findings suggest that maintaining tight control of disease activity is more critical for preventing nodules than concerns about drug-induced nodulosis.

“There was a time when we worried that methotrexate might be causing nodules,” Edwards said, referring to anecdotal reports of increased nodulosis after initiating methotrexate (MTX). “But now we're using more MTX and seeing fewer nodules.”

He emphasized that the presence of nodules alone should not prompt discontinuation of MTX. “It wasn't a reason to stop methotrexate back then, and it's not a reason now — though in some cases, it may justify a more aggressive treatment approach.”

Other medications — particularly tumor necrosis factor inhibitors like etanercept — have also been linked to nodule development, though Edwards suggested this may reflect reporting bias. “It might not be causal,” he said.

Often, treatment isn't necessary. “Sometimes it's just a matter of observation,” Edwards noted. Painful or functionally limiting nodules may be managed with local glucocorticoid injections to reduce discomfort and soften the nodules. However, he admitted he had never personally injected a rheumatoid nodule.

He also cautioned against injections over the elbow. “There's something about the skin and the olecranon bursa that makes infections more likely in that area. I saw one patient who needed plastic surgery after an infection left a significant wound.”

Rheumatoid nodules also have a tendency to recur.

“Surgery can benefit some patients,” Edwards said. Surgical removal may be warranted for nodules that ulcerate, become infected, or impair function — such as large nodules on the thumb or fingertip that interfere with gripping. “Patients are usually happy to regain function, even if the nodule comes back a couple of years later.” Nodules that are consistently irritated by shoes or clothing straps may also merit removal.

Pulmonary rheumatoid nodules — unlike subcutaneous ones — often contain B cells and typically respond well to rituximab or abatacept. “These lung nodules tend to shrink or stabilize with rituximab, and certainly, no new ones seem to develop,” Edwards noted. Case reports and small series have also documented improvement with Janus kinase inhibitors.

A study led by Cedars-Sinai investigators uncovered a significant uptick in chronic digestive disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Neurogastroenterology & Motility, highlight a potential link between pandemic-related stress on the gut-brain axis.

Using data from a national online study, we found that rates of digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation rose significantly. These findings underscore the significant toll the pandemic has taken on digestive health.""

Christopher V. Almario, MD, MSHPM, lead author and gastroenterologist at Cedars-Sinai

Also known as disorders of gut-brain interaction, conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation are common gastrointestinal disorders driven by complex interactions between the gut and nervous system.

Nearly 40% of people in the U.S. are estimated to meet diagnostic criteria for at least one disorders of gut-brain interaction, making these conditions a major source of healthcare burden and reduced quality of life.

""These disorders involve chronic gastrointestinal symptoms that are often triggered or worsened by psychological stress,"" said Almario.

To better understand how the viral infection might be linked with digestive health, researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults across the U.S. who participated in a national online survey conducted from May 2020 to May 2022.

Participants completed detailed questionnaires covering digestive symptoms, mental health and lifestyle changes. By tracking responses over time, the researchers observed a steady rise in gut-related health issues that began early in the pandemic and persisted throughout the survey period.

Key findings showed that:

As doctors uncover the long-term health effects of COVID-19, study investigators hope this study may draw attention to how the virus' impact on mental health may affect the gut-potentially triggering or worsening disorders like IBS and other gut-brain conditions.

""This research calls for a renewed focus on gastrointestinal health in the post-pandemic era,"" said Brennan Spiegel, MD, MSHS, corresponding author of the study and director of Health Services Research for Cedars-Sinai.

Spiegel, director of the Cedars-Sinai Master's Degree Program in Health Delivery Science and the George and Dorothy Gourrich Chair in Digital Health Ethics, says even those who did not get COVID-19 but endured significant psychological distress also may have had alterations in their gut-brain axis.

""Healthcare providers must be vigilant in recognizing and addressing the long-term effects of the pandemic on digestive health,"" said Spiegel.

Researchers examine how the use of animal testing to identify endocrine-disrupting substances in the EU can be reduced. Although it is, in principle, possible to identify such substances without using animals, non-animal methods are still rarely applied.

A team from the MERLON research project, led by the DTU National Food Institute, has mapped the use of alternatives to animal testing - so-called New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) - in the identification of endocrine disruptors. This required a thorough review of the complex legal framework underlying the EU's regulation of chemicals in everyday products, ranging from hair shampoo to food.

The conclusion is that alternative methods are almost never used to demonstrate the harmful effects of endocrine-disrupting substances, even though EU legislation allows for their use in this context. The research has been published in the scientific journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology.

According to the EU law, alternative methods may be used to demonstrate harmful effects of endocrine disruptors if they provide a 'similar predictive capacity' as animal tests. The problem is that we currently have only one alternative method that can actually be used for this purpose - namely 'read-across', where data from one substance is used to assess another, similar substance.""

Marie Louise Holmer, Special Consultant at the DTU National Food Institute, and one of the authors of the scientific article

""Read-across is ready to be used now, and we should apply it as broadly as possible. However, when it comes to other alternative methods, such as computer-based models and cell-based tests, substantial further development is still required.""

Alternative testing methods are, from an animal welfare perspective, clearly preferable. However, these methods are also much faster to carry out, which means that NAMs could significantly increase the efficiency of identifying endocrine disruptors in the EU.

""This is an area in which we are in urgent need of the support offered by digitalisation and new laboratory techniques. The WHO estimates that over 60,000 chemical substances are in global commerce. With today's methods, we would not be able to test them all for the many harmful effects associated with endocrine disruptors - not even in 100 years,"" says Marie Louise Holmer.

Endocrine disrupting substances pose risks to humans, animals and the environment, and can affect health in multiple ways. They may, for example, be carcinogenic, impair fertility, or interfere with the development of the brain and immune system. In the EU, substances can be regulated if testing confirms they are endocrinedisrupting - and such testing has so far primarily relied on animal experiments.

Animal testing has been widely debated for many years. Following a large public petition, the European Commission is developing a roadmap to outline how all animal testing for chemical safety assessments can eventually be phased out.

The researchers advocate a balanced approach. They argue that there is a need both to develop and validate alternative methods and to explore how these, potentially in combination, can predict harmful effects to the same degree as animal tests. At the same time, animal testing should be refined and optimised to provide as much valuable information as possible.

""We must ensure that the alternatives are just as effective as animal testing before animal methods can be phased out completely. That is why we also emphasise the continued need for animal testing until alternatives are fully accepted and routinely implemented in chemical regulation,"" says Marie Louise Holmer.

One of the recommendations from the researchers is to bring together all stakeholders affected by the legislation in order to build consensus.

""We need, among other things, to determine when results from New Approach Methodologies - or combinations of New Approach Methodologies - are sufficiently robust and reliable to predict harmful effects and thus replace animal testing,"" says Marie Louise Holmer.

Stakeholders could include national authorities (such as the Danish Environmental Protection Agency), relevant EU agencies, researchers, industry representatives, and NGOs.

Three criteria must be fulfilled to classify a substance as endocrine-disrupting:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Twice-yearly injection could transform HIV prevention efforts","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250703/Twice-yearly-injection-could-transform-HIV-prevention-efforts.aspx","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 13:28:00 GMT","

Preventative therapies for HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1) have made leaps and bounds over the past decade. A once-daily pill named PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, has been a stalwart for HIV prevention-but only if people take it consistently and can routinely access a pharmacy.

In 2022, Gilead Sciences, Inc., received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable medication for adults with multidrug-resistant HIV. A number of clinical trials have shown that this medication could also serve as a preventative medication-one that can specifically help those struggling to pick up their prescriptions or stick to a daily pill regimen.

Now, the well-tolerated medication has by the FDA as a new preventative medication for all adults, as well as adolescents weighing at least 35kg, who are at risk of acquiring HIV. Joe Eron, MD, the Herman and Louise Smith Distinguished Professor of Medicine and director of the clinical core at the UNC Center for AIDS Research, played a hand in the clinicals trials leading up to FDA approval of the medication.

This is game changing development in our field. I honestly think if public health and medical institutions can deploy it to rural populations, this medication could help end the HIV epidemic, not only in North Carolina, but in the United States overall.""

Joe Eron, MD, principal investigator of the clinical trial site, UNC School of Medicine

The injection, which boasts a six-month-long period of effective protection, will help mitigate healthcare access gaps and prevent further infections brought on by low medication adherence.

Here in North Carolina, the HIV epidemic still lingers. About 38,634 people are living with HIV in the ""Tar Heel State"", placing NC in the ""Top Ten"" in terms of nationwide HIV rates.

The blood borne infection can be transmitted through anal or vaginal sex, or the sharing needles or syringes with an HIV-positive partner. Certain groups of people are more likely to get HIV than others, depending on their behaviors and geographic locations.

Infectious disease researchers and physicians, like Eron, have seen that HIV disproportionately affects those living in rural, underserved areas in the South, especially young men of color who have sex with other men.

This is because many rural areas of the South are considered to be healthcare deserts-or areas where people cannot easily travel to pharmacies, primary care providers, hospitals, and low-cost health centers. These can pose a huge challenge for people who need to grab their prescriptions-and to do so discreetly.

""North Carolina is no exception to that,"" said Eron. ""We see that young men of color who have sex with other men are not comfortable with taking PrEP, due to stigma and lack of healthcare access. This long-lasting injection is critical because it can be given in a private, medical setting just twice a year.""

In the summer of 2021, researchers initiated two different phase 3, multicenter trials to study lenacapavir's safety and effectiveness for PrEP in highly vulnerable populations: PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2.

PURPOSE 1 enrolled 5,000 sexually-active women throughout Uganda and South Africa to determine how lenacapavir fares against Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s once-daily Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and once-daily oral Descovy (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide).

Researchers published their results in the New England Journal of Medicine in July 2024. Lenacapavir was shown to be 100% effective, with zero infections across 2,138 participants. The injectable medication also demonstrated superior prevention of HIV infections compared to those who received once-daily Truvada.

The PURPOSE 2 clinical trial was designed to test the efficacy and safety of lenacapavir for PrEP in cisgender men and gender-diverse individuals (i.e. transgender women, transgender men, and gender non-binary individuals) who have sex with men. The trial had a wider international scope compared to PURPOSE 1 and took place across 92 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States.

Yet again, lenacapavir demonstrated high efficacy in participants. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2024, found that approximately 99.9% of participants in the lenacapavir group were protected against HIV infection. There were only two cases of HIV among 2,179 participants. Compared to once-daily Truvada, lenacapavir was 89% more effective at reducing HIV infections.

""Through the PURPOSE trials, we found that lenacapavir is effective at preventing HIV infection from taking hold in the body,"" said Eron. ""But it is safe, too. The studies did not demonstrate toxicity in liver, kidney, or other parts of the body.""

Results from the past two trials were so impressive that Science named lenacapavir its 2024 Breakthrough of the Year.

Medical adherence is crucial. In order to prevent breakthrough infections, it is incredibly important for patients to take their medications as prescribed and to continue taking them for the entire regimen. Oral PrEP takes about 7-22 days of consistent daily use to reach full effectiveness.

In the PURPOSE 1 trial, results were consistent with other reports in people taking PrEP medications. At the one-year mark, researchers found that 84.1% of participants receiving Descovy were not adhering to their medication schedule. In the Truvada group, approximately 93.0% of participants had low medication adherence.

Eron and colleagues are now looking to get the drug to people who are at highest risk of HIV infection–such as those who are just leaving prison, receiving treatment for intravenous substance abuse, or those living without transportation. The long protective properties of the drug are key, as people are adjusting to their new lives and may not be able to come in for frequent follow-up visits.

""When people at risk leave prison or received opioid therapy, they're at highest risk [of getting infection] over the next three to four months,"" explained Eron. ""A single shot could actually be the protection they need to keep themselves and their partners healthy.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Long-term study confirms lasting benefits of lifestyle changes in preventing diabetes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250703/Long-term-study-confirms-lasting-benefits-of-lifestyle-changes-in-preventing-diabetes.aspx","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 18:51:00 GMT","

In the early 2000s the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large randomized clinical trial, showed that intensive lifestyle modification was better than a medication called metformin at preventing at-risk patients from developing Type 2 diabetes.

In a newly completed follow-up study, a team of researchers including Vallabh ""Raj"" Shah, professor emeritus in The University of New Mexico Departments of Internal Medicine and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology at the School of Medicine, found that the health benefits from the lifestyle intervention persisted more than 20 years later.

In a paper published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, they reported that the greatest results from both interventions were seen in the first few years of the study, and they were durable, Shah said. ""The data suggests that those people who didn't get diabetes also didn't get diabetes after 22 years,"" he said.

The DPP was launched in 1996 to compare the benefits of metformin – then newly approved by the FDA to treat Type 2 diabetes – and a lifestyle modification regimen that included exercise and a healthy diet. The study enrolled 3,234 patients with prediabetes at 30 institutions in 22 states.

The intensive lifestyle intervention reduced the development of diabetes by 24%, and metformin reduced diabetes development by 17%, according to the new study. The DPP had previously found that after the first three years of study, the lifestyle intervention of moderate weight loss and increased physical activity reduced the onset of Type 2 diabetes by 58% compared with a placebo medicine, while metformin reduced development of diabetes by 31%.

Compared with the original placebo group, the median time without diabetes was extended by three-and-a-half years in the lifestyle group and two-and-a-half years in the metformin group.

Within three years, they had to stop the study because lifestyle was better than metformin. That means lifestyle, which everybody is banking on, is more effective – that is the news.""

Vallabh ""Raj"" Shah, professor emeritus in The University of New Mexico

But because a wealth of health and biological data had already been collected for patients participating in the project, the DPP was repurposed into the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS), enabling researchers to follow their health outcomes in multiple domains over a period of decades, he said.

Shah has contributed to kidney disease research for more than three decades, conducting multiple studies at Zuni Pueblo and other American Indian communities in western New Mexico. He has also overseen the participation of the American Indian cohort enrolled in the DPPOS. Meanwhile, David Schade, MD, chief of the Division of Endocrinology in the UNM School of Medicine, recruited New Mexico participants in the study.

More recently, he said, DPPOS researchers have taken advantage of their large, well-documented cohort to repurpose the study to focus on diseases associated with aging, such as cancer and dementia, Shah said.

Canada must address the growing crisis of communicable diseases that has occurred in tandem with a rise in misinformation that threatens our health systems, argue authors in an editorial in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250916.

""A crisis of communicable diseases is unfolding in North America, just as Canada's health systems' responses are being hampered by the dismantling of public health and research infrastructure in the United States,"" writes family physician Dr. Shannon Charlebois, medical editor, CMAJ, with coauthor Dr. Jasmine Pawa, Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Ontario. ""Coordinated attacks on US health institutions by the country's executive office have drastically reduced their capacity to collect, interpret, and share data in the service of public health delivery. This coincides with a concerning spread of novel and existing communicable diseases across the continent, including in Canada.""

The spillover effect of changes in the US will likely affect Canada and other countries around the globe, as programs to track infectious diseases and address potential pandemic threats like avian flu have been cut or cancelled, and specialized staff with the capacity to rapidly develop reliable tests have been fired. Canada and other countries have relied on this work for disease surveillance and public health preparedness.

Now is the time for Canada to act on long-standing calls to strengthen health surveillance systems, improve interoperability and data exchange between electronic medical records and health systems, and better document and report rates of vaccine coverage.

The editorial outlines the threats from several infectious diseases to Canadians - information the public should be made aware of. However, ""[p]eople living in Canada are vulnerable to a cross-border bleed of not only microorganisms, but also of attitudes, health misinformation, and exposure to biased US media."" write Charlebois and Pawa.

""Canada does not have control over the situation south of the border, but strengthening national capacity to manage communicable diseases by optimizing data collection and interprovincial sharing of the information required to do this is possible.""

New research from UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center has uncovered an evolutionary change that may explain why certain immune cells in humans are less effective at fighting solid tumors compared to non-human primates. This insight could lead to more powerful cancer treatments.

The study was published in Nature Communications. It revealed a tiny genetic difference in an immune protein called Fas Ligand (FasL) between humans and non-human primates. This genetic mutation makes the FasL protein vulnerable to being disabled by plasmin, a tumor-associated enzyme. This vulnerability seems unique to humans and is not found in non-human primates, such as chimpanzees.

The evolutionary mutation in FasL may have contributed to the larger brain size in humans. But in the context of cancer, it was an unfavorable tradeoff because the mutation gives certain tumors a way to disarm parts of our immune system.""

Jogender Tushir-Singh, senior author for the study and associate professor, Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology

FasL is an immune cell membrane protein that triggers a programmed cell death called apoptosis. Activated immune cells, including CAR-T cells made from a patient's immune system, use apoptosis to kill cancer cells.

The UC Davis team discovered that in human genes, a single evolutionary amino acid change - serine instead of proline at position 153 - makes FasL more susceptible to being cut and inactivated by plasmin.

Plasmin is a protease enzyme that is often elevated in aggressive solid tumors like triple negative breast cancer, colon cancer and ovarian cancer.

This means that even when human immune cells are activated and ready to attack the tumor cells, one of their key death weapons - FasL - can be neutralized by the tumor environment, reducing the effectiveness of immunotherapies.

The findings may help explain why CAR-T and T-cell-based therapies can be effective in blood cancers but often fall short in solid tumors. Blood cancers often do not rely on plasmin to metastasize, whereas tumors like ovarian cancer rely heavily on plasmin to spread the cancer.

Significantly, the study also showed that blocking plasmin or shielding FasL from cleavage can restore its cancer-killing power. That finding may open new doors for improving cancer immunotherapy.

By combining current treatments with plasmin inhibitors or specially designed antibodies that protect FasL, scientists may be able to boost immune responses in patients with solid tumors.

""Humans have a significantly higher rate of cancer than chimpanzees and other primates. There is a lot that we do not know and can still learn from primates and apply to improve human cancer immunotherapies,"" said Tushir-Singh. ""Regardless, this is a major step toward personalizing and enhancing immunotherapy for the plasmin-positive cancers that have been difficult to treat.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","The USWNT has not just a new era of players, but a new era of leaders","https://www.inquirer.com/soccer/claire-hutton-uswnt-sam-coffey-naomi-girma-emma-hayes-20250703.html","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 17:05:17 GMT","

Sam Coffey, Naomi Girma, and 19-year-old Claire Hutton are reminders to the world that no country consistently develops as much top women's soccer talent as the United States.


WASHINGTON — Some day, the U.S. women's soccer team will lose a game again.

It doesn't happen often. Since the Americans' unprecedented early exit from the 2023 World Cup, they've only suffered three defeats in 39 games. And even that amount of losing has at times been enough to rattle the fan base.

Still, it's a lot of winning overall. And it isn't just because of the famous names who shine brightest in the biggest games, like the “Triple Espresso” Olympic-winning attack of Sophia Wilson, Trinity Rodman, and Mallory Swanson.

These days, it's actually because of all the other players in the program, even if fans don't know them as well. For as much as the rest of the women's soccer world has improved, it remains true that no other country develops as much high-level talent on a consistent basis as the United States.

The next generation is not just starting to play often, it's starting to grow into leadership. That was seen again Wednesday night, when the U.S. capped a five-game summer slate with a 3-0 rout of Canada.

It was seen in 20-year-old Alyssa Thompson's darting runs forward from left wing, having seized a starting role in the Triple Espresso line's absence. (Wilson and Swanson are pregnant, and Rodman is injured.) It was seen in 19-year-old Claire Hutton commanding the defensive midfield spot in what's always a physical matchup, and leaping to head in her first national team goal off a corner kick.

Both outside backs, positions where the U.S. has often lacked depth, had newcomers who seem up to the task: 23-year-old Avery Patterson on the right and 21-year-old Lilly Reale on the left.

At centerback, 25-year-old Naomi Girma has long since proven her talents, including a calmness that players far older than her could only hope to emulate. 

Sam Coffey still counts as a newcomer too at age 26. She has only become a national team regular over the last year and change and has done so well that manager Emma Hayes now includes her in the rotation of captains.

Yes, big countries in the rest of the world have caught up to the U.S. in terms of top-end talent — especially reigning World Cup champion Spain, reigning European champion England, fellow European powers Germany and France, and perennial Asian force Japan. 

But none have yet fully overtaken the U.S. atop the rankings for the most consistent production of players in both quality and quantity. Wednesday's game, coincidentally played on the opening day of this summer's European Championship, was the latest proof.

“We're not going to win something again doing what we did in exactly the same way,” Hayes said. “To win a World Cup, it's another level. So I trust the players. They know that I want them to trust in themselves and have the belief in themselves, because they're good enough.”

As she trusts the players, they trust her in turn and reward her with nights like these. The image of Hutton grabbing her shirt and pointing at the U.S. crest after her goal will live in lots of memories, not just hers.

“Just to wear this jersey, wear this badge, it weighs a lot, and I know the history behind it,” Hutton said. “I think it does speak to a lot of the trust that is put into me, and it also goes to who I'm playing around. I'm playing next to Sam Coffey today. I played next to [23-year-old] Sam Meza the first game [vs. Ireland on June 26], and just knowing that I have these other players to learn from and grow with is incredible.”

Veteran attacking midfielder Rose Lavelle, who played a 68-minute starting shift in front of Hutton, gave her loads of praise.

“Oh, my gosh,” Lavelle said. “Claire plays well beyond her years. … I think the sky's the limit for her. She's already commanding in the midfield. So, yeah, I'm excited to see how she continues to grow and develop in that role.”

Patterson gave thanks for the opportunity and noted that it hasn't always been there for young players. It's one thing to bring in a lot of prospects in the off years between an Olympics and a World Cup, but the U.S. Soccer Federation has also significantly raised its investment in U.S. women's youth teams. The second-year pro, a product of North Carolina's college powerhouse, has been one of the beneficiaries.

“I'm very fortunate to be in the position that I am today, considering a couple years ago, this wouldn't have been an opportunity for me or for any of the younger players,” Patterson said. “So I think knowing that she has the utmost trust in [us] — it's my second year playing professional soccer, so that's something that is really special.”

And as Coffey said of recently adding her first U.S. captain's armband to her regular captaincy of the Portland Thorns: “I come fully into myself as a player and a person as I grow in that role. … It's an ongoing learning process and one that's not always easy. But I'm really grateful for the lessons that I'm learning and the ways that I'm able to grow as a leader.”

Hayes acknowledged that not all of the young players might be on the field when the U.S. returns to bigger games. But they are here now and making the most of it, and that's the best they can do.

“I think Emma does a really good job of giving them that trust, but also confidence, and I think that's why you see them going out and playing like their best selves” said Girma, who on Wednesday captained the U.S. for one of what will be many times in her career. “They don't seem scared; they don't seem timid. They come in and they raise the level. I think as a program, that's what we need, and I'm really proud of the work they've put in.”

There is ever more noise from the rest of the world, especially from Europe — doubly so during the Euros tournament, with all the attention it gets. The U.S., meanwhile, is going about its business more quietly. But it's still at the top of the game, and Wednesday was the latest proof.","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Why Diego Luna's ‘Hunger, Desire' has Translated into a Standout Gold Cup","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/07/diego-luna-usmnt-has-standout-concacaf-gold-cup","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 19:04:05 GMT","

When Diego Luna scored his first National Team goal in the Concacaf Gold Cup Quarterfinal, he celebrated by pointing to the crest on his jersey. 

Then, he doubled that contribution with a brace in the 2-1 semifinal win against Guatemala. And again, he took in the moment with a gesture to his jersey.

USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino often underscores wanting to see players compete with pride for their country. Pochettino looks to Luna as a clear example of that.

“It's that attitude, hunger, desire,” Pochettino said. “... [He's] desperate to play for this shirt for the National Team, and that is why now he is at the level he's shown.” 

In 2025, Luna leads the team in goal contributions with three goals and four assists. He earned just his 11th cap in Wednesday's knockout win. The midfielder got his first call-up in the January 2024 development camp. He'd have to wait a full year until he got his second call-up and made his mark, earning a spot in the Concacaf Nations League roster in March, then as a starter in the Gold Cup.

The 21-year-old caught the attention of many in a January friendly against Costa Rica when he continued to play after sustaining a broken nose. Cotton rolls stuffed up his nostrils to stop the blood didn't keep Luna from competing. That image has become the embodiment of Luna's grit and desire. 

Captain Tim Ream said Luna is “not fazed by anything.” It's a quality that the veteran defender hasn't seen in a while, especially in a player as young as Luna. It's also why, when the USA needed to set the tone early in the semifinal and match the energy of the crowd at Energizer Park — which was mostly cheering for the opposition — Luna was calm and composed. He bagged a brace in less than 15 minutes to swing the momentum toward the U.S.and lead the Americans to their semifinal win and 13th Gold Cup Final.

“He just has something about him,” Ream said. “That chip on his shoulder that was like, ‘This is me — unapologetically me. Get me the ball. I'mg onna make things happen.' And let's drag the rest of us into the fight and get after it. It's just so nice to see.”

Like many other senior team players, Luna developed playing for U.S. Youth National Teams. He made a particular impact at the U-20 level, winning the U-20 Concacaf Championship in 2022. At the time, he was playing with USL Championship's EL Paso Locomotive, after he signed with the Division II team when he was 17 years old. Later that year, he caught MLS attention and transferred to Real Salt Lake, where he's called home for the last three years. Last week, he was one of seven USMNT players in this camp named to the MLS All-Star roster and will have the chance to represent U.S. Soccer and Real Salt Lake at the MLS All-Star Game on July 23.

Now, he's shining at the highest level in Concacaf. He'll have another chance to showcase his skill and be part of his first championship roster as the USMNT faces Mexico in the final at NRG Stadium in Houston on July 6 (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

“It's going to be about the energy and the grit that we have to really put in good performances,” Luna said of the final. “We have the capability to create chances and players that have the ability to do special things.”

But most of all, it'll be about the words Pochettino echoed.

“I think it's about the hunger and attitude going into this,” Luna said.

English Premier League club Chelsea face Brazil's Palmeiras in the second quarterfinal of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Who: Chelsea vs Palmeiras
What: FIFA Club World Cup quarterfinals
Where: Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States
When: Friday, July 4 at 9pm (01:00 GMT, July 5)

How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 6pm local (22:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream.

The second quarterfinal of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup pits English Premier League club Chelsea against Brazil's Palmeiras.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at whether the match-up is a repeat of the 2021 final, which the Blues won 2-1 in the United Arab Emirates.

Chelsea picked up wins against Los Angeles and ES Tunis in the group stage to seal their qualification for the knockout rounds, although they did slip to a 3-1 defeat to another Brazilian club, Flamengo, to concede the top spot.

That handed the Blues a tricky all-European round of 16 tie against Benfica, which required extra time for the London-based club to progress with a 4-1 win.

A two-hour delay, with Chelsea leading 1-0 with four minutes of normal time to play, for nearby lightning was far from ideal in what has already proved a draining summer tournament.

Two draws, against Corinthians and Porto, and a final match win against Al Ahly were enough for Palmeiras to progress to the last 16 of the tournament.

The cost of finishing second in the group, behind Porto, meant an all-Brazilian tie with Botafogo in the first knockout round.

Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho came off the bench to score the only goal of the game in extra time to send Palmeiras through.

The winners of the first quarterfinal between Brazil's Fluminense and Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal, played earlier in the day, await the winners of the second last-eight tie.

Paris Saint-Germain against Bayern Munich and Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund complete the quarterfinal lineup, with the winners of those ties facing each other in the semifinals.

Yes. Chelsea signed forward Joao Pedro from Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday and could make his debut for the London-based club in the quarterfinals.

Financial details were not disclosed, but British media reported that the deal was worth 60 million pounds ($81.54m).

“Everyone knows this is a big club with a great history,” the Brazilian, who has signed an eight-year contract, said in a statement.

“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now. So I am excited to join, and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win.”

The 23-year-old joined Brighton from Watford in 2023 and has scored 30 goals and provided 10 assists in 70 appearances for the south-coast club.

He has also made three appearances for Brazil's senior team.

“We've come a long way. It was difficult to be so close to the end of the match and then have a kick in the teeth like that when we lost a late goal. We had to pick ourselves up and brush ourselves down – and to then score a few goals in extra time after the delay probably shows how far we've come, and everyone has played a part.”

“Never give up, never give in. All the time, we work for this. I would like to say thank you to my players for all their efforts. We had an amazing game against Botafogo. When we needed to suffer, we suffered together with one player less. We deserved it because we work a lot.”

Chelsea welcome back striker Nicolas Jackson after a two-game ban for his sending off in the defeat by Flamengo.

Moises Caicedo, however, sits out the tie after picking up a yellow card in the win against Benfica.

Paulinho is set to have surgery on his leg after the tournament, so, despite his winning goal in the last round, the midfielder is set to remain among the substitutes.

Palmeiras will also be without the services of the suspended Uruguayan Joaquin Piquerez.

Estevao, who is set to join Chelsea following the finals, will, however, be able to play.

This is only the second meeting between the sides following Chelsea's 2-1 win in the 2021 Club World Cup final.

Romelu Lukaku and Kai Havertz scored for the Blues, either side of Raphael Veiga's 64th-minute penalty, to settle the match that went to extra time. Luan was sent off for Palmeiras for a second yellow card in the final minute of the match.

Barcelona superstar and Ballon d'Or contender Raphinha has spoken out against FIFA and this year's Club World Cup tournament, brandishing the lack of time off for those involved as ‘unacceptable'.

Raphinha's comments reflect widespread concern for the growing workload soccer players are facing, with the 28-year-old suggesting that FIFA and other governing bodies have shown a continued disregard for player welfare: ‘You have to go, period, because we follow orders; we have to be there playing. And, as a player for a European club, giving up my vacation to play in a new tournament is very complicated.'

‘It's really bad having to give up your vacation to play something you're forced to, because at no point did they ask us players about anything. At no point did they ask us if we wanted to play or what the ideal dates were. They just said we had to go and that's it.'

Barcelona missed out on Club World Cup qualification this year as their FIFA co-efficient for the past four years is lower than that of Atletico Madrid, but Raphinha's frustration demonstrates his concern for those who are involved and their lack of real choice over competing in the tournament.

The last few seasons have seen a significant increase in the number of elite players struggling with injuries, fatigue and burnout, coinciding with a reduction in recovery time between games and growing demand on players to perform in more matches.

Raphinha's comments are not the only backlash that FIFA and President Gianni Infantino have received over what has been a highly controversial Club World Cup, with France's Footballers' Union describing the tournament as ‘a massacre' in which Infantino is ‘trampling player welfare for money'.

While the Brazilian winger has been able to enjoy ‘three weeks of vacation' in his native country, before Barcelona's pre-season begins on July 13, he has emphasized that such time is ‘sacred' and needs to be protected for all players as they face increasingly heavy physical tolls.

The Club World Cup, which also culminates on July 13, has continued to face criticism due to extreme weather conditions and injuries - exacerbating pre-tournament fears over the impact of the tournament's tight scheduling with the regular season.

While Raphinha's comments reflect broad concern over what many are calling a player welfare crisis, rival fans will suggest that his complaints may also be stemmed from jealousy over Barcelona's lack of involvement rather than genuine outrage.

The competition is proving to be a particularly large success in Raphinha's home continent of South America, offering fans the chance to see their teams face off against the very best in Europe and around the world, with Palmeiras set to face Chelsea on Friday night in the tournaments quarter-final.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

The second quarterfinal of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup pits English Premier League club Chelsea against Brazil's Palmeiras.

Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at whether the match-up is a repeat of the 2021 final, which the Blues won 2-1 in the United Arab Emirates.

Chelsea picked up wins against Los Angeles and ES Tunis in the group stage to seal their qualification for the knockout rounds, although they did slip to a 3-1 defeat to another Brazilian club, Flamengo, to concede the top spot.

That handed the Blues a tricky all-European round of 16 tie against Benfica, which required extra time for the London-based club to progress with a 4-1 win.

A two-hour delay, with Chelsea leading 1-0 with four minutes of normal time to play, for nearby lightning was far from ideal in what has already proved a draining summer tournament.

Two draws, against Corinthians and Porto, and a final match win against Al Ahly were enough for Palmeiras to progress to the last 16 of the tournament.

The cost of finishing second in the group, behind Porto, meant an all-Brazilian tie with Botafogo in the first knockout round.

Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho came off the bench to score the only goal of the game in extra time to send Palmeiras through.

The winners of the first quarterfinal between Brazil's Fluminense and Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal, played earlier in the day, await the winners of the second last-eight tie.

Paris Saint-Germain against Bayern Munich and Real Madrid against Borussia Dortmund complete the quarterfinal lineup, with the winners of those ties facing each other in the semifinals.

Yes. Chelsea signed forward Joao Pedro from Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday and could make his debut for the London-based club in the quarterfinals.

Financial details were not disclosed, but British media reported that the deal was worth 60 million pounds ($81.54m).

“Everyone knows this is a big club with a great history,” the Brazilian, who has signed an eight-year contract, said in a statement.

“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now. So I am excited to join, and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win.”

The 23-year-old joined Brighton from Watford in 2023 and has scored 30 goals and provided 10 assists in 70 appearances for the south-coast club.

He has also made three appearances for Brazil's senior team.

“We've come a long way. It was difficult to be so close to the end of the match and then have a kick in the teeth like that when we lost a late goal. We had to pick ourselves up and brush ourselves down – and to then score a few goals in extra time after the delay probably shows how far we've come, and everyone has played a part.”

“Never give up, never give in. All the time, we work for this. I would like to say thank you to my players for all their efforts. We had an amazing game against Botafogo. When we needed to suffer, we suffered together with one player less. We deserved it because we work a lot.”

Chelsea welcome back striker Nicolas Jackson after a two-game ban for his sending off in the defeat by Flamengo.

Moises Caicedo, however, sits out the tie after picking up a yellow card in the win against Benfica.

Paulinho is set to have surgery on his leg after the tournament, so, despite his winning goal in the last round, the midfielder is set to remain among the substitutes.

Palmeiras will also be without the services of the suspended Uruguayan Joaquin Piquerez.

Estevao, who is set to join Chelsea following the finals, will, however, be able to play.

This is only the second meeting between the sides following Chelsea's 2-1 win in the 2021 Club World Cup final.

Romelu Lukaku and Kai Havertz scored for the Blues, either side of Raphael Veiga's 64th-minute penalty, to settle the match that went to extra time. Luan was sent off for Palmeiras for a second yellow card in the final minute of the match.

The 23-year-old is currently ranked as Britain's No. 1

Jack Draper is set to hit the tennis courts at Wimbledon today (Thursday 3rd July) to face former US Open champion Marin Čilić.

It'll be a high-impact second-round showdown, with lots at stake for both Jack and Marin, who nearly won the whole thing back in 2017.

Known for his powerful left-handed shots and cool confidence on court, Jack has the full support of the home crowd behind him. He's never made it past this stage at Wimbledon before, but this year could be different...

As he takes to the court, read on for everything you need to know about Jack, including whether he's in a relationship and his life off the court, which includes modelling with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

Jack Draper is a left-handed British tennis player, currently ranked as Britain's No. 1 and world No. 4 in the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) rankings.

He went pro in 2018 and has won three ATP Tour titles so far, including the prestigious Masters 1000 Indian Wells in March 2025, and reached the US Open semi‑final in 2024.

Jack Draper is 23-years-old. He was born in Sutton, Surrey, on 22nd December 2001, which makes him a Capricorn.

He grew up surrounded by tennis - his mum Nicky was a junior British champ and coached him from the age of six. 

Jack's brother, Ben Draper, also played tennis, but now works as Jack's agent. Similarly, Jack's grandmother, great-uncle, mother, and dad have all played tennis at serious levels.

Jack is 6ft 4in, and is known for his  seriously powerful left‑hand serve (clocked at around 138 mph) and aggressive baseline game.

In an interview, Jack revealed the diet changes he made to improve his performance, saying: ""I used to take a lot of caffeine before I played, because I felt maybe sometimes with my emotions, I would feel tired before I played. The anxiety would shut me down, so my way of dealing with it was taking on a hell of a lot of caffeine.

""But I learnt that probably wasn't the best situation because I ended up becoming very wired and agitated, and I wasn't able to be present and focus on what is important. I think it was probably best that I cut it out of my life.""

In a March 2025 interview with Vogue, Jack confirmed that he's single, saying the intense demands of his tennis career leave little time for relationships, although he does enjoy going on dates...

In a previous interview, he said of his professional career: ""I had to be a bit more lonely and make sure I'm doing all the right things for my warm-ups, my cooldowns, keeping my body fresh, my ice baths, my gym sessions. Since last year, I've definitely put my head down a lot more and just focused on myself and what's important to me.

""It's sometimes a bit of a lonely existence, being a top tennis player. You have just got to make many sacrifices."" 

He sure is.

You can follow him at @jackdraper where he has just over 450k followers (as of July 2025).  

Away from tennis,  Jack has revealed that he wants to learn about investing his money. He's not really into partying and prefers to spend time with friends and family.

He owns a a three-bedroom apartment in south west London, which he shares with his brother Ben and friend Jubb who he's known since junior tournaments.

In April, Jack became Burberry's new brand ambassador, posing alongside Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for the High Summer season campaign.

Novak Djokovic defeats Dan Evans in 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 to advance to the third round at Wimbledon. (0:50)

WIMBLEDON, England -- Novak Djokovic added another record to his name by reaching Wimbledon's third round for a 19th time with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 win over Dan Evans on Centre Court on Thursday.

It was Djokovic's 99th match win at Wimbledon overall, and the 19 third-round appearances put him one ahead of Roger Federer for most by any man in the Open era (since 1968).

It's hardly the most prestigious record for Djokovic, whose 24 Grand Slam titles -- including seven at Wimbledon -- are the most by a male player. But he could at least use it to poke fun at his new, and much younger, main rivals.

""Nineteen times, that's a great stat,"" the 38-year-old Djokovic said. ""That's probably almost as much as Sinner and Alcaraz have years in their lives.""

Well, not quite.

Carlos Alcaraz, who beat Djokovic in the past two Wimbledon finals, is 22, while No. 1-ranked Jannik Sinner -- who was playing later on Centre Court -- is 23.

The growing rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz -- especially in the wake of their five-set final at the French Open last month -- has helped tennis move on from the era of the Big Three, of whom Djokovic is the last man standing after Federer and Rafael Nadal retired.

But Djokovic is too focused on proving he can still win another Slam to sit back and reflect on everything he has accomplished at Wimbledon.

""I don't pause to reflect, to be honest. I don't have time,"" Djokovic said in an on-court interview. ""I would like to. But I think that's going to come probably when I set the racket aside and then sip margarita on the beach with Federer and Nadal and just reflect on our rivalry and everything.""

Against Evans, Djokovic failed to convert his first nine break points in the first set. But once he got the breakthrough for a 5-3 lead -- raising both arms in the air as if to say ""finally"" -- he went 5-for-6 on break points the rest of the way.

""You have these kinds of days where everything goes your way,"" said Djokovic, who didn't face a break point of his own until the final game. ""Everything flows.""

Also in the men's draw, No. 11 Alex de Minaur ousted 115th-ranked Arthur Cazaux 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-0, and 19th-seeded Grigor Dimitrov outlasted Corentin Moutet 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic defeats Dan Evans in 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 to advance to the third round at Wimbledon. (0:50)

SIX HUNDRED AND sixty-two days have passed since Novak Djokovic last won a major title.

That day, in September of 2023, was a history-clinching performance at the US Open, in which he defeated Daniil Medvedev to tie Margaret Court's longstanding record for the most Grand Slam singles titles of all time with 24.

It seemed all but certain that Djokovic would eventually claim the outright record.

Since then, Rafael Nadal, his greatest rival, has retired from the sport, leaving Djokovic as the lone remaining member of the Big Three. (Roger Federer, the other member, retired in 2022.) The now 38-year-old Djokovic has reached a Wimbledon final, made three other major semifinals and even won Olympic gold, but the coveted record remains elusive. After losing to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals at the French Open last month, he was emotional as he walked off the court. He later told reporters it ""could have been the last match ever"" he would play at the tournament and hinted at his own retirement.

Even without mentioning his inevitable end in the sport, there already was a looming question mark over every major he played. But by making it clear that he knew it too, there's almost a countdown clock on his dream and his chance to secure tennis immortality. And now at Wimbledon, an event in which he has won seven times, many of those around the game have publicly speculated that this fortnight is his best -- and perhaps final -- opportunity to win major title No. 25.

Now into the third round after clinically defeating Dan Evans, 6-3, 6-2, 6-0, on Thursday, and after looking mostly dominant in his first two matches, the No. 6-seeded Djokovic's play has supported this claim. And he hasn't hidden that he knows it too.

""Whether it could be my last dance, I'm not sure, as I'm not sure about Roland Garros or any other Slam that I play next,"" Djokovic said during his press conference before the tournament got underway.

He added he wanted to keep playing, but admitted he was unsure he would be able to.

""And yes, I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance because of the results I [have] had, because of how I feel, how I play in Wimbledon, just getting that extra push mentally and motivation to, yeah, perform the best tennis at the highest level.""

For now, five matches -- and potentially his two biggest rivals of the moment in Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz -- stand in his way. If he were to do it, he would become the oldest player in the Open era to win a Slam, and he would match Roger Federer for the most men's singles titles at the All England Club. Twenty years after making his debut at the tournament, so much is in his favor and the stakes are higher than ever. Can he do it?

TO BE CLEAR, Djokovic does not have to win another match to secure his spot among the sport's greatest.

His resume already speaks for itself. He has more major titles than any man in history and has spent an ATP record of 428 weeks ranked at No. 1, including holding the year-end distinction eight times. He has 40 Masters-1000 titles and 100 ATP trophies overall, won the ATP Finals crown seven times, has two Olympic medals, including a much-desired gold he secured last summer in Paris, and the list goes on and on. For many, Djokovic firmly cemented his status as the best ever after the victory in New York two years ago.

""There will always be watercooler debates, but it's going to be tough, and much more difficult, for anyone to argue in any other direction outside of Novak being the greatest of all time with him at 24,"" James Blake, the former world No. 4 and current analyst, told ESPN at the time.

But even if others didn't need any more convincing, Djokovic made it clear he wanted to continue playing and winning as many titles as possible. After he finished the 2023 season with another ATP Finals title and the year-end top ranking, he told reporters he had even loftier goals for 2024.

""Well, you can win four Slams and an Olympic gold,"" Djokovic said. ""I have always the highest ambitions and goals. That's not going to be different for the next year ... Motivation, especially for the biggest tournaments in sport, is still present. It still inspires me to keep going.""

Of course, fate -- and Sinner and Alcaraz -- had other ideas. Djokovic lost to Sinner in the semifinals at the 2024 Australian Open and had to withdraw ahead of the quarterfinals at the French Open to undergo surgery for a torn medial meniscus in his right knee. He returned to Wimbledon and even made the final -- his sixth in a row -- but lost, for the second consecutive year, to Alcaraz. He achieved his lifelong dream of winning Olympic gold with an electric victory over Alcaraz and then was stunned in the third round of the US Open by Alexei Popyrin.

Djokovic appeared to be in near-peak form at the Australian Open in January, beating Alcaraz in four sets in the quarterfinals, and then had to retire after the opening set of his semifinal due to a hamstring injury. Throughout his struggles, Djokovic has spoken openly about his waning motivation and how difficult it's been to continue with Nadal, Federer and Andy Murray no longer on tour.

Since Djokovic's victory at the US Open, Sinner, 23, and Alcaraz, 22, have combined to win every major. Djokovic has had some success over the past year against Alcaraz, but he has been winless in all three meetings against Sinner since the start of 2024.

The duo has established themselves as the New Big Two, with Djokovic on the outside, looking to pull off the upset -- much like he was earlier in his career against the then-more established Federer and Nadal. But Djokovic said that mattered little to him and his approach entering majors.

""In a sense you're always hunting because you're always going for the titles -- in my also privileged position -- the records and more history,"" Djokovic said on Saturday. ""I do feel that I'm always in that position of going for something with the attitude of trying to win rather than trying to defend ... I would say it's slightly different for me now in terms of, I don't chase the rankings anymore in that regard, [but] I'm trying to play the best tennis in Grand Slams and trying to win Grand Slams. That hasn't changed. It still stays the same.""

Through two matches at Wimbledon this week, and particularly in his second-round victory, Djokovic has displayed an increasingly high level of tennis. He was relentless in his overpowering of the British Evans with an 89% win percentage on first serve and 46 winners (to Evans' 19) in the one hour and 47-minute clash.

""The bottom line is, it's pretty obvious why he's as good as he is on that court,"" Evans said after the match. ""He played good tennis and showed everybody on Centre Court why he's a contender.""

Djokovic told the crowd after the match he executed his game plan for the match ""perfectly"" and said it was one of those days ""where everything goes your way."" With the win, he advanced to the Round of 32 at Wimbledon for the 19th time. He will next face fellow Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic on Saturday, with a spot in the second week on the line and a chance for his 100th career victory at the All England Club. Djokovic has won all three of their previous meetings, including at Wimbledon in 2022.

GRASS HAS ALWAYS been well suited for Djokovic's playing style and it remains the surface in which he has the biggest advantage.

Though he didn't play on the surface as a child, or even as a junior, he has managed to adapt his movement, and masterfully utilizes his flexibility and footwork to cover the court. In addition to his strong serve and return, which are obvious benefits, he can handle the low-bouncing conditions and differing speed of the grass better than almost anyone. While some players have said the court speed at Wimbledon has slowed in recent years, Djokovic said on Thursday that grass remains the fastest surface, but added he believes the ball used has changed the pace of play somewhat. He's seemingly adjusted no matter how fast or slow the court may be.

Grass is also the softest and absorbs impact differently than the others -- something that could certainly benefit an aging player with recent leg injuries.

But perhaps most helpful to him of all, Djokovic has the experience on the surface that few others do. The grass season is undoubtedly the shortest portion of the calendar -- with just over three weeks separating the end of the French Open and the start of Wimbledon -- so few top players participate in more than two warm-up events and some, for varying reasons, play none at all. With such a short window every year, it can be hard for players to ever truly feel comfortable on the surface, as evidenced by the rash of top-seeded players who have been upset in the first two rounds of play.

""I don't know when the end is coming but I think his best chance is on grass,"" said Andy Roddick, the 2003 US Open champion and former world No. 1, on a recent episode of his ""Served"" podcast. ""I think his game as it stands currently -- not Novak from five years ago -- but as it stands currently, I think he gets the most benefit from the surface on grass now. And he knows what to do with it.""

If Djokovic were to win on Saturday, he would likely face No. 11 seed Alex de Minaur in the fourth round. While No. 4 seed and British favorite Jack Draper was Djokovic's presumed quarterfinal opponent, Draper lost in the second round on Thursday to unseeded Marin Cilic, the 2014 US Open champion. While Cilic or Jakub Mensik, the No. 15 seed and rising teenage star, are now potential foes in the quarters, Djokovic's draw feels more favorable in Draper's absence. Sinner would likely await in the semifinals, and while Sinner has gotten the better of Djokovic in their recent meetings, he's never advanced past the stage at Wimbledon before, and lost in his lone lead-in event in the Round of 16.

If Djokovic were to make it to the championship match, he could set up a third-consecutive Wimbledon final against Alcaraz, the undisputed favorite to win the title. While it would be difficult to defeat Sinner and Alcaraz back-to-back on one of the sport's grandest stages, it would not be impossible.

""He's not at the levels of Carlos and Jannik, especially in the last 18 months, because the numbers speak for themselves, but the way he played against Sinner [at the French Open] surprised me,"" former world No. 12 Feliciano López said in a recent interview with Sky Sports. ""He challenged Sinner and pushed him to the limit and, although the gap is still big, I see the grass as the only place for him to get to this level that they play because the grass is very different. Djokovic proved that he can still compete at this level [and] he will have a better chance on grass.""

A student and fan of the game, there's little one can tell Djokovic about his chances or what's at stake that he doesn't already know. But as he basked in the adoration of the fans and the sunshine on Thursday afternoon, he admitted he doesn't allow himself to think much about what he's already achieved -- instead saving that for a day in the future in which he can ""sip margaritas on the beach with Federer and Nadal and just reflect"" -- but he is focused on what's immediately in front of him.

""Wimbledon still stays the most special tournament in my heart, the one that I always dreamed of winning when I was a kid, so any history made here is obviously extra special for me,"" Djokovic said. ""It's the beginning of the tournament, so yes, I'm aware of the history on the line and I'm obviously in a privileged position to do that, but at the same time, I'm thinking about the big things that I can make in this tournament.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com.au', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

 Evans admits difficulty in recovering post-match 

 By Ossian Shine 

 LONDON, - Dismantled 6-3 6-2 6-0 by Novak Djokovic on Centre Court on Thursday, Britain's Dan Evans found solace in what could be his final bow on tennis's most famous stage. 

 ""When you're 35, you've got more perspective than when you're 21,"" he said. ""I wanted to win the match. I believed I could win the match. I felt confident going into the match. It's just such a hard task at hand, and that's it. 

 ""I'm not going to say I enjoyed it or didn't enjoy it. I understand the occasion and what a moment it was for myself to go out there and experience everything today."" 

 The veteran Briton, who beat Djokovic in the pair's only other meeting but is now ranked outside the top 150 in the world, acknowledged that he had been outclassed from the opening game. ""I felt like I was always on the back foot,"" he said. 

 ""I'd say, if I had to sum it up, it felt the tennis balls were back in my pocket very quickly and never stayed in there a long time."" 

 Despite the lopsided scoreline, Evans embraced the magnitude of the occasion, particularly in the closing stages. ""The last probably four or five games, I really soaked it up, and I did enjoy it, yeah,"" he reflected. 

 Evans praised Djokovic's tactical brilliance, noting how the seven-times Wimbledon champion served ""like a big server"" despite his modest 1.85-metre frame. ""Today he served spots. I don't think he got over 130 , but every serve was a spot,"" Evans observed. 

 With his ranking having slipped and his body feeling the toll of professional tennis, Evans faces an uncertain future. 

 ""Waking up after playing matches is hard now,"" he admitted with characteristic honesty. ""It's just not as easy as it used to be - without sounding Andy Murray-esque dramatic."" 

 The Briton has not mapped out his schedule beyond potentially targeting U.S. Open qualifying, preferring to ""take a bit of time"" to assess his options. But regardless of what lies ahead, Evans felt grateful for one more Centre Court moment, especially with his father watching from the box. 

 ""Bottom line is I may never get another chance,"" Evans said of playing on the sport's grandest stage. ""I'll look back with a proud happiness.""

LONDON — Top-ranked Jannik Sinner moved into Wimbledon's third round with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-3 victory over Aleksandar Vukic of Australia at Centre Court on Thursday.

Sinner had 38 winners and just 11 unforced errors in the 1-hour, 40-minute match and saved all four break points he faced.

The owner of three Grand Slam titles advanced to face 52nd-ranked Pedro Martinez of Spain on Saturday.

Wimbledon is the only major tournament where Sinner has yet to reach a final; he lost in the 2023 semifinals at the All England Club.

He won the Australian Open each of the past two years, won the U.S. Open last September and was the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz at the French Open last month. Sinner took the first two sets in that final and held three championship points before Alcaraz came back to win.

Wimbledon champions Elena Rybakina and Barbora Krejcikova both advance to the third round in different fashions. Rybakina defeated Maria Sakkari 6-1, 6-3, while Krejcikova overcame Caroline Dolehide in three sets.

Two of the last three most recent Wimbledon champions were in action in the second round at the All England Club on Thursday -- and both advanced to the third round. 

But there were different roads to sealing a spot in the Round of 32 for 2022 winner Elena Rybakina and defending champion Barbora Krejcikova.

In a No. 1 Court match between two players who peaked at World No. 3 in the PIF WTA Rankings, No. 11 seed Rybakina rolled past Maria Sakkari 6-1, 6-3 to reach the last 32 at Wimbledon for the fifth consecutive year. 

After double-faulting twice in the first game of the second set to drop serve, Rybakina didn't lose another game. 

She is now 5-1 against Sakkari, whose ranking has slipped to No. 77, all-time, and has won their last four matches.

Next door on No. 2 Court, No. 17 seed Krejcikova -- who dropped the first set of her first-round match against Alexandra Eala of the Philippines on Tuesday -- was again stretched to three sets, but had enough to push past American Caroline Dolehide 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

After two sets in which she hit more errors than winners, Krejcikova saved her best tennis for the third set. She hit 10 winners in eight games, breaking Dolehide twice, and never faced break point herself.

""I think I was playing well on the baseline,"" said Rybakina, who hit 23 winners to Sakkari's five.

""Overall, I think I found a little bit better my rhythm on the serve later and played pretty confident,"" she added, reflecting on losing just two points in her final three service games.

""[It was] definitely a very tough match today,"" Krejcikova said. ""Very tough conditions that she's playing. She's very difficult player. The match was really up and down, but I'm very happy at the end that I was the won that one and I'm through.""

Rybakina has, in fact, never lost before the Round of 16 at the All England Club. For a return trip to the second week, she will face either No. 23 seed Clara Tauson of Denmark or Anna Kalinskaya. 

Krejcikova, meanwhile, has what she dubbed an ""interesting"" match against No. 10 seed Emma Navarro next. They have never played previously.

While admitting to not watching any of Krejcikova's championship run at SW19 12 months ago, Navarro added: ""She's confident on this surface, and she knows she has what it takes to go all the way. But from my end I feel like I have a lot of tools and the ability to sort of combat that.""

Wimbledon champions Elena Rybakina and Barbora Krejcikova both advance to the third round in different fashions. Rybakina defeated Maria Sakkari 6-1, 6-3, while Krejcikova overcame Caroline Dolehide in three sets.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The Brazilian teenager is into the third round of his first SW19 main draw.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 03, 2025 copy_link

For all the times he's been called The Next Big Thing, Joao Fonseca would be forgiven for having a big head. Instead, the starstruck teenager is staying humble in his Wimbledon debut and the result is a second straight run into the third round of a major tournament.WATCH: 18-year-old Joao Fonseca roars into Wimbledon third round“It's a just a dream being here,” Fonseca said in his visit to the Tennis Channel Live Desk on Wednesday. “Here at Wimbledon, everything is super cool. Since I was a kid, I was dreaming of coming here and now I'm in the third round. I was just realizing what I did and it was super nice. I'm proud of myself with the way that I played.”At 18 years old, Fonseca is arguably still a kid but playing some very grown-up tennis at the All England Club, where he has dropped just one set in in two matches.

“I know that I'm supposed to be the underdog, the teenager one,” Fonseca said after a four-set victory over American Jenson Brooksby. “But at the same time, I've increased my ranking, people are getting to know me more. They might have some fear of me because I'm playing some good tennis, making a good season.“I'm just kind of learning every week. Every month has been a new experience: it's my first time in Wimbledon; it's my first time at Roland Garros. So, a lot of first times this year. I'm enjoying very much. This tour is just amazing. Playing the tournaments you watch on TV is just super cool. I'm living a dream this year, so I'm just liking every moment.”Currently at a career-high ranking of No. 54, Fonseca is tentatively projected to make his Top 50 debut after Wimbledon thanks to back-to-back third-round results at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Standing between the Brazilian and a spot in the second week is qualifier Nicolas Jarry, a former Top 20 player who opened the tournament with a five-set win over No. 8 seed Holger Rune.

“Every year, I'm leaning more how to play on grass,” reflected Fonseca. “This year has been the best. I'm doing better serves and knowing how to play on important points, being more solid. The ball doesn't bounce very well, and it's all very quick, so you need to focus all the time. It's just cool playing on it. The first time I played on grass was in 2022. I played two years in juniors and last year I lost in the first round of qualies here. It's my first time here playing main draw, and it's just super nice. I've loved the experience and the opportunity of being here as a teenager. I'm lucky.”As he grows in experience, Fonseca draws inspiration from Roger Federer, an eight-time champion at SW19 and co-founder of the Team8 agency that represents the youngster.“He's my idol, so before going to the grass season, I've been watching some highlights of him in Halle and here at Wimbledon. The way that he played so simply is just amazing. You think it's easy to play like that but it's not. It was good to inspire me how to play.“Hopefully in the future, I can meet him!”At this rate, the feeling is surely mutual.

The No. 14 seed leaned into self-deprecating humor amid a string of early upsets at SW19.ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Jul 03, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 03, 2025

After a whirlwind first two days at Wimbledon witnessed a record-tying 23 seeds crash out of the tournament, the early-round carnage continued on Day 3. Frances Tiafoe (No. 12) and Jiri Lehecka (No. 23) exited on the men's side, while the women's draw lost Jasmine Paolini (No. 4) and Donna Vekic (No. 22).Amid the chaos, No. 14 seed Andrey Rublev, has quietly—and somewhat surprisingly—made serene progress into the third round.The Russian opened with a four-set win over Laslo Djere, then overcame big-serving Lloyd Harris on Wednesday, rallying from a set down to win 6-7 (1), 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Court 3.Read More: Joao Fonseca shows grit, another high seed falls, and Emma Raducanu gets ready for the spotlight | Day 3 Wrap“Today it was just more about, OK, the guy serves amazing.

I also know how to hit the ball, so I tried to hit first,” Rublev told reporters.“As soon as I have chance, I try to dictate, and that's it… because the guys who like to hit, obviously they don't defend as good as the ones who like to run.”

The win marked a mental milestone, too. It was Rublev's first comeback victory from a set down all year, and his first since the 2024 US Open, when he staged a five-set turnaround against Arthur Rinderknech.Having lost in the first round at Wimbledon last year, Rublev is no stranger to upsets himself. When asked about the tournament's slew of top-seed exits, his trademark dry humor came out in Tennis.com's Quote of the Day:Q. We've seen so many top seeds fall in the last couple of days.

Stroll hopes for 'a step in the right direction' with Silverstone upgrades

The British Grand Prix this weekend sees Formula 1 return to Silverstone – where the very first World Championship event took place 75 years ago. But who should you be considering for your F1 Fantasy team?

Formula 1 returns to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix this weekend – historic home to the very first World Championship event 75 years ago – and our Strategist has been evaluating the statistical trends and reviewing the track history to ensure you're well-informed to make the right decisions in F1 Fantasy.

It's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week. New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Be sure to join the McLaren mini league that is now open for three races between the British and Hungarian Grands Prix. There are exciting new prizes on offer, including the winner receiving an incredible tour of the McLaren Technology Centre.

Keep an eye open for other mini leagues popping up throughout the F1 Fantasy season too, providing you with even more chances to play and win.

Ahead of every Grand Prix, our F1 Fantasy Strategist takes a deep-dive into seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that could contribute to a starring weekend, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

The Driver of the Day award has had some meaningful results in recent memory, especially given the significance of this metric in F1 Fantasy (+10 points). British drivers have claimed the last two consecutive results at Silverstone – Lando Norris in 2023 and Lewis Hamilton in 2024. Could we see another Briton take home the award yet again this season?

Catch up on the Austria highlights below and keep reading for more tips. Remember to lock in your teams before Qualifying starts on Saturday, July 5 at 1500 local time (1400 UTC).

Lando Norris bounced back to form in Spielberg with a 36-point F1 Fantasy performance and continues to average the most F1 Fantasy points per race by a driver through 11 race weekends (35.3).

The Briton closed the gap to his team mate Oscar Piastri in the World Drivers' Championship to just 15 points, after a disappointing retirement in Canada the race before.

As stated, the Driver of the Day award has been claimed by Englishmen at the last two British Grands Prix, including when Norris finished P2 at the circuit in 2023. He presents a compelling option with home crowd support behind him if he is in the mix for another race victory.

The McLaren driver has secured a spot on the podium in each of his last two visits to Silverstone and will be hungry to secure his maiden British Grand Prix win this weekend.

Esteban Ocon reappears on the Strategist's radar this week after double-digit F1 Fantasy scores in three of the last four race weekends.

The French racer has had a new lease on life with Haas, Ocon currently P9 in both the F1 Fantasy and Drivers' Championship standings.

Ocon led all drivers on overtakes in Austria with 12 to finish the race P10, and now requires to score at least zero fantasy points in Silverstone (new players should remember that negative points totals are a thing!) for a maximum $0.6m price increase.

The Haas driver is a reliable option for points and cost cap gain this weekend for engaged players.

For the third consecutive weekend, Nico Hulkenberg warrants the Strategist's attention.

The German racer is in a rich vein of form with game scores of 32, 15 and 20 between Spain and Austria – also securing three consecutive $0.6m price rises in that span.

Most impressively, the Kick Sauber driver came from P20 on the grid in Austria to P9, bumping him up to second for average positions gained per race weekend (3.5) this season.

Hulkenberg continues to remain in the ‘buy' category this week.

Oliver Bearman re-enters the thinking for the Strategist for his home race in Silverstone.

The rookie leads all drivers for positions gained (3.6) and overtakes (4.6) per race this season.

Bearman becomes a ready-made replacement for those players who own Isack Hadjar ($6.9m), a driver anticipated to fall in price this weekend after underwhelming recently in F1 Fantasy.

Should Bearman finish in the points on Sunday, he could also be an outside chance for winning Driver of the Day with home crowd support behind him.

An improving Kick Sauber car has culminated in an F1 Fantasy improvement for Gabriel Bortoleto.

The young Brazilian secured a career-best P8 and 25 F1 Fantasy points, including winning Driver of the Day, in Austria.

The 2024 F2 Champion has improved on his previous race's F1 Fantasy score in every outing since Monaco.

Bortoleto remains at a friendly price point and should be well set up to rise in price yet again.

Other drivers to monitor: Oscar Piastri, Lewis Hamilton

McLaren continue to set the F1 Fantasy history books alight and will be looking to do much of the same at a historic circuit ahead of their three-race mini league going live this weekend.

The team led by Andrea Stella posted their third score of 100 or more Fantasy points in a single race week this season – the first-time since Japan 2024 (Red Bull) that a team has scored in triple digits on a non-Sprint weekend.

In Austria, McLaren continued to flex their F1 Fantasy muscles, recording their eighth fastest lap in 11 races this season. They have also built on their Qualifying teamwork streak, with both drivers making it to Q3 in every Qualifying session in 2025.

If any asset deserves the “essential” tag in F1 Fantasy this season, it should be McLaren.

A triple up on Kick Sauber would be daring for many, but it also has its merits.

The Hinwil-based outfit are averaging 41 F1 Fantasy points per race weekend over the last three, fourth-best among all teams and good for 6.6 points per $1 million spent – value unmatched in F1 Fantasy in that period.

For a team that was plagued with slow pit stops in the early stages of 2024, the Jonathan Wheatley-helmed team has staged a stunning turnaround in the pit box with the fastest pit stop time in two of the last six race weekends.

At the very least, Kick Sauber should rise in value by $0.6m for the sixth consecutive race weekend and present a fantastic option for lower-budget teams to increase in value.

Other constructors to monitor: Ferrari, Aston Martin

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on free practice to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

F2 driver Arvid Lindblad will make his Free Practice 1 debut for Red Bull in front of his home fans at the British Grand Prix.

Arvid Lindblad is expecting his FP1 debut with Red Bull to be a “very special moment”, with the British driver set to get behind the wheel of Yuki Tsunoda's RB21 in front of his home crowd at Silverstone.

After being granted a Super Licence in June, the Formula 2 racer will make his first F1 weekend appearance when he drives for Red Bull during Friday's first practice session at the British Grand Prix.

The 17-year-old is keen to get going and has hailed the experience as “an amazing opportunity”, having long been a part of the Red Bull Junior Programme.

""I am very excited to be driving during FP1, driving in an official F1 session is going to be a very special moment,” said Lindblad. “It is something I have dreamt of for a long time.

“To get a first taste of F1 with Oracle Red Bull Racing as well, after being with the Junior Programme for almost five years, is really special to me. This is an amazing opportunity, and I am super grateful to everybody at Oracle Red Bull Racing for it.

“And to be making my F1 debut as a British driver, on a British track, in front of a British crowd, is going to be really amazing.

“My aim is to get up to speed in the car really quickly, get Yuki good data to help him across the weekend, lead the team in a good direction and try to drive quickly as well! I can't wait to hit the track and get going.""

Lindblad currently competes for Campos Racing in Formula 2 and sits in sixth place of the Drivers' Championship on 79 points, having achieved two race victories and one pole position so far.

Prior to this, the young driver finished fourth during his sole F3 season in 2024 after climbing the ranks in junior categories, a rise that saw him win the Macau F4 World Cup race at the end of 2023.

He also made the ‘Kill Bill' films, ‘The Hateful Eight' and ‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' with Quentin Tarantino.

Senior Editor


	Michael Madsen, the rough-and-tumble actor best known for his work in the Quentin Tarantino films Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & 2, The Hateful Eight and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, died Thursday morning. He was 67.


	Madsen was found unresponsive by deputies responding to a 911 call at his Malibu home and pronounced dead at 8:25 a.m., a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter.




	Liz Rodriguez, his rep at EMR Media Entertainment, told THR “we understand Michael had a cardiac arrest.”

	Madsen's official bio notes that he “balanced intensity with introspection … whether delivering chilling dialogue or quietly capturing a moment behind the camera, his commitment to storytelling remained constant. He brought both edge and soul to every role, and his enduring influence on American cinema is undeniable.”


	His big-screen body of work included WarGames (1983), The Natural (1984), The Doors (1991), Thelma & Louise (1991), Free Willy (1993), Species (1995), Mulholland Falls (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997), Die Another Day (2002), Sin City (2005) and Scary Movie 4 (2006).


	He has 346 acting credits and counting on IMDb in a career that began in the early 1980s.


	“Fame is a two-edged sword,” he told THR's Scott Roxborough in 2018. “There are a lot of blessings but also a lot of heavy things that come with it. I think it has a lot to do with the characters I've played. I think I've been more believable than I should have been. I think people really fear me. They see me and go: ‘Holy shit, there's that guy!'

	











	“But I'm not that guy. I'm just an actor. I'm a father, I've got seven children. I'm married, I've been married 20 years. When I'm not making a movie, I'm home, in pajamas, watching The Rifleman on TV, hopefully with my 12-year-old making me a cheeseburger. I sure as hell had my rabble-rousing days, but sooner or later you have to get over that and move on.”


	He appeared in dozens of films in the past five years alone, many of which were forgettable.


	“Well, sometimes people forget that sometimes you have to pay the mortgage, sometimes you have to put your kids through school,” he said. “You can't always pick the greatest script. And you pick a project you probably shouldn't be involved in and then you have to live with it all your life.”


	“Michael was one of the greatest American actors,” his friend and lawyer Perry Wander said in a statement. “His onscreen presence was macho, but he was a very sweet, sensitive man who wrote incredible poetry and had it published in a number of books. He was my dearest friend and client for the past 20 years and I will miss him. I'm so sad. I know his soul is at peace.”


	One of three kids, Madsen was born in Chicago on Sept. 25, 1957. His father, Calvin, was a firefighter with the Chicago Fire Department, and his mother, Elaine, was an author turned filmmaker who won an Emmy in 1983 for producing the documentary Better Than It Has to Be, about the history of movie-making in the Windy City. His folks divorced when he was 11.

	











	Inspired by Robert Mitchum in the war movie Heaven Knows Mr. Allison (1957), Madsen began his acting career at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, where he learned from John Malkovich and appeared in Of Mice and Men as Carlson, the ranch hand who kills an innocent dog.


	After moving to Los Angeles and working as a mechanic at a gas station in Beverly Hills, he appeared in two episodes of NBC's St. Elsewhere in 1982, then played a cop in WarGames, directed by John Badham.


	In Tarantino's directorial debut film, Reservoir Dogs (1992), Madsen landed the role of the ultra-cruel Mr. Blonde. He said he really wanted to play Mr. Pink because he had more lines with the veteran Harvey Keitel, but Steve Buscemi got that part. It was the psychotic Mr. Blonde or nothing, Tarantino told him. 


	“I had never met Quentin before,” he told The Independent in a 2016 interview. “I walked in the room at the 20th Century Fox lot and he was standing there with his arms folded, Harvey sitting on the couch in bare feet.” He did get to cut off a cop's ear in the movie, however.


	For Tarantino's follow-up, Pulp Fiction (1994), Madsen declined the role of Vincent Vega, which went to John Travolta in what would be an Oscar-nominated turn; he had already committed to playing Virgil Earp in Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp (1994). 


	In the martial arts action films Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and 2, released in 2003 and 2004, Madsen portrayed the assassin Budd (code name Sidewinder) and strip club bouncer who is an early target of the avenging Bride (Uma Thurman).

	











	He then was the quiet cowpoke Joe Gage in The Hateful Eight (2015) and Sheriff Hackett on Bounty Law, the fictional 1960s TV show at the center of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019).


	“Quentin is, in my estimation, the best director of my generation. He's up there with George Stevens and Alfred Hitchcock, Elia Kazan,” he told Roxborough. “Because of that, because of my relationship with him, it became bigger than anything I ever did. And then Kill Bill put the final stamp on that one. It's a great blessing to have that and at the same time, it is really hard to get out of it. And people don't want you to get out of it.


	“But if you're an actor, you want to act, you want to try different stuff. But it is becoming a very, very desperate game, it is becoming a very, very hard, competitive industry. And social media is really brutal. The funny thing is if you look for good things, you are going to find them. If you look for bad things, you are going to find them, too. And most people, sadly, want to look for bad things.”


	In addition to his mother, survivors include his two sisters, Oscar-nominated actress Virginia Madsen and Cheryl; his third wife, DeAnna, whom he married in 1996; and his children, Christian, Max, Kal and Luke. His son Hudson died by suicide in 2022 at age 26.


	Madsen also was a published poet and accomplished photographer, and he has a book, Tears For My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems, due out next year.


	Writes Tarantino in the foreword: “For me, the real journey that Michael the writer is exploring is what it means to be a man in a world where the notions of manhood that some of us grew up with are barely remembered. But then if everybody embarked on the hero's journey, everybody would be a hero, wouldn't they?”

The 'Till' and 'Piano Lesson' actress plays a woman who must fend off a violent militia trying to steal her farmland in R.T. Thorne's feature debut.


							By 

	Lovia Gyarkye


Arts & Culture Critic


	In a future where land is the most valuable commodity, the Freemans adhere to a strict isolationist policy. The tight-knit family at the center of R.T. Thorne's gripping debut 40 Acres does not explore areas outside of their farm, a sprawling tract of land in rural Canada demarcated by barbed wires, nor do they fraternize with other survivors in their dangerous post-apocalyptic world. Led by their resolute matriarch Hailey (Danielle Deadwyler, in typically fine form) and her partner Galen (Michael Greyeyes, also excellent), the Freeman children spend their days tending crops, undergoing rigorous combat training and learning about the traditions of their Black and Indigenous ancestors.

	But their quiet existence becomes threatened after Emanuel (Kataem O'Connor), the eldest Freeman kid, makes contact with a young woman who desperately needs his family's help. 







	
	
		
					40 Acres		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	A tense and gripping debut.
	



Release date: Wednesday, July 2Cast: Danielle Deadwyler, Kataem O'Connor, Michael Greyeyes, Milcania Diaz-Rojas, Leenah RobinsonDirector: R.T. ThorneScreenwriters: R.T. Thorne, Glenn Taylor

									Rated R,
								1 hour 53 minutes			






	Borrowing from a range of familiar sources, most notably the work of Octavia Butler, Thorne crafts a tense and absorbing story about the Freeman family's attempt to survive in a world ravaged by disease, famine and a brutal civil war. In 40 Acres, which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last year and is being released by Magnolia Pictures this week, Thorne builds on the racial and environmental politics that propel Butler's most prescient tales. Like the American sci-fi writer, the Canadian filmmaker examines these themes through the compelling lens of a fraught family drama. Similarly to the protagonist of Parable of the Sower, which is name-checked in 40 Acres, Emmanuel finds himself at odds with his parents' view of the world and yearns for a community outside of the Freeman colony. 

	











40 Acres opens with a bit of explicit world-building. A title card details reasons for the dismal condition of the world; the list reads like an appendix to the Biblical plagues. Almost 15 years ago, a fungal pandemic killed more than 90 percent of the animal biosphere. The global food chain collapsed and a few years later a civil war broke out. Next came famine, which made farmland a valuable commodity. The land on which Hailey, Galen and their four children — Emanuel (O'Connor), Raine (Leenah Robinson), Danis (Jaeda LeBlanc) and Cookie (Haile Amre) — live is an inheritance from her ancestors, who struggled to get free. It's evidence of that promise, never quite fulfilled by the U.S. government after the Civil War, to provide reparations for the formerly enslaved. Because of this Hailey, is protective of the farmland and not interested in sharing its resources with anyone. 


	Thorne structures his narrative (which he co-wrote with Glenn Taylor and Lora Campbell) with chapters. The early ones bolster our sense of the Freemans' routine, showing the goings-on on the farm. The director's background in music videos is most apparent in these moments, when, for example, he pairs Emanuel's early patrols of the farm with k-os' trippy record “Neutroniks,” whose lyrics reflect the young adult's existential angst. Unlike his mother and stepfather, Emmanuel wants to commune with other survivors. When he happens upon Dawn (Milcania Diaz-Rojas) swimming at his favorite pond in the woods, he watches her with the desperation of those seeking connection.

	











	The main action of 40 Acres involves a series of mysterious deaths and disappearances at the neighboring farms. When not coaching her kids on how to maim an attacker, Hailey mans the radio. One day she learns that the Flemings, another family at a nearby farm, are dead. The gruesome details of their murder alerts the broader community to a vicious, cannibalistic militia. This news sends the Freemans into high alert and Hailey instructs her children to approach strangers with a shoot-first-ask-later mentality. 


	Emmanuel can't adhere to this, and when he finds Dawn bloodied and panicked by their farm gate, he hides her in a barn.  His decision sets off a series of calamitous events that threaten the survival of the Freemans and their land. 


	For the most part, Thorne's direction is assured, ably swerving between the nail-biting tension of the principal story and the comedic elements of its subplots. The filmmaker doesn't take the demands of the genre too seriously; he peppers 40 Acres with humorous moments that humanize its central characters. This family might be in survival mode, but that doesn't mean they don't laugh at the dinner table or poke fun during training. It's also exciting to see how the director blends Black and Indigenous lore, underscoring the similarities of these historically marginalized groups in American history. 


	Deadwyler is naturally compelling as a steely woman trying to translate her painful experiences of war to her sheltered children. It's a pleasure to see the actress, whose major roles have required a stoic resolve, lean into softer and even funnier aspects of her character. 

	











	Where 40 Acres is less satisfyingly realized is in its world-building. While Thorne, production designer Peter Cosco and cinematographer Jeremy Benning make the Freemans' post-apocalyptic world feel capacious through a combination of detailed interiors and establishing shots of dense forest (filming took place on a farm in northern Ontario), there's a lack of clarity around the context and conditions of their existence. Thorne shies away from detailing the new world order that governs this land or offering more explanation for the violent, presumably white, nationalist militia trying to steal farmland. There's plenty implied by brief conversations and Hailey's attitude, but questions about who these people are — and their role beyond that of antagonistic foils to our central crew — linger, detracting from the power of this otherwise fine film.

Bavaria Media and Beta Film are backing a new period drama from the makers of 'Sisi,' which reframes the Mozart mythos through the untold true story of Maria Anna Mozart, Amadeus' brilliant, forgotten sister. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Bavaria Media and Beta Film have joined forces on Mozart Mozart, a six-hour drama that reimagines the legacy of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his (real-life) sister, Maria Anna Mozart. 


	The series, from the creators of German costume drama hit Sisi, has received a first-season commission from German public broadcaster ARD and Austria's ORF. 




	Set in the late 18th century, the series centers on Amadeus' sister, Maria Anna Mozart, portrayed by Havana Joy (Love Sucks), who steps into her brother's shoes after his dismissal from the Salzburg court threatens the family's future. When Wolfgang, played by Eren M. Güvercin (Druck, Eldorado), proves too volatile to secure favor at the court of Emperor Joseph II, Maria Anna disguises herself as her brother, captivating Vienna's elite and drawing the envy of Mozart's rival, Antonio Salieri. Her deception grows increasingly complex as she attempts to maintain the ruse, protect her family's reputation and navigate her relationship with Salieri.

	The series stands apart from the upcoming English-language series Amadeus, which Sky has commissioned in the U.K., and will see White Lotus actor Will Sharpe play Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. That drama is a reimagining of Peter Shaffer's 1979 stage play Amadeus, which inspired Milos Forman's 1984 Oscar-winning adaptation.

	“What we definitely didn't want to do was a remake of Amadeus,” Mozart Mozart showrunner Andreas Gutzeit, who created the series and co-wrote it with Swantje Oppermann (Dignity), tells The Hollywood Reporter. “The desire is to tell a new story for a younger audience, and to tell the forgotten story of Maria Anna, who was a musical genius of her own, perhaps as talented, or more so, than her superstar brother.”


	“Mozart's sister isn't a secret, but we don't know much about her life, other than she was also a child prodigy and that she and Amadeus toured together to every royal court in Europe at the time,” notes Clara Zoë My-Linh von Arnim, who is directing the series. “But she had the misfortune of being a woman and then, when she turned a marriageable age, she was dragged off the stage, in the truest sense of the word. There is a lot of speculation on how big her influence was on Amadeus' music, on his compositions, over the years.”


	Jessica De Rooij, who composed the award-winning music for Sisi, is back for Mozart Mozart, giving Mozart's iconic compositions a contemporary edge for the show.  Gutzeit and Jens Freels (Dignity) serve as executive producers, with Simona Weber producing.


	The ensemble cast includes Eidin Jalali (The Swarm, Maxton Hall), Verena Altenberger (Wild Republic), Peter Kurth (Babylon Berlin), Philipp Hochmair (Freud), Sonja Weisser (Maxton Hall), Lisa Vicari (Next Level) and Annabelle Mandeng (Vikings: Valhalla).


	Produced by Gutzeit's Story House Pictures in co-production with ARD, ORF and The Dreaming Sheep Company, Mozart Mozart is being sold internationally by Bavaria Media and Beta Film.

David Koepp — screenwriter of the original 'Jurassic Park' — returns decades later with a new film that strives to return the franchise to its scary thrill-ride roots: ""I wanted to make dinosaurs special again.""


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	The Jurassic franchise was, clearly, ready for a new era. 


	The previous Jurassic World film, 2022's Dominion, garnered the weakest reviews and poorest box office of the sequel trilogy (though still managed to top $1 billion). Some thought Universal's dino franchise might be put into cryo storage for a decade. But executive producer Steven Spielberg wasn't ready to let his creation go extinct, and tapped his longtime go-to screenwriter David Koepp to design a new adventure in the saga — Jurassic World Rebirth, which opens this week and stars Scarlett Johansson as a mercenary seeking to retrieve some dino blood samples on a forgotten island that has ties to the original park.

	Koepp co-wrote the beloved 1993 first film (based on Michael Crichton's bestseller) and penned its sequel, 1997's The Lost World: Jurassic Park. His other credits include 1996's Mission: Impossible (and has quite an entertaining idea for a new sequel for that franchise, as you'll read below), 2002's Spider-Man, 2002's Panic Room, 2005's War of the Worlds, and the last two Indiana Jones films.




			Popular on THR		







	Spend a few minutes chatting with the bespectacled 62-year-old industry veteran, and you understand why the world's most acclaimed director has worked with him on roughly a dozen projects. Koepp comes across affable, clever and pragmatically flexible to the sometimes frustrating needs of the industry. But he's also perfectly blunt about what he thinks will work in a story — or won't — as well as his own limitations. 

	











	“I can only go with what works for me,” Koepp says. “What it works or doesn't for others, that doesn't matter. You have to be sincere … You can only write what you can write.” 


So you rewatched all the Jurassic movies to prepare for this. What did that tell you in terms of what works and what doesn't work, in this franchise?


	What I was struck by was that every three movies there's an opportunity to change the tone, characters and ideas. The first Jurassic Park was an incredible feat of imagination. All these movies exist because Michael Crichton had a genius idea, right? The first Jurassic World, okay, that was also a great imagining. So this felt like a license to start with new people and a tone I was comfortable with.


	But what was more important was I re-read both of Crichton's novels — Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Because I was like, “How am I going to come up with stuff that feels new? I've done this twice, but it's been a while.” When I re-read the books, I was like, “Oh, I remember this feeling.” The books are different in tone than the movie Jurassic Park because Crichton's and Spielberg are very different people with different worldviews. [With Jurassic Park], we did something that was not quite as dark, and certainly hoped it was funny and but still had to be grounded in real science. As I was rereading the novels, I started taking tons of notes, because I was like: It's all still here.


So Rebirth feels like: Let's get away from dinosaurs in the real world, and get away from forgetting that dinosaurs are mostly scary monsters, and get away from the idea that velociraptors are your buddies that you go biking with. 












	Well, I felt like in the in the last film, in particular, they took that idea all the way. Dinosaurs were nesting on the Chrysler Building and renting apartments downtown. I didn't have a single idea about where to go with that. But I wanted to respect what occurred in the first six movies, because I hate when you watch a franchise movie and they gaslight you and say, “No, that never happened.” Or, “That was a timeline.” I hate that shit. So I said, “No, that all happened, but I want to make them special again. How do we do that?” I wanted us to be back in their environment instead of them in ours.


	Then, in re-reading the books, I found the perfect justification. There's a great speech which I just popped into the script, which was that we think these things are going to live here now, but we forget that this is a different planet. Our landscape is completely different except this narrow band where the environment is somewhat similar to what it used to be [where dinosaurs can survive]. So let's make dinosaurs exotic and special so that we have to go seek them out instead of, you know, fighting with them over a cab.


Sure, but to give credit where it's due, you introduced the idea of dinosaurs coming into our world with the ending of Jurassic Park 2, when the T. Rex shows up in San Diego. But also to your credit, you only gave us a brief taste of what that would be like.


	Yeah, once you have a T. Rex drinking out of your pool and eating your dog, there's not much more you can do. 

	











One thing I liked in Rebirth is the movie isn't overly interested in expanding the franchise mythology. There's a small percentage of moviegoers who geek out on those details, but most just want a good story where you can stay present and not have to think about random callbacks or heavy exposition. 


	The working title of the script was Survival. I wanted to keep my eye very much on that with every single character fighting to survive once they get to the island. And the animals, of course, are fighting to survive. So when you got that going for you, don't need to goose it. These are people trying to not die. That's a big story.


Speaking of the title, I was really curious about this: Did you consider calling the film Jurassic Park Rebirth instead of Jurassic World Rebirth? Because you're obviously trying to resurrect of the spirit of the first film and the story has much closer story ties to the original franchise than the World movies.


	That would have been a great idea. Where were you? I thought maybe we should have a whole new name, you know, Jurassic Era, something like that. But [choosing the title] was above my pay grade. There are corporate destinies at stake.


The idea of people don't care about dinosaurs anymore is also in the film and it seems almost like a meta commentary on trying to relaunch the franchise.


	I think they also used that first in the first or second Jurassic World movie too, where they were making gigantic, weird things, because there was idea inflation. So yeah, it's a little meta. But all these movies are. In the first Jurassic Park, there's a shot that pans lovingly over the dinosaur pajamas and Jurassic Park lunch boxes in the visitors center — that was actual merchandise that was going to come from the movie. There is a circularity to writing a movie about theme park people.

	











That reminds me of my favorite shot in Jurassic Park. The CG shot of a velociraptor where there are 1s and 0s reflected on its head from a computer screen below. It evokes not only their genetic creation origins, but also how Jurassic Park was the dawn of the digital age of filmmaking, all in one shot. 


	Oh, that had that aspect hasn't occurred to me, but yeah.


Spielberg was apparently heavily involved in Rebirth. It does surprise me a bit that at this point in his career — and with everything else he's working on — that he would still get out of bed for a Jurassic movie. 


	I've done 10 or 12 movies with Steven over the years, and I think his favorite part is making them up. The part where you say, “Hey, do you think it would be cool if…” That's the part where I still find him so engaged, whether it's a movie he's directing or not. So I get why he would want to — because these are fun. He and I enjoy working together. He the one who started this [franchise]. It's his. So I think he felt a certain care and responsibility to ask, “How can this go on? What would make it really good?”


What was important to Steven to have in the film? 


	That it should be scary. We should see some things that we've never seen before. Let's make the science as close to real as we can. And something that is important to him with everything — but in this movie in particular — he really wanted to avoid anything that was a self reference. He does not like to quote himself. He's allergic to it. If you put something in that rings too familiar, he'll say, “Didn't I already do that? Don't do that.” 

	











That's interesting as there's a sequence with your heroes on a boat where they're hunting a dinosaur that definitely has Jaws vibes. 


	Maybe a little. But it doesn't feel like it's redoing anything from Jurassic. Steven had the idea of, “What if a Mosasaurus was depleting fishing grounds?” Then we ran with the idea. But what I loved was this you wouldn't expect is a 25-minute sea going adventure in the middle of this movie. I felt like it was kind of Creature from the Black Lagoon — a bunch of people on a boat go looking for something weird. I find that sequence exhilarating. It's beautifully shot and acted, and gorgeous to look at. It had scope and awe — which was another thing that was important to Steven to recapture, if possible. Because there are moments where you feel moved by how beautiful dinosaurs are, and that they're majestic, but we can't forget they should also be very scary and sometimes want to eat us. 


I remember seeing that original film as a kid and thinking, “That was amazing, but I can't believe they didn't have the raft scene from the book.” So it's no surprise that's my favorite sequence in the new film. That had to be satisfying to finally get to add that.


	You know when you have to sneeze and you can't? I've had that feeling for 32 years about the raft scene. In the first movie, Steven and I had talked about it. I think he'd storyboarded it. And I had put it in the very first draft. It quickly had to get dropped because it didn't quite fit the structure, and it definitely didn't fit the budget. Also, in 1992, doing CG water was still really hard. Showing a T. Rex in the first place was going to be groundbreaking, and nobody knew if we could do it or not. Doing a T. Rex swimming was off the table right away. So it was enormously satisfying to put that in. When I wrote it for this movie, I was almost just transcribing what's in the book, because it's a perfect scene.

	











Scarlett Johansson did a great job. So I read the character was originally written to be gender neutral? (Director Gareth Edwards suggested this in an interview).


	No, she was always a woman. What self-respecting writer would write: “A character — and I can't tell you what kind of person she is”? You gotta make some choices. But yeah, she was great. I try not to think about actors when I'm writing the early drafts. But I didn't dare to think of her anyway because she's a very popular actress. She the only person we talked to, and urgently wanted to do it. She also had some really savvy notes, which I was happy to implement. She's so comfortable with the action and running and sliding and screaming and looking scared and being mad — all things that you have to do that are hard in these movies. You have to be physically capable. My favorite moment of hers is she's rappelling down a cliff, and she zips into the frame and says, “It's fun, isn't it?” and then keeps zipping out of frame.


What were couple of her notes?


	I wish I had something great to offer but I can't remember specifically. But when a good actor comes in, they behave like their character's lawyer. They say, “I don't believe my client would do that,” or, “My client is underrepresented in this portion.” And you're like, “You're right, for 14 pages I kind of forgot about her.” Then you go through and you do a draft looking at it solely from that character's point of view. It really liberates you, because you're not balancing everybody's needs, you're just thinking about that one character. I felt like her character got a lot better. 

	











Without giving away any spoilers, it's fair to say the film's ending doesn't leave you with a cliffhanger to set up a new trilogy. I liked that it was very, “Here's the end. If we do more, we'll let you know.” 


	That was a specific conversation we had. Do we need to throw to the future in this? I thought occasionally about planting a little something here or there that might be helpful. But honestly, it's a bad idea to do that, and they're the first things to [get cut from a script] if they're remotely in the way. It is so hard to make one good movie — speaking as someone who's both succeeded and failed at making a good movie. There are so many ways to go awry. Thinking about the future is like the dumbest thing you can do. So it was: Let's make this work. If it works, people will like it. And then maybe there can be another one.


Going back to the first movie, two famous changes in the original film from the book is that both Ian Malcom and John Hammond live. I always thought Hammond arguably should have died. But curious, as the writer, did you agree with both those changes or were they Spielberg's? 


	I was in favor of both those. When we started discussing our tone at the very beginning, we decided our Hammond is a bit more of Walt Disney than the more selfish, dark character that he is in the book. You can kill him in the book because he's got it coming. The character in the movie is misguided. The worst thing he does is he's a bit doddering. Ian Malcolm I was never going to kill, because I love that guy. He's so useful — funny and smart and carries the science.

	











You're also the writer on Steven's intriguing new UFO project. What can you tease about that one? 


	I can say that we're going with a really snazzy title, Untitled, at the moment. It comes out in June. That's all I'm supposed to say.


Okay, let me ask this then: Did the events depicted in Close Encounters of the Third Kind also occur in the world of this film?


	Like I'm going to answer that. Sorry Woodward! You're trying to trick me into confirming something that I don't want to confirm. 


Fair enough. You also have the sci-fi movie Cold Storage coming up (which stars Liam Neeson, Joe Kerry and Georgina Campbell and is about security guards trying to stop a deadline fungus before it destroys humanity). 


	That I can talk about that. It's based on the first novel I wrote. Comes out in February. I think it turned out wonderfully and I'm very happy with it. It's horror movie that's very funny and rather sweet — that's a hard balance to hit. But the director, Jonny Campbell, and the terrific cast really got it.


Indiana Jones franchise. That's done, right? 


	Well, I don't see it continuing. Everybody made it pretty clear. Harrison was like, [Harrison Ford impression] “Yeah, I'm done.” So it would need to be somebody's brand new idea about how to come at that. I'd watch it as a streaming show. Streaming is perfectly suited to a serial adventure, which is what Indiana Jones was. He could have a season-long goal and you don't have to wrap up the story every week like with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. But I think their plan is to just let it be for a while. 

	











Speaking of being done: Tom Cruise suggests he's done with Mission: Impossible. You co-wrote the first movie. What do you think Paramount should do with that franchise? 


	This is something [the first film's director, Brian De Palma] and I have talked about. I know exactly what they should do, and I would be happy to write it. I think that they should make a film with Tom playing that character that opens with a great, big extended action sequence. He gets himself in a terrible pickle. He fell off a rocket. How's he gonna get out of this one? He's falling to Earth. He's pulling out Swiss Army knives. He's spreading his skin out to slow his fall. Doing all sorts of clever things. But it's all for naught because he smashes into the ground and dies. The film ends. It's a 16-minute film.

	“It's always been a tool for me,” Harry shared. “It's not like I started having cosmetic surgery as a kid in school — I think nowadays a lot of girls are getting cosmetic surgery when they're 10, 11 years old. God bless if it improves their lives and they feel happy. But as far as me having cosmetic surgery, it made me feel better about myself. Maybe it made me feel happy, or more confident.”

	She added, “It was just something that I felt necessary at the time. I wanted to work, and so much of women being attractive, and being a selling point, is clearly showbiz. If you're going to be in the business, be in it.”

	











	The “Heart of Glass” singer also reflected earlier this year on aging gracefully. “The beauty of aging is that you learn how to live with yourself,” she said at the time.


	Blondie fans have more to celebrate than Harry's milestone birthday. The band is reportedly working on a new studio album with Grammy-winning producer John Congleton.


	The news was shared back in December 2024 by guitarist and co-founder Chris Stein, who posted a black-and-white photo of lead singer Debbie Harry and Congleton in the studio on Bluesky, accompanied by the caption, “With John Congleton. New Blondie record next year.”


	It marks the band's first album since 2017's Pollinator, also produced by Congleton. That record earned critical acclaim and featured collaborations with artists like Joan Jett, Charli XCX, and Johnny Marr. Known for his work with St. Vincent and Angel Olsen, Congleton's involvement hints at a modern, innovative approach for Blondie's upcoming release.


	The album comes in the wake of drummer Clem Burke's death in April following a private battle with cancer. Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock has been contributing to Blondie's new music and performing with the band in recent years, including at Glastonbury 2023.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The signature piece of Donald Trump‘s legislative agenda cleared Congress on Thursday, as the House of Representatives gave its final approval after a marathon overnight session.


	The vote was 218-214, with two Republicans. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) joining all Democrats in voting against it.


	Trump is expected to sign the bill at the White House in a ceremony on Friday. 


	Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump worked through the night trying to convince holdouts, while they managed to flip almost all Republicans who initially voted to block the bill from even coming to the floor.

	As things dragged on, Trump wrote shortly after midnight, “Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy. What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Before the final vote, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave a speech that lasted for eight hours, 44 minutes and 25 seconds, breaking a record for longest floor speech in the chamber. As he spoke, C-SPAN added a timer on the side of its screen. Jeffries spoke 12 minutes longer than the previous record holder, then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a 2021 speech.


	Jeffries called the bill a “disgusting abomination” that will have far reaching consequences, threatening the economic security of lower income Americans. He called it a “crime scene” going after the “health and safety of the American people.” His speech also at times seemed like a kickoff to the midterms, as Democrats hope to hammer Republicans over their voters for the legislation.

	











	“What our journey teaches us is that after Project 2025 comes Project 2026. And you will have an opportunity to end this national nightmare.” 


	After he finished, Johnson said, “It takes a lot longer to build a lie than to tell the simple truth.”


	“Today there was performance for some of them, but today for us is about results, results that improve the lives of Americans, regardless of their race, religion, color or creed.”


	The mammoth, 887-page legislation extends 2017 tax cuts, adds tens of billions for border security and immigration enforcement, allowing for increased deportations, and boosts defense spending. But the legislation also includes cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, rolls back clean energy credits and initiatives. 


	The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years. Elon Musk, once Trump's highest profile ally, has warned again in recent days that the legislation would send the country into “debt slavery.” He also threatened to fund primary challengers to Republicans who voted for the legislation.


	The CBO also says that 11.8 million would lose their health insurance under the legislation through 2034, reversing gains since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. 


	Polling has shown that the legislation is unpopular, albeit significant numbers of voters still do not know enough about it. The White House has been touting its tax cuts. They include new provisions for no taxes on tips and overtime. The break is capped at $25,000 for tips and $12,500 for overtime (or $25,000 for married filing jointly filers), and expires at the end of 2028.


	The cap on the State and Local Income Tax deduction would be raised to $40,000 per year, for incomes up to $500,000. The cap will revert to $10,000 in 2030.


	The legislation includes $257 million for repairs and restoration of the Kennedy Center, even as the Trump administration has sought to dismantle other cultural agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump engineered a takeover of the Kennedy Center shortly after he took office, firing Biden-appointees to its board and ensuring that he was elected chairman.


	Also allocated is $40 million to purchase statues and construct a Garden of American Heroes, long a Trump priority.


	The bill also added sound recordings to the list of Section 181 tax deductions that have been offered to film, TV and live theatrical productions.


	The legislation also increases the debt limit by $5 trillion.


	After passage, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told reporters, “People are going to go hungry, they are going to get sick, on a scale unlike anything we have ever seen, and all of it is just to finance tax cuts for billionaires and the wealthiest corporations that don't even need it. … They are giving people crumbs and they are taking away the whole loaf.”

This is the fundamental difference between us and them. They take action and get the things their constituents want, we have a really long speech by a guy who'd have pulled the fire alarm again if it was anyone else. Enough performing, time to get to work.

Let democrats have their speeches, as long as they don't have power.

Just rename this the ‘Kill the Poor' Bill.

That's too bad, I was counting on the House Freedom Caucus to do the right thing.

Still Winning

			By Anthony D'Alessandro, Nancy Tartaglione 


EXCLUSIVE: Disney's A Lilo & Stitch continues to upend the box office with the duo taking out Warner Bros and Legendary's pigs and chickens pixelated pic A Minecraft Movie to become the highest grossing MPA movie year-to-date with $957.6 million worldwide and $553.9 million international. A Minecraft Movie stands at $954.9M million worldwide and $530.9M abroad. They are the only two movies to surpass $900M currently in 2025. 


Lilo & Stich is currently in its sixth week at the box office. 


	Note the Dean Fleischer Camp directed movie is still on track to become the first billion-dollar grossing Hollywood title of 2025. Also, in all fairness to A Minecraft Movie, they're still the highest grossing movie stateside with $423.9M to Lilo & Stitch‘s $403.7M. They're also the only two pics to cross the four century mark stateside.

	As the box office in post Covid and strike times provides more confidence to studios about the potency of theatrical, here's another big takeaway for the industry, and that's that there's big business in beloved nostalgic female properties, i.e. Lilo & Stitch (62% women), How to Train Your Dragon (50% women) and Moana 2 (71%). No pressure, Disney, but all eyes are on the sequel Freakier Friday with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan on Aug. 8.


	To date, Lilo & Stitch top territories are as follows: Mexico ($66.1M), UK ($47.1M), France ($39.8M), Brazil ($36M), Germany ($30.2M), Spain ($25.9M), China ($25.2M), Italy ($24.5M), Argentina ($19M), Australia ($18.8M), Japan ($16.3M) and Central America ($15.8M). Lilo & Stitch is already the highest grossing film of 2025 in France, Italy, Spain, Brazil and Mexico as well as all the Latin American countries and many other markets.

	











Lilo & Stitch is in the top all-time industry lists of such markets as Brazil and Mexico as well as the Latin America region as a whole. It's also the highest grossing Disney live-action title of all-time in Mexico as well as several smaller markets.


Lilo & Stitch opened domestically to $182.6M 4-day, repping the biggest 4-day Memorial Day weekend opening of all time, ahead of Top Gun Maverick's $160.5M. Across all 4-day holiday weekend openings, Lilo & Stitch had the second biggest ever, only behind Black Panther‘s $242M (President's Day Wknd 2018).


	As we've always noted, it was logical that Disney would make a live-action take of the 2002 animated movie (which only made $145.7M domestic, $274.7M worldwide). The Lilo & Stitch franchise in series and the original pic has driven over 579 million hours on Disney+ around the globe. The original Lilo & Stitch has accounted for more than 306M hours of viewing on the OTT service.  Disney+ global. Retail sales for Stitch have grown from $0.2B in 2019 to $2.6B in 2024, representing a ten-fold increase. Stitch is one of 11 evergreen franchises for the Walt Disney Company that has surpassed $1B in retail sales last year (Stitch being in the top 10). A live-action sequel was announced last week.

Look, we'll be honest: We can't keep track of everything. We do our best to keep our fingers on the pulse of the entertainment industry, to seize the zeitgeist and stay informed on all the news that's fit to blog. But sometimes things slip through the cracks. You think you're doing fine, and then BAM—you're suddenly reminded that Jon Favreau is making a TV show about largely forgotten Disney character Oswald The Lucky Rabbit. Fuck!

This stark and hideous realization brought to you via news that Jon Favreau has cast Amy Sedaris in that Oswald The Lucky Rabbit Show he continues to be making, despite our inability to maintain mental object permanence on the topic. This is per Variety, which notes that Sedaris has been a frequent collaborator with Favreau from Chef on forward—including, notably, his Lion King remake and The Mandalorian, projects so immensely successful that Disney has now allowed Favreau to squander what's essentially a blank check on reviving a character so obscure that the company shoves all his theme park merch into a single little store at the exit of California Adventure, to catch people too brain-blasted by exhaustion to realize the guy on the T-shirt they've shelled out 30 bucks for isn't just an ugly Mickey with the ears drawn all wrong.

Anyway: Favreau announced the project back in March, revealing in the process that the series sounds kind of like his take on Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (Complete with what'll be a hybrid of live-action and animation, albeit with probably fewer murders predicated on complicated plots to sabotage public transit in Los Angeles.) Sedaris joins a cast that's so far pretty much just kids, including Skeleton Crew‘s Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Disney alum Mykel-Michelle Harris, and Ryder Allen, who had an eye-catching role last year as the young version of Oz Cobb in HBO's The Penguin. Sedaris will reportedly play the mother of Allen's character, and will hopefully also get to hang out with Oswald The Endlessly Forgettable Animal, because if there's one actor we'd like to see try to out-cartoon a literal cartoon, it's got to be Amy Sedaris.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Michael Madsen, prolific character actor and frequent Tarantino collaborator","https://www.avclub.com/michael-madsen-obituary-tarantino-character-actor","Thu, 03 Jul 2025 18:25:07 GMT","

Michael Madsen, a prolific character actor best known for his frequent appearances in Quentin Tarantino films, died Thursday morning. The cause of death, his manager said  (per NBC News), was cardiac arrest. He was 67.

Madsen's acting career began with a chance run-in. In 1980, his friend took him to see a production of Of Mice And Men at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company, starring a young John Malkovich. In an interview with The Independent, Madsen recalls wandering into the wings where he found Malkovich taking off his makeup. Malkovich promised to send the young Madsen a brochure for acting classes and then actually followed up. A couple months later, Madsen himself was on stage in a different Steppenwolf production of the same play.

From there, he moved to Los Angeles, where he secured some bit roles in TV shows and films throughout the '80s like WarGames (which he told The A.V. Club brought him to L.A. in the first place in a 2015 interview), as well as St. Elsewhere, Miami Vice, Cagney & Lacey, Quantum Leap, The Doors, and more. 

In 1991, he landed one of his first major parts, as Susan Sarandon's boyfriend in Thelma & Louise. “There's a nice little part for anytime that people think that I've been put in the corner as the guy with the cigarette and the gun,” he told The A.V. Club. “I can say, ‘Well, what about Thelma & Louise? I got to play a nice guy, a romantic guy, and a gentleman.' I rarely get asked to do stuff like that, so I was happy.”

He was the guy with the cigarette and the gun in Reservoir Dogs, which followed in 1992. He had the chance to be an A-list star in the years following—a scheduling conflict kept him from playing Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction, a role that eventually netted John Travolta an Oscar nomination—but he mostly stayed on the sidelines. “I'm not a publicity hound,” he told The Independent. “I don't care about being on the cover of GQ or Vanity Fair. There was a time when I could have done that, but I didn't have a publicist. And I think the studios decided I was some sort of renegade or malcontent.”

That doesn't mean he didn't have an incredibly fruitful career, however. Madsen went on to appear in three other Tarantino films—Kill Bill: Volume 2, The Hateful Eight, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, as well as Free Willy, Wyatt Earp, Donnie Brasco, Die Another Day, and many, many, others. “If a time machine existed, I would've liked to have played Doc Holliday. But it was fun. I just like to live in the present. Hey, I'm in The Hateful Eight. I'm a happy man!” he told The A.V. Club.

In a joint statement shared with USA Today, Madsen's managers wrote, “In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films Resurrection Road, Concessions and Cookbook For Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life.”

“Michael was also preparing to release a new book called Tears For My Father: Outlaw Thoughts And Poems,” they added. “Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, who will be missed by many.”

Michael Madsen is dead at the age of 67 from cardiac arrest, IndieWire has confirmed. He was found unresponsive July 3 in his Malibu home. The prolific character actor was best known for his decades-spanning collaborations with Quentin Tarantino, appearing in the director's “Reservoir Dogs,” “Kill Bill,” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”

One of the finest character actors of the past 40 years, Madsen instantly grabbed viewers' attention in any scene he was in, with his trademark husky drawl. He was a scene-stealer without ever chewing the scenery, always embodying various degrees of laconic. Born in Chicago in 1957, and the sister of fellow screen star Virginia Madsen, he nonetheless embodied traits filmgoers would identify more with that of a cowboy, and he often wore a 10-gallon hat, bolo tie, and sunglasses when appearing on the red carpet.

“In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films ‘Resurrection Road,' ‘Concessions' and ”Cookbook for Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life,” said a statement obtained by IndieWire from his managers Susan Ferris and Ron Smith and publicist Liz Rodriguez. “Michael was also preparing to release a new book called ‘Tears for My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems' currently being edited.”

He added, “Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, who will be missed by many.”

Cutting his teeth at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company, Madsen likely made his first big impression on cinephiles with his turn as “Bump” Bailey in 1984's “The Natural.” The cocky outfielder burned himself into viewers' brains by being lazy and corrupt enough to go along with the New York Knights' owner's scheme to lose as many baseball games as possible, even avoiding an opportunity to get on-base because he had a cigar in his back pocket and didn't want to slide. When Bump does show a little effort, he crashes through the outfield wall and somehow dies, his ashes then scattered from an airplane flying over the stadium. Unforgettable. And in a movie, in addition to star Robert Redford, pretty much populated with memorable character actors.

That's what Madsen could do with a role: Leave an indelible mark with relatively little screen time. It was a quality Quentin Tarantino undeniably recognized when he cast him for his debut film, the ensemble piece “Reservoir Dogs,” the kind of story that basically requires that it be built around character actors. Madsen scarred viewers' forever as the psychotic Vic Vega, who slices off a cop's ear while doing a slow-shuffle to “Stuck in the Middle with You.”

 










And yet somehow he could also play the good guy foster parent Glen in “Free Willy.” Blood soaked Tarantino movie or '90s family film? Madsen could fit right in either way.

More collaborations with Tarantino followed, particularly his role as Budd, the strip club bouncer who'd once been a hired gun for the title character in “Kill Bill.” This is the kind of role Madsen did best: The kind of coiled menace so lowkey his line readings are a breathy purr. The kind of persona to obsess ever. The kind that actually led to a 2007 mockumentary being made about him, drawing from his Steppenwolf classes with the theater's co-founder John Malkovich, called “Being Michael Madsen” — an obvious play on the Spike Jonze film. A lot of direct-to-video genre films, Westerns especially, followed.

But he had one last great hurrah with Tarantino, appearing as Sheriff Hackett in the fictional Western TV series “Bounty Law” in 2019's “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” where his so-relaxed-it-may-be-threatening demeanor came to inspire a little fear in Rick Dalton's small-screen alter ego Jake Cahill. As soon as you see him there, as you do in every movie, you go “That's Michael Madsen.”

He is survived by his sister, actress Virginia Madsen, wife DeAnna Morgan, and five children.

Julie Bowen is more than happy to be reprising one of her her roles 30 years later for the upcoming sequel “Happy Gilmore 2.” Bowen starred in the 1996 original film as Virginia Venit, a representative for the professional golf tour that Adam Sandler‘s titular character joins on a whim. Virginia (Bowen) is also the romantic interest of Happy (Sandler).

When it came to the long-awaited sequel, though, Bowen was shocked to be asked to return. “I didn't think they'd bring me back at all,” Bowen said during the “Inside of You” podcast, as reported by Variety. “I mean, who am I supposed to be? He's got to have a younger woman in this one, ‘Happy Gilmore 2.'”

However, Sandler assured Bowen that Virginia is the “heart of the movie” even though Bowen noted she has less screentime than in the first film. “Adam's like, ‘Stop saying that. You're the heart of the movie,'” the “Modern Family” star said. Bowen previously reunited with Sandler for 2020 film “Hubie Halloween” prior to “Happy Gilmore 2.”

 










Bowen continued that, even when she was cast in the first “Happy Gilmore,” she didn't know if she was right to play Virginia. “I read [for the role] and they were relieved,” she said. “They were visibly relieved. I go, ‘What's going on?' They're like, ‘Yeah, some of these girls are just so aggressively sexy.' And I was like, ‘That's a bad thing?'”

“Happy Gilmore 2” will also star original actor Christopher McDonald, with Travis Kelce, Bad Bunny, Kid Cudi, and Sandler's “Uncut Gems” director Benny Safdie co-starring. Sandler cowrote “Happy Gilmore 2” with Tim Herlihy, who also cowrote the original. “Happy Gilmore 2” is directed by Kyle Newacheck (“Workaholics,” “What We Do in the Shadows”), who also previously helmed Sandler's 2019 film “Murder Mystery.” 

McDonald announced the sequel in 2024, saying during Audacy radio show “92.3 The Fan,” “I saw Adam [Sandler] about two weeks ago, and he says to me, ‘McDonald, you're going to love this.' I said, ‘What?' He says, ‘How about that,' and he shows me the first draft of ‘Happy Gilmore 2.' … Fans demand it, dammit!”

Mega-producer Sandler has a Netflix deal which has been extended twice. Sandler has produced films like “Leo,” “You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,” “Hustle,” and two “Murder Mystery” movies for the streamer.

 










“Happy Gilmore 2” will start streaming on Netflix on Friday, July 25.

Allison Williams had to get “Stronger” to play Marnie. The actress recently detailed a cut storyline that involved her love-to-be-hated “Girls” character working as a SoulCycle instructor. “Girls” aired on HBO for six seasons, from 2012 to 2017, with creator Lena Dunham, Jemima Kirke, Zosia Mamet, and Adam Driver co-starring.

“Sometimes, in the process of writing a season of a show, the plans change,” Williams said during Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang's “Las Culturistas” podcast, as reported by EW. “Marnie was a SoulCycle instructor for a season and that ended up getting cut out of the show.”

 










Williams added, “Listen, I was devastated. I trained, I went to, like, double classes at the SoulCycle in New York City.”

“M3GAN 2.0” star Williams previously reflected on her legacy as Marnie to VF. “The whole show got a lot of flak when it was airing for everyone being too selfish and self-centered,” Williams said, citing how audiences have perceived Marnie differently over the years. “My theory is, what was coded as selfishness among millennials is now coded as self-care. Just being aware of what you need and advocating for your needs and standing up for yourself, and so Gen Z, is like, ‘No, we get her. She [Marnie] makes sense to us.'”

 










Williams isn't the only “Girls” alum to share how the series has impacted her. “Girls” creator Dunham told The Times that she opted to stay out of the spotlight as an actor after the series wrapped. “I always joke that I need a T-shirt that says, ‘I survived New York media in 2012 and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.' And all I got was this lousy PTSD,” Dunham said. “I didn't really understand how to distinguish between what was and wasn't necessary for the public. I felt confused about how I was supposed to respond. I thought if I explain properly who I am, or give a glimpse of who I am, people are going to have a different perception of me, that we would be friends. But no one cares — and that's fine.”

	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke for eight hours and 44 minutes on the House floor on Thursday, in a marathon speech delaying the passage of = Donald Trump's Medicaid-and-food-assistance slashing, tax-gift-for-the-wealthy abomination of a reconciliation bill. The speech breaks the record for longest ever delivered on the House floor, previously held by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 


	Jeffries spent much of his hours-long “magic minute” speech reading statements, letters, and stories from individuals who have benefited from Medicaid and other programs, or have written in opposition to the legislation's cuts to the federal health care program for the disabled and poor. 


	“Donald Trump's deadline may be Independence Day. That ain't my deadline,” Jeffries said of the president's demand that the bill be sent to his desk for signature by the Fourth of July. “We don't work for Donald Trump. We work for the American people. That's why we're right here now, on the floor of the House of Representatives, standing up for the American people.”

	The people are being set up to suffer, as Jeffries highlighted. “People will die. Tens of thousands, perhaps year after year after year, as a result of the Republican assault on the healthcare of the American people,” he said. “I'm sad. I never thought that I'd be on the House floor saying this is a crime scene. And House Democrats want no part of it.”


	Republicans dismissed the stalling tactic, which will only delay the House's final passage of the bill through Congress. “The sooner we get this done, the better,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Thursday. “If Hakeem Jeffries would stop talking, we could deliver relief for the American people.”

	











	“It's an utter waste of everyone's time, but you know, that's part of the system here,” Johnson told reporters. “We'll land this plane before July Fourth.”

	While Jefferies is making the GOP wait to take their victory lap, the majority of the delays related to the bill's passage have stemmed from disagreements within Johnson's own party. On Wednesday night, another record was broken in the House when Republicans forced the longest vote in the history of the lower chamber, holding a rule vote open for seven hours while they attempted to browbeat the party's deficit hawks into submission. 


	While Johnson may consider a lengthy speech a waste of his time, the over 11 million American who may lose health care as a result of the bill's Medicaid cuts would hope that their elected representatives delay passage as long as possible. Unfortunately for those affected, delay was all Jeffries' speech did, and the Democratic Party's accomplishments in the early months of Trump's second term haven't amounted to much more than symbolic theatrics.

Michael Madsen, the prolific actor best known for playing tough guys in Quentin Tarantino films like Reservoir Dogs and the Kill Bill series, has died at the age of 67.


	Madsen's reps confirmed the actor's death to Variety, adding that he died Thursday morning from cardiac arrest in Malibu, California.


	“In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films Resurrection Road, Concessions and Cookbook for Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life. Michael was also preparing to release a new book called Tears For My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems currently being edited,” Madsen's managers Susan Ferris and Ron Smith and publicist Liz Rodriguez said in a joint statement. “Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, who will be missed by many.”


	After beginning his acting career in the Eighties and spending much of that decade in bit roles — including a small part in Oliver Stone's The Doors biopic — Madsen found overnight success in 1992 with his unforgettable turn as “Mr. Blonde” in Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In that acclaimed film, Madsen portrayed a sadistic criminal who — in one of the most infamous scenes in Tarantino's filmography — cuts off the ear of a policeman with a straight razor while dancing to Stealers Wheel's “Stuck in the Middle With You”:


	After his turn in Reservoir Dogs, the now-prolific Madsen continued filling the big screen in tough guy roles in films like The Getaway, Donnie Brasco, Mulholland Falls, and Wyatt Earp; in an against-type role, Madsen also portrayed the protagonist's adopted father in the 1993 drama Free Willy and its sequel.

	











	The Chicago-born actor, and brother of Oscar-nominated actress Virginia Madsen, also appeared in the James Bond film Die Another Day before reuniting with Tarantino in the early 2000s for the director's Kill Bill series; after a brief appearance in the first film, Madsen had an entire segment devoted to him in 2004's Volume 2, playing Budd, a retired assassin (and brother of the titular Bill) living in a mobile home in the desert:

	Over the next 20 years, Madsen remained prolific, appearing in dozens of TV shows, movies, video games, voice acting roles, and music videos: Madsen featured the lengthy intro to Justin Bieber's “As Long As You Love Me” visual, as well as Sky Ferreira's “Obsession” and Iggy Azalea's “Black Widow.” The actor also starred as a version of himself in the mockumentary Being Michael Madsen.


	In addition to appearing in Tarantino's 2015 Western The Hateful Eight, Madsen reunited with the director once more for a cameo as a TV sheriff in 2019's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

	Republicans in Congress have obeyed Donald Trump and passed the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping reconciliation package that pairs massive tax breaks for the wealthy with massive cuts to Medicaid and other social services.


	The bill's journey through Capitol Hill has been fraught. Democrats were universally opposed to the legislation, and Republicans weren't exactly in lock-step over it, either. Republicans in both chambers of Congress voted against the bill, despite Trump attacking them by name and threatening retribution. The bill passed through the House in June, and then barely made it through the Senate on Tuesday. Vice President J.D. Vance broke a 50-50 tie after three Republican senators broke with the party and voted against the bill. “What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding isn't there anymore?” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who announced his retirement amid attacks from Trump, wondered this week.

	











	The House passed the final version of the legislation on Wednesday, sending it to Trump's desk before the Fourth of July, as the president demanded. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) sounded off on the bill's Medicaid cuts during a marathon speech before its passage on Thursday. “People will die … as a result of the Republican assault on the health care of the American people,” he said. “I never thought I would be on the House floor saying that this is a crime scene.”

	











	The “Big Beautiful Bill” contains a bounty of disastrous policies. Here are eight of the worst measures Trump will sign into law: 


	One of the bill's biggest achievements, as far as Trump and his friends are concerned, is the enshrinement of massive tax cuts for the wealthy, originally created in Trump's 2017 tax bill. The tax breaks — which saw the rich save an average tens of thousands on their annual taxes compared to a couple hundred bucks for middle-income Americans — were set to expire on New Year's Day 2026, and will now be extended permanently.

	According to the Tax Foundation, an international policy think tank, the bill will reduce federal tax revenue by over $5 trillion over the next 10 years.


	In order to pay for the extension of the tax cuts, Republicans are taking a hacksaw to programs that benefit low-income Americans, including massive reductions to spending on Medicaid and food assistance programs. In the end, corporations and the wealthy will get to keep paying low taxes, while low-income Americans are expected to lose over $1,600 a year in take-home pay.  


	Trump and Republicans have insisted that the Big Beautiful Bill does not cut Medicaid. This is a lie. The legislation will cut over $1.1 trillion from Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, resulting in nearly 12 million people losing their health coverage.


	The cuts are a middle finger to the less fortunate, particularly those who rely on Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. Republicans have made it vastly more difficult to qualify for the program, imposing strict work requirements and setting up a series of bureaucratic hurdles for recipients to navigate before they can get coverage. 


	Republicans have claimed the Medicaid work requirements are about eliminating “fraud” and “waste.” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), one of the Republicans leading the charge to crack down on Medicaid, previously ran a business that allegedly scammed the program. One of Scott's counterparts in the Senate, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), made a show of opposing the cuts, even writing an op-ed for The New York Times in which he argued that the Medicaid cuts are “both morally wrong and politically suicidal.” He voted for them anyway.

	The bill additionally limits funding that states send to health care providers that treat patients on Medicaid. And the legislation is so expensive that it's expected to trigger mandatory spending cuts, including a $500 billion cut to Medicare, the government insurance program for seniors.


	Trump's big bill sets aside roughly $30 billion to fund recruitment, retention, and bonuses for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. That's enough money to deploy as many as 10,000 new federal police as part of what administration officials imagine as an Amazon-style logistics machine for arresting, detaining, and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. 


	The bill puts over $45 billion into the construction and expansion of detention facilities and transportation, enough money to open up about 116,000 detention beds. The moves would create a migrant holding system that rivals the size of the entire federal prison system. Immigration advocates point not only to the harms that this militaristic mass-deportation program will inflict on minority communities, but also on the U.S. economy. “The immigration pieces of this bill are cruel and harmful for immigrants and their communities, but it is equally harmful for America overall,” Nayna Gupta, policy director of the American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy organization, tells Rolling Stone. 


	She also points out that once such federal funding levels are established, the special interests who benefit — including from the contracts to house detained migrants — will fight tooth and nail to keep that money flowing from Congress. “Once we have an apparatus set up in this manner,” says Gupta, “our experience is that it's incredibly challenging to dismantle it — even if the American public no longer supports such sweeping enforcement and detention.”


	Stephen Miller, the president's chief immigration hawk, understands what's at stake. “This is our one chance to reverse decades of illicit mass migration,” he wrote as the House prepared to pass the final version of the bill.


	Trump's bill will have a devastating impact on renewable energy, revoking scores of clean energy subsidies, credits, and grants given to green energy projects — many in Republican areas — under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. 


	The measures drew objections even from Republican lawmakers. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) warned that the predicted increase in energy prices would have widespread impacts on consumers. “Maintaining a reliable energy tax environment is essential to attracting long-term investment, particularly in states that offer business-friendly climates,” she wrote in an April letter to members of her party. “Repealing incentives that support energy development would undermine these objectives, slowing economic progress and job creation in key industries.” 

	











	“For energy credits that provide a direct passthrough benefit to ratepayers, repeals would translate into immediate utility bill increases, placing additional strain on hardworking Americans,” Murkowski added.


	Murkowski voted to pass the bill, despite her criticisms.


	Should it be easier to shoot someone in the United States? Republicans think yes. Trump's bill throws several favors to gun retailers and lobbyists, most notably the repeal of a $200 tax on firearm suppressors, more commonly known as “silencers.” This was a key priority for Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), a conservative lawmaker who owns a gun store. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) criticized the provision last month as an effort to remove “the controls that we have today to make sure that only the right people get their hands on this technology so that the wrong people can get their hands on this technology.” 


	The Senate expanded the bill's tax repeal on silencers even further, removing federal taxes on short-barrel (also known as “sawed off”) rifles and shotguns. Clyde complained about the final bill because it no longer eliminates a registration tax on silencers and shot-barrel firearms, as he hoped, but people who want to buy those products at his gun shop will still see their costs go down.  


	To summarize: tax cuts for gun aficionados, health care cuts for the poor. 


	Health care and access to the basic resources needed to survive are not a guarantee in this country, but you can bet your life's savings that where there's a spending bill, there's a massive infusion of cash into the already bloated defense budget. 


	Trump's bill authorizes a $150 billion surge in the Pentagon's 2026 budget. This includes billions to advance the creation of a so-called “Golden Dome,” an air and space missile defense system inspired by Israel's “Iron Dome” defense system. 


	The United States already has extremely robust missile defense systems, and the proposal has been criticized as a potentially ineffective use of military resources given the size and sprawl of the United States compared to a nation like Israel, which is about the size of New Jersey.


	In 2023, the most recent year provided by the Department of Agriculture, an average of 42 million Americans received government help paying for monthly groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Millions of children in low income families benefit from the program. 

	











	Trump's bill slashes spending on SNAP by $287 billion over 10 years. In order to do this, Republicans are making eligibility requirements more exclusionary, instituting new restrictions on federal SNAP funding for states, while also expanding work and reporting requirements for recipients. In other words, they are imposing cumbersome red tape and bureaucratic hurdles to discourage, confuse, or strain recipients out of the program. 


	The cuts are the steepest to SNAP since the program was created. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, they will result in roughly 3.2 million adults, as well as their dependents, losing food assistance.


	For decades now, the Republican Party has made it their business to kick up dirt about the national debt and its many repercussions. But as is the norm with the GOP, this rhetoric is not necessarily correlated to legislative action. 


	After months of controversy over the mass firing of government employees and gutting critical federal agencies in the name of spending austerity, Trump and the GOP's bill is expected to add $4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.


	Republicans are using accounting gimmicks to try to change the narrative about the cost of the legislation, adopting something called “current policy baseline” that allows them to essentially write off the bill's $3.8 trillion in tax cuts and insist it doesn't really add to the deficit. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) described the maneuver as “budget math as fake as Donald Trump's tan.”


	The massive deficit bump has driven divisions inside and outside of Congress, complicating the bill's passage. Tesla billionaire and former Trump right-hand man Elon Musk threatened to create a new political party and primary Republicans who supported the legislation. Musk of course led the disastrous and largely ineffective Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and left the president's inner circle on less-than-great terms. Republicans like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) have also raised hell about what the bill would do to the national debt, drawing the wrath of Trump, who has vowed to ensure he is primaried.

Anyone see anything they can't explain? A resident living in New York's upper Hudson Valley reported a strange site flying in the sky late Saturday night. The person who filed the report even says the object was traveling through the clouds at a hypersonic rate of speed.

The sighting once again raises the question if the source is some sort of unidentified flying object, or simply something like miliary aircraft, or naturally occurring phenomena?

New York has a long history with unidentified flying objects, as the state ranks 5th overall for sightings across the United States. It's no secret New York, particularly the state's Hudson Valley area, has a long history with unexplained flying phenomena and other strange sightings.

As stated many times, these observations of so-called UFOs can easily be explained as drones, military planes, communication satellites, or even a meteor burning up in the upper atmosphere, though.

A resident living in Climax, New York reported to the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting center that they witnessed an object traveling at a hypersonic rate of speed the night of June 21. The report describes what they allegedly saw as ""orbs seen through cloud cover at incredible speeds.""

The witness say that for about an hour they saw two white orbs ""through thick cloud cover"", flying across the sky at an extremely fast rate of speed. The person say that this would continue every 5 to 10 minutes for roughly around an hour that night.

The report says that the person witnessed ""the orb start as one"", and then ""split off and make a U-turn"" through the sky.

Back in my early days of blogging for Psychology Today, I posted an article (2010) on the UFO (now UAP) phenomenon which, more than a decade-and-a-half later, I want to revisit and further amplify. 

It is a subject that has grown increasingly compelling and fascinating for some over the years, including myself, particularly following the recent release of military verified videos of so-called UAPs by the U.S. government (see The New York Times article), and one I believe worthy of further analysis. What is the psychological significance of this strange phenomenon?

As Stanford psychiatrist Irvin Yalom (1980) asserts, one of the ""ultimate concerns"" of humankind is our existential state of alienation and isolation often expressed in the question: Are we alone in the universe? Traditionally, religion (i.e., the belief in god or gods or some superhuman being) has been helpful for some, both individually and collectively, in assuaging the sense of being all alone in a cold and uncaring cosmos. However, for many today, traditional religion no longer fulfills this function. 

Yet, despite this secular turn away from religion toward a more scientific worldview, for a growing number of people the answer to this age old query is nevertheless a resounding NO. Why? Because they fervently believe in the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life. (See, for example, my prior piece on the wildly popular television program, Ancient Aliens.) It is as if faith in some divine deity has been replaced by belief in alien life forms visiting Earth in extraordinary vehicles beyond our current technological comprehension. This quasi-religious conviction regarding the objective reality of extraterrestrial visitation begs several big questions, not the least of which are: Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? 

In 1958, C.G. Jung published a very controversial work about UFO's, at that time popularly referred to as ""flying saucers."" Later posthumously titled Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky (Princeton University Press, 1979), Jung's main concern at that time was less whether or not these UFO's objectively, physically or materially exist than with their subjective, phenomenological inner reality, psychological meaning, and spiritual significance. (See my prior posts on subjective and objective reality.) 

Jung's existential emphasis on our fundamental human need for meaning in the face of a seemingly random and meaningless universe is something he shared with psychotherapists like Otto Rank, Viktor Frankl and Rollo May (see my prior post). Indeed, meaning and the problem of meaninglessness is, as Yalom (1980) posits, another ultimate concern of existential psychotherapy. 

Existential analyst Viktor Frankl (1946/1984) felt that we all possess an innate, instinctual ""will to meaning"": i.e., an intrinsic need to make sense of life, to find some significance and purpose.(See my prior post.) When this basic need is chronically unmet or frustrated, when we find ourselves living in a seemingly absurd, meaningless world, a state of mind he termed an ""existential vacuum"" frequently resulting in feelings of despair, rage, depression, and embitterment. As Jung pithily put it, ""Man cannot stand a meaningless life."" 

Existential psychoanalyst Rollo May, in his final major work, The Cry for Myth (1991), clearly illustrates the vital psychological importance of myths (or personal or archetypal narratives) that help give meaning to human existence and suffering. Soren Kierkegaard, a philosophical forerunner of existential therapy, held that life is fundamentally meaningful, and that it is our task to discover that enigmatic meaning.

 At the same time, like Jean-Paul Sartre, existential therapy recognizes the possibility that life may be essentially meaningless or absurd except to the extent we courageously and creatively imbue it with meaning. That life holds no inherent hidden meaning other than that which we choose to give it. And that without the capacity to tolerate life's partial or total meaninglessness, we become perilously susceptible to believing almost anything, no matter how fantastic, in order to allay our existential anxiety or Angst about the unknown and satisfy our insatiable psychological and spiritual need for meaning. 

This could partially explain the underlying psychology of the UFO phenomenon. The unknown can, for most if not all creatures, be a frightening and dreadful experience. As with primitive peoples witnessing natural phenomena such as solar or lunar eclipses, fire, floods, thunder, lightning, volcanoes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or tornadoes, we tend to fear the unknown and create elaborate stories or myths to try to explain it, rendering it less scary. Religion can be generally understood as one such myth. Science is another. They both serve the psychological purpose of mitigating our existential anxiety in the face of these enigmatic, mysterious, and terrifying phenomena. 

This is part 1 of a two-part series.

Welcome back to DEAD Time. In Stephen King's 1974 horror novel Carrie, the bullied and abused teenage protagonist gets revenge on her tormentors using telekinesis, or psychokinesis, the psychic ability to move or influence objects using her mind. This month, I talked to a real-life researcher who has studied the phenomenon of psychokinesis for many years. Professor Stephen Braude is a philosopher, author, and parapsychologist, who received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Professor Braude is the author of ESP and Psychokinesis: A Philosophical Examination (2002), The Gold Leaf Lady and Other Parapsychological Investigations (2007), and Dangerous Pursuits Mediumship, Mind, and Music (2020). He is also past President of the Parapsychological Association and former Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Scientific Exploration. Professor Braude has spent over thirty years studying the paranormal in everyday life, from extrasensory perception and psychokinesis to mediumship and materialization. He is also a professional pianist and composer.

This month, Bloody Disgusting had the pleasure of talking with Professor Braude about his comprehensive work on psychokinesis, including his thoughts on controlled experiments and his most compelling case of PK.

Bloody Disgusting: Your first paranormal experience was in the late '60s, when you were in graduate school and some friends invited you to play a game called “table up.” Is that similar to a séance and what was that experience like?

Stephen Braude: It's exactly like a séance. My friends knew nothing about parapsychology; I knew nothing about parapsychology. It was a slow day in Northampton, MA and we had seen the only movie in town. So, my friends said they knew about his game called table up. They had tried it a few times and they thought it was a game, and they said when it worked it was a lot of fun. So, this was in broad daylight in my house at my table. My friends were not practical jokers and I'm not even sure they had a sense of humor. We sat down at the table and concentrated on the words “table up,” we stood next to the table, and eventually it started to lift up under our fingers and spell out answers in response to questions. The funny thing was, because we were all ignorant about parapsychology, we didn't know that there was a well-established method of doing this. The well-established method was to ask yes or no questions and then have the table nod or rap once for yes and twice for no, and so on. My friends let the table nod once for the letter A and twice for the letter B, and so on, and so not surprisingly, it took forever to get a message.

BD: So, was that a scary experience for you?

SB: It scared the hell out of me, and I didn't know why really. I didn't think my friends were playing a joke on me. Because I was ignorant about parapsychology, I knew that superficially at least, it suggested that there was some kind of agency responsible for this. I didn't know if it was one of my friends doing it normally or paranormally or if I was the cause or what. I knew I couldn't go to my mentors about this. I was too busy trying to write a dissertation and get my Ph.D. and get a job. So, I literally put it out of my mind until I got tenure many years later.

BD: You've done extensive work on psychokinesis, the ability to move objects by mental concentration. Why did you take a particular interest in this subject?

SB: Well, when I got tenure, I remembered that this incident happened back in grad school and I felt if I was an honest scholar and philosopher, I needed to take this seriously. I knew that some well-known philosophers had in fact taken psychical research seriously and I read what they had to say. So, I decided that it was in fact something worth sinking my teeth into. I cranked out a book on the experimental evidence for parapsychology thinking that, like many others, if there was good evidence it would come from laboratory studies. I later changed my mind when I read accounts of large-scale, or so-called macro-PK or psychokinesis. Then I realized that if I was going to investigate this stuff, I was going to really dirty my hands with trying to experience the phenomena myself. PK was much easier to investigate than ESP. I could go with a video camera and at least try to see what was going on, whereas with telepathy or clairvoyance it's much more hidden of course.



BD: Can you briefly explain the difference between telepathy, clairvoyance, and psychokinesis? I think a lot of people might assume these terms are interchangeable.

SB: Telepathy roughly is mind to mind interaction. So, if I think about let's say Bugs Bunny and then you have a thought and that causes you to have a thought about rabbits or cartoons or Bugs Bunny, that would be an instance of telepathic interaction. Now, if a follower at a distant location causes you to have thoughts about fire or even the knowledge that a certain location is on fire, that would be an example of clairvoyance. In other words, where a physical state of affairs causes you to have a thought without the usual intervening causal chains. Psychokinesis is just roughly mind over matter. The direct cause of a thought directly causing some physical state of affairs. It's usually assumed that PK is something that affects the world outside your body, but in principle PK could be working on your body. It could be the cause of psychosomatic ailments or self-healings or spontaneous remission.

BD: I've read that you've received criticism from other parapsychologists for saying there is no such thing as a controlled experiment in parapsychology and that the most interesting cases are conducted outside of a lab setting. What do you say to your critics?

SB: I try to explain it more clearly because apparently, I didn't get through the first time [laughs]. The reasoning is simple. In the case of a laboratory experiment—let's suppose you're trying to test PK by having subjects try to influence a random number generator. We can't go around with a PK meter and see where the lines of force are coming from and experimenters usually assume that everybody connected with a laboratory experiment is going to adhere to a kind of idiotic gentlemen's agreement where only the official subject uses only the psychic ability being tested for and only at the appointed time when the experimenters gun goes off, so to speak. And they assume that nobody else even remotely connected with the experiment is going to use whatever psychic abilities they might have to mess up the evidential waters, so to speak.

Since we don't know where the effects are coming from, if an effect is observed it could equally come from the experimenter who very likely is even more motivated for getting a particular result than the subject. And as far as you know, it could come from an onlooker or it could come from somebody living in the trunk of an old Ford truck somewhere in Gary, Indiana, let's say. In the case of ESP, a blind experiment is going to be blind only for normal forms of information gathering. You can't set up an ESP experiment blind for ESP, blind for telepathic interaction or clairvoyant access to what's going on in the apparatus.

You know where else it makes a difference? In ghost hunters. People who have these television shows and go around with fancy equipment and wait for their equipment to register something or other. They assume that it's coming from some outside agency, and they completely discount the possibility that they could be producing the effects themselves. It's a hoax. I attended a ghost conference in Chicago a few years ago where the ghost hunters were explaining some of their exploits. I gave a talk, and I laid out my criticism of what they do, and they said, “Wow, I never thought of that.” And then they completely forgot about it again and went back to doing their business. It's intellectually dishonest in my opinion.



BD: You've researched a ton of PK cases. If you had to choose one, what do you consider to be the most compelling case of PK you've encountered in your research?

SB: It would have to be what I call the Gold Leaf Lady. This was a woman in Florida whose body would break out instantaneously and spontaneously in a kind of golden colored foil, which actually turned out to be brass. This woman was a well-known psychic; she would help the police solve crimes; she was really good at that. She had only a first-grade education and was functionally illiterate, but when she was in a mediumistic trance she would write out quatrains from Nostradamus in medieval French. And then there was the golden foil.

BD: They tested the foil and determined it was brass?

SB: Oh yeah, large quantities of it were scraped off her body. It didn't disappear. It appeared on the surface of her skin. It often looked as though she was sweating it because sometimes her skin would glisten a little bit before it appeared. But then in an instant there were well-formed patches of the golden foil. The big mystery of the case is what kind of phenomenon is this; is it a material dysfunction or is it what's known as an apport, where an object is paranormally moved from one location to another. The woman's name was Katie. Katie could be going about her business; she could be paying a cashier at a 7-Eleven and suddenly stuff would appear on her face. She had no control over it.

BD: So, she didn't know what would trigger it?

SB: The case is a real mystery, but I think I understand one aspect of it. I think I understand what we could call the psychogenesis of the foil. First of all, Katie had no apparent psychic abilities until she married her second husband. The marriage was by all accounts a difficult one. What happened at first was that Katie started to experience poltergeist like phenomena. So, objects would move around, rearrange themselves, and appear and disappear. One day, a carving set appeared out of nowhere and Katie's husband said, “What good is it if it isn't money?” Then two days later, Katie's body started to break out in this golden colored foil. So, if you want my pop psychological analysis of this it would be that symbolically the foil satisfies Katie's husband's demands for something valuable, but Katie doesn't really have the responsibility of being the goose that laid the golden egg, which is a heavy-duty responsibility. And it's also a way for Katie to safely express her resentment and rage towards her husband because he wanted something valuable and Katie was giving him fool's gold. She was giving him the psychic finger.

BD: You think she was manifesting it.

SB: Yes, she was the agent, but whether it was a materialization phenomenon or an apport I can't decide. The reason I can't decide is that all the accounts I know of apparent materializations is that whatever materializes later dematerializes, it doesn't stick around. But I've had large quantities of Katie's foil analyzed at various places and there is nothing unusual about it.

BD: You witnessed the appearance of the foil on her skin?

SB: Yes. It was really cool [laughs]. She passed away a number of years ago, but this was a case I investigated in the mid-80s initially.

Jensen Ackles-led Countdown continues to dominate the streaming charts.

Per FlixPatrol, the latest crime drama from creator Derek Haas has reached the number two spot on the top streaming chart for Amazon Prime Video for July 3. As of the time of writing, Countdown is only beat out by We Were Liars, while standing well above other hit releases such as The Chosen and The Accountant 2.

Blumhouse founder and M3GAN 2.0 executive producer Jason Blum explains why the film flopped and why its titular android can't be Superman.

Countdown stars Jensen Ackles as Mark Meachum, a Los Angeles Police Department robbery and homicide detective who is called in to join a covert, undercover task force made up of agents from various law enforcement agencies. The series' ensemble cast is rounded out by Jessica Camacho as DEA Special Agent Amber Oliveras, Violett Beane as DEA Special Agent Evan Shepherd, Elliot Knight as FBI Special Agent Keyonte Bell, Eric Dane as FBI Special Agent Nathan Blythe, and Uli Latukefu as LAPD Detective Lucas Finau. Countdown also features Jonathan Togo as Senior Special Agent Damon Drew and Merrick McCartha as District Attorney Grayson Valwell, who each have their own role to play in Countdown's overarching story.

The series premiered on Amazon Prime Video on June 25 and has been met with some particularly divisive reviews. While critics have largely lambasted the series so far, fans have been far more kind to Countdown. The series currently holds a 31% ""Fresh"" rating via review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, as averaged across 13 critical reviews. Countdown's user-generated ""Popcornmeter"" score, however, stands much higher at a 71% approval rating, as averaged across more than 250 user-submitted reviews of the series.

The Rookie's Melissa O'Neil takes fans behind-the-scenes to see what kinds of prep the cast of the series are going through before Season 8.

Haas himself recently opened up about the addition of Heroes and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia to the Countdown cast, which came as a major surprise to audiences considering the fan-favorite actor was nowhere to be seen previously. ""We purposefully left him out of all the ads and the promo. And then he was great,"" Haas explained. ""I felt like he was doing us a favor. I didn't know him, but I was delighted when he said he wanted to meet about it and I thought, 'There's no way he's going to do this.' And then he was like, 'I think this would be really cool.' I don't think he's ever done something like that before.""

Countdown is currently available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

An 18-year-old Morgan Hill woman, Marissa DiNapoli, has been missing for four days, and police are asking for the public's help to find her.

The Morgan Hill Police Department said DiNapoli was last seen on the morning of June 29 with a man, identified as Martin Mendoza. The duo was seen leaving a home on Trail Drive near Morgan Hill. “Marissa's car was later located in the same area,” the police department wrote.

When police tried talking to Mendoza, he was “not cooperative,” and MHPD now considers him a “person of interest” behind DiNapoli's disappearance.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Thursday it will consider whether to revive a lawsuit from a man barred from evangelizing outside a small-town Mississippi amphitheater after authorities say he shouted insults at people over a loudspeaker.

Gabriel Olivier, an evangelical Christian, says restricting him from public property violated his religious and free speech rights, but a legal Catch-22 has barred him from challenging the law in court. 

Lower courts found he couldn't file a civil-rights lawsuit because he'd been arrested, and instead needed to file under habeas corpus, a legal remedy open to prisoners. But because he was ticketed rather than imprisoned, his lawyers say that option wasn't open either, effectively denying him a day in court. 

The city of Brandon, Mississippi, on the other hand, says the restrictions aren't about religious speech, but rather about limiting disturbances caused when he and his group yelled insults like “Jezebel,” “nasty,” and “drunkards” at people passing by. 

The ordinance restricts demonstrations near the amphitheater but does allow him to preach from a designated “protest zone,” and has already survived another lawsuit, the city said. The city says the case is about Olivier and his group's “desire to have their preferred method of protest, without regard for the rights or interests of anyone else.”

Olivier's attorneys say he was engaging in respectful and protected speech at the time of his arrest, and the case centers on a key legal issue affecting free speech across the political spectrum. 




“Every American has First Amendment rights to free speech; and every American has a right to their day in court,” said Kelly Shackelford, president and CEO for First Liberty Institute, which is representing him along with attorney Allyson Ho of the firm Gibson Dunn. “Both of these rights were violated for Gabe Olivier. The Supreme Court will now decide whether those rights will be protected for all Americans.”

The court is expected to hear arguments in the fall.

Logan and Jake Paul discuss why they continue to be in front of the cameras leading up to the debut of their reality show.

Famed Mexican boxer and criminal illegal immigrant Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday, just four days after fighting Jake Paul at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. 

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the arrest on Thursday, noting Chavez was being processed for ""expedited removal from the United States.""

Chavez was arrested in Los Angeles in January 2024 and later convicted of possession of an assault weapon, and manufacturing or importing a short-barreled rifle, according to the statement. He had a prior U.S. criminal conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2012.

He also has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for his alleged involvement with the Sinaloa Cartel—trafficking firearms, ammunition and explosives, according to DHS officials.

While Chavez entered the U.S. legally in August 2023 on a B2 tourist visa, it expired in February 2024. 

In April 2024, he filed an application for Lawful Permanent Resident status. 

However, his application was based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen, who is connected to the Sinaloa Cartel through a prior relationship with the now-deceased son of the infamous cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to the statement.

In December 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services made a referral to ICE that Chavez was considered ""an egregious public safety threat."" 

""However, an entry in a DHS law enforcement system under the Biden administration indicated Chavez was not an immigration enforcement priority,"" DHS wrote. 

DHS said Chavez reentered the country in January through the San Ysidro port of entry. But, after ""multiple fraudulent statements on his application to become a Lawful Permanent Resident,"" he was deemed to be in the country illegally and removable on June 27.

""It is shocking the previous administration flagged this criminal illegal alien as a public safety threat, but chose to not prioritize his removal and let him leave and COME BACK into our country,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement. ""Under President Trump, no one is above the law—including world-famous athletes.""

""Our message to any cartel affiliates in the U.S. is clear: We will find you and you will face consequences,"" McLaughlin added. ""The days of unchecked cartel violence are over.""

Chavez's fight against Paul ended in defeat, with judges giving the Youtuber-turned-boxer a unanimous victory after 10 rounds. 

Chavez was a former WBC middleweight champion and the son of the boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez, who held five different world titles in four different weight classes. Paul's win on Saturday resulted in him getting ranked for the first time, coming in at No. 14 in the WBA cruiserweight rankings.

From Treasury market reversals to trade threats, the first half of 2025 was dominated by policy upheaval and Wall Street angst. The dollar famously fell, while commodities and risky assets were whipsawed. But inside the markets where the world's biggest quants operate, a funny thing happened: Time-honored trading patterns prevailed.

Markets rewarded the strong over the weak, widening the gap between winners and losers amid a return to what AQR Capital Management's Cliff Asness has called “basic rational investing.” That wide dispersion, as the industry calls it, proved fertile territory for systematic hedge funds, which scored some of the strongest returns so far in 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Congress passed President Donald Trump's tax and spending package Thursday, ushering in major changes to Americans' finances. 

The GOP's marquee ""one big beautiful"" bill makes Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while adding a senior ""bonus"" along with a bigger state and local tax deduction and higher estate and gift tax exemption.

Among other tax provisions, the megabill also includes breaks for tip income, overtime pay and auto loans, as well as the creation of a new tax-advantaged savings account for children. 

The chart below outlines these key tax changes and how they could impact your wallet.

The wealthy will likely see a host of new tax breaks in President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill,"" along with permanent extensions of many of the 2017 tax cuts, according to tax experts.

Taxpayers earning $1 million or more are expected to see a boost in after-tax income of about 3% in the Senate version of Trump's bill, according to the Tax Policy Center. That compares with the nationwide average of about 2.5%. In dollar terms, millionaire earners will see an average after-tax income increase of $75,000 in 2026, according to the Tax Policy Center.  

Virtually all the core provisions of the 2017 tax cut are expected to be extended in the final bill, which was passed in the House on Thursday and now heads to Trump's desk, with some provisions becoming permanent. There are also several new tax breaks or benefits added in the bill that further lower tax bills for those at the top — especially for investors in small businesses.

Here are the five most important changes in the bill that affect high earners and the wealthy.

Surprisingly, the Senate bill largely follows the House's version of the state and local tax, or SALT, cap increase. The existing $10,000 cap on SALT deductions will rise to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000, with the income threshold rising 1% a year. Initially the Senate was opposed to a change that largely benefits blue-state top earners. Yet after threats from the House, the Senate agreed to the $40,000 level.

Unlike the original House version of SALT, however, the Senate bill preserves a popular loophole to get around the cap. Dozens of states allow a workaround, called the pass-through entity tax, or PTET, that encourages pass-through owners and partners to avoid the cap at the state level. It benefits everyone from car dealers and dentists to accounting and law partners, but not employees of those firms.

The initial House version of the bill eliminated the loophole benefit for service industries and most white-collar firms, such as accountants, lawyers and doctors, according to Kyle Pomerleau at the American Enterprise Institute. Yet the Senate didn't follow the House change.

“The Senate version has no limitation on the workarounds,” Pomerleau said, “effectively allowing these taxpayers to utilize an unlimited SALT deduction.”

Entrepreneurs and investors in small businesses will cheer a change in qualified small business stock, or QSBS. Created during the Clinton administration and expanded under President Barack Obama, the program is designed to encourage investments and creation of small companies. Under current law, investors or owners of a qualifying C Corp for more than five years get reductions in capital gains taxes when they sell. A qualifying company is defined as a “small business” if its total assets are $50 million or less. When a business is sold, owners or investors are exempt from capital gains taxes up to $10 million, or 10 times the original basis of the investment, whichever is greater.

The Senate bill raises the threshold to qualify as a “small business” from $50 million to $75 million. It also increases the exclusion from $10 million to $15 million, and it creates a new, tiered system for allowing tax breaks for those who want to sell before five years.

Justin Miller, partner and national director of wealth planning at Evercore, said the new rules would allow an investor to put $74.9 million into a small business and have up to $749 million exempt from capital gains if it sold for more than 10 times the original basis.

“It's encouraging wealthy investors in qualified small businesses with enormous potential,” Miller said.

Like the version the House put forward, the Senate bill makes the estate tax permanent, which in Washington means it won't have a built-in expiration date. The exemption would increase to $15 million per estate or $30 million for couples, and the exemption will be indexed for inflation.

For the ultra-wealthy, the estate tax is the most important of all the major tax code provisions. So having some stability, at least until the next election, will make for calmer estate planning and gifts.

The Senate bill includes a limit on the value of itemized deductions that was also included in the original House bill. Only about 10% of Americans — mostly the wealthy — still itemize their taxes, since the standard deduction is now $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for joint filers. Under both the House and Senate versions, taxpayers in the top bracket will have to subtract 2/37th from the value of each dollar deducted over the threshold. The net effect is that top taxpayers will only get a deduction benefit of 35 cents for every dollar, rather than 37 cents.

There's good news and bad news for charitable giving, depending on your income level. For lower- and middle-income earners, the Senate bill includes a provision to encourage more charitable giving by the 90% of Americans who no longer itemize. The 2017 tax cuts doubled the standard deduction, eliminating the incentive for the vast majority of taxpayers to itemize and claim the charitable deduction. The Senate bill allows taxpayers to take the standard deduction and still claim a charitable deduction of up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married joint filers.

Yet for wealthy donors, who now account for the majority of charitable giving, the Senate bill is decidedly uncharitable. It decreases the value of the charitable deduction for high-income taxpayers by capping itemized deductions and sets a new floor of 0.5% of adjusted gross income for the itemized charitable deduction.

So someone with $1 million in adjusted gross income wouldn't get a tax break on the first $5,000 of donations.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever said he will assume the CEO role at Safe Superintelligence, the artificial intelligence startup he launched last year.

Sutskever's announcement on Thursday comes after Meta poached Daniel Gross, a longtime entrepreneur and AI investor who had been CEO of Safe Superintelligence.

In a post on X, Sutskever said Gross' time at the company has been ""winding down,"" and that his last day was June 29. Safe Superintelligence co-founder Daniel Levy will now serve as president, and the company's technical team will continue to report to Sutskever, he said.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been on a multibillion-dollar AI hiring spree, highlighted by a $14 billion investment in Scale AI that brought the startup's founder Alexandr Wang and a small group of his lead engineers to Meta. 

Zuckerberg announced a new organization on Monday called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. However, Gross' name was not listed among the new hires mentioned by Zuckerberg.

Gross did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

During Zuckerberg's AI hiring blitz, Meta tried to acquire Safe Superintelligence, but Sutskever rebuffed those efforts, CNBC previously reported. Safe Superintelligence was reportedly valued at $32 billion in a fundraising round in April.

Sutskever confirmed his plans on Thursday to keep running the company as an independent organization.

""⁠You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through,"" Sutskever wrote. ""We have the compute, we have the team, and we know what to do. Together we will keep building safe superintelligence.""

Sutskever previously served as OpenAI's chief scientist and co-led the company's Superalignment team with Jan Leike, who left to join rival AI firm Anthropic.

President Donald Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday for nearly an hour, according to a Kremlin official translated by NBC News.

Part of the conversation was about Ukraine, the official said. Two days earlier, the U.S. said it would halt some missile and ammunitions shipments to the country, which continues to fight off invading Russian forces.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the pause weeks after ordering a review of America's munitions stockpile, sources told NBC News.

Trump ""raised the issue of an immediate ceasefire"" between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian official said on a call with reporters.

Putin said he was focused instead on a ""political resolution to the conflict through negotiations.""

The Russian president also said his country ""will pursue its stated objectives"" in Ukraine, according to the official.

""Namely, to eliminate the well-known root causes that led to the current situation and the sharp confrontation. Russia will not abandon those goals,"" the official said.

The U.S. decision this week to pause the Ukraine shipments fueled concerns from those skeptical of Trump's commitment to providing U.S. assistance to Ukraine in the fourth year of its war with Russia.

""Ukraine has never asked America to send in the 82nd airborne; they've asked for the weapons to defend their homeland and people from Russia attacks,"" said Mike Pompeo, who served as secretary of State during Trump's first presidential term, in an X post Wednesday.

""Letting Russia win this war would be a unmitigated disaster for the American people and our security around the world,"" Pompeo wrote.

On Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the department ""continues to provide the President with robust options regard regarding military aid to Ukraine, consistent with his goal of bringing this tragic war to an end.""

At the same time, he said, the Pentagon is ""rigorously examining and adapting its approach towards achieving this objective while also preserving U.S. military readiness and defense priorities that support the president's America first agenda,"" Parnell said.

""This capability review, and that's exactly what it is, going forward, we see this as a common sense pragmatic step towards having a framework to evaluate what munitions are sent and where,"" he said.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Washington and Kyiv are ""clarifying all the details of defense support, including air defense.""

""One way or another, we must ensure protection for our people,"" Zelenskyy said.

The pause comes as Russia has ramped up its attacks all around Ukraine. Kyiv's foreign affairs minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia launched more than 5,000 combat drones and hundreds of missiles, including nearly 80 ballistic missiles, in June alone.

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it stressed to a U.S. official on Wednesday that ""any delay or slowing down in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities would only encourage the aggressor to continue war and terror, rather than seek peace.""

BitMine Immersion Technologies shares were halted twice on Thursday, as the firm's stock price soared for a third straight day after an early-week announcement of an Ethereum treasury strategy.

The stock was halted shortly after 11 a.m. ET and then immediately again. 

BitMine shares closed at $135 on Thursday, a 130% increase, but fell to $118 in after-hours trading, according to Yahoo Finance. Since the company announced that Fundstrat founder and CIO Tom Lee was appointed board chair, shares have rallied nearly 1,900% from $6 on Monday.

Lee, who frequently appears on CNBC, said this week on “Squawk Box” that BitMine will accumulate Ethereum before a stablecoin boom crystallizes demand for the asset. 

With a regulatory framework for stablecoins inching toward passage on Capitol Hill, he said it's likely that big banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs will begin staking the asset in bulk, as a way to secure the network and billions of dollars of newly-issued, dollar-pegged tokens.

“We're trying to get in front of that by creating a treasury vehicle,” he said.

BitMine, which operates Bitcoin mining facilities in Texas and Trinidad, said in a press release on Monday that it raised $250 million through a private placement, which included participation from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, crypto venture capital firm Pantera, crypto prime broker FalconX, and crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group and Lee.

The transaction involved the purchase and sale of 55 million shares for $4.50 each. As of Thursday, BitMine had a float of 1.4 million shares, indicating investors who participated in the private placement had massive gains on paper but were not able to trade their shares yet.

Ethereum treasury firm SharpLink Gaming's shares plunged 70% after its registration-of-shares filing was deemed effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Not long after, Solana Treasury firm Upexi's stock cratered on a similar filing.

Shares from BitMine's private placement “may not be offered or sold [...] except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption,” Monday's press release said.

Mirroring the goal of most crypto treasury firms, BitMine seeks to maximize shareholder value by growing the amount of digital assets it owns per share, in this case Ethereum. BitMine noted on Monday that it has access to staking and decentralized finance, or DeFi.

Lee isn't the only familiar face on CNBC leading a crypto treasury firm. Strike founder Jack Mallers is leading the Tether-backed, Bitcoin-buying firm Twenty One Capital as CEO, while Anthony Pompliano, a social media personality and entrepreneur, has created ProCap Financial, another Bitcoin treasury firm.

 The Wyoming Senator seeks to end double taxation and add clarity to the tax treatment of crypto staking, mining, and lending transactions. 

US Senator Cynthia Lummis submitted a draft bill on Thursday, outlining several provisions to overhaul the tax code and exempt certain digital asset transactions from taxation after crypto amendments failed to appear in the budget package.

The bill proposes a de minimis exemption for digital asset transactions and capital gains of $300 or less, with a $5,000 annual exemption cap.

The Wyoming Senator also outlined provisions to exempt crypto lending agreements and digital assets used in charitable contributions from taxation. Additionally, the bill proposed deferring taxes on mining and staking rewards until the underlying assets are sold. Lummis said:

My legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” she continued.

The standalone draft bill is now the Wyoming Senator's best chance of passing the pro-crypto legislation promised to the crypto community after Senators passed the spending bill without addressing digital assets.

Digital asset taxation has become a hot-button issue in the crypto industry, with executives, investors, traders, and users frustrated by the lack of clarity and tax efficiency in the United States.

One major topic of contention is the tax treatment of completely decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and non-custodial platforms where the developers do not have control over funds or consensus rules.

In June, US lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee introduced an amendment to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, the crypto market structure bill, exempting developers of decentralized protocols from being classified as money-transmitting services.

This would also exempt these DeFi protocols from the same tax reporting requirements as centralized exchanges and other crypto businesses employing a traditional business structure.

US lawmakers are scrambling to include crypto provisions in the final version of the spending bill before it hits US President Donald Trump's desk.

Imagine you're messaging some friends on the Facebook Messenger app or WhatsApp, and you get an unsolicited message from an AI chatbot that's obsessed with films.

“I hope you're having a harmonious day!” it writes. “I wanted to check in and see if you've discovered any new favorite soundtracks or composers recently. Or perhaps you'd like some recommendations for your next movie night? Let me know, and I'll be happy to help!”

That's a real example of what a sample AI persona named “The Maestro of Movie Magic” might send as a proactive message on Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram, per guidelines from data labeling firm Alignerr that Business Insider viewed.

The outlet learned through leaked documents that Meta is working with Alignerr to train customizable chatbots to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on any past conversations. That means the bots, which users can create in Meta's AI Studio platform, also remember information about users. 

Meta confirmed that it was testing follow-up messaging with AIs to TechCrunch. 

The AI chatbots will only send follow-ups within 14 days after a user initiates a conversation and if the user has sent at least five messages to the bot within that time frame. Meta says the chatbots won't keep messaging if there's no response to the first follow-up. Users can keep their bots private or share them through stories, direct links, and even display them on a Facebook or Instagram profile. 

“This allows you to continue exploring topics of interest and engage in more meaningful conversations with the AIs across our apps,” a Meta spokesperson said. 

The technology is similar to that offered by AI startups like Character.AI and Replika. Both companies allow their chatbots to initiate conversations and ask questions in order to function as AI companions. Character.AI's new CEO, Karandeep Anand, joined the team last month after serving as Meta's VP of business products. 

But with engagement comes risk. Character.AI is undergoing an active lawsuit after allegations that one of the company's bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy. 

When asked how Meta plans to address safety to avoid situations like Character.AI's, a spokesperson directed TechCrunch to a series of disclaimers. One of them warns that an AI's response “may be inaccurate or inappropriate and should not be used to make important decisions.” Another says that the AIs aren't licensed professionals or experts trained to help people. 

“Chats with custom AIs can't replace professional advice. You shouldn't rely on AI chats for medical, psychological, financial, legal, or any other type of professional advice.” 

TechCrunch has also asked Meta if it imposes an age limit for engagement with its chatbots. A brief internet dive comes up with no company-imposed age limitations for using Meta AI, though laws in Tennessee and Puerto Rico limit teens from some engagement. 

On the surface, the mission is aligned with Mark Zuckerberg's quest to combat the “loneliness epidemic.” However, most of Meta's business is built on advertising revenue, and the company has garnered a reputation for using algorithms to keep people scrolling, commenting, and liking, which correlates to more eyes on ads. 

In court documents that were unsealed in April, Meta predicted that its generative AI products would secure it $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue in 2025, and up to $1.4 trillion by 2035. Much, if not most, of that would come from Meta's revenue-sharing agreements with companies that host its open Llama collection of models. The company said its AI assistant may eventually show ads and offer a subscription option. 

Meta declined to comment on TechCrunch's questions on how it plans to commercialize its AI chatbots, whether it plans to include ads or sponsored replies, and whether the company's long-term strategy with AI companions involves integration with Horizon, Meta's social virtual reality game.

Gene therapy can improve hearing in children and adults with congenital deafness or severe hearing impairment, a new study involving researchers at Karolinska Institutet reports. Hearing improved in all ten patients, and the treatment was well-tolerated. The study was conducted in collaboration with hospitals and universities in China and is published in the journal Nature Medicine.

This is a huge step forward in the genetic treatment of deafness, one that can be life-changing for children and adults.""

Maoli Duan, consultant and docent at the Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, and one of the study's corresponding authors

The study comprised ten patients between the ages of 1 and 24 at five hospitals in China, all of whom had a genetic form of deafness or severe hearing impairment caused by mutations in a gene called OTOF. These mutations cause a deficiency of the protein otoferlin, which plays a critical part in transmitting auditory signals from the ear to the brain.

The gene therapy involved using a synthetic adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver a functional version of the OTOF gene to the inner ear via a single injection through a membrane at the base of the cochlea called the round window.

The effect of the gene therapy was rapid and the majority of the patients recovered some hearing after just one month. A six-month follow-up showed considerable hearing improvement in all participants, the average volume of perceptible sound improving from 106 decibels to 52.

The younger patients, especially those between the ages of five and eight, responded best to the treatment. One of the participants, a seven-year-old girl, quickly recovered almost all her hearing and was able to hold daily conversations with her mother four months afterwards. However, the therapy also proved effective in adults.

""Smaller studies in China have previously shown positive results in children, but this is the first time that the method has been tested in teenagers and adults, too,"" says Dr Duan. ""Hearing was greatly improved in many of the participants, which can have a profound effect on their life quality. We will now be following these patients to see how lasting the effect is.""

The results also show that the treatment was safe and well-tolerated. The most common adverse reaction was a reduction in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. No serious adverse reactions were reported in the follow-up period of 6 to 12 months.

""OTOF is just the beginning,"" says Dr Duan. ""We and other researchers are expanding our work to other, more common genes that cause deafness, such as GJB2 and TMC1. These are more complicated to treat, but animal studies have so far returned promising results. We are confident that patients with different kinds of genetic deafness will one day be able to receive treatment.""

The study was conducted in collaboration with a number of institutions, including Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, China, and was financed by several Chinese research programmes and Otovia Therapeutics Inc., the company that has developed the gene therapy and that employs many of the researchers involved in the study.

...

Novak Djokovic crushed British wildcard Dan Evans in the Wimbledon second round as he stepped up his bid for a record 25th Grand Slam title, while world number one Jannik Sinner cruised into round three on Thursday.

But there was heartbreak for home favourite Jack Draper as he crashed out to former finalist Marin Cilic.

Djokovic avoided becoming one of the host of big names eliminated in week one in south London as the Serb needed just one hour and 47 minutes to dispatch Evans in a 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 victory on Centre Court.

""It means I've been playing quite a long time!"" Djokovic said when told he had just secured his 99th Wimbledon match victory.

""I still enjoy it. This court has given me so much. Wimbledon has a special place in my heart. Any history made here is obviously extra special.""

Djokovic is dreaming of putting an exclamation point on his incredible career by becoming the most successful singles player in tennis history.

The 38-year-old has been tied with Margaret Court on 24 Grand Slam titles since winning his most recent major prize at the 2023 US Open.

Despite losing the last two Wimbledon finals to Carlos Alcaraz, Djokovic believes the lawns of south-west London provide his best chance to win that elusive 25th major.

""I'm aware of the history on the line. I'm thinking about the big things I can do in this tournament,"" he said.

Sinner is yet to reach a Wimbledon final, but the US and Australian Open champion has been ruthless in dropping just 12 games in his opening two matches.

The Italian thrashed Australia's Aleksandar Vukic 6-1, 6-1, 6-3 to set up a third round clash against Spaniard Pedro Martinez.

""We saw there have been so many upsets this tournament so we try to stay focused and raise our level,"" said Sinner.

Draper's dream of following in the footsteps of Andy Murray as a British champion were dashed as 36-year-old Cilic rolled back the years.

The Croatian, who is making his first Wimbledon appearance for four years after major knee surgery, blasted 53 winners in a 6-4, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 victory.

""The emotions I'm feeling are incredible,"" said Cilic, who lost the final to Roger Federer at the All England Club in 2017.

""It's been a long journey but I never lost any doubt. This was a huge challenge, to come back and play at this level against Jack, in front of this crowd.""

- Krejcikova's relief -

Only one of the top five seeds in the women's draw -- world number one Aryna Sabalenka -- is still standing.

But defending champion Barbora Krejcikova and five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek avoided joining the big name casualties with hard-fought three-set wins.

Krejcikova has had a miserable time with injuries this year and arrived at Wimbledon with just six matches under her belt in 2025.

Despite not feeling 100 percent, she overcame American Caroline Dolehide 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 to set up a meeting with Emma Navarro.

""Definitely a huge relief,"" said the Czech. ""I wasn't feeling that well but I was fighting for every ball. I'm really happy I won the third set.""

Swiatek has previously struggled on Wimbledon's lush lawns despite being a former junior champion at the All England Club.

The former world number one dropped the first set to American Caty McNally before roaring back to win 5-7, 6-2, 6-1.

""For sure second and third set I played how I wanted to play,"" said Swiatek.

Elena Rybykina, Wimbledon winner in 2022, demolished Maria Sakkari 6-3, 6-1.

Russian seventh seed Mirra Andreeva, aged 18, beat Italy's Lucia Bronzetti 6-1, 7-6 (7/4).

Jannik Sinner continued his perfect start to his bid for a maiden Wimbledon crown on Thursday, when he raced past Aleksandar Vukic to reach the third round.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings delivered a near-flawless performance, during which he saved all four break points he faced, to prevail 6-1, 6-1, 6-3 in just one hour and 40 minutes. Sinner let slip five match points on serve at 5/3 in the third set, but saved his fourth break point with a stunning forehand pass on the stretch before promptly firing consecutive aces to close the match.

“I enjoyed it because I won the game,” Sinner said with a smile when asked about the final game. “The match can change very quickly. If he breaks me there, it could go a long distance, so I'm very happy to finish. [Playing on] Centre Court is such a special occasion.”

Smooth sailing ⛵️@janniksin eases his way to a 6-1 6-1 6-3 victory over Vukic.@wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/mRPtKty3Q8

Sinner arrived at Wimbledon off the back of a gut-wrenching five-set defeat to rival Carlos Alcaraz in the Roland Garros final and a stunning second-round exit to Alexander Bublik in Halle. Yet the Italian is showing few signs of wear so far in his SW19 campaign, in which he is the only player in the field yet to drop a set.



Sinner, who is into the third round at Wimbledon for a fourth consecutive year, is aiming to win a fourth major title and first since the Australian Open this year. After improving to 3-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Vukic, the 23-year-old will next face Spain's Pedro Martinez. 

""Every opponent is very difficult, third-round matches in Grand Slams are something special,” said Sinner. “As we saw, there have been many upsets this tournament, so we try to stay focused and raise our level. I felt the level was at a good point today, but I can improve a couple of things.”

With his victory against Vukic, Sinner avoided the seeds' exodus at Wimbledon so far this year. In the men's field, there was a record 13 seeded players who fell in the first round, including World No. 3 Alexander Zverev and World No. 7 Lorenzo Musetti. The fourth-seeded Jack Draper then followed suit on Thursday after his defeat to Marin Cilic.

Regardless of his run during the fortnight, Sinner will remain the World No. 1. Yet he is attempting to make pace in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which serves as an indicator as to who will claim the ATP Year End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Two-time defending champion Alcaraz currently holds a 2,240-point lead over Sinner atop the Live Race.

Sinner's best result at Wimbledon came in 2022, when he reached the semi-finals before falling to Novak Djokovic. He is seeded to meet the 38-year-old Serbian at the same stage this year.

George Russell has given an update on his contract situation at Mercedes, with the Briton insisting that he is not speaking to other teams.

George Russell believes that the chances of him not being at Mercedes next season are “exceptionally low”, the Briton stating that he is not speaking to other teams as his loyalties remain with the Silver Arrows – as well as saying of the squad, “I know where their loyalty lies”.

Speculation has mounted for some time over Russell's future at the outfit, with the 27-year-old's current deal running until the end of 2025, while Russell himself has also spoken of Mercedes having “conversations” with Max Verstappen.

Asked ahead of this weekend's British Grand Prix if there is any new contract yet, Russell explained: “No updates since the last time we spoke. Honestly, as I've said for the majority of this season, I'm just focused on the driving.

“It's a huge weekend for us, for me my home race – it's my favourite race of the year, and that's where I want to give all my focus and attention, to try to win this Grand Prix. We were on pole here last year, we were leading the first third of the race.

“Temperatures look slightly more favourable for us this weekend – not as favourable as they were this time 12 months ago, but much more compared to Austria last weekend. We know clearly that's where we struggled, so just excited for that.”

Pushed on whether he would question the team's loyalty more if the contract saga continued to go on, Russell responded: “There's a lot of conversations behind the scenes that are not public. I know where their loyalty lies and it doesn't need to be public, it doesn't need to be broadcasted to everybody.

“We've obviously spoken a little bit more over the past week because there's numerous news articles and whatnot out there, but in all honesty it doesn't really change anything from my side because, as I've said before, I feel I'm performing better than ever and it's as simple as that really. Performance speaks for everything.”

And when then asked if he was speaking to any other teams, Russell firmly answered: “No.”

Following on from his recent comments about Mercedes having “conversations” with Verstappen, the four-time race winner was quizzed on whether it was right for him to also speak to other teams.

“Every team has two seats available, and it's normal that every team is considering what the future holds,” Russell reflected. “I don't take that personally, because I made it clear from the beginning I'm happy to be team mates with anybody.

“Of course there's lots of conversations, lots of rumours and all of these are being pointed towards me, but from my side feel that isn't really going to be the case. I want to continue with Mercedes into the future.

“The fact is Toto [Wolff] has never let me down – he's always given me his word but he's also got to do what's right for his team, which includes me but it also includes thousands of people who work for Mercedes.

“For me it's nothing to worry about because I don't think I'll be going anywhere, and whoever my team mate will be, it doesn't concern me either. I'm just focused on the driving.”

In terms of how confident he is that there is a contingency plan in place should he not be at Mercedes in 2026, Russell said: “Pretty confident, to be honest, because I think what I've proven so far has been plenty enough. Not really much more to say.

“Any teams who did reach out in the past, I said I am loyal to Mercedes – that's where my future lies, and ultimately Mercedes are my managers so it has to be dealt through Mercedes in the first place but there hasn't been a lack of interest, let's say.

“I've been focusing on my side, I am loyal to Mercedes and everything will work itself out. The likelihood I'm not at Mercedes next year I think is exceptionally low.”

And while he suggested that there is no specific deadline in place for when his future needs to be decided, Russell hinted that there may be movement within the near future.

“There's not really any deadline in place, to be honest,” the Mercedes driver said. “Naturally you try and have stuff done before the summer break. From my side, Mercedes manage me as well, so it's not really a deadline in my hands as such.

“I'm not even thinking about it – right now obviously there's a lot of questions about it, but the more we speak about it, the less we speak about it, nothing really changes. It will happen when the time is right. I expect in the next couple of weeks probably something will happen, but we'll need to wait and see.”

Michael Madsen is being remembered by his Hollywood peers. The actor, who collaborated with Quentin Tarantino ever since his directorial debut “Reservoir Dogs,” died at age 67 after suffering from a cardiac arrest. 

Madsen's team confirmed his death to IndieWire, stating that he had been found unresponsive at his Malibu home. Madsen starred in both “Kill Bill” films, “The Hateful Eight,” and “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,” and almost appeared in “Pulp Fiction” as Vincent Vega, the character that was later played by John Travolta. Outside of his work with Tarantino, Madsen acted in “Donnie Brasco,” “The Natural,” “The Doors,” “Thelma & Louise,” “Die Another Day,” “Sin City,” “Boarding Gate,” and “Free Willy,” among many other films. His representatives cited that he had more projects in the works, too.

“Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, who will be missed by many. […] In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films ‘Resurrection Road,' ‘Concessions,' and ‘Cookbook for Southern Housewives,' and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life,” Madsen's managers Susan Ferris and Ron Smith and publicist Liz Rodriguez said in a joint statement obtained by IndieWire. “Michael was also preparing to release a new book called ‘Tears For My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems' [which is] currently being edited.”

Madsen's family, former co-stars, and directors took to social media to remember the late actor. 

“My brother Michael has left the stage,” his sister, actress Virginia Madsen, wrote in a statement to Variety. “He was thunder and velvet. Mischief wrapped in tenderness. A poet disguised as an outlaw. A father, a son, a brother — etched in contradiction, tempered by love that left its mark.” 

She continued, “We're not mourning a public figure. We're not mourning a myth — but flesh and blood and ferocious heart. Who stormed through life loud, brilliant, and half on fire. Who leaves us echoes — gruff, brilliant, unrepeatable — half legend, half lullaby. I'll miss our inside jokes, the sudden laughter, the sound of him. I'll miss the boy he was before the legend; I miss my big brother. Thank you to everyone reaching out with love and memory. In time, we'll share how we plan to celebrate his life — but for now, we stay close, and let the silence say what words can't.”

The duo worked together in director Michael Mongillo's 2007 mockumentary “Being Michael Madsen,” starring as comedic versions of themselves. 

Madsen's fellow “Kill Bill” actor Vivica A. Fox told The Post that he was a “talented” co-star. “I had the pleasure of working with Michael Madsen on ‘Kill Bill' & several other films!” Fox said. “Michael was a talented man with an AMAZING on screen presence! My deepest condolences & prayers to his family.”

 










Harvey Keitel, who worked with Madsen on “Reservoir Dogs,” told The Post, “We've lost another great American poet. Farewell, my dear friend. I'll never forget one of the best scenes I've ever seen on film — of you and Chris Penn fighting in ‘Reservoir Dogs.' A great love scene. Give Chris a hug for me.” (Chris Penn died in 2006 at age 40.) 

James Woods wrote to remember Madsen, “Oh man, this is a hard one. Michael and I did ‘The Getaway' together. We did ‘Straight Talk' together. I was always touched by his sweet nature and generosity, the absolute opposite of the ‘tough guys' he portrayed so brilliantly. Rest in Peace, dear friend.”

Rob Schneider also wrote, “Michael Madsen was a dream to work with.A truly gifted actor & gentleman who made every person on the set comfortable; generous with his stories & with his infectious laughter.I only wish we could have done more things together in this crazy business. My love to his kids & friends.”

	Republicans are clapping each other on the back after passing one of the most destructive pieces of legislation to ever target the American poor and middle class. Donald Trump and the GOP's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” belly-flopped through Congress not because it makes sense economically, environmentally, or morally — but because the president asked for a bill to sign, and his cronies delivered. 


	In a 218-214 vote, the massive legislative package — passed using budget reconciliation — made it through the House of Representatives on Thursday, two days after the Senate passed it on Tuesday. It will now head to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it into law in a ceremony on the Fourth of July. What a great night it was,” Trump wrote on Thursday as Republicans closed in on passing the legislation. “One of the most consequential Bills ever. The USA is the ‘HOTTEST' Country in the World, by far!!!”


	Trump's push to have the bill on his desk by the Fourth of July holiday threw members of the House into a mad scramble to make it back to the Capitol in time for voting this week. Some lawmakers packed up their cars and made lengthy road trips to Washington, D.C., as major airports in the area canceled or delayed hundreds of flights in response to intense summer storms. But in the Trump era, the optics of an Independence Day passage is paramount.

	“The president of the United States is waiting with his pen,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said to Republican cheers before the vote. “The American people are waiting for this relief. We've heard enough talk; it's time for action. Let's finish the job for him.”

	The bill's passage on Thursday was preceded by spirited debate on the House floor, including a marathon speech by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). Jeffries informed Republicans he would be taking his “sweet time” in addressing concerns about the bill. “People will die. Tens of thousands, perhaps year after year after year, as a result of the Republican assault on the health care of the American people,” he said. “I'm sad. I never thought I would be on the House floor saying: This is a crime scene.”

	Republicans tried to justify the cuts with lies about how they would only impact Americans too lazy to get a job. “Able-bodied people, 35-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they're going to now have to go get a job,” Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) said as Republicans laughed behind him. “That's a good thing for them because their mom doesn't want them sitting in the basement playing video games anyway.”


	The mythical 35-year-old couch potato leeching money out of welfare programs that could be benefiting other more deserving people has been the central strawman of the GOP's justification for the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid, the nation's government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans.


	The legislation imposes sweeping bureaucratic hurdles to Medicaid coverage, demanding all supposedly able-bodied adults under the age of 65 either volunteer or work 20 hours a week in low-wage jobs to maintain their insurance. The Medicaid provisions are expected to force over 10 million Americans off the program, and that is the point. Combined with the GOP's changes to health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act — and their refusal to extend subsidies for such plans — around 17 million Americans are expected to lose their health care coverage, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Rural hospitals that depend on Medicaid patients and federal funding for these patients may be forced to close programs or outright shut down as a result.


	The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” is deeply unpopular with the public, not surprisingly, and has prompted protests and disruptions at the Capitol, town halls, and other events hosted by Republican lawmakers. The sprawling package grants a permanent extension to Trump's wealth-favoring 2017 tax cuts, and numerous windfalls to other GOP pet projects. The extension of the tax cuts is expected to increase the national debt by over $4 trillion, a bump that Republicans have only partially offset by savaging Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), renewable energy investments, and other programs supporting working Americans.

	In addition to cutting over $1 trillion from Medicaid, the bill is expected to force at least 2 million monthly SNAP recipients off food assistance, a loss that is expected to impact one million children every month. Meanwhile, the price of utilities will increase as the GOP cuts green energy tax credits, in a move that could also cause Republican communities that benefited from Biden-era development incentives to bleed jobs and investments. 


	In response to frustration from the public — and even from within the Republican caucus — members of the Trump administration have oscillated between insisting that the bill's passage will usher in an age of prosperity, and admitting that they don't actually care if poor people get screwed over — as long as their own priorities are met. 


	Vice President J.D. Vance, who cast the tiebreaking vote to advance the legislation through the Senate, wrote on Tuesday that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” must pass because it increases funding for deportations, and seeks to strip undocumented migrants of any meager benefits they may receive. He wrote that everything else in the bill — including “the minutiae of the Medicaid policy — is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions”. 


	On Wednesday, Trump argued on Truth Social that people complaining about his administration taking a blowtorch to the social safety net were focused on the wrong things. “Nobody wants to talk about GROWTH, which will be the primary reason that the Big, Beautiful Bill will be one of the most successful pieces of legislation ever passed,” he wrote. 


	The president claimed that “hundreds of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs are filling up the coffers of Treasury.” Estimates place the actual number at less than $100 billion in the first six months of the year — a drop in the bucket compared to the $2.4 trillion generated by federal income taxes in 2024.

	“Our Country will make a fortune this year, more than any of our competitors, but only if the Big, Beautiful Bill is PASSED! As they say, Trump's been right about everything, and this is the easiest of them all to predict. Republicans, don't let the Radical Left Democrats push you around,” Trump added.


	Republicans did what Trump wanted, and practically tripped over themselves to appease him — shoving low-income and working-class Americans into even more dire economic conditions than they're already in as the president continues to remake the nation around the interests of the rich.
