                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, right, welcomes Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz at EU headquarters in Brussels, Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Tuesday that the Trump administration's new national security strategy underscores the need for Europe to become “much more independent” from the United States in terms of security policy. Merz also pushed back against the notion that European democracy needs saving. The U.S. strategy, published Friday, paints European allies as weak, while offering tacit support to far-right political parties, and was critical of European free speech and migration policy. On Monday, European Council President António Costa warned the U.S. against interfering in Europe's affairs and said only European citizens can decide which parties should govern them. “If it needed to be saved, we would manage that alone.” This is not a surprise, but it has now been confirmed again. Merz said that Vance's speech earlier this year had “set off something in me as well, and you can see that today in our defense spending.” Merz's government, in office since May, has enabled higher spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt — adding to an effort to bolster Germany's military that has been underway since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started in 2022. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, NATO members, including Germany, agreed in June to a massive hike in the alliance's defense spending target. “In my talks with the Americans, I say: ‘America first is fine,' but ‘America alone' can't be in your interest. You need partners in the world too,” Merz said Tuesday. And if you can't do anything with Europe, then at least make Germany your partner.”</p>

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. The Heritage Foundation's EJ Antoni joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how President Donald Trump can tackle affordability as he takes his economic message to residents in Pennsylvania. President Donald Trump declared the U.S. economy is strong and holds an "A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus" grade under his leadership despite inheriting a "mess" from the Biden administration. Prices were at an all-time high when I came in. When energy comes down, everything... 'cause it's so much bigger than any other subject. But energy has come down incredibly. The Trump White House is facing a crisis over its economic messaging after Democrats swept a series of elections in November while campaigning on platforms focused on "affordability," lowering the current cost-of-living prices skyrocketing from grocery store shelves to rent, while touting a vote for Democrats was a vote against Trump and his policies. The Democratic election wins earlier in 2025 — which included the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and the mayoral race in New York City — are viewed as a bellwether ahead of the 2026 midterms, lighting a spark among Republicans to fine-tune their messaging on the economy. President Trump and his administration have increasingly pinned blame for the economic anxiety among Americans on Biden administration policies. The White House and Trump increasingly have amplified blame for the current affordability woes on former President Joe Biden's leadership as voters' financial anxiety grows at peak holiday shopping season. "Putting an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump," White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital Monday morning when asked about the White House's message on affordability. "Every Trump administration official has been playing their part over the past year to deliver on this priority, from slashing costly regulations to securing historic drug pricing deals — efforts that have cooled inflation and raised real wages," he continued. "Much work remains, but President Trump is highlighting the meaningful progress that his Administration has made and will continue to make to turn Joe Biden's economic disaster around." The survey found that voters overwhelmingly blamed Trump over Biden. About twice as many voters polled reported that Trump, rather than Biden, is responsible for the current economy, with three times as many voters reporting that Trump's economic policies have hurt them, which is on par with their feelings during Biden's final year in office. Andrew Bates, who served as the Biden White House's deputy press secretary, pointed to the voter survey when asked for response to the Trump administration's heightened comments, pinning blame for economic concerns on policies held over from the Biden White House. "Democrats and the Biden-Harris Administration warned Trump against making the biggest health care cuts in history so billionaires could get tax breaks; just like they warned against the tariffs that are a record-level tax hike on working people," Bates said in an emailed comment to Fox News Digital. "Maybe Donald Trump can't remember prices were lower last year. That's what I wondered when he started building himself an assisted living ballroom." President Donald Trump holds a chart on household income in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Aug. 7, 2025. "Turning this crisis around has been a Day One priority for the Trump administration, which has already delivered cooled inflation, multi-year low gas prices, trillions in investments, and historic drug pricing deals to dramatically cut costs for American patients," White House spokesman Desai said. "Biden flacks who insisted Biden was in absolute peak health and wasn't dropping out of the 2024 presidential race just days before Biden did just that need to get a grip on reality." Trump continued in his Politico interview that he grades the current economy as "A-plus." "I do want to talk about the economy, sir, here at home. Trump hammered again in the interview that Democrats created the current affordability woes while stressing that they are the party that would bring prices down. "You talk about affordability, the Democrats love to say affordability, afford... but then they never talk about it," he said. I'm the one that's bringing them down." President Joe Biden's economic policies during his Oval Office tenure are coming under fire from the Trump administration as financial anxiety persists. Trump is set to travel to Pennsylvania Tuesday, a key battleground state that helped deliver him his 2024 victory, to promote his administration's economic policies and growth amid voters reporting financial anxiety. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed Trump's speech during an appearance on "Fox & Friends" Tuesday, which included taking shots at the Biden administration's economic record. "And President Trump is going to give a positive, economic focused speech where he talks about all that he and his team has done to provide bigger paychecks and lower prices for the American people." She added: "And don't forget, a year ago, President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in modern American history from the Biden administration. And I have watched every single day as President Trump and his tremendous economic team have been working to fix it. And they have, through a very simple economic formula, which President Trump will talk about tonight."

Day 9 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar

Day 9 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar: A Cosmic Cat's Paw. Emission nebula NGC 6334, otherwise known as the Cat's Paw Nebula, lies about 4,000 light-years away. Instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope recently took a detailed look at one of its “toe beans,” a star-forming region where the energy from bright young stars is blasting away dense nearby clouds of gas and dust.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I think they're weak, but I also think that they want to be so politically correct,” the president told Politico in an interview. Europe is not doing a good job in many ways. In it, the 33-page guiding document for the president's “America First” foreign policy agenda argued that Europe faces “civilizational erasure” due to mass migration, which he warned could prevent traditional U.S. allies from maintaining those statuses. “And if it keeps going the way it's going, Europe will not be … in my opinion, uh, many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer,” Trump said. This is one of the great places in the world, and they're allowing people just to come in and … unchecked, unvetted.” The president praised Hungary and Poland, saying the countries have “done a good job” regarding immigration, but added that “most” European nations are “decaying.” The administration has been putting pressure on European countries to change their domestic immigration policies, including issuing guidance for U.S. embassies in Europe to report “violent crimes and human rights abuses perpetrated by migrant populations.” Trump said in the interview that he would be open to endorsing candidates for elections in Europe, as he has in the past with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Argentine President Javier Milei. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the Trump administration's National Security Strategy “confirms my assessment that we in Europe, and so also in Germany, must become much more independent from the U.S. in terms of security policy.” Merz noted that the administration's viewpoint “is not a surprise, but it has now been confirmed again. Under pressure from the Trump administration, the NATO alliance agreed to increase the minimum defense spending threshold from 2% of a member's gross domestic product to 5%, although it is a long-term goal that most countries will not reach for years. Last month, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matt Whitaker, said he looked forward to the day Germany would take over the Supreme Allied Commander Europe position, though he caveated it with, “We're a long way from that.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE — Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, speaks during a news conference to announce charges against Ghislaine Maxwell for her alleged role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein, July 2, 2020, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday granted the Justice Department's request to publicly release grand jury transcripts and other material from Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case, citing a new law that requires the government to open its files on Jeffrey Epstein and his longtime confidant, but he cautioned that people shouldn't expect to learn much new information from them. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer, who along with other judges had previously rejected Justice Department unsealing requests before the transparency law was passed, said the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.” Engelmayer, in Manhattan, ruled Tuesday after the Justice Department had asked judges in the wake of the law's passage last month to lift secrecy orders in Maxwell's and Epstein's cases that had kept some records under wraps. A request to unseal records from Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case is pending. Engelmayer is the second judge to act after the Epstein Files Transparency Act created a narrow exception to rules that normally keep grand jury proceedings secret. Last week, a Florida federal judge ordered the release of transcripts from an abandoned Epstein federal grand jury investigation in the 2000s. AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports investigative materials, possibly in the hundreds or thousands, will soon be released in the sex trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell. The Republican campaigned for reelection last year on a promise to release the files, and his administration did disclose some records earlier this year — almost all of them already public — but suddenly stopped in July after promising a “truckload” more. Forced to act by the new transparency law, the Justice Department says it plans to release 18 categories of investigative materials gathered in the massive sex trafficking probe, including search warrants, financial records, notes from interviews with victims, and data from electronic devices. Epstein, a millionaire financier, was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself in jail a month later. Maxwell, a British socialite, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021. The Justice Department said it was conferring with victims and their lawyers and planned to redact or black out portions of records to protect victims' identities and prevent dissemination of sexualized images. Engelmayer said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton must personally certify that records have been “rigorously reviewed” to avoid an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. The release “would create undue prejudice so severe that it would foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial,” Maxwell lawyer David Markus wrote. The Supreme Court in October declined to hear Maxwell's appeal. Annie Farmer, a vocal Epstein and Maxwell accuser, fought for the transparency act's passage and supports the release of court records. She said through her lawyer, Sigrid S. McCawley, that she “is wary of the possibility that any denial of the motions may be used by others as a pretext or excuse for continuing to withhold crucial information concerning Epstein's crimes.” Last year, a Florida judge ordered the release of about 150 pages of transcripts from a state grand jury that investigated Epstein in 2006. On Dec. 5, at the Justice Department's request, a Florida judge ordered the unsealing of transcripts from a federal grand jury there that also investigated Epstein. That investigation ended in 2008 with a then-secret arrangement that allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges by pleading guilty to a state prostitution charge.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior foreign policy correspondent and anchor Gillian Turner reports on efforts to advance a Ukraine-Russia peace deal on ‘Special Report.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his country is ready to propose details for a new peace deal with Russia to the U.S. on Tuesday. Zelenskyy made the announcement on social media, saying Ukrainian and European negotiators had come to a more solid agreement on a proposal. Ukraine had previously ruled out any peace proposal that involved ceding land to Russia. "We are working very actively on all components of potential steps toward ending the war. The Ukrainian and European components are now more developed, and we are ready to present them to our partners in the U.S. Together with the American side, we expect to swiftly make the potential steps as doable as possible," Zelenskyy wrote. "We are committed to a real peace and remain in constant contact with the United States. And, as our partners in the negotiating teams rightly note, everything depends on whether Russia is ready to take effective steps to stop the bloodshed and prevent the war from reigniting. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine is ready with new peace proposals for the U.S. (Francesco Fotia/Reuters) President Donald Trump had expressed frustration with Zelenskyy earlier this week, arguing he had been sluggish in responding to a proposal from the Russian side this weekend. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner for five hours last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin had an extensive meeting with U.S. officials last week. After the meeting, Putin traveled to India for a state visit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and gave an interview to the India Today news channel, where he said the negotiations with the Americans were long but productive. President Donald Trump told reporters Sunday, Dec. 7, 2025, at the Kennedy Center that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has yet to read the updated peace plan. The Russian leader stuck to his maximalist demands in the interview, arguing his war will only end when his country takes Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Ukrainian troops withdraw.

Fox News senior foreign policy correspondent and anchor Gillian Turner reports on efforts to advance a Ukraine-Russia peace deal on ‘Special Report.' German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are in talks with a reluctant Belgium over what to do with billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in the country. According to the Belgian government, at least €197 billion (approximately $224 billion) of sanctioned Russian assets are held in Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial institution. The European Commission wants to seize these assets and transfer them to Ukraine as part of a €165 billion financial package for Ukraine (approximately $190) to help pay its bills and fund the war effort. Prime Minister Bart De Wever is concerned that taking Russia's assets could be interpreted as an act of war by Russia and provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin to retaliate against Belgium. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of the country's Security Council, even threatened Brussels and its European allies in an inflammatory post on X. Belgium's Prime Minister Bart de Wever arrives for a meeting with European Commission President at the EU headquarters in Brussels on Nov. 14, 2025. "If the crazy EU does steal frozen Russian assets for a "reparations loan," we may view it as a casus belli with all the relevant implications for Brussels & Co.," the former Russian president said. EU leaders are up against a tight clock, as Ukraine is projected to run out of funds for the war in April and EU leaders will convene on Dec.18 to make a final decision on how to support Ukraine's budgetary needs for the next two years. We agreed to continue our discussions with the aim of reaching a consensus at the European Council meeting on December 18," von der Leyen posted on X after meeting with Merz and De Wever. Merz said after the meeting that Belgium's concerns were legitimate and must be heard. "What we decide now will determine Europe's future: Belgium's particular vulnerability in the issue of utilizing the frozen Russian assets is indisputable and must be addressed in such a way that all European states bear the same risk," Merz said on X. France's President Emmanuel Macron (L), Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer pose as they meet on the sidelines of the two-day NATO's Heads of State and Government summit in The Hague on June 24, 2025. Robert Kremzner, an associate analyst with the New Lines Institute and an expert in Russian gray zone warfare, said Russia has a number of ways it can target Belgium that fall below the threshold of open hostilities. "Russia has been very active in using something called gray zone warfare, which sees Russia undertaking hostile actions against other nations that are below the threshold of war, and thus not that easy to respond to," Kremzner told Fox News Digital. He said some examples include information warfare, cyberattacks, election interference, GPS spoofing, cutting undersea cables, and increasingly arson attacks and assassinations. The Belgian government, along with Euroclear, are looking for financial guarantees from fellow EU member states before committing to supporting the plan. De Wever fears that Belgium will ultimately be held responsible and be forced to pay back the assets that are seized in the event a sanctions deal is negotiated with Russia as a way to end the war in Ukraine. The European Commission said it put in place safeguards to protect Member States and financial institutions from possible retaliatory measures from Russia. If Belgium remains recalcitrant, von der Leyen could resort to the EU's Article 122 emergency powers, which would allow the commission to move forward with the proposal on a majority-rule basis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge in New York on Tuesday granted the Justice Department's request to unseal records from the investigation and criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. The ruling from Judge Paul Engelmayer opens the door for the department to publicly release evidence it had gathered against Maxwell, an associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The trove of documents, which will be redacted to protect victims' identities and other identifiable information, includes grand jury transcripts, financial records, travel documents, and notes from victim interviews obtained during the investigations. Some of the evidence in the case came out during Maxwell's trial and Congress has released a trove of records in recent weeks. “Contrary to DOJ's depiction, the grand jury materials would not reveal new information of any consequence,” Engelmayer wrote. Engelmayer is the second judge to order investigative files be made public since the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law last month. The Justice Department has also filed a request to unseal records to a third judge who oversaw Epstein's short-lived prosecution in New York. That judge has not yet issued a ruling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event. The trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump. The president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded. “We're bringing prices way down,” Trump said at the White House on Monday. As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing. It's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections. Trump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation's closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race. “We're actually going to turn that on its head,” Wiles said, “and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.” Asked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” Trump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing. Since the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Months into a pressure campaign that has seen the US military move thousands of troops and a carrier strike group into the Caribbean and President Donald Trump issue repeated threats against Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, the Trump administration is working on day-after plans in the event Maduro is ousted from power, according to two senior administration officials and another source familiar with the discussions. They include multiple options for what US action could look like to fill the power vacuum and stabilize the country if Maduro voluntarily leaves as part of a negotiated departure or is forced into leaving after US strikes on targets inside Venezuela or other direct action, the sources said. CNN has reported that Trump has not made a decision as to how he will resolve the standoff, and there are multiple factions within the administration with sharply contrasting views on potential military or covert action to remove Maduro. While Trump has repeatedly threatened an escalation, including land strikes, two senior administration officials said there was no appetite for ramped up US engagement in the country. Trump spoke by phone with Maduro late last month, just days before the US designation of Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization went into effect. A senior White House official said that while the call was not necessarily contentious, the president did give something of an ultimatum to the dictator, telling him that it was in Maduro's best interest to leave the country and that Trump intended to keep “blowing up” boats. In an interview with Politico published on Tuesday, Trump said he didn't want to say how far he'd go to oust Maduro but added that “his days are numbered.” Trump has refused to rule out directly participating in regime change, and the planning by those at the White House preserves his options. “It's the job of the federal government to always prepare for plans A, B and C,” said a senior administration official, noting that the president would not be making the threats he's making if he did not have a team ready with a series of options for any potential outcome. The Venezuelan opposition led by María Corina Machado and Edmundo González has been working on day-after plans for years and has shared elements of those plans publicly. Their efforts would address security, economy, energy, infrastructure and education, among other focuses, opposition leader David Smolansky told CNN. The opposition has been formulating “100 hour” and “100 day” plans for next steps if Maduro is ousted, and those plans have been shared with different parts of the Trump administration, a source familiar said. Machado has publicly praised Trump and said that Venezuela would work closely with the US. But now the day-after planning is more intense, having to account for a number of different situations wherein Maduro could leave leadership. It is not clear that the administration has decided how they might move to oust Maduro, complicating the already fraught task of developing detailed day-after plans. The US would have to determine how much and what kind of support it would give the country to prevent it from descending into conflict and chaos, and how it would push to influence the country's governance if Maduro leaves after leading the country for more than a decade. While putting US troops on the ground is unlikely even while Trump has not ruled it out, there would need to be plans for economic, security and intelligence support, experts said. Multiple administration officials said Trump is not interested in a long, drawn-out negotiation with Maduro. Maduro will be given a shorter leash for negotiations than Trump has given to other world leaders, one of the officials said. The officials also do not consider a negotiated departure for Maduro to be likely given past failures. “The problem is Maduro has made five deals with different parties over the last 10 years and has broken every single one of them,” Rubio told Fox last week, adding that Maduro's track record doesn't mean that Trump shouldn't try to strike a deal. In October, Trump said that he had authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying it would have authority to remove Maduro. Cancian also pointed out that having those plans could make it harder for Trump to step back from any regime change efforts. “When and how do you restore recognition of the Venezuelan government? If it is Maria Carina Machado and Edmundo Gonzalez who take over immediately its very clear, they would be considered a legitimately elected president so the US would restore recognition from day one,” said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist who has studied Venezuela. Recognition will determine the lifting of sanctions and access to economic support which will be critical to stabilizing the country,” he said, referencing the political movement of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. While the administration remains in touch with the Venezuelan opposition there are not regular meetings at a high level with officials such as Rubio, multiple sources said. “We are aligned with the US about having a freer and safer hemisphere reducing the influence of Cuba, Iran, Russia, and China in the hemisphere where Venezuela is the hub for those external actors,” said Smolansky, a senior security and foreign affairs adviser to Gonzalez and Machado.</p>

It's tempting to wonder what Baudrillard would have made of the current US military buildup targeting Venezuela, a campaign that often appears to be driven by narratives with only a tangential relationship to actual events taking place. Take, for instance, President Donald Trump's dramatic announcement on his Truth Social platform a little over a week ago: “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.” As Reuters reported, US officials “were surprised by Trump's announcement and unaware of any ongoing U.S. military operations to enforce a closure of Venezuelan airspace.” The US not only took no actions to affect the “closure” of Venezuelan airspace; a migrant repatriation flight from the US landed in Venezuela just a few days later. Lawmakers have defended the deadly US strike in September, saying it “probably saved thousands of American lives.” This echoes Trump himself, who has claimed that “Every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives.” Trump has explicitly said on several instances that the boats were carrying “mostly fentanyl.” But these boats are almost certainly not carrying fentanyl, which is almost entirely shipped into the US overland from Mexico, often by US citizens — not on speedboats from South America. Assuming these boats really are carrying drugs, which has been disputed in some cases, it's almost certainly cocaine, which is hundreds of times less deadly. Cocaine also causes thousands of overdose deaths in the US every year, though most of what's moving on these boats is likely headed for Europe. This shouldn't come as much surprise to Americans, including Trump supporters, given that the administration spent much of its early months blaming China, Mexico, and (less credibly) Canada for the fentanyl crisis. The idea that it's the key to solving America's drug crisis (fentanyl, cocaine, or any other drug) doesn't make much sense. If the case for military force is based on confusing and contradictory premises, that would make sense, given that it's not always clear what the actual target is either. Adding to the sense of a virtual buildup is the administration's decision to designate Venezuela's “Cartel de los Soles” as a foreign terrorist organization, naming Maduro itself as its leader. It's a term used by Venezuelans to refer to the cadre of senior military officials involved in a range of criminal activities. But the designation appears to be part of an effort to build a political case for military action, though it actually conveys no such legal authority. Trump is not the only one contributing to a sense of unreality. But there's been far less effort to produce evidence for the Trump administration's narrative around Venezuela than there was to sell evidence that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. The other key difference is that even if the US ultimately does launch strikes inside Venezuela, or even seeks to oust Maduro, there's little chance of a protracted Iraq-style ground invasion. There's still a strong possibility that the US will launch some demonstrative airstrikes against drug labs or rebel camps in Venezuela and then move on to the next issue. It feels less like Iraq war redux than the sort of thing an AI model trained on histories of the Iraq war era might produce. The lives of the nearly 90 people killed so far in US boat strikes are real, as are the Venezuelan civilians and US service members who would be put at risk if strikes on land begin, as are the thousands of Americans killed by drug overdoses every year and those living under Maduro's crumbling dictatorship. But in contrast to other recent military actions, there's a sense of unreality about this buildup. Seniors' rising political influence is a threat to economic growth. You can now place bets on elections, wars, and deportations.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Seniors' rising political influence is a threat to economic growth. Within a decade, America's seniors will outnumber its children for the first time in history, according to Census Bureau projections. By 2060, those over 65 are expected to comprise about one quarter of the population. But its political implications are liable to be especially profound — and immediate: Seniors already accounted for 29 percent of the US electorate in 2024. Older voters have always exerted disproportionate political influence, due to their exceptionally high turnout rates. Historically, however, seniors' power was limited by their small share of the population. This could be a problem for America's rising generations. By international standards, our welfare state offers meager support to families with children, even as it provides robust benefits for retirees. And the latter programs are likely to consume an ever-larger share of the federal budget in the coming decades, a shift that could burden younger Americans with higher tax rates or borrowing costs, while crowding out new spending on their needs. Our nation's housing policies, meanwhile, privilege (disproportionately older) homeowners over renters. This drift towards gerontocracy — government of, by, and for the old — doesn't just undermine the interests of millennials or zoomers. It also threatens the prosperity of America as a whole. In states across the country, governments have recently shifted tax burdens away from older generations and toward younger ones. In some cases, this elder bias is explicit and intentional. Since 2022, Texas, Colorado, Iowa, and Pennsylvania have all slashed property taxes specifically for homeowners 65 or older. At the same time, a slew of states have begun exempting retirement income from taxation. Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and West Virginia ended taxes on Social Security benefits, while Iowa abolished the taxation of all forms of retirement income — from 401(k) withdrawals to pension benefits — for residents over 55. The principal function of these measures is not to rescue cash-strapped seniors from poverty. Federal rules already shield indigent retirees from income taxes. Research into the distributional implications of other states' exemptions has yielded similar findings. There has also been a broader turn against property taxes on all existing homeowners — a shift that tends to benefit affluent seniors at younger families' expense. The present rebellion against property taxation has been remarkably widespread. Texas has enacted especially steep cuts, reducing property taxes by $18 billion in 2023. But less sweeping reductions have passed in Georgia, North Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Idaho, among other places. And more ambitious reforms may be in the offing: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has floated a plan to eliminate all property taxes in his state. Nevertheless, policymakers' focus on this dimension of the cost-of-living crisis likely reflected seniors' disproportionate political influence. Although plenty of millennial homeowners have benefited from property tax cuts, younger Americans as a whole stand to gain less — and lose more — from such measures than older ones do. This wouldn't be much of a problem for younger generations, if property tax cuts did not need to be paid for. In the long run, maintaining lower levies on property typically requires states to either charge higher sales and income taxes or pare back government services. In either case, younger Americans will disproportionately bear the burdens. Working-age people pay more in income taxes than retirees, and they're also more likely to have young children, whose school systems rely on property tax revenue. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of US school districts in session only four days a week jumped from 650 to nearly 900. Meanwhile, some recent property tax cuts massively favor longtime homeowners over first-time buyers. Over time, these policies can have radically inequitable consequences. This is well-illustrated by Florida's longstanding cap on assessment growth. In the Sunshine State, a home's taxable value cannot rise by more than 3 percent annually, no matter how much its market price has changed, so long as its current homeowner maintains possession. Since much of Florida's real estate has appreciated at a far faster pace, this policy has opened up a massive gap between how much longtime homeowners and new buyers must pay in taxes for the same properties. According to a report from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a young family purchasing a Miami townhouse in 2024 would owe three times as much in property taxes as an older neighbor who'd been occupying an identical unit since 2006. As already noted, America's welfare state has long given short shrift to young families. In 2021, the United States spent just 0.6 percent of its GDP on benefits for children and their parents — far below the OECD average of 2.3 percent. That same year, America spent 7.2 percent of GDP on public pensions, placing it only a bit behind the OECD average of 8.5 percent. The federal budget's age bias would have deepened over the past four years, even if legislators hadn't changed a single policy. But Congress accelerated this trend by expanding social benefits for the old, while cutting spending on programs that primarily benefit working-age Americans. By contrast, Biden oversaw a permanent expansion in elder benefits. At the end of 2024, Congress passed a bill effectively increasing Social Security payments to public-sector workers, at an annual cost of nearly $20 billion. This law addressed a nuance in the pre-existing entitlement system: Many public sector workers are not subject to Social Security taxes, as they pay into their own separate pension plans instead. For this reason, they traditionally did not receive full Social Security benefits in addition to their public pensions, even if they worked briefly in the private sector before retirement. The 2024 law changed this, enabling public-sector workers to collect both their pensions and full Social Security benefits. In their view, a worker who did not pay into Social Security with every paycheck should not receive the same benefits as one who did. Nevertheless, in a striking testament to older voters' political clout, congressional Republicans supported the law. Which is to say: The GOP increased welfare benefits for an overwhelmingly Democratic constituency (public sector workers are left-leaning), in a manner that struck many technocratic experts as excessively generous. It is hard to imagine conservatives getting on board with such a proposal, were its beneficiaries younger than 65. Yet Trump's GOP has largely embraced social spending that is explicitly earmarked for seniors. Under Donald Trump, Republicans have forsworn cuts to Social Security and Medicare — and created new tax benefits for the old — even as they've made large spending cuts to programs that primarily benefit Americans under 65. To be sure, the GOP did finance its regressive tax cuts this year with large reductions in Medicaid spending, which will adversely impact many older Americans. And Trump concentrated his cuts on prime-age Americans, many of whom will lose coverage due to Medicaid's new work requirements, which do not apply to seniors. And his food stamp cuts will make it harder for the impoverished to feed themselves. Yet it is also true that the past four years of policymaking have left America with a welfare state even more heavily weighted towards seniors than it had been before. Americans of all ages, therefore, have an interest in their government maintaining robust Medicare and Social Security benefits. If the United States raised taxes on the rich and middle-class, forced down our medical providers' exorbitant payment rates, and enacted growth-enhancing economic reforms, then we could plausibly sustain generous entitlement benefits while creating a child allowance for young parents, expanding unemployment benefits for the jobless, and guaranteeing healthcare coverage for all. After all, seniors are relatively insulated from its inequities and inefficiencies. And across countries, older voters tend to prioritize their narrow material interests over both spending on children and economic growth, while also opposing liberal immigration policies. Partly for these reasons, democracies older than the US — such as Italy and Japan — have suffered from tepid growth and wildly age-biased public spending. America isn't necessarily doomed to continue on its present trajectory. Although seniors' share of the electorate is steadily growing, the vast majority of voters will remain under 65 for decades to come. Older Americans owe their influence not merely to sheer numbers, but also to their higher rates of political engagement and organization. Composed largely of young renters, YIMBY organizations across the country have agitated against zoning policies that privilege homeowners over tenants. YIMBYs' fundamental aim — to make housing abundant and affordable —would benefit renters of all ages and make America as a whole more prosperous. Thus, absent YIMBYs' mobilization, America was likely to adopt more restrictive housing policies as it grew older. Instead, municipalities across the country have made it easier to build homes in recent years. If younger voters stand up for their broader material interests in a similar fashion, America's political economy just might age gracefully. You can now place bets on elections, wars, and deportations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wahidi helps run Afghan Hope Community Development, a volunteer-led nonprofit that assists Afghan refugees and families in the Sacramento, California, area. One family called him asking whether they should still plan to attend their citizenship test in early December. Others, already scheduled for naturalization interviews this month, worry showing up could expose them to scrutiny or arrest. “People worry any action might cause separation of children or spouse,” Wahidi said. From recent arrivals still waiting for work permits or green cards to longtime residents trying to reunite with spouses and children still in Afghanistan or in the region, he says many are now “giving up” on the idea of a stable future in the United States. First, an internal memo dated November 21 showed the Trump administration planned to reinterview and rereview refugees admitted under President Joe Biden. The memo, which CNN reported November 24, instructed officers to reassess whether refugees met criteria at the time of admission; allowed for termination of refugee status with no right to appeal; and ordered a hold on pending green card applications for refugees until further notice. A year after refugees are admitted to the country, they are required under US law to apply for permanent status. Refugee advocates called the move “unspeakably cruel,” warning that threatening to revoke protections could re-traumatize people who had already undergone years of intensive US security vetting. Then came the attack near the White House on November 26 in which two West Virginia National Guard members were ambushed and shot, one fatally. Within hours, after authorities identified the suspect as an immigrant from Afghanistan, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it would stop processing all Afghan-related immigration cases “indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.” Days later, Trump said the pause in asylum request processing could be in effect for “a long time.” “We don't want those people,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. “You know why we don't want them? Because many of them are no good and they shouldn't be in our country.” Altogether, more than 190,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US since 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome and its successor, Enduring Welcome, according to the State Department. Another 260,000 Afghans remain abroad waiting for US entry, often in precarious conditions, according to Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, an organization that relocates and resettles Afghan people. Many of them are in Afghanistan and face persecution by the Taliban, he told CNN. Wahidi said he noticed immediate changes on the ground in California when he tried to get in touch with Citizenship and Immigration offices. “No one was answering the phone, no one was responding (to) emails, so then we knew that something happened,” Wahidi said. Most of his clients are waiting for work permits, green cards or asylum decisions﻿. Clients scheduled for citizenship interviews in early December have flooded his office with questions: Should they still go? “I told them we don't have any update,” Wahidi said. On December 1, Wahidi said, he received an alert from the nonprofit NorCal Resist warning of what it described as “an increase in ICE arrests of Afghan neighbors,” claiming multiple Afghans had been detained at the Sacramento Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office and many others had been called to report immediately. Inside Wahidi's office, he says, the toll is visible. “When they come to our office, we can see it in their faces,” he said. Many of the families he hears from are split across continents: a husband in California, a wife and young child in Afghanistan, relatives waiting in Qatar for final visa steps that have now paused indefinitely. But he sharply criticized political leaders and media figures who he said have seized on the attack to generalize about Afghans. “Anybody who is able to commit such an abhorrent, horrific and heinous act is committing an act that's beyond the pale of humanity,” he added. “That is the baseline from which our response should start.” Azam urged Americans to remember the tens of thousands of Afghan Americans who serve “across our armed forces and in harm's way,” including some currently serving in the National Guard units now shaken by the shooting – even as their communities face heightened scrutiny. “Those who would twist this moment to attack Afghan families aren't seeking safety or justice – they're exploiting division and endangering all of us,” the statement read. Thousands of Afghan soldiers, police officers, interpreters, staff, and civilians sacrificed their lives for this shared mission. The wrongdoing of one person must not overshadow this historic partnership and collective sacrifice.” While Afghans in the United States brace for new scrutiny, Afghans still waiting abroad – including those who once worked closest to American forces – say the freeze has placed them in immediate danger. Mohammad, a former Afghan National Army officer who asked that his full name not be made public for fear of retaliation, said he spent more than a decade working “shoulder to shoulder with coalition forces.” From 2015 to 2018, he was an escort to Taliban detainees at Bagram Air Base – a role that, he says, left him recognizable to the very people now in power. Once the Biden administration announced Afghans with active cases could move to a second country for processing, Mohammad says, he got his wife and two young children ready. He said he envisioned his children growing up in California or Virginia, in communities with Afghan families and safe schools. When the Afghan government collapsed in 2021, he says, the Taliban summoned him for interrogation and later attempted a night arrest. “It felt like a door to safety had finally opened for me and my family,” he said. “After years of danger, I finally felt hope.” His children, ages 5 and 7, traveled with him on what he described as a long, punishing journey back into Taliban-controlled territory. Since returning to Afghanistan, Mohammad says, he has been in hiding, fearing Taliban members might recognize their former jailer. Mohammed says the entire time he worked with US soldiers, there was mutual respect. We shared the same mission, and their support kept us alive in dangerous situations,” he said. “I want Americans to know that people like me did not just work a job,” he said. We believed in the values of safety, freedom and justice. We are not asking for favors; we are simply asking for safety and the chance to live without fear.” One of them is Brazil, which created a special humanitarian program for Afghans after the Taliban takeover and has since issued more than 13,000 visas, but now requires local organizations to sponsor each application. Others in a similar situation to Mohammed have told CNN they are also considering Ireland, which has resettled 700 Afghans since 2021 and also requires community sponsorships, and Mexico – the latter on a temporary basis, for its proximity to the United States. “Right now, the best-case scenario is simple,” he said. But any safe country that gives us protection would be a blessing.” Advocates warn that thousands of Afghans like Mohammad – former partners of US forces who moved to third countries for processing – may now be stranded indefinitely, vulnerable to Taliban retribution and worsening economic hardship. Back in Sacramento, Wahidi says his community feels abandoned. “It is too hard for them to live here in America. Afghans who staked their lives on the US mission are now questioning whether the country still wants them, he says.</p>

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A strange porn subculture reveals what life online is doing to us. Open the internet today, and you'll find entire worlds most of us never encounter. Spaces built around practices so strange, so hyper-specific, they read like satire at first glance. It's a digital subculture organized around endless pornography and what can only be described as ritualized masturbation. GoonVerse is a distorted mirror held up to the rest of us, a warning about what happens to a culture — and to our own minds — when constant stimulation becomes the only reliable source of comfort. Few writers have explored this frontier more vividly than Daniel Kolitz. His Harper's essay, “The Goon Squad,” is part ethnography, part cultural diagnosis, and part prophecy about where the internet may be taking all of us. I invited Kolitz onto The Gray Area to talk about what he discovered inside these communities and what “gooning” — he'll explain below — reveals about the rest of us. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, which drops every Monday, so listen and follow us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. On one level, it's a new way of masturbating that's built around edging. If people aren't familiar with the term, edging is when you bring yourself to the point of climax without climaxing. They edge for hours, sometimes for days, trying to reach what they call the “goon state,” a kind of masturbation nirvana. They describe it as total bliss, where the world falls away and they're fully immersed in pornography. Some people compare it to advanced meditation, except the object of focus is porn. Gooning is also the online subculture that's formed around this practice. There are big Discord servers and Twitter pockets where gooners gather. Why did you think something this weird and fringe was worth writing about? You look around and think, Someone needs to document this. But there were bigger forces pulling me in. When I started reporting, softcore content was exploding on major social platforms and funneling people toward OnlyFans. One of the first servers I entered was called the GoonVerse, which had around 50,000 members when I joined. That's huge for such a niche porn community. I clicked on a stream without knowing what to expect, and it looked like a Zoom call where every square was a different person masturbating to the same video. The camera frames were neck down, but everyone was enthusiastically going at it while chatting together. Nothing stayed onscreen for more than a second or two. That was my entry point, and it was so bizarre that I had to understand who these people were. You start digging around, talking to people, trying to understand how this fits into their lives. And a lot of them wanted to talk. This isn't something you can talk about at work or at a family dinner. You can't say, I spent the weekend in my goon cave. So you end up with this huge part of your life that's basically unspeakable. And for many of them, it really is a hobby. They invest money in gear, spend tons of time, form friendships. But it's a lifestyle you can't explain to anyone outside the community. So when someone shows up and says, I'll listen and you'll be anonymous, people open up. Many seemed relieved to finally talk about what had taken over so much of their mental space. You use the word “hobby.” Is that how most gooners think of it? The whole conceit of being a gooner is that you're addicted to porn. Gooning is a kink where the kink is the idea that you're a hopeless porn addict. People fantasize about worlds completely dominated by porn, like porn on billboards in Times Square. But this overlaps with real debates about addiction. There's a big argument, both in academia and in amateur anti-masturbation circles, about whether porn addiction is a meaningful clinical diagnosis. Studies often show that people's sense of being addicted tracks closely with how ashamed they feel. So the line between hobby and addiction is blurry. And when the digital economy is engineered to make us dependent on stimulation, it's hard to know where that line even is. It's a hobby, an identity, a lifestyle, and in many cases, it feels like an addiction, whether or not a clinician would call it that. You assumed, and I would've assumed, that most of these people would be deeply maladjusted incel types. But you say a lot of them were “distressingly normal.” What was distressing about the normality? That made it more unsettling, because it forced me to abandon the idea that this was just fringe pathology. It doesn't mean nothing troubling was happening. There are ethical questions around porn and objectification. But if the incel stance is “I hate women because they won't sleep with me,” the gooner stance is closer to, “I can't get a date, that's fine, I love women anyway, and I'll masturbate for 15 hours.” It's less outward anger and more a surrender to the screen. How many of the gooners you talked to still have sex with actual people? Roughly 40 percent said they were sexually active in some capacity. That could mean a lot of things, but the majority identified as “pornosexual,” which means they have no real interest in physical sex. For some, that's tied to a nihilistic posture. They eroticize being unlovable or broken. Older gooners were more likely to have relationships. Younger ones, raised entirely online, often said they had no interest in sex at all. There's that guy in the piece who says he can't have sex because he can't tolerate not knowing what's in someone else's mind. That feels incredibly specific to this era. That level of inwardness only happens when your entire social world is mediated. So the ambiguity of real relationships becomes terrifying. Younger gooners grew up in curated digital spaces. They have gaming friends, Discord circles, parasocial bonds with creators, and porn that never talks back. Real relationships feel not just hard but unnecessary. This is where the story becomes about a lot more than porn. When did you realize you were looking at a funhouse mirror for the whole attention economy? Last winter, when I was at peak goon anthropology. I'd wake up dreading the day because I knew I'd be opening my laptop and immersing myself in PMVs [porn music videos] and Discord streams. And then I started noticing the same dynamic everywhere. On the subway, people weren't reading. The stimulation wasn't unique to porn. Around that time, a friend gave me Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death. Postman was writing about television decades ago, arguing that a visual culture erodes our ability to sustain attention. Now we've taken those concerns and put them on steroids. If you set the masturbation aside, how different is it from compulsively watching YouTube or binging Netflix? If you zoom out and look at what the person is doing physically, they're sitting in front of a screen chasing stimulation. PMVs are just the most stimulating version of that. And when platforms started allowing more softcore content, that wasn't surprising. Gooning just takes that logic and strips away the pretense. Is this where the internet was always going? We've always had the capacity to destroy ourselves with entertainment. David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest imagines a film so pleasurable people watch it until they die. That book came out before the modern internet. Once you can produce endless stimulation, it'll be exploited. But a global system that connects everyone instantly was always going to tilt toward hyperstimulation. I don't want to erase the good. Listen to the rest of the conversation and be sure to follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Sunday's awards exemplify MAGA's politics of resentment. Men's search for meaning is everyone's problem. The ultimate college experience is social and Southern. The world is aging out of killing one another.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) questioned lawmakers' ability on Monday to address expiring Obamacare subsidies before they lapse at the end of the year, but expressed cautious optimism that bipartisan negotiations could eventually restart. Thune said he sees an impending legislative defeat for Democrats as a motivator to return to the negotiating table once the chamber votes down a Democratic bill later this week for a three-year extension of the enhanced premium credits. “If there is going to be some meeting of minds on this, it is going to require that Democrats sort of come off a position they know is an untenable one and sit down in a serious way and work with Republicans,” Thune said. The vote, likely to occur on Thursday, is part of a bipartisan deal last month to end the government shutdown, but it's a nonstarter proposal for Republicans and will fall well short of the 60-vote filibuster threshold. “Republicans are nowhere on healthcare, and the clock is ticking,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said. Most oppose a straight extension of the subsidies, which they said do more to line the pockets of insurance corporations and cause fraud than lower healthcare costs. “And the question is, when that's over with, will they really want a solution? Because I think we have some people that are really interested in a constructive outcome.” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the most outspoken supporter among his GOP colleagues to extend the Biden-era subsidies, lambasted Republican leadership for not rallying around an alternative to Democrats. Hawley indicated that he was still considering whether to vote for the Democratic extension. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have floated Jan. 31, the next government funding deadline, as another opportunity to address insurance subsidies, despite them lapsing on Jan. 1. There are varying proposals from Senate Republicans, including a mixture of income eligibility caps, fraud prevention measures, and a multiyear phaseout of the subsidies. Yet others, such as a measure from Senate Health Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) that is modeled after President Donald Trump and supported by Thune, would give money directly to people for health savings accounts rather than to insurance companies. “We'll see whether the Democrats, when this is all sort of said and done on this political messaging exercise, want to have a serious conversation about how to fix it,” Thune said.</p>
