                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before ICE descended on New Orleans, GOP lawmakers made it a crime to interfere with immigration enforcement. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. When concerned residents of the New Orleans metro area stepped out into the streets with their whistles and phone cameras over the weekend, ready to protest and document the Trump administration's unwelcome assault on immigrant communities, they faced both widespread digital surveillance by state and federal authorities and a vague state law that makes hindering federal immigration enforcement a crime punishable by up to one year of hard labor in a Louisiana prison. The new law makes “any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with federal immigration enforcement” a crime. On December 3, the ACLU of Louisiana filed a lawsuit challenging Act 399 on behalf of a local group, which stopped conducting know-your-rights trainings after organizers feared they could be criminalized under the law's broad language. Videos shared online show residents gathering for a series of protests over the past week against ICE deployments in New Orleans that began on December 3. In suburbs like Kenner, a working class city with a large immigrant population and a local police chief who works directly with ICE, activists on the ground said caravans of vehicles coordinated by ICE watch activists followed ICE patrols with whistles and bullhorns, warning anyone who could be profiled as undocumented that federal agents were nearby. Businesses across the city posted signs refusing entry to ICE and Border Patrol. “What we are hearing from our clients is exactly what we have seen in other cities — folks are being arrested indiscriminately, targeted for the color of their skin, the language that they speak, the location where they are working,” said Homero Lopez, legal director of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in New Orleans, in a press conference with local leaders on December 5. Meanwhile, a digital surveillance fusion center shared by federal law enforcement and state police is keeping tabs on the online activity of residents and protesters as ICE and Border Patrol fan out across the New Orleans metro area, according to records obtained by the Associated Press. “Online opinions still remain mixed, with some supporting the operations while others are against them,” noted an intelligence briefing circulated early Sunday to law enforcement and obtained by the Associated Press. Previous intelligence bulletins noted “a combination of groups urging the public to record ICE and Border Patrol” as well as “additional locations where agents can find immigrants.” Jeremy Jong, a staff attorney with the immigrant rights group Al Otro Lado in New Orleans, said both Act 399 and the digital surveillance are designed to stifle speech and dissent. “It appears that there is a real chilling effect,” Jong said in an interview. Jong said many people in southern Louisiana may have heard about Act 399 or a separate state law restricting the filming of police officers — the latter was temporarily blocked by a federal court in January — but they may not understand how these attempts at repression impact their constitutional rights. “We want to tell people they have the First Amendment right to go out there and blow a whistle and follow them around and record them — these are all things that are essentially protected by the First Amendment,” Jong      told Truthout. Jong said he recently spoke to members of a church in the New Orleans area who were worried that they could be prosecuted under Act 399 if they refused to let ICE agents enter the church without a warrant. Shortly after taking office, Trump ended a longstanding policy that prohibited ICE from making arrests at schools, churches, and other sensitive public locations. “It's designed to scare people into giving up rights that they otherwise have,” Jong said. Of the 38 people arrested, only about a third had a criminal record, further undermining ICE's debunked claims that immigration sweeps are focused on public safety threats. The total number of people arrested for civil immigration violations in New Orleans has not been publicly reported despite demands from city leaders. Masked ICE and Border Patrol agents also ignored pleas from city leaders not to conceal their identities in public. Jong said people across the metro area are asserting their rights when confronted by federal agents, making it more difficult for ICE and Border Patrol to make indiscriminate arrests at Home Depots and construction sites, for example. “People can't go to work, people can't make rent, can't go to the doctor's office — that's terrible, but one silver lining is it gives us the opportunity to talk to people and say, ‘no, you have rights, and if everyone asserts their rights, these terrible calamities can be resisted,'” Jong said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several Trump officials made unsubstantiated claims that the app encouraged or led to violent outcomes. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The developer of an iPhone app that allows users to report and track immigration enforcement operations across the U.S. is suing several Trump administration officials, alleging that they unfairly characterized his app's intent, leading to it being unduly removed from the Apple Store. He lists several Trump administration officials as defendants, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting director Todd Lyons, and White House border czar Tom Homan. White House officials “have falsely claimed that ICEBlock and similar apps are responsible for violent attacks on law enforcement officers,” the lawsuit states. “No actual evidence has ever been cited to support these claims.” By her own admission, the White House had “reached out to Apple demanding they remove the ICEBlock app” from its store — “and Apple did so,” she added. ICEBlock has always displayed a disclaimer on the app, telling users it is for “information and notification purposes only” and that the app is not for “inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.” “Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,” the lawsuit states. Notably, the complaint's arguments are similar to those made by Republicans who sued social media companies in 2022, after the companies restricted their accounts due to their false claims regarding COVID-19 and vaccines. He is also seeking to “permanently enjoin Defendants…from coercing, threatening, or demanding Apple or other app distribution services in order to stop distribution of the App.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ron DeSantis's legally dubious order designating Cair – and Muslim Brotherhood – follows similar move by Texas Florida is declaring the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) – a US civil rights and liberties group – a foreign terrorist organization, the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, announced on Monday. The move closely follows a similar order issued in November by Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, DeSantis's fellow Republican, even though only the federal government can designate terrorist organizations. The groups vowed to sue Florida as it has Texas, where Abbott has directed law enforcement officials to investigate whether a group in Dallas is operating courts under sharia law. “Governor DeSantis knows full well that Cair-Florida is an American civil rights organization that has spent decades advancing free speech, religious freedom and justice for all,” including for the people of Palestine, the groups said in a statement. His order also targets the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist group founded in 1928. DeSantis and Abbott, it added, want “to smear and silence Americans, especially American Muslims”, who criticize the US's support for Israel's war in Gaza. In a separate statement on X, DeSantis said that members of the Florida legislature “are crafting legislation to stop the creep of sharia law, and I hope that they codify these protections for Floridians against Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood in their legislation”. Abbott's order in Texas prohibited Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood from acquiring property in the state and authorizing legal action to shut down affiliated entities. Cair sent a letter to Abbott in November saying it “has spent 30 years vocally speaking up against all forms of bigotry, including anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism, as well as all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maximiliano Rivero holds up his pet Manola in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Monday.Natacha Pisarenko/The Associated Press Excitement pulsed through Bosques de Palermo, a sprawling park in Buenos Aires, as golden retriever-owners from all over Argentina transformed the park's grassy expanse into a sea of bright yellow fur. Dog owners of all ages, their clothes covered in dog hair and stained with slobber, plopped down on picnic blankets with their beloved goldens to take in the surreal sight of so many other, exceptionally similar-looking ones. Children squealed with delight and giddily petted every dog that pranced about. Families posed for pet selfies under the blazing Southern Hemisphere's summer sun. Sipping Argentina's traditional yerba mate drink, attendees swapped fun facts about their favourite breed – such as goldens' famed ability to sniff out low blood sugar and cancer – and shared stories of their retrievers comforting them throughout all of life's ups and downs. “Since we were children, she's been a constant presence in our family. His family said they drove an hour and a half from their hometown in Buenos Aires province for the event. Around them, fellow golden retrievers sniffed each other furiously, some decked out in costumes ranging from Argentine soccer jerseys and national flags to tutus and Star Wars bandanas. Through the tsunami of tail-wagging and treat-giving, 10 dog-loving volunteers clad in yellow vests roved with clipboards to register each golden retriever in attendance. After hours of meticulous counting, the final number came in late Monday. With 2,397 golden retrievers recorded, the event's organizer, Fausto Duperre, announced that Argentina had broken the informal world record set last year when an event in Vancouver drew 1,685 goldens. High hopes for a big group photo of the dogs alone on the field quickly faded as it became clear that no owner – nor dog – would withstand even a few moments of separation. Owners yanked at leashes and wrangled with the most restive dogs to keep them close. Some said they were expecting total chaos from Monday's event but were surprised to report that it turned out to be easy and delightful – like the dogs themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Africa's international relations minister, Ronald Lamola, has accused an Israel-linked group of manipulating the country's visa system to orchestrate an unauthorized mass entry of Palestinians. Speaking on MacG's Podcast and Chill, Lamola said the group had made use of South Africa's visa-free arrangement with Palestine and that intelligence pointed to external interference. ”They exploited a loophole because of the situation in Palestine. We have a visa-free regime with Palestine. Lamola stressed that although the aircraft had valid landing rights, no authorization was given for a mass arrival of foreign nationals, a requirement under international norms when large groups are transported. But with such things, when we want to bring people en masse, there must be an agreement between the two governments. Lamola defended Home Affairs Minister Dr Leon Schreiber's initial call to halt entry, saying the irregularities justified precaution. But as conditions on board deteriorated, the government was forced to step in. ”The minister of Home Affairs made the call, but we supported him because it was clear that now, we have to act on humanitarian grounds.” “We ended up agreeing that we should make a humanitarian intervention and process them through immigration, and those who wanted to leave left and those that wanted to follow our laws would do so.” And so, the 90-day Palestinian visa waiver was pulled. “Following investigations and recommendations by national intelligence structures and consultations within the Security Cluster – which confirmed the deliberate and ongoing abuse of the 90-day visa exemption for Palestinian ordinary passport holders by Israeli actors linked to ‘voluntary emigration' efforts for residents of the Gaza Strip – Home Affairs has withdrawn the exemption,” Schreiber said. He added that short-stay visa exemptions are commonly used by countries to encourage tourism and short-term travel. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) has placed its defenses on maximum alert after Burkina Faso's military government grounded a Nigerian Air Force plane for allegedly violating the country's airspace. The move comes a day after the Nigerian Army carried out operations to help foil a coup in neighboring Benin. The authorities said on Monday that the C-130 aircraft, carrying 11 military personnel, was forced to land “following an in-flight emergency situation” in Bobo-Dioulasso, located in southwestern Burkina Faso, roughly 910km (565 miles) from Cotonou, Benin's economic capital. “An investigation was immediately opened by the competent Burkinabe authorities and revealed the absence of authorization for the overflight of Burkinabe territory by this military aircraft,” according to an official statement. The group said it has taken measures to guarantee the security of its airspace, including placing its air defense systems on maximum alert and “authorized to neutralize any aircraft that violates the confederal airspace.” Ouagadougou, Bamako, and Niamey accused ECOWAS of serving as a tool for foreign powers, particularly France, after the bloc threatened military intervention to restore constitutional order in Niger. The AES has also previously accused Benin and Nigeria of serving as logistical hubs for French-backed operatives allegedly plotting to destabilize the Sahel, which has been grappling with a jihadist insurgency for more than a decade. Abuja has dismissed the claims and, in its latest response, described the aircraft incident as a “safe precautionary landing” during a ferry mission to Portugal. In a statement on Tuesday, Nigerian Air Force spokesperson Ehimen Ejodame said the crew noticed a technical fault after takeoff from Lagos and diverted to Bobo-Dioulasso, “the nearest airfield… in accordance with standard safety procedures and international aviation protocols.” Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She props him up and tips a pink cup of porridge into his mouth. It's a hot afternoon in November, not far from the town of Bor, which lies about 200 kilometres north of Juba, the capital. The children are at a cooking demonstration organized by Save the Children – an international non-governmental organization – where nutritionists gathered mostly pregnant and lactating mothers to teach them how to cook meals using a variety of food groups and local ingredients. There are other regions of South Sudan where the hunger crisis is even more acute. More than a dozen women gather on blankets and chairs, many comforting their babies after cooking pots of rice, vegetables, fish and meat. Akem and her little brother came with a distant relative on this day, but aid workers often see the pair on their own. Akem walks on the shoulder of the wide and dusty road that's shared with cattle, goats, tuk-tuks and motorbikes to bring her brother here every Monday to pick up packages of Plumpy'Nut, a plastic-wrapped paste with the protein and vitamins that he needs to recover from malnutrition. “It's challenging to take care of the little boy,” says Akem, who speaks so softly she's almost inaudible. But she doesn't have a choice, she adds, as her mother must go into the forest to collect charcoal, sometimes for days at a time. One of Akem's other siblings is responsible for selling it. If their mother comes home empty-handed, they go without food. But this is what it's like in South Sudan, where people are struggling to survive. The hunger crisis, the result of a number of factors – including government corruption, escalating factional violence, extreme poverty and climate change – is further fuelled by a reduction in foreign aid from the United States and other Western countries. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), nearly six million people are facing high levels of acute food insecurity and famine is looming in parts of the country. A 2018 peace agreement was meant to end the war, stipulating that the parties led by President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar would share power, usher in a permanent constitution and prepare for elections. Joanne Minns, Canada's ambassador to South Sudan, told The Globe that the country is at a turning point, and if its leaders fail to act quickly, it could be plunged back into war. It is the only credible path to democracy and stability.” And without stability in the country, its people will continue to starve. You go farming, you get shot by gangs,” said Daniel Akech, a senior analyst for South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, an independent policy organization. He pointed out that devastating floods have also made it difficult for farmers to cultivate. But in addition to violence and climate change, the United Nations said in a September report that government corruption is also to blame for the humanitarian crisis. Yasmin Sooka, chairperson of the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, said in a statement that corruption is not only exacerbating the food shortage and armed conflict over resources but also collapsing the health systems. Edward Chol, a civil servant who works in nutrition in Bor, said the government launched a nutrition strategy and is working with partners to improve the situation. Political turmoil and conflict have meant that South Sudan has depended on foreign assistance for a long time, Mr. Akech said, but over the years, there has been donor fatigue, with international donors realizing they weren't getting much of a return on investment. This year's shutdown of USAID was just one way in which the Trump White House has greatly scaled back foreign aid, with serious consequences for nations such as South Sudan.J. The Trump administration's reduction in foreign aid earlier this year has left the local government exposed, he said, because they haven't invested in their own emergency response systems. “Early identification in the community always saves lives and reduces the severity of disease, and that has become limited because there are no staff who are going up to that level to identify cases earlier,” he said. “Children are facing acute hunger, and we're closing those clinics where they go to get treated.” Other Western nations have failed to fill the gap, even inflicting their own aid cuts. The United Kingdom and other European countries have slashed their foreign assistance budgets. The Canadian government is cutting $2.7-billion from foreign aid over four years, but it has not yet said where the cuts will be made. Mr. Glenwright said that Save the Children is disappointed in the Canadian government's decision to cut foreign assistance, including to health programs, at a time when children are going hungry. The World Food Programme, which has a South Sudanese logistics base in Bentiu, has to be more careful where it deploys its dwindling supplies.RIAN COPE/AFP via Getty Images Funding cuts have forced the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) – the largest humanitarian organization that provides food assistance – to prioritize only communities facing emergency and catastrophic levels of hunger. The organization had hoped to provide such aid for 4.2 million people in South Sudan, said Tomson Phiri, a spokesperson for WFP in the country, but they could only reach 3.7 million – and even then, with reduced rations. “In some areas, rations have been sliced by up to half, whereas in the worst-affected areas we have intensified rations to 70 per cent.” He said a shortfall of US$485-million in 2026 threatens the WFP's ability to prevent the crisis from deteriorating further. UNICEF, the UN's children's rights agency, said that 186 nutrition centres have closed across South Sudan since the beginning of 2025, and so have more than a third of the safe spaces it supports for women and girls. Inside the pediatric ward at the hospital in Bor, 23-year-old Nyaror Agau sits on a bed with her daughter in her arms. She's in a stabilization centre run by Save the Children, which is reserved for children who are severely malnourished and have compounding illnesses. Ms. Agau's daughter, who isn't yet two years old, has malaria and pneumonia. Ms. Agau said she travelled by boat, holding her daughter, who was restless with a fever, to reach this hospital. Nyaror Agau's daughter is recovering from malnutrition in Bor. Once a baby is treated here, nutritionists enroll them in an outpatient program and follow their progress. In the ward, women stretch out on beds with blankets they've brought from home under a web of tangled mosquito nets. The little girl squirms and cries as she is laid down to have her height measured. The results show that she is at risk of malnutrition. I won't be able to produce milk,” Ms. Bol says. “Go and tell those who were helping us that we still need support. Adol Bol worries about her six-month-old daughter, and the hunger they endure at home. On the grounds of the hospital, where pigs and goats roam between buildings, other nutritionists sit at a long table inside a warm building where they treat malnourished children and offer their mothers advice. She instructs them on how to eat the therapeutic foods they provide and tells them, because it's treatment, that sharing is not allowed. “We are preaching balanced diets,” Ms. Kelei says, laughing and shaking her head. You can reach to the level of one meal a day.” “Now we tell them: ‘If God has blessed you today with something, try to eat that thing today, and tomorrow you look for another one.' She pulls over a plastic chair and talks about their routine. When there's food, she cooks porridge for them in the morning. In the afternoons, she washes his clothes, and when her mom doesn't make it home, she puts him to bed and then falls asleep beside him. Once a week, she brings him here to pick up his Plumpy'Nut. When asked if it was also an opportunity for her to eat, she says she will if there's enough, but the priority is her brother. Akem says she had to quit school after primary because her family couldn't afford it, and she has to look after Garang. But she hopes to return one day, and eventually become a nutrition counsellor herself who can help kids like her brother.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Armed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia entered a second day on Tuesday, both sides said, in defiance of calls from the United States to stop fighting and adhere to a months-old Trump-backed peace deal that now looks on the brink of complete collapse. At least eight people have been killed since the latest skirmishes began, according to reports from both sides. By Tuesday, the fighting had spread to more points along the disputed border, with accusations of rocket strikes and drone attacks in some areas. And Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow hinted the clashes could escalate, telling CNN in a sit-down interview that military action would continue “until we feel that sovereignty and territorial integrity are not challenged.” The fighting, over decades-old competing territorial claims along their 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border is the heaviest between Thailand and Cambodia since a deadly five-day conflict in July. Both sides accuse each other of firing first, and CNN is unable to verify who did. Cambodia had been mobilizing heavy weapons and repositioning combat units, the Thai air force said. The Cambodian army said Thai forces had “engaged in numerous provocative actions for many days,” without specifying details. On Tuesday firing was reported in six of the seven Thai provinces that share a border with Cambodia, according to the Thai military. The navy said Cambodian troops fired heavy weapons, including BM-21 rockets, into civilian areas, and accused Cambodia of deploying special operations units and snipers to the border, of digging trenches to fortify positions, and encroaching into Thai territory in the coastal Trat province “in a direct and serious threat to Thailand's sovereignty.” Cambodia's army said Tuesday that Thailand's military had carried out “uninterrupted firing throughout the night” in several border areas using “large-scale drones” and “poisonous smoke.” Seven Cambodian civilians were killed and about 20 others wounded, according to the country's Interior Ministry. And on Monday, Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters in Bangkok that “Cambodia must comply with (Thailand), in order to stop the fighting.” When asked about the Trump-backed peace agreement signed in Malaysia, he said: “I don't remember that anymore.” Hun Sen, the influential former leader of Cambodia and current Senate President said in a Facebook post Tuesday, “our armed forces of all types must strike back at all points where the enemy attacks.” Trump, who presided over the ceremony, had helped broker it – in part, by threatening he would not make trade deals with either country if they refused. But tensions had been simmering for weeks, including a landmine explosion that injured four Thai soldiers in November. Following that blast, Thailand suspended all work on the peace agreement, and accused Cambodia of violating the joint declaration by laying fresh landmines – a claim Cambodia vehemently denies. Trump had considered the peace agreement as a major diplomatic victory, and another boost to his much vaunted – and often over-exaggerated – campaign to have ended several wars. The dispute has its origins in the mapping of Cambodia's border by its former colonial ruler France, and analysts had cautioned of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LUGANSK, December 9. Seven Russian civilians were killed and nearly 60 people, including a child, were injured over the past week as a result of Ukrainian attacks, Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador-at-Large for the crimes of the Kiev regime Rodion Miroshnik told TASS. "Over the past week, 65 civilians were affected by Ukrainian shelling: 58 people were injured, including one minor, and seven people were killed. <...> The largest number of civilian casualties last week was recorded in the Belgorod, Kherson, Zaporozhye Regions and the Donetsk People's Republic," he said. Miroshnik specified that Ukrainian strike drone attacks were the most common cause of death and injury to Russian civilians. He added that over the past week, more than 80% of the total number of victims - 55 people - were killed by Ukrainian drones. "Ukrainian militants actively targeted apartment buildings, private homes, commercial and social facilities, and civilian passenger vehicles," the diplomat noted. Miroshnik added that the enemy continues to mine the area remotely. Last week, a 55-year-old resident of Yalta was killed when he stepped on a Ukrainian mine, and two more people were injured when they stepped on explosive devices in Dimitrov and Rovno. According to the diplomat, the Ukrainian military fired more than 3,200 types of ammunition at Russian regions last week.</p>

(AP) — Admitting participation by Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki in the World Baseball Classic is “very delicate” following a World Series that stretched into November, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts isn't sure whether any limits will be placed on his team's Japanese stars. “I would like to think that it's going to be a dialogue as far as restrictions and limitations, in the sense of just trying to give them the opportunity,” Roberts said Monday at baseball's winter meetings. But right now there's no more clarity than we had before.” Ohtani won his fourth unanimous Most Valuable Player award, hitting .282 with 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases while going 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA over 14 shortened starts that included 62 strikeouts in 47 innings. He had eight homers and 14 RBIs in 17 postseason games along with a 2-1 record and 4.43 ERA in four postseason starts. Roberts said he wasn't sure whether Ohtani will pitch for defending champion Japan in the WBC, which starts March 5 and ends March 17 — nine days before the Dodgers' opener against Arizona. Sasaki started the semifinal win over Mexico and Yamamoto followed in relief as Ohtani doubled to spark a ninth-inning rally. “I know the organization doesn't but I do think that the conversations need to be had, will be had, as far as what each individual is taking on and whatever role that they might be taking on and what potential costs there might be. … But you can't debate the emotion, what a player might feel of this potential opportunity.” Limited to 90 innings by a triceps injury in his first season with the Dodgers after signing a $325 million, 12-year contract in December 2023, Yamamoto pitched 211 innings this year in the regular season and postseason combined. Sasaki, in his rookie season, didn't pitch for the Dodgers between May 9 and Sept. 24 because of a right shoulder impingement and became their closer in the postseason. Los Angeles plans to have Ohtani as a regular member of the starting rotation next season. “But it's not going to be a regular five-man rotation,” Roberts said. He told Amazon Prime's “Good Sports” last week that he favors a salary cap, which some in management are advocating be proposed during collective bargaining next year. Baseball is the only U.S. professional major league without a cap. “I'm entitled to an opinion, as we all are,” Roberts said Monday. Los Angeles projects to a major league-record $509.5 million in payroll and luxury tax this year. “We have an organization that whatever rules or regulations, constructs are put in front of us, we're going to dominate,” Roberts said. “And so just give us the rules, let us know the landscape and then I'll bet on our organization.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>
