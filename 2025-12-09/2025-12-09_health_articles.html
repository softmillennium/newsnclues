                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington State University researchers have discovered how a neural circuit – or a connection between two brain regions – drives relapse after opioid use, a finding that could lead to more effective treatments for opioid use disorders. In a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, researchers in the Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience at WSU's College of Veterinary Medicine used a preclinical model to model opioid use in humans and found that reducing the activity within a specific neuronal circuit linking the prelimbic cortex and the paraventricular thalamus significantly reduced drug-seeking behavior. The project was led by graduate researcher Allison Jensen, the study's first author, working under assistant professor Giuseppe Giannotti. We know people are going to use drugs, but for someone who decides, 'I'm done,' the challenge is stopping cravings. If we can target the brain regions driving those episodes, we can help prevent relapse and save lives." Opioids are the leading cause of drug overdose deaths in the United States, accounting for more than 79,000 deaths in 2023. One of the major challenges for those trying to break opioid addiction is relapse. Studies show nearly 60% of people relapse within one week of completing an inpatient detoxification and as many as 77% relapse within six months after short-term inpatient care without medication-assisted treatment. "By identifying the upstream driver of that response, we can begin to understand how cravings form and how to intervene." They first used chemogenetics, which involved introducing a designer receptor – a genetically engineered protein – into neurons of the prelimbic cortex sending projections to the paraventricular thalamus. Researchers could then activate the receptor with a specific drug that doesn't affect other cells, allowing them to reduce activity in the pathway, which was followed by a significant reduction in heroin-seeking behavior. Even more promising was an optogenetic approach that used light to manipulate activity in the pathway. A similar approach called deep brain stimulation, in which electrodes deliver controlled electrical impulses to specific brain regions, could potentially achieve the same results in humans. Not only could it be effective for opioid addiction, Giannotti said, but it could also be adapted for other abused substances, including cocaine, alcohol and nicotine. "These kinds of therapies could one day help reduce cravings in humans," Giannotti said. "If someone comes to a treatment facility, we could potentially use an approach like this to target this pathway and help them get through the periods when cravings are the highest." The next step for Giannotti's lab is to examine how environmental cues – such as light and sounds associated with drug use – are dynamically activated in this brain circuit to drive relapse. "Environmental cues can be incredibly powerful triggers of relapse in humans," Giannotti said. "Understanding the neuronal dynamics by which neurons respond to those cues will help us design even more precise and effective treatments."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The negative health impacts from contamination by so called "forever chemicals" in drinking water costs the contiguous U.S. at least $8 billion a year in social costs, a University of Arizona-led study has found. The research team studied all births in New Hampshire from 2010-2019, focusing on mothers living near PFAS-contaminated sites. The research shows that mothers receiving water from wells that are "downstream" (in groundwater terms) of PFAS-contaminated sites, as opposed to comparable mothers receiving water from "upstream" wells, had higher first-year infant mortality, more preterm births (including more births before even 28 weeks), and more births with infants weighing less than 5.5 pounds (including more births with weights less than even 2.2 pounds). These findings build on earlier laboratory and public health research but offer new evidence from real-world exposure across a large population. Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes costs of at least $8 billion on the babies born each year, which encompasses medical care, long-term health impacts and reduced lifetime earnings. Removing PFAS from drinking water not only results in drastically improved health outcomes. It also produces a significant long-term economic benefit." Lemoine and fellow Eller economics professor Ashley Langer collaborated on the research with Bo Guo, an associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences, in the College of Science, after meeting at an event hosted by the Arizona Institute for Resilience to foster collaborative research across disparate fields of study. Lemoine and Langer took an immediate interest in Guo's years-long research into PFAS, while Guo was fascinated by the economists' research into long-term health and economic impacts. Eller economics alumnus Robert Baluja and former AIR-funded postdoctoral researcher Wesley Howden also contributed to the study. PFAS were originally developed to make protective coatings for goods to resist heat, oil and water, and are used in a range of products and in firefighting activities. They earned the label "forever chemicals" because they take much longer to break down naturally in the environment. Researchers have long suspected that exposure to PFAS poses health risks, especially to infants, who can suffer from low birth weight or even die from PFAS exposure via their pregnant mothers. But prior work had not found a way to make PFAS exposure effectively random. "We found really substantial impacts on infant health, which expanded on what others before us had found," Langer said. The U of A study focuses on two "long-chain" PFAS – PFOA and PFOS – that are no longer manufactured in the U.S. but remain in soils and therefore are still percolating into groundwater. "Whatever PFAS we see in groundwater is only a tiny fraction of the PFAS that has been dumped in the environment," Guo said. They also note that activated carbon filters, whether used by water utilities or installed in homes, can remove these long-chain PFAS from drinking water. "These chemicals may be everywhere, but we still find that drinking water matters for pregnant women. Installing and maintaining home water filters could be prudent for them," Lemoine said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Preliminary results of a nationwide study suggest that the disinfectant used to treat water before it is distributed through pipes may impact the incidence of Legionnaire's disease in certain parts of the country. Waterborne diseases – caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites – affect more than 7 million people in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). One of them is Legionnaires' disease, a potentially severe pneumonia. It is caused by the bacterium Legionella, which grows in the pipes of water systems, where it can be spread through aerosolized droplets from sources such as showerheads, decorative fountains, or building cooling towers. Researchers conducted an epidemiological study comparing historical data on Legionnaire's disease in the United States with 25 water utilities' treatment attributes (representing all 10 EPA regions). There are higher rates of Legionnaires' Disease in zip codes served by water treatment plants that use chlorine as the primary disinfectant, rather than monochloramine. These preliminary results back up data from previous studies of individual buildings. (For example, previous research has found that in healthcare facilities where the water is treated with monochloramine, there is a lower prevalence of Legionnaires''s disease.) The risk for Legionnaires' disease is higher for people with weakened immune systems, older adults, smokers, and those with chronic lung or kidney diseases. It is important to think about the whole life of the water, from treatment to tap, when we consider how to best manage this pathogen and lower the incidence of Legionnaires'disease."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a major step towards a precision therapy for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, researchers at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) have uncovered how the body's bile acids bind to block C. diff's most dangerous toxin. C. diff is a toxin-producing bacterium and the leading cause of health care-associated infections, causing serious infections in the gut and persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and inflammation of the colon. Current treatments for C. diff infection rely on antibiotics, which can disrupt healthy gut bacteria and leave patients vulnerable to repeated infections. Working with partners at the University of Minnesota, North Carolina State University, and Scripps Research Institute, the SickKids research has informed the development of a new compound that can protect against C. diff in preclinical models, offering hope for safer, more effective treatments that could finally stop the cycle of recurrent infections. Recognizing the limitations of antibiotics as a front-line treatment for C. diff, SickKids investigators focused on TcdB, the toxin responsible for most of the cellular damage and gut inflammation associated with infection. Earlier research led by Dr. Roman Melnyk, study lead, Senior Scientist and Program Head in Molecular Medicine and Co-Director of the SPARC Drug Discovery Facility, demonstrated that some naturally occurring bile acids, best known for their role in digestion, can also inhibit TcdB. Building on this work, postdoctoral fellow Dr. Sean Miletic set out to investigate how these bile acids interact with the toxin in the gut; in collaboration with Dr. John Rubenstein, a cryo-electron microscopy expert in the Molecular Medicine program, the team captured the first detailed view of TcdB bound to bile acids. Their findings revealed that the toxin's structure must be in an "open" formation to cause damage – and certain bile acids can latch on and hold it shut. This structural insight guided the development of bile acids that could act as targeted therapies for C. diff infection. Dr. Casey Theriot at North Carolina State University led testing of these compounds in preclinical models. Together, the team created and tested sBA-2, a synthetic bile acid that was capable of neutralizing TcdB directly in the gut. In preclinical models of C. diff infection, sBA-2 significantly reduced disease symptoms such as weight loss and intestinal damage. Importantly, it did this without affecting bacteria as whole, preserving gut health and targeting the toxin with precision. We are very excited about the potential of sBA-2 as a first-in-class oral therapy for this devastating disease. For patients, this approach could mean safer treatment and a real chance to break the cycle of repeated illness."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reducing calorie intake helps cancer-fighting immune cells do their jobs more effectively, reports a study by Van Andel Institute scientists and collaborators. Growing evidence suggests dietary restriction has anti-cancer effects but the 'why and how' are not well understood. Additional research is needed but we are hopeful these insights can inform evidence-based dietary guidelines to improve the effectiveness of immune-based cancer treatments." Dietary restriction is an approach that reduces overall calorie intake while maintaining good nutrition. Lab studies by other researchers suggest that modest calorie restriction may improve immune and metabolic function and delay the onset of certain age-related diseases. Conversely, diets that are too restrictive can have significant negative effects, such as nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss and depression. The study, conducted in mouse models and published today in Nature Metabolism, explored a low-fat, high-protein diet given once a day with 30%–50% fewer calories than usual. The results showed this lower calorie intake promoted the formation of ketones, which act as a cellular fuel T cells use to become more effective tumor fighters. Ketones also help T cells combat cancer longer by preventing cellular exhaustion. Ketone levels rise when glucose, a sugar that serves as the primary power source for cells, is in short supply, such as during exercise or fasting. Earlier research by Jones's lab found that T cells often prefer ketones to glucose because ketones can "reprogram" T cells to better address threats. T cells' ability to rely on different nutrients may be a biological failsafe that boosts the immune system when resources are limited, such as when a person's appetite is suppressed during illness. But T cells aren't the only type of cell that can harness ketones. Earlier this year, a study by VAI's Evan Lien, Ph.D., revealed that cancer cells also can use ketones to fuel their growth. Ongoing research in Jones's and Lien's labs aims to answer this question. For now, the findings add to an increasingly complex understanding of how different nutrients help or hinder cellular activity. While the study demonstrates that reducing calorie intake supports T cell function, it does not suggest dietary restriction prevents or treats cancer. Additionally, people with cancer already face significant challenges in meeting nutritional needs, in part due to loss of appetite or nausea associated with treatment. More research is needed to clearly understand all the factors at play. The team's next steps include exploring different diet and fasting combinations to see how they impact immune function. In the long-term, Jones envisions robust clinical trials to evaluate potential dietary strategies designed to boost the success of immunotherapies against cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new preclinical study, researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center developed an antibody therapy called 77A that showed an ability to overcome treatment resistance in blood cancers, such as myeloma and lymphoma, as well as solid tumors. The study was led by Jun Wei, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Lymphoma & Myeloma, and principal investigator Robert Z. Orlowski, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Lymphoma & Myeloma. All ASH content from MD Anderson can be found at MDAnderson.org/ASH. There is tremendous promise in the way 77A is capable of rewiring the immune system, enabling it to respond effectively against multiple cancers. Our findings offer a new pathway to immunotherapy and patient treatment." HSP70 often is overproduced in certain blood cancers and solid tumors, contributing to a hostile tumor environment by suppressing immune responses and promoting cancer cell survival. It also showed potential to pair with adoptive T cell therapy, a cutting-edge approach where patients receive lab-grown immune cells to target cancer cells. Importantly, 77A was effective in laboratory models of multiple cancer types, and early tests with human immune cells showed it could enhance immune responses in healthy donors. These findings pave the way for clinical trials and suggest 77A could become a versatile new therapeutic option that warrants further investigation. "These results give us confidence that 77A could become a versatile immunotherapy," Orlowski said. "Our next step is to advance a humanized version of this antibody into clinical trials to evaluate its potential in patients across multiple cancer types." The 77A humanized antibody is under development and expected to move into clinical trials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Bielefeld University have analyzed how reliably AI methods can detect pulse rates from simple video recordings. But a new study in the journal npj Digital Medicine reveals clear weaknesses as soon as heart rates rise. For telemedicine to function in everyday life, digital diagnostic tools must operate reliably, even under challenging conditions. A research team at Bielefeld University has now examined how accurately modern AI methods can estimate pulse rates from facial video recordings. It is intended, for example, to ease the workload of medical practices or automatically detect stress in everyday situations. We wanted to know whether these methods truly deliver on their promises, especially when heart rates go up. Because it is precisely in such moments that they would be most important." Most previous rPPG studies rely on ideal conditions: seated participants, good lighting, stable cameras. The team led by Bhargav Acharya, William Saakyan, Professor Dr Barbara Hammer, and Hanna Drimalla intentionally focused on real-life scenarios. The results are surprising: while low lighting has little effect on automated measurement, accuracy drops sharply at elevated heart rates. Some modern methods then produce values that are simply unusable for telemedical applications. Because digital health services are expanding rapidly, the researchers caution against uncritical deployment of these technologies. If AI methods misjudge stress or heart problems, this can create real risks, both for clinicians and for their patients. “That's why we are currently working on new and more resilient approaches,” says Bhargav Acharya, “ones that can detect high heart rates and function even in poor lighting or for people with darker skin tones.” Only then can contactless pulse measurement find its place in digital healthcare, beyond the lab and in the midst of everyday life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new meta-analysis finds that “laughing gas” can lift depressive symptoms within hours, highlighting a fast-acting antidepressant approach that may work best when carefully repeated rather than given just once. Study: Nitrous oxide for the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis. In a recent review published in the journal eBioMedicine, researchers synthesized data from protocol papers, clinical trials, and exploratory studies to assess evidence regarding the effectiveness of nitrous oxide for treating depression. They concluded that within hours of administration, nitrous oxide can produce a rapid antidepressant effect with generally transient, dose-dependent side effects. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. Its causes include complex interactions among environmental, biological, and psychological systems that disrupt stress-regulation pathways and neural circuits. This has intensified research focus on faster-acting therapies that can support people with depression, particularly for those who experience treatment-resistant depression. Growing research has shifted toward the glutamatergic system, motivated in part by ketamine's fast-acting antidepressant effects. Nitrous oxide, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist widely used as an anesthetic, has shown similar fast-acting benefits, accompanied by short-lived, dose-dependent adverse effects. Its actions include modulating glutamate signaling, altering activity within the default mode network, and influencing dopamine and opioid systems. These mechanisms have positioned nitrous oxide as a promising candidate for further investigation as a novel antidepressant. In the normal state (A), glutamate (glu) binds to NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+) ion influx, triggering excitatory signalling. This modulation of ions affects the excitatory and inhibitory balance in the central nervous system and is implicated in depression. The review identified eleven eligible studies, including seven completed clinical trials, most of which were randomized controlled trials, and four published protocol papers. These studies represented early-phase research conducted in Australia, Brazil, China, and the United States. Across the completed trials, a total of 247 participants were enrolled, comprising individuals with major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, or bipolar depression. Nitrous oxide was typically administered at concentrations of either 25% or 50%. It was delivered through controlled inhalation for periods ranging from 20 to 60 minutes, either as a single treatment session or as repeated sessions scheduled weekly or twice weekly, with most pooled efficacy estimates driven primarily by single-session 50% protocols. Overall, the studies showed that one session of nitrous oxide could quickly reduce symptoms of depression, with detectable improvements within two hours after its administration. In one of the earliest trials, scientists found that a 60-minute session of 50% nitrous oxide led to noticeably lower depression scores compared with a placebo at both two and 24 hours. People receiving the treatment were also more likely to show a meaningful improvement (20% vs 5%), and some even reached remission within a day. Another study reported similar results in people with treatment-resistant depression: symptoms improved within hours. In one study, both nitrous oxide and the comparison drug midazolam reduced symptoms; however, nitrous oxide helped more people improve within the first two hours. The study also suggested that people with certain patterns of brain blood flow might be more likely to benefit, hinting at a possible biological marker for predicting treatment response. Across all repeated-dose studies, the greatest improvements usually appeared within 24 to 48 hours after each treatment and accumulated over time. For example, eight sessions over four weeks led to very high improvement and remission rates compared to a placebo. Another study found that both low-dose (25%) and high-dose (50%) nitrous oxide reduced symptoms over two weeks, though the higher dose was more effective. The lower dose, however, caused fewer adverse events such as nausea and dizziness, suggesting it might be a good compromise between effectiveness and tolerability. The most extensive study to date found that weekly sessions over four weeks led to steady, cumulative improvement. When data from several trials were combined, nitrous oxide showed clear antidepressant effects at both two hours and 24 hours after treatment. These early improvements were consistent across studies, with very low statistical heterogeneity. However, the combined data did not show lasting benefits at one week, suggesting the main effects are short-term unless treatments are repeated. Because only a small number of trials contributed to the pooled estimates, some asymmetry in the funnel plots suggests that publication bias cannot be excluded, and blinding may have been imperfect in some trials, raising the possibility of expectancy effects. Researchers found that across a small number of early-phase trials, nitrous oxide produces rapid, short-term antidepressant effects, with repeated dosing extending both the magnitude and duration of benefits. However, most studies were small, early-phase trials with heterogeneous designs, limited long-term follow-up, and insufficient power to compare doses or identify predictors fully. Differences in delivery systems, comparators, and outcome measures also constrain comparability. Safety data, though generally reassuring, remain incomplete for long-term or repeated use. Overall, the evidence suggests that nitrous oxide is a fast-acting antidepressant candidate that is generally well tolerated, with higher rates of mild, transient side effects than placebo, but that larger, longer, and mechanistically informed trials are needed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new clinical trial suggests that pairing bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates with CAR T-cell therapy may sharply boost one-year progression-free survival for people with aggressive lymphoma. In just a few years, treatment options for aggressive lymphoma have rapidly advanced. However, many patients show a consistent pattern: powerful new therapies act quickly but often fail to keep the lymphoma at bay permanently, says Jay Spiegel, M.D., a transplant and cellular therapy physician at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Jay Spiegel, M.D., a transplant and cellular therapy physician, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center That challenge inspired a new clinical trial - the researchers, led by senior author Lazaros Lekakis, M.D., professor of clinical medicine at the Miller School, combined three of the most promising lymphoma treatments, aiming to improve outcomes. The clinical trial data indicate that combining these treatments may significantly enhance progression-free survival at one year. Its most frequent subtype, diffuse LBCL, affects about 25,000 people in the U.S. each year. For the 30% whose lymphoma comes back or never fully disappears, the next step is often CAR T-cell therapy, such as axicabtagene ciloleucel, approved in 2017. It trains a patient's immune cells to target lymphoma. "CAR T works incredibly well upfront," Spiegel said, "but we've learned that it often falls short in the long-term - only about 40% of patients remain in remission after five years." Polatuzumab is an antibody–drug conjugate, meaning it delivers a small dose of chemotherapy directly into lymphoma cells. Both are effective initially but don't reliably keep the disease away when used alone. "Attacking three different antigens at once could help overcome several of the reasons CAR T fails," Spiegel said. The phase 2 study enrolled 25 adults with relapsed or refractory LBCL. Of the 24 patients who reached day 90, 90% were in complete remission. At one year, about 80% were still in remission, a significant increase from an estimated 50% at one year with CAR T alone. "I did not think it would work this well," Spiegel said. "To take patients with this type of aggressive disease and have so many still in remission at one year, that really surprised me." The Sylvester trial might provide a way to achieve longer remissions. "We have an exciting result," Spiegel said, "but now we need to show it can be done on a larger scale. "Everything in lymphoma is happening all at once," Spiegel said. That pace presents both opportunity and complexity as clinicians work to understand how each advancement fits into the broader treatment landscape - and how they can work together. In this surge of treatment options, the message for patients is increasingly hopeful. "If you have relapsed disease, even aggressive disease, there are multiple approaches now that can still cure your lymphoma," Spiegel said.
