                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans, but still lags goals set by a trade agreement with President Donald Trump, an NBC News analysis found. China previously was a top buyer of U.S. soybeans, but last spring stopped purchasing American soybeans because of a trade war launched by Trump. The country resumed purchasing soybeans in October after reaching a trade agreement with the United States. Under that deal, China promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025. But China has bought just 2.85 million metric tons of soybeans since Oct. 30, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data compiled by NBC News. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said that China is on track to purchase 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of February. The Trump administration has said China would buy at least 25 million tons of soybeans in the next three years. Trump on Monday announced that he was giving $12 billion in aid to American farmers who have been affected by his trade war. Trump said that the aid will come from U.S. tariff revenues.

Canada's budget watchdog is walking back his most charged criticisms of Mark Carney's fiscal policy, but says the government's decision to drop its debt-to-GDP guideline is a major shift that warrants more public debate.

Soon after Jason Jacques was appointed interim parliamentary budget officer in September, he called the Canadian government's debt position “unsustainable” and “stupefying,” pointing to the prime minister's mounting spending pledges. </p>

Crypto:

Wall Street's biggest Bitcoin bulls are dialing back their near-term forecasts after the recent downdraft, but their long-term conviction hasn't wavered.

Standard Chartered Plc, a longtime crypto proponent, halved its Bitcoin price forecasts as demand from corporate treasuries collapses and ETF flows falter. The bank now expects the original cryptocurrency to climb to $150,000 by the end of 2026, down from a previous projection of $300,000, and has delayed its $500,000 long-term target to 2030 from 2028.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new exchange-traded fund from Bitwise that began trading Tuesday will give retail investors and financial advisors access to a broad range of cryptocurrencies in one shot, as opposed to the ETFs so far that have mostly just tracked just one or two cryptocurrencies. The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (BITW) holds the following 10 digital assets: Bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot. The conversion makes BITW the first ETF by a major crypto asset manager to include Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot, Bitwise CEO and co-founder Hunter Horsley told CNBC. "This really meaningfully expands the audience that can access exposure to these different assets, [and] of course, for assets that don't have spot ETF, all the more," Horsley said Monday. The fund offers exposure to crypto-assets for financial advisors as well as other smaller investors who are using funds from an IRA or retirement account "where their only choice is to use ETFs," said the CEO. The ETF was converted from an index fund which held the same coins and it starts trading with more than $1 billion in assets. Along with broader permissions to trade and hold, ETFs offer other advantages over funds that may make them more attractive to some investors, including increased trading flexibility and tax efficiency, as well as lower fees. This move follows the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of a rash of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. Since then, asset managers have jockeyed for approvals to launch ETFs tracking a wider range of digital assets, from altcoins like sui and aptos to memecoins such as official Trump and dogecoin. The ETF launches amid a series of recent pullbacks in the crypto market that saw bitcoin trade as low as $85,000 earlier this month,  more than 30% off its record high of just north of $126,000 hit in October. Smaller coins with fewer institutional vehicles were hurt even more during the recent sell-off, exposing a risk this ETF will lead to bigger losses for smaller investors. "It's the perfect time for a lot of investors who've now been paying attention since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, but want a more comprehensive solution to allocating to digital assets than having to pick specific assets and size a bunch of different exposures," said Horsley. BITW allocates 90% of its holdings to assets that are held by existing single-coin exchange-traded products— Bitcoin, ether, solana and XRP. The fund will be rebalanced every month — more frequently than most ETFs, which rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Bitwise manages more than $15 billion in client assets and has a suite of more than 40 digital asset investment products. BITW, which is technically an exchange-traded product, was 1.5% higher Tuesday on its new home at the NYSE Arca exchange. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pfizer on Tuesday said it has struck an up to $2.1 billion licensing deal with YaoPharma to develop and commercialize its obesity pill, furthering the pharmaceutical company's push into the weight loss space. Pfizer will pay YaoPharma, a subsidiary of Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, an up-front payment of $150 million. YaoPharma could also receive up to $1.94 billion in milestone payments, along with tiered royalties on sales if the drug is approved. YaoPharma's drug works by targeting the same gut hormone, GLP-1, as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. But the pill is still in early-stage development, which means it will take several years to reach patients. The deal will help Pfizer beef up and diversify its obesity drug pipeline after a string of setbacks, including its decisions to scrap two different pills over the past two years. The drugmaker boosted its prospects in the competitive space with its up to $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last month, following a fierce bidding war with Novo Nordisk. "We look forward to contributing our expertise and resources to continue the development of this investigational GLP-1 small molecule which complements and strengthens our growing portfolio of novel candidates for treating obesity and its adjacent diseases," said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, in a statement. Under the terms of the agreement, YaoPharma will conduct a phase one trial on its drug, while Pfizer will take control of later development. Pfizer also plans to conduct studies combining YaoPharma's treatment with its own drug targeting another gut hormone receptor called GIP, which is currently in mid-stage development. That combination isn't new in the space: Eli Lilly's weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro use a dual approach targeting both GLP-1 and GIP. In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said limited information is available on YaoPharma's drug, called YP05002. But Seigerman said he views "obesity diversification as promising in the short term" for Pfizer. He added that Pfizer's $150 million up-front payment reflects "prudent capital conservation in light of the recent Metsera bidding war." But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.

"Getting the top team right is the CEO-elect's most important early decision," Dewar said, adding that a CEO's "real leverage comes through leaders" and if they're "not aligned, capable, and energized for the next chapter, no strategy can take hold." John Longo, a finance professor at Rutgers Business School and the author of "Buffett's Tips," told Business Insider there are parallels to a "new football coach wanting to install his own offensive and defensive coordinators." Dewar also said a CEO transition is often an "unfreezing moment" for a company's leaders, prompting them to "step back and reflect" on whether they want to keep working under the new boss or make a change as well. Berkshire's finance chief of nearly four decades, Marc Hamburg, will hand over his responsibilities to Berkshire Hathaway Energy's finance boss, Charles Chang, in June 2026, but hold off on retiring until June 2027 to ease the transition. Mead said his "contributions to structuring deals and managing the financials can't be overstated." Hamburg's willingness to work with his successor for a full year is a "testament to his commitment to Berkshire and its longevity," Chris Bloomstran, the president of Semper Augustus Investments and a Berkshire shareholder for 25 years, told Business Insider. NetJets CEO Adam Johnson has been appointed president of Berkshire's 32 consumer products, service, and retailing businesses — a group that includes See's Candies, FlightSafety, and Fruit of the Loom. David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger, told Business Insider that he expected Abel to pick someone to supervise those "very large" businesses in the near future. Combs also took over as Geico's CEO in 2020 and spearheaded the auto insurer's rebound this year. Kass predicted Berkshire would find a replacement for Combs to help Weschler manage Berkshire's more than $350 billion worth of cash and roughly $300 billion stock portfolio. Bloomstran said Weschler might take charge of a larger chunk of Berkshire's portfolio and be a "sounding board" for Abel on major investments, or at least take over Combs' allocation if he hasn't already. Geico's operating chief, Nancy Pierce, has replaced Combs as CEO after nearly 40 years at the company. Pierce's appointment is "pure continuity," Cunningham said, adding that her long tenure, deep experience, and strong endorsement from insurance boss Ajit Jain are "all very on brand for Berkshire." Michael O'Sullivan will become Berkshire's first-ever general counsel on New Year's Day. Prior to joining Snap as general counsel in 2017, O'Sullivan spent more than two decades at the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, cofounded by Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger. Bloomstran said the new position was "interesting but not surprising" as Berkshire has long relied on Munger, Tolles & Olson as external counsel, and cofounder Ron Olson recently retired from Berkshire's board, where he likely served as an informal legal advisor. Kass underscored that no other senior leaders are leaving Berkshire and said it's "critically important" that Jain and other senior insurance bosses, such as Joe Brandon, "remain in place to smooth this management transition." Meyer Shields, a managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who's been covering Berkshire for more than 15 years, said in a research note that his team "expect more turnover" in the months ahead, as the cachet of "working for Mr. Buffett's successor is not (at least yet) the same as working for Mr. Buffett himself." Brett Gardner, the author of "Buffett's Early Investments," told Business Insider there's "justifiable concern that some people want to work for Warren Buffett and not Berkshire Hathaway." Complicating matters is the reality that many of Buffett's most trusted lieutenants are "past retirement age already," he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Regional bank Fifth Third on Tuesday announced a deal making fintech firm Brex the provider of its commercial cards and expense management tools for business clients. The program will run on Brex's embedded payments platform, which lets banks issue corporate cards and automate expense reporting using artificial intelligence tools, the companies said in a release. The move shows how some banks are choosing to partner with fintech firms rather than building their own platforms to keep up with clients' evolving technology expectations. Fifth Third is in the process of acquiring Comerica, a deal expected to make it the ninth largest U.S. bank with about $288 billion in assets. "Our partnership with Brex is a commitment to redefine how companies leverage financial technology," Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence said in a statement. "By combining the strength of a leading bank with Brex's AI-driven innovation, we're creating intelligent solutions that simplify complexity, drive efficiency and enable businesses to scale globally with confidence."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A New York federal judge on Tuesday ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials and other documents related to the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite convicted in 2021 of procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Paul Engelmayer's order came at the request of the Department of Justice, which cited the Epstein Files Transparency Act that Congress passed last month. The act mandates that the DOJ disclose investigative material about Epstein, a former friend of President Donald Trump who killed himself in jail in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term for her conviction. Grand jury materials are normally permanently sealed by law. Because of that, Engelmayer denied the DOJ's initial request over the summer to unseal grand jury materials in Maxwell's case. In his order on Tuesday, the judge noted that the Epstein files "Act does not explicitly refer to grand jury materials." Englemayer's order authorizes the DOJ to publicly disclose grand jury transcripts and exhibits, as well as extensive material that federal prosecutors disclosed to Maxwell's defense attorneys for her 2021 criminal trial. But he also modified a protective order in the case to put in place a mechanism "to protect victims from the inadvertent release of materials ... that would identify them or otherwise invade their privacy." It is not clear when the DOJ will release the material covered by Engelmayer's order. The public is not likely to learn much, if anything, new about Epstein or Maxwell from the unsealed grand jury material. "The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor," Englemayer wrote in August when he rejected the DOJ's first bid to unseal the material. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes," the judge had written. "They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. "In its two rounds of applications to this Court to disclose records, DOJ, although paying lip service to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims, has not treated them with the solicitude they deserve," Engelmayer wrote. "In applying on November 24, 2025 for leave to release records pursuant to the Act, DOJ again acted without notice to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims," the judge wrote. "The Court ... were compelled again to direct DOJ forthwith to notify these victims of its latest motion, and to set a deadline for victims' submissions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Johnny C. Taylor, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, was heading to the trade group's annual holiday party on December 5 when he received bad news. In a video sent to SHRM staff, Taylor described learning that a Colorado jury had just hit the organization with an $11.5 million verdict in an employee discrimination and retaliation case. SHRM said in a LinkedIn post that it plans to file an appeal "to the highest courts in the land," a response that has since drawn more than 100 comments, many of them critical. "An $11.5 million verdict doesn't happen in a vacuum; it reflects patterns, dismissed concerns, and a lack of internal accountability," one user wrote. "We understand the heightened attention surrounding this case because SHRM exists to advance workplace excellence. A verdict like this can create questions, and we take those concerns seriously," SHRM spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in a statement to Business Insider. We maintain that the defendant in this case was not discriminated against." Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Mohamed, whose lawyers have said she is Black and Egyptian, was awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages by the jury. The largest such verdict in Westlaw's dataset was less than $7 million. The size of the verdict "is a staggering figure" for an employee-discrimination case, said Allison Williard, an employment lawyer with Washienko Law Group in Boston. The extraordinary award likely speaks to the jurors' understanding of how SHRM brands itself as an expert in HR best practices, Williard added. "SHRM, of all organizations, really should have known better." In September, SHRM asked the court to bar Mohamed from introducing evidence or argument that the organization is a specialist in HR best practices. US District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher later denied SHRM's request, saying its "asserted expertise in human resources is integral to the circumstances of this case and cannot reasonably be excluded." The jury deliberated for about four and a half hours before delivering its verdict, said Ariel DeFazio, one of Mohamed's lawyers. Court records show that jurors sent one note, asking two questions: "Who receives punitive damages AND is there a formula or max value for punitive damages?" Describing the verdict as "mind-blowing," this person said they worry the chapter could lose both members and sponsors — sources of income that local affiliates need to survive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A C-130 aircraft transporting 11 Nigerian servicemen is reportedly being detained in Burkina Faso following accusations of airspace violation. This information was disclosed by the state-run news agency Agence d'Information du Burkina in a joint statement published by the Alliance of Sahel States. “An aircraft belonging to the Air Force of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, type C-130, was forced to land today in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, following an in-flight emergency situation while it was operating in Burkinabe airspace,” the statement read partly. Some reports suggest that the Alliance, which comprises Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, is considering taking action against the Nigerian soldiers for what the country considers a violation. This incident is coming just days after Nigeria launched airstrikes against coup plotters in the West African state of Benin. On Sunday, the Nigerian government disclosed that its fighter jets and ground forces helped Benin's army thwart an attempted coup in Cotonou. According to a statement published by Nigeria's presidential spokesperson, Bayo Onanuga, the Benin administration, through a Note Verbale, requested that Nigeria deploy fighter jets to safeguard its airspace and expel soldiers led by Colonel Pascal Tigri, who had seized the national television station and announced the suspension of democratic institutions. General Olufemi Oluyede, Nigeria's Chief of Defence Staff, announced that all demands were fulfilled, with Nigerian ground soldiers now operating in Benin only on missions approved by Beninese authorities. Within hours, loyal forces, aided by Nigeria, reclaimed the national broadcaster and put down the coup attempt.
