                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Men's National Team star Christian Pulisic channeled his inner Michael Jordan against Torino in Serie A, battling through a fever to score twice off the bench, securing a comeback win which keeps the Rossoneri at the top of the table. Having missed Milan's recent 1-0 win at home to Lazio after suffering another minor muscular issue, Pulisic was named to the bench by head coach Massimiliano Allegri for their trip to relegation-battling Torino on Monday. With Milan having gone 2-0 down within 20 minutes, midfielder Adrien Rabiot was able to stem the bleeding after 24 minutes, long before Pulisic was introduced in the 66th minute for Davide Bartesaghi. Pulisic is now tied with Inter Milan's Lautaro Martínez as the league's top scorer with seven goals, while his nine goals across 12 games in all competitions are also a team high. This also means the American now has 12 league goals this calendar year for the first time in his trophy-laden career, via Bleacher Report - perfect timing with the 2026 FIFA World Cup just six months away. However, it seems Pulisic wasn't just working his way back from a muscular issue on Monday, telling reporters post-game that two days prior he had been managing a 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) fever. The American told Sky, via Milan News, “Two days ago I was truly dead, today I felt much better. Pulisic added, of what has already been an injury and illness-interrupted season, “It was a little strange. The team is doing very well this year. With Allegri suspended for the game, it was down to his assistant, Marco Landucci, to speak with reporters post-game, saying, via Milan News, “When you win with difficulty, it's even more beautiful. Pulisic had a fever of 39 the other day, and he was crucial to today's victory.” Milan is looking to defend its crown from last season, when it beat Inter 3-2 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Therefore, FIFA announced earlier this week that every match during the World Cup will feature three-minute hydration breaks in each half. These breaks will essentially turn matches into four quarters, which is something we Americans are more used to in other sports. The game clock will not be stopped for the mandatory hydration breaks, but instead added on in stoppage time of each half. FIFA President Gianni Infantino arrives on the red carpet ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw  (Brian Snyder-Reuters via Imagn Images) FIFA say it is "a streamlined and simplified version of the breaks used at some previous tournaments, including the FIFA Club World Cup 2025." Covered stadiums such as AT&T Stadium in Texas and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will, of course, be temperature-controlled, but to make all things fair, matches played inside those buildings will also include mandatory water breaks. While one might argue that the best, most fit soccer players from nations around the world should be able to compete for two 45-minute halves without stoppages for water, temperatures could reach over 100 degrees in certain cities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi has been named Landon Donovan MLS MVP for the second straight season. Messi capped his season by winning MLS Cup last weekend, delivering two assists and earning MLS Cup MVP as Inter Miami lifted the first league title in club history. That performance was the final chapter of a dominant year in which Messi also collected his second straight Landon Donovan MLS MVP award, becoming the first player in league history to win it in back-to-back seasons. Across the 2025 regular season, Messi produced 48 goal contributions (29 goals and 19 assists) in 28 matches, the second-highest total ever recorded, and averaged 1.78 goal involvements per 90 minutes, a mark only surpassed by his own 2.18 from 2024. Messi set multiple league records during the campaign. He became the first MLS player to record 10 multi-goal games in one season and generated at least three goal contributions in nine different matches. He also scored multiple goals in five consecutive games from late May through mid-July, the longest multi-goal streak in MLS history. Over his MLS career, he now has two MVP awards, two Best XI selections, two All-Star selections, a Golden Boot, 12 Player of the Matchday honors, and five Player of the Month awards. Messi's season resulted in a landslide MVP vote. He secured 70.43 percent of the total ballot, finishing comfortably ahead of Anders Dreyer, with Denis Bouanga, Evander, and Sam Surridge rounding out the top five. The only other two-time winner is former Kansas City Wizards midfielder Preki, who collected MVP honors in 1997 and 2003. Despite Messi's brilliance, Miami's season was anything but smooth. They were eliminated from the CONCACAF Champions Cup by Vancouver, lost to Seattle in the Leagues Cup final, and failed to defend their Supporters' Shield title.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland have had similarly sensational starts to the 2025-26 season. Based on goal contributions alone, Mbappe has the edge — with his 25 goals and four assists in 21 matches for Real Madrid ahead of Haaland's 20 and three in 20 games with Manchester City. Mbappe has scored 57 per cent of Madrid's 44 goals in La Liga and the Champions League, while Haaland, after a fast start, has received more help but has still contributed 44 per cent of City's 45 goals so far in Europe and the Premier League. Goals that lift teams up from losing or drawing game-states have greater weight. Across domestic and Champions League action, Mbappe and Haaland each have scored nine times when their teams have trailed or been level in matches, more than any other player across Europe's top five domestic leagues. Haaland has yet to score from the spot for City, missing his only attempt in November's 3-0 win against Liverpool. When you take national-team stats into the equation, Haaland's total of 13 goals and three assists for Norway in five matches over this season's three international breaks comfortably clears Mbappe's still impressive five and three in four games for France. Haaland's goals have come from 43 efforts on target and 77 in total (56 per cent accuracy). Mbappe's shot accuracy is slightly lower at 48 per cent, but his goals have come from 51 shots on target. But 35 per cent of his goal attempts in the Premier League this season have been headers, with only Bournemouth's Evanilson (41 per cent), Nick Woltemade of Newcastle United (40) and Tottenham Hotspur's Richarlison (39) boasting a higher share. The leap he has taken is down to his positioning. Watch his 2025-26 highlights and many of his goals are a result of starting at the far post and sprinting to the penalty spot or near post, generating momentum before shooting. That has helped improve his heading game, too, and City are feeding him more than ever while embracing a more direct and vertical approach. Haaland's acceleration is not only impressive in short spurts but over longer distances, and manager Pep Guardiola has found ways to tap into this as well. As Josko Gvardiol pauses in possession, Haaland notices Phil Foden attracting Eric Dier's attention and is alert to the growing space between the Monaco centre-backs. As Dier steps up towards Foden, Haaland sprints in behind to meet Gvardiol's pass over the top. The City striker then shows incredible dexterity to lob goalkeeper Philipp Kohn. Mbappe's achievements are admirable given the tactical shift Madrid have taken under new head coach Xabi Alonso this season. In 2024-25, Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid were an expansive side built around maximising the strengths of their stars, rather than on savvy tactical foundations. Mbappe and Vinicius Junior posed a massive threat when Madrid played at pace, but that pair's lack of work out of possession was punished by elite teams in a trophyless campaign for the Spanish giants. Alonso has reduced the randomness of Madrid's game, preferring structured possession in central areas instead. Their tempo has been much more measured under him, with long spells of possession. Mbappe is playing the No 9 role better than ever. He is working harder out of possession and in attack. Goals against Barcelona and Atletico Madrid came from such runs. In the series of images below, against Valencia last month, he changes direction well on the fly to hook Arda Guler's cross home with his weaker foot. Madrid and Mbappe have looked at their best when they have been able to raise the pace, due to the profiles in their squad. In 16 La Liga matches under Alonso, he has scored just once from such situations. Thirty-one per cent of his shots in La Liga have been from outside the box, the fourth-highest among centre-forwards with 900 or minutes in Europe's top five leagues. By contrast, 97 per cent of Haaland's shots have come from inside the opposition box, the second highest across Europe's top five leagues, behind Joaquin Panichelli of French side Strasbourg. Haaland is averaging 24.2 touches per 90, of which 9.6 are in the attacking third. More importantly, his 7.1 touches per 90 in the opposition penalty area suggests that in City's current setup, he is very much the old-fashioned No 9, jostling with defenders, winning aerial duels and dominating the box, with limited activity outside it. Mbappe is averaging 54.6 touches per 90 in La Liga, marginally higher than the 53.9 from 2024-25. As his activity map from Madrid's past six league matches shows, he often spends time out wide and away from the penalty area. He averages 3.3 chances created per 90 across La Liga and the Champions League, with Haaland some distance behind on 0.5. However, he has three assists so far to the Frenchman's four. The Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry over the previous decade often saw one player's case bettered based on how he performed in games where the two of them were head-to-head in meetings between their respective clubs, even if that lacked nuance. Round two went to Mbappe in last season's Champions League play-offs in February, when he led Madrid with their opening goal in a 3-2 win at the Etihad, despite Haaland twice giving City the lead on the night. An injured Haaland missed the return a week later, in which Mbappe got a hat-trick as the defending European champions went through 6-3 on aggregate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His sobering conclusion: "It was the worst 20 minutes of my life." A Manchester United legend, that quote sums up Bet's rebellious attitude towards football, and life in general. Best was at the height of his career in '69. A year earlier, he had led United to their first European Cup, was the top scorer in England and won the Ballon d'Or. But as prolific as Best was a producing spectacular dribbles, countless goals and important titles on the pitch, he was just as prominent when it came to partying, drinking and undertaking in affairs off it. At the time, his dazzling double-life as a football star and bon vivant was going well – but it would soon come to an end. When he was 15 years old, he was discovered by Manchester United scout Bob Bishop, who wrote to the club's manager, Matt Busby: "I think I've found a genius." Best made his debut for United in 1963 at the age of 17 and quickly formed the most dangerous attack in the country alongside Denis Law and Bobby Charlton. Dubbed 'The Holy Trinity', Best, Law and Charlton have since been immortalised as statues outside Old Trafford. United won the league in 1965 and 1967 before, in 1968 – exactly 10 years after Munich – they won their long-awaited first European Cup. Best had long been more than just a footballer. His sporting achievements, coupled with his rebellious lifestyle, infamous escapades, long hair and catchphrases, exuded a very special magic. He was one of the world's first football celebrities, 'the fifth Beatle', a true sensation. Emerging from the somewhat socially rigid early-1960s, he, like many rockstars, stood for the dawn of a new era. "If you gave me the choice between scoring a goal from 40 yards at Anfield or going to bed with Miss World, it would be a tough decision," Best once said. Another of his memorable one-liners went: "I spent most of my money on alcohol, women and fast cars. The European Cup victory proved to be his last major title, as his priorities shifted further and further away from sport and into nightlife. Far too early in his career, football became a secondary concern for Best despite his ridiculous levels of talent. Best would repeatedly turn up drunk for training, and in 1972, United coach Tommy Docherty suspended him. Two years later, at the age of just 27, Best played his final game for United. He even spent the Christmas of 1984 in prison after driving while intoxicated before getting into an altercation with a police officer. In 2002, he received a liver transplant, but continued to drink, and in November 2005, Best died of multiple organ failure at the age of just 57. In Manchester and in his hometown, people still say today: "[Diego] Maradona good, Pele better, George Best."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's football chief has labelled the World Cup game chosen by organisers as an LGBTQ ‘Pride Match' as an ‘irrational move'. Iran's football chief has objected to the “irrational” branding of its World Cup 2026 match against Egypt, which local organisers in the United States have suggested will be held in support of the LGBTQ community. The organising committee in Seattle, Washington state, where the match is scheduled to take place next year, had previously announced their intention to hold a “Pride Match” coinciding with the northwestern city's Pride Weekend in late June. Following last week's FIFA tournament draw, Egypt and Iran are now slated to face off in Seattle on June 26, the Friday before. The head of Iran's Football Federation, Mehdi Taj, was quoted by local news agency ISNA as saying Tehran and Cairo had both raised “objections against the issue”, which he labelled an “irrational move that supports a certain group”. On Monday, Iranian state television said Tehran would “appeal” against FIFA over the matter. Homosexuality is illegal in Iran and can be punishable by death. The Egyptian Football Association has voiced similar objections, according to local media reports citing unnamed sources. On Tuesday, Taj said some Iranian players might face visa problems over their service in the Iranian military, which includes the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – designated a “terrorist organisation” by the US in 2019. Iran is drawn in Group G with Belgium, Egypt and New Zealand in the 39-day tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19.</p>

And as he reflected a little on what awaits him in June (and hopefully July) next year, the Milan winger would have surely felt that tingling in his stomach. Because that draw, with no major obstacle likely until a possible meeting with Belgium in the round of 16, sets the stage perfectly for Pulisic for what could be the summer of his life. It creates the ideal stage for him to make the defining run of his career and transition from being merely a U.S. soccer star to a true, mainstream American sports superstar. The stakes are absolutely colossal for him in 2026. If Milan manages to win Serie A and he maintains his current form – two more goals Monday have him atop the league's scoring chart – it's near-certain he would be named Serie A Player of the Year. Carrying that momentum into a World Cup on home soil, the expectations would be that he would take his team on a thrilling adventure. If he can be the hero for the USMNT on home soil, in a World Cup, the opportunities that will open up for him in terms of his reputation, commercial appeal and marketability will be enormous. In this sport, that means the World Cup. Soccer fans know winning Serie A would earn Pulisic respect throughout the game and adoration in Italy, but it still wouldn't make him a household name in America. Bringing people to their feet in stadiums, fan zones and bars across America next summer? That would catapult Pulisic to true Captain America status. Traps can be set and challenges get tougher just from those plastic balls pulled out on stage. Group D isn't easy – almost no group that could be imagined for a team like the USMNT in the modern game can truly be considered that way. Yet when you compare it with, say, 2014, when the USA was dealt a group stage with Germany, Portugal and Ghana (and no progression for third place in that edition) and was written off by many international commentators, you realize that it is a setting that offers Mauricio Pochettino's team every chance of advancing. In the past, he felt pressure, having to do too much and dropping into parts of the field he didn't need to, which took away from his game. He has made it clear that this is not a squad with a Messi-like player and he is setting up the system so that there are several attacking players with responsibility to be creative forces. There is Malik Tillman, Sergiño Dest, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and, in the right circumstances, Gio Reyna. Folarin Balogun is expected to deliver goals and Ricardo Pepi and Haji Wright will be waiting for the chance if he doesn't deliver. But let's be clear: there's a big difference between paper and performance. There isn't an absolute minnow in the group, the kind of opponent that teams look to boost their goal difference. Every game will be competitive, featuring teams that are cut from the same cloth as Wales and Iran from four years ago — tough, resilient, and hard to break down. But none of these three opponents possesses the game-breaking individual brilliance of a Kylian Mbappé, a Lamine Yamal, or an Erling Haaland, who can ruin your perfect game plan by beating three guys and scoring out of nowhere. In terms of individual star power, even if Turkey and exciting Real Madrid rising force Arda Güler make it through the playoff, Pulisic is top of the tree in this group. Still, the team's tactical planning must be spot on for each opponent. Paraguay is a side that is defensively stout, resilient and comfortable sitting deep in a mid-block and playing on the counter. What is needed are players who can break down that deep block. This is where a number of players, such as a healthy Reyna or Tillman, are vital, as they are creative, can force defenses out, and open up space for runners like Balogun or Pulisic in behind. Players such as Balogun, Weah, and hopefully a healthy Antonee Robinson, who thrive in transition, will be absolutely necessary in that game. Australia relies on work rate, physicality and set pieces to make up for any difference in quality, which reminds me a little bit of how the U.S. team used to play. If Turkey makes it out of the UEFA Path C playoff and into the tournament, they will be a tough team to beat, but their defense can be vulnerable to pace and there are ways to get past them. One factor not to be discounted is home-field advantage. If the U.S. is playing its best, and with full stadiums of American supporters pushing them on, they will feel that they can run through walls. If that task is navigated, the pathway opens up beautifully. Next would be a third-place team in the round of 32. They are a good team, but you would still take Belgium 10 times out of 10 over facing alternatives such as France, England, Spain, or Portugal. Morocco showed in 2022 that a team can go deep by being cohesive, and the U.S. now has the quality and a world-class coach to deliver something special. Pochettino has taken a massive step by setting the team's mentality and unity, reminding the players that there are no guarantees for anyone. The Argentine must now start to deal with ideas for different opponents and game situations, focusing on whether the plan is high-pressing, playing on the front foot, or dropping deep to protect a lead. Pochettino has to deliver top game plans that expose opponents, similar to how Bob Bradley was able to neutralize the midfield source of Xavi and Xabi Alonso against Spain in the 2009 Confederations Cup. There are four friendlies scheduled before the opening game against Paraguay on June 12 in Los Angeles. The March 28 game against Belgium in Atlanta takes on a new tone given the draw, and it will be interesting to see if the two coaches are wary of showing their hand against potential World Cup opponents. The USMNT has been dealt a good hand by the draw, but as any poker player knows, it's how you play 'em that counts. You need something special to go far at a World Cup, and watching Pulisic add to his tremendous season with two more goals on Monday gave me that feeling that we have an ace in hand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now that the USMNT knows it will face Australia, Paraguay and one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Türkiye or Romania, the planning can well and truly start for the tournament. At the same time, manager Mauricio Pochettino can start eyeing players to best fit those opponents. This weekend saw the 2025 MLS season wrap up with Inter Miami capturing their first MLS Cup title and ensuring no USMNT players got their hands on the trophy—Sebastian Berhalter, Tristan Blackmon and Brian White all playing for the runners-up Vancouver Whitecaps. Over in Europe though, the success continued for American players who are looking to impress in order to crack the 26-player roster. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Caught in a relegation battle at the bottom of the Bundesliga, Augsburg upset fourth-place Bayer Leverkusen 2–0 and fellow American Malik Tillman, with Banks helping to secure the clean sheet as part of a back three.Likely a name to follow for the 2030 World Cup instead of 2026, he led the match by winning eight duels, while also completing five passes into the final third. Ricardo Pepi got back-to-back starts for PSV Eindhoven for the first time in months and continued his recent run of form with a goal in the 2–0 win over Heerenveen. He now has five goals across 511 minutes in the Dutch top flight this season, and seems to have reestablished himself as a reliable option for the squad alongside Guus Til. With some good form, Pepi will hope to stay in the role for the remainder of the season and head into his likely World Cup inclusion in good form. Fellow American Sergiño Dest also played and helped keep the clean sheet. Josh Sargent's stock in the USMNT striker race has fallen since the 2022 World Cup, and if he wants to make his way into the squad for 2026, he'll need to score a few more goals. The American striker snapped a 14-game goalless drought with a goal in a 3–2 loss to Watford in the Championship, bringing him to six goals and three assists in 19 matches this season.Sargent wasn't in the USMNT's October or November rosters, but could find his way into the March friendlies, which serve as the final tests before the pre-World Cup window in June. The second-best moment for USMNT players this weekend came from Gio Reyna, even though he did not have a groundbreaking performance. Reyna, who scored in his November return to the USMNT, played 68 minutes against St. Pauli and three days later, started again in a 1–0 win over last-place Mainz on Friday, where he played 69 minutes and won five of eight duels. One of the most skilled players in the USMNT picture, Reyna will hope to establish himself as a regular starter through December and into the new year, with the aim to not only crack Pochettino's squad but also start. SUPER SUB CHRISTIAN PULISIC DELIVERS FOR MILAN 💪A BRACE IN JUST 10 MINUTES ⚽⚽ pic.twitter.com/oou5nSxktu Christian Pulisic continued his outstanding season with AC Milan on Monday, coming off the bench to score a match-winning brace in a 3–2 win over TorinoPulisic now has 13 league goals for the Rossoneri in 2025, the most he has managed in a single calendar year in his club career, and a number he can extend with three weeks left in 2025. Averaging a goal every 64 minutes in Serie A, it has been an exceptional run for Pulisic in the first half of the 2025-26 campaign and he will look to carry that form into the summer and the World Cup. “Two days ago I was dead in bed, but I felt much better today and I am very happy I came here and was able to help the team,” Pulisic told Sky Sport Italia after the game, having suffered several setbacks this season.

World Cup matches at the 2026 tournament will have three-minute hydration breaks midway through each half regardless of the weather conditions, FIFA has said.

Referees will stop games 22 minutes into each half so players can rehydrate, soccer's global governing body added in a statement.

FIFA said the new rule will streamline and simplify the previous rules, which required cooling breaks 30 minutes into each half when the temperature at kickoff exceeded 31 C.

“For every game, no matter where the games are played, no matter if there's a roof, (or) temperature-wise, there will be a three-minute hydration break,” said Manolo Zubiria, the World Cup's chief tournament officer in the United States.

“Obviously, if there's an injury at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” he added in a meeting with broadcasters in Washington.

Excessive heat raised concerns during this year's Club World Cup held in the U.S., with several matches kicking off in the afternoon amid high temperatures.

A report published in September by Football for the Future, Common Goal and Jupiter Intelligence found 10 of the 16 venues for the World Cup, taking place in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are at very high risk of extreme heat stress conditions.

“The use of hydration breaks is part of a focused attempt to ensure the best possible conditions for players, drawing upon the experiences of previous tournaments, including the recent FIFA Club World Cup,” FIFA added in Sunday's statement.
