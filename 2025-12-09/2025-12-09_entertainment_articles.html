                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: With her time on Pandora coming to end with Avatar: Fire and Ash bowing this month, Sigourney Weaver may already have another high-profile property in her sights. While a deal has not closed, sources tell Deadline that she is in talks to join the upcoming Tomb Raider series for Prime Video. Sophie Turner is set to star as Lara Croft, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge on as writer and executive producer. Prime Video had no comment on the Weaver news. It is unknown who Weaver would play. The series, from Story Kitchen, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM, is also executive produced by Crystal Dynamics; Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins through Wells Street Productions; Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson through Story Kitchen; Michael Scheel; Hodge; and Legendary Television. If a deal closes, it will mark another high-profile project Weaver can add to her career that started with Alien and continued on with box office smash hits that include Avatar. She can be seen next in Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in the record-setting James Cameron franchise that bows December 19. Next year she will appear in Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu. She also has the Bryan Fuller pic Dust Bunny, which opens this weekend. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The singer also described how sweet and supportive her musical hero Whitney Houston was during a Tuesday (Dec. 9) chat on the "Jennifer Hudson Show." “Whitney Houston said she loved your voice, one of the greatest voices that she knows,” Hudson told Aguilera of the high praise she received from the late R&B/pop superstar who died in 2012 at age 48. Selena Gomez Says She's 'Forever Honored' After Scoring Golden Globe Nod for Fourth Year in a Row Hudson said she had to second that emotion, and the holiday cheer kept a-rollin' as Xtina bounced the compliment right back to the Oscar- and Grammy-winning host, who wondered what Aguilera remembered about meeting Houston. “She was always just always so kind and just down to earth and it's so wonderful when you get to meet an icon of yours,” Aguilera said of Houston, who she studied and was fascinated with growing up. Aguilera recalled bumping into Houston once backstage at a European MTV awards show where the “I Will Always Love You” singer came right up to her and said, “‘how you doin' girl?' When Aguilera casually mentioned that time she sang Whitney's “Run to You” at a 2001 BET Awards tribute to Houston — a moment Hudson said she remembered with crystal clarity — she praised her mentor's generosity and kindness. Hudson wasn't there to just talk old times, though. She also pressed Aguilera — who hasn't released  an album of new material since her second Spanish language LP, 2022's Aguilera — on whether she has any unreleased music in the vault. “I'm not like someone that's just like, ‘Oh let me just keep pumping it out,'” said the singer who dropped 2018's Liberation LP after an six-year gap following 2012's Lotus. I'm a message girl and I really like to absorb what's happening in the world, things that are really moving me and affecting people to really put thought into it,” Aguilera said, promising that her untitled next album will be a “really personal project” that will tie-in with an equally personal documentary she's been filming for the past few years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The golden-voiced singer was revered by fans and fellow artists for both his songwriting and extraordinary pipes, and he was honored, in absentia, with the American Eagle Award from the National Music Council of the United States during a tribute show on Friday in Nashville. Music has been the guiding force of my entire life. It carried me from my Cuban American childhood in Miami to stages across the world. It introduced me to my brothers, the Mavericks. It gave me a home in Nashville, Tennessee. It allowed me to raise my three incredible sons, Dino, Vincent, and Max, who are my greatest pride and joy. I've always believed that music is one of the most powerful bridges we have. It crosses cultures, politics, (and God, don't we need that right now?) But on the hardest of days, music remained my companion. I accept this award with profound gratitude and with the hope that the music we create continues to inspire, to heal and bring people together. This past September, he announced the cancer had spread to his brain. Raul Malo, Golden-Voiced ‘Maestro' of the Mavericks, Dead at 60 Jimmy Kimmel Responds to Trump Calling Him a ‘Horrible' Host: ‘I'm Starting to Think He Might Have a Crush on Me' Gifted with one of music's most robust and dynamic voices, Malo was known as “El Maestro” among his bandmates and fans. His singing style, powerful and emotive, had the ability to both stun an audience into silence and spur them to their feet. And with world-class musicians behind him, including Malo's co-founders in the group, bassist Robert Reynolds and drummer Paul Deakin, the Mavericks earned a reputation as the most eclectic and entertaining of performers. “If you ask 10 different people what the Mavericks mean to them, you're going to get 10 different answers,” Malo told Rolling Stone in 2015. Then you're going to hear the next song, and go, ‘Holy shit, this band is nothing like that song that I just heard. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madonna is setting out to prove that she's the OG diva. With a series of photos posted to her Instagram on Sunday, the singer wrote, “A Good Week for Divas…….💕💘🌸 👛🎀,” while wearing an all-pink look. The outfit consisted of a pale pink satin corset, bra top, lingerie-inspired skirted bottom, and a pink fur jacket thrown over her shoulder. On each arm was a long opera-length fingerless lace glove. She wore nude fishnet fights and shaded sunglasses to complete the throwback ensemble. The look immediately recalls Madonna's style during her “Blond Ambition” tour era in 1990. The habitual cone bra wearer pulled out her pale pink Jean Paul Gaultier corset top, which she originally wore with black tights and her short, curly, blond bob. Madonna is currently preparing for her latest album, set for release in 2026, as she returns to Warner Records nearly 20 years after departing the label. It will be produced by DJ Stuart Price, who worked on “Confessions on a Dance Floor,” suggesting that her homecoming project will be another high-energy record. Here's hoping that she continues to pay tribute to her legacy with more cone bras and corseted looks during her next musical era.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Margo may have money problems, but she's lousy with movie stars, at least according to our first look at the new Apple TV series from David E. Kelly, Margo's Got Money Troubles. Returning to television following the cancellation of The Great, Elle Fanning (Predator: Badlands and Sentimental Value) stars as Margo, the titular fiscally troubled young woman, as she tries to make ends meet, alongside a cast that includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Nicole Kidman, Nick Offerman, Marcia Gay Harden, and Greg Kinnear. Produced by A24 for Apple TV, Margo's Got Money Troubles is Kelley's follow-up to last summer's hit mystery, Presumed Innocent, currently in production for season two. Margo takes on a slightly more comedic tone, following a young woman who has an affair with a professor, gets pregnant, and uses her estranged father's (Offerman) pro-wrestling skills to make a killing on OnlyFans. Margo's Got Money Troubles is a bold, heartwarming, and comedic family drama following recent college dropout and aspiring writer, Margo (Fanning), the daughter of an ex-Hooter's waitress (Pfeiffer) and ex-pro wrestler, as she's forced to make her way with a new baby, a mounting pile of bills and a dwindling amount of ways to pay them. Based on Rufi Thorpe's bestseller, the eight-episode first season of Margo's Got Money Troubles premieres on April 15, 2026, with three episodes, with two new episodes streaming every Wednesday through May 20.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert are expecting their first child any day now, and the couple could not be more excited. The “Dancing with the Stars” judge and his lovely wife Erbert opened up about something deeply personal in an Instagram post on October 15. Their decision to open up about the loss of a prior pregnancy was to help raise awareness for miscarriage around Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month. “We share this part of our story to honor our baby that never made it earthside,” they wrote in the caption of a moving video. Hough and Erbert have shared some aspects of their journey into parenthood with fans, but they have chosen to keep other personal details private. They have chosen not to publicly reveal their baby's gender, name, or date of birth. However, they have dropped subtle clues about when Erbert is due to give birth. “I'm going to Chicago, and it's very exciting because it's for Ovation, but also very nervous because this baby could literally come any day,” he said in the video, before showing Erbert and her baby bump. She has been on an incredible journey to recovery since, and Hough has been with her every step of the way. In an Instagram post on December 6, she reflected on her strength and how proud she is of herself for overcoming so much. She posted a black-and-white photo of herself with her baby bump. In the caption, she wrote a lengthy message, part of which reads, “I'm truly grateful for it all, and so incredibly proud of myself and my body for everything it has endured. What a miracle it is that two years ago I was fighting for my life… and now, here I am creating life.” This includes Hough, who is incredibly proud of his wife and has publicly praised her. Watching her navigate this pregnancy with such grace, calm, and strength is one of the most beautiful experiences of my life,” he wrote. When they post about their baby, fans, celebrities, and loved ones flood the comment section with messages of support. “Hayley and Derek are such a beautiful match. They are the perfect combination of creativity and strength, and they give so much love to each other and the people in their lives,” she told People on November 14, around the time of their baby shower. “Britt (Stewart), Jess (Gee) and I knew we needed to throw them the most beautiful shower to honor them and their greatest creation yet.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

Fan-captured videos shared on social media show Johnson Wen, 26, being escorted out of SunCorp Stadium Tuesday, Dec. 9. Wen turned to face them all with a smile. Wen, who calls himself “Pyjama Man,” posted on Instagram after, “Got kicked out of Lady Gaga concert. A fan who witnessed the encounter wrote on X, “Many finger snaps to the girl in EE [early entry] who got security and gave them a description of that fuckin weirdo so they could legit just wait for his stupid disguise to try to get in. Actual mental help is needed for that man.” Raul Malo, Golden-Voiced ‘Maestro' of the Mavericks, Dead at 60 Jimmy Kimmel Responds to Trump Calling Him a ‘Horrible' Host: ‘I'm Starting to Think He Might Have a Crush on Me' After grabbing Grande in Singapore, he was charged with being a public nuisance, detained in prison for nine days, and subsequently deported from Singapore back to Australia, where he lives. Wen's social media posts often attempt to reframe these incidents as normal fan encounters. “I feel like I'm in a dream, that's my best friend Ariana Grande,” Wen said in an Instagram Story uploaded prior to the red carpet attack.

Monroe is well known to horror fans for his extremely brutal — and extremely effective — 2010 remake of the exploitation classic “I Spit on Your Grave,” but he never set out to be associated with any particular genre. Related Stories The Costumes of ‘I Love LA' Are in Love with Many Different LAs The ‘Chad Powers' Team Had One Football Season to Bring Their Show to Life Although Monroe spent the first several years of his career directing mostly horror and sci-fi, he eventually got the chance to show off his own versatility by wading into a category that's about as far from “I Spit on Your Grave” as you can get: a Hallmark Channel rom-com. Monroe is not alone: There are at least a half-dozen established horror filmmakers who moonlight as TV Christmas movie writers and directors. According to writer and director Michael Varrati, who splits his time between horror films (“A Halloween Trick,” “What's Left Inside”) and TV movies (“A Christmas in Vermont,” “Christmas with a Crown”), scary movies and cozy Christmas fare made for Hallmark and Lifetime have a lot in common. “They're each different kinds of cult films,” Varrati said. In both cases, the audience suspends their disbelief in a multitude of ways so they can get on board,” he explained. “Most holiday rom-coms, for example, center around some kind of business closing or whatever. No business is going to shut its doors on Christmas Eve; that doesn't happen. But for the mechanics of a story, we believe it. We believe the bakery is gonna close on Christmas unless they get so many cookies sold,” Varrati said, drawing a parallel to horror films and how characters tend to behave less according to logic than the demands of the genre. “There are rules to the slasher genre that we've all culturally agreed to, even though, if there was really a killer running about, none of these things would necessarily apply.” Satisfying audiences by serving up what they craze about horror or light romance dovetails perfectly with Monroe's ambition to be an old-school Hollywood craftsman. “So often people who are new to the world of holiday films will send me a message saying, ‘I'm gonna do one that's different.' Like horror movies, Christmas rom-coms also have their own star system that exists somewhat outside of that of more mainstream theatrical movies. These shared tastes mean that it's not uncommon for people who are dedicated to one genre to have an affinity for another. To that point, Varrati has been surprised to find that many of the horror fans he interacts with at conventions are also fans of Hallmark Christmas movies. “Ultimately, horror fans are looking for things that strike a specific chord that evokes an emotion, and I think the discerning horror spectator can appreciate the heightened reality of how holiday rom-coms present.” Where fans of either genre may deviate is how much leniency they give to filmmakers, specifically. In Monroe's opinion, the internet has made everyone a critic, but holiday movie fans tend to be more forgiving of directors than horror fans, who he said are “hands down the hardest fans on the planet to make happy.” “You are either a hack to them, or they love you and it changes from film to film,” he said, explaining that, while TV Christmas movie fans are more willing to blame the script or the acting, horror lovers “blame the director for literally every single thing they do not like. I have been slammed for things in horror films that I had no say in whatsoever, but what producer is going to step in and say, ‘No, that was me, not the director? That's thanks in no small part to audiences' seemingly endless appetite for heartwarming holiday movies. (Hallmark cranks out around 40 new Christmas movies every year.) But it's also because scoring a hit means exposure to an enormous global audience, between initial network airings, re-runs, and streaming. “On the first Christmas movie that I ever co-wrote, the producer told me, ‘If this hits, it will be seen by more people than anything else you ever do, even if you write a big blockbuster,'” Varrati said. This piece of art that you made is now as much a part of someone's Christmas as drinking eggnog or baking cookies.” That's another parallel between Christmas rom-coms and horror movies, which tend to get rewatched by fans every year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katie Couric is opening up about a meaningful moment from her past and reminding followers to hold their loved ones close. “It made me think that we never really know what lies ahead and it was a reminder to appreciate every day and cherish those you love,” Couric wrote. She also shared that her husband, John Molner, responded warmly to the photo, adding, “He never feels threatened by Jay's memory and understands a heart has space for two people.” Couric closed her message with a simple reminder: “Tell the people who matter to you that you love them… I approve this message.” According to comments on her post, Amanda Kloots wrote, “Always need that reminder and I also approve this message,” while Sheryl Crow added, “Beautiful pic and beautiful message, Katie ❤️.” Couric has remained open about the impact Monahan's passing had on her life. In June, she posted another tribute on what would have been their 36th wedding anniversary, writing that although their time together was cut short, “our love endures, especially in our remarkable daughters.” She added that she misses him “every day, but especially on the important milestones where his absence feels so acute.” The journalist has spoken candidly about their final months together, sharing in past interviews that she struggled with acknowledging the severity of his illness because she wanted to preserve hope. Despite the heartbreak, she has continued to honor Monahan's memory through advocacy, awareness and storytelling. Years after losing Monahan, Couric found love again with Molner, whom she married in 2014. Per People, Couric praised Molner for being her “port in the storm” and for always respecting the space Monahan still holds in her heart. Couric has also remained one of the most visible advocates for cancer screening and early detection. Couric ended her recent Instagram message with a reminder that resonated deeply with her followers: “Be grateful today… appreciate every day and cherish those you love.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Management consulting firm Bain & Co., in a new research report, shares some suggestions and insights. The big-picture takeaway from Bain partners Chris Xanthakis, Nicole Magoon, and Daniel Hong: “Successful companies will invest in premiumization, personalization, and partnerships to draw people back to theaters.” After all: “Audiences haven't abandoned theaters; they need a more compelling reason to go.” Red Sea Film Foundation CEO Faisal Baltyuor On Building an Entertainment Ecosystem in Saudi Arabia Their new report, which was completed before the Netflix deal for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has raised more concerns about the future of cinemagoing, starts off in an ominous way. “For two decades, movie theaters have consistently wrestled with how to get people into seats. “While consumer spending on video streaming subscriptions surged from 2010 through 2024, North American box-office revenue in real terms fell during the same time frame. Ticket prices in real terms are close to flat since 2010, but the cost of a visit has risen as the increase in concessions revenue per patron has outpaced inflation. Major studios, meanwhile, have seen the number of their wide releases remain about a fifth below pre-pandemic levels, filling the resulting gap with films from smaller affiliated studios. All this comes to a head in what Bain dubs the “Flooded Era,” where media is everywhere, with new technologies enabling “a deluge of ‘good enough' content.” In this environment, “anyone can compete, but not everyone can compete profitably,” the consultancy warns. Its key benefits are “immersion, spectacle, and shared experiences,” the Bain report highlights. “But this is at odds with people's evolving consumption of media, which is increasingly short-form, interactive, and digital.” Its recommendations focus on premium experiences, community, personalization, and partnerships. “Industry leaders recognize that, more than ever, cinema must reframe itself as a premium experience, not mere content,” the Bain consultants write. Theaters can deliver on this promise via premium auditoriums, service, and personalization that can't be replicated at home.” “Cinemas can harness community to draw people in,” the company believes. “But great IP and large marketing budgets alone don't guarantee movie success, and they're insufficient” in a world where many a theater seat remains empty. Note the perennial breakout successes of innovative original movies, live streams, and concert films. … In response, we expect more theaters will forge new kinds of partnerships to deliver creative content and innovative formats for customers.” In this context, concert movies and live sports “have shown that there are other ways to draw audiences to movie theaters,” the consultancy highlights. The winning companies will invest in premium, personalized offerings that can't be replicated at home.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No, Gloria Gaynor actually had a “wonderful” meeting with Donald Trump ahead of the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday, Dec. 7, when she was honored alongside Sylvester Stallone, KISS, George Strait, and Broadway legend Michael Crawford. Romeo Santos & Prince Royce Prove 'Better Late Than Never' on Billboard Charts Album -- And It's Coming Sooner Than You Think Gaynor also admitted that Trump didn't reveal exactly why she got the nod, making her the only woman celebrated during its 48th incarnation, “just that he, you know, believed that my song had done so much for so many people.” And through prerecorded videos, he introduced every honoree, ensuring a constant presence throughout the show, whether he was on stage or not. The latest edition will be broadcast on CBS (select Paramount+ customers will also be able to stream the show) on Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT She added, “I mean, really, it's so wonderful to be counted among all these other great artists, and with all of their accomplishments. After Gaynor was announced as an honoree for this year's honors, many fans spoke up asking the artist — who is widely considered a gay icon thanks to her perennial anthem — not to accept the honor or attend the ceremony out of protest for Trump's mistreatment of the LGBTQ+ community. Gaynor has repeatedly declined to define her political affiliations in the past. However, a report from MediasTouch revealed that, according to FEC records, Gaynor donated almost $22,000 to right-wing politicians starting in 2023, including candidates like Mike Johnson, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz and Marsha Blackburn.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While that record's dreamy, digi-orchestral atmospherics sometimes gave way under the weight of re-establishing Coverdale as an album artist, two subsequent projects have scoped out the periphery of her practice and been more compelling for it. As a percussive instrument, once struck, the piano cannot crescendo. On A Series of Actions, Coverdale draws out the vapor trails from each key. Coverdale also foregrounds the material components of her chosen instrument—wood, steel, ivory—and its physical limitations. You can hear her audibly press the sustain pedal into gear on the Ruins-esque “In Charge of the Hour,” while “Lowlands” creates, through what must be a trick of microphone placement, the effect of being positioned below her foot, capturing those distinctive (and familiar, to anyone who took childhood piano lessons) whooshes and creaks. At the climax of “Turning Multitudes,” which by this point has woven a weir out of Ravel, Sakamoto, and Satie, Coverdale seems to reach for a note higher than the highest she can play. A Series of Actions' final chord mirrors the first notes of Changes in Air, but the tone, both timbral and emotional, is warmer, rounder, homier. Each of the album's five movements is arranged to mimic a different elemental substrate, though in what way these building blocks guided Coverdale remains ambiguous without further annotation. A better way to describe opener “Strait of Phrase” would be like sonar suspended in honey, each of its waveform oscillations wide enough to skip rope with. Then again, “Labyrinth 1” possesses a certain sculptural quality, seeming to rotate as if suspended from an invisible string. Changes in Air neatly inverts the structure of its predecessor: where A Series of Actions strewed a sparing few twinkles across a vast empty space, here Coverdale throws open the blinds and floods every nook with light. When different frequencies collide in midair, they form overtones, pitches that can be heard without ever being played. The body of work—which has also included site-specific performances at Berlin's Kraftwerk and Portugal's Braga 25 festival—hums with unexpected resonances. Part the new age haze of From Where You Came to reveal the icicle-sharp A Series of Actions and oaken-tough Changes in Air as individual mechanisms within its intricate machinery. Each arguably surpasses the more “definitive” work because there's no resting on pretty and nowhere to hide. To sit at a piano is to confront head-on the constraints of the body, of only having 10 fingers, two feet, and a finite wingspan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After falling for a bad-faith conservative cancel culture campaign in September, briefly sidelining the late-night host in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Disney has extended Kimmel's contract through May 2027. Per Bloomberg, which first reported on the extension, his contract was initially set to expire in May 2026. The fracas between Kimmel and Disney began when FCC chair Brendan Carr more or less instructed affiliate groups to preempt Kimmel's show after Carr misunderstood and then played right into Kimmel's criticism of the conservative reaction to Kirk's murder. Nexstar Media Group, which is hoping Carr's FCC will approve its $6.2 billion acquisition of its competitor Tenga, and Sinclair Broadcast Group, best known for poisoning public television with hyper-conservative “must run” segments, pulled the show. Both held out longer than ABC, which reinstated Kimmel about a week after suspending him. Eventually, Kimmel returned to Nexstar and Sinclair affiliates as well. To those who canceled their Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions in protest of Disney's knee-jerk decision-making, Mr. Kimmel owes you his gratitude. It turns out that mocking President Trump publicly and not caving to every empty threat is good for ratings—a message we hope NBC hears as the President pressures the FCC to go after Seth Meyers.

Related Stories James Cameron's Biggest Epic Required 1,907 Pages of Music ‘Sound of Falling' Trailer: Mascha Schilinski's Stunning German Oscar Entry Treats Girlhood as Ghost Story This Christmas, Vincent comes back to work with Brewer for the first time since 2011's “Footloose” on “Song Sung Blue,” an exuberant musical about two musicians in love (played by Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson) who attempt to fulfill their dreams by forming a Neil Diamond cover band together. “We started out with this incredible source material,” Vincent said, referring to Greg Kohs' 2009 documentary about the real-life couple on whom “Song Sung Blue” is based. The documentary gave Vincent a baseline of reality on which to build, but it quickly became clear that a gritty vérité style was not going to be appropriate for the film. “You cast movie stars like Hugh and Kate and there becomes an essential need to embellish just because of those movie star faces,” she said. “There was a danger of those movie star faces and a more raw documentary reference being in conflict with each other.” “We had a lot of tiny, manual, human zooms in the movie,” Vincent said. “In the wedding scene, for example, there are these little push-ins on Hugh and Kate. They're manually operated, and it just makes you feel like there's a human being in the room as opposed to a more clinical, mechanical approach.” Whereas earlier in her career Vincent stuck to a more rigorously disciplined approach, she credits the trust that has built between her and Brewer with allowing her to “incorporate tools that I might have avoided before.” The film's early 1990s setting gave Vincent what she called “an extraordinary excuse” to work with the kind of tungsten and incandescent lighting that has fallen out of fashion in the age of LED fixtures. ”My gaffer would say I use more hot lights than anybody he's worked with in a long time,” Vincent said, adding that using fixtures that were from the period was not only aesthetically appropriate but a practical necessity, since for many of the concert sequences the lights were actually visible in the shots. “It allowed me to embrace the Kelvin scale of colors, which I find so pleasing. “Being able to photograph the lights is such a privilege, because you can put the light exactly where it needs to be.” Vincent worked with theatrical lighting designer Christina See, whose experience working with bands like Pearl Jam in the 1990s added to the overall sense of authenticity. “The theatrical part of the movie was treated like a real concert,” Vincent said, noting that she and Brewer looked at footage from Neil Diamond concerts as well as the 1984 Prince vehicle “Purple Rain” — another movie that, like “Song Sung Blue,” utilized gel-covered PAR can stage lights to stunning effect — for inspiration. “Partly because we had to load in and out of the Ritz Theatre in Elizabeth, New Jersey, according to their production schedule.” “It was a triumphant collaboration all the way around,” Vincent said. “I remember Hugh and Kate being there in their civilian clothes for the tech rehearsal, and I overheard Hugh say to Kate, ‘Can you believe we get to do this for a living?' “Song Sung Blue” will be released in theaters on Christmas Day.
