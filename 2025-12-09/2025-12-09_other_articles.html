                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Celebrity confessions don't usually involve ghosts poking around a hotel room in the middle of the night, but Cazzu, the Argentine trap queen known for turning personal stories into powerful lyrics, shared a tale that felt straight out of a supernatural thriller. Touring can be exhausting — the lights, the stage, the adrenaline, the endless interviews — but nothing could've prepared her for what happened when she finally lay down to rest. The singer thought she was in for a peaceful night. During an appearance on the Colombian show La Mega, Cazzu spilled the full story. She explained that the hotel seemed perfectly normal. As she was drifting off to sleep, the curtains decided to go rogue. “And well, night came, and I said ‘How nice, I'm going to sleep.' And suddenly, as I was drifting off, the curtains — which had a button on the wall pretty far away — started opening on their own. “The curtains opened again right in front of him,” the Argentine artist said. So I got up, looked around, and I had left a little light on because… obviously. So I sent a message to Titi, who was nearby, and I said: ‘Titi, are you asleep yet? I think you're going to have to come sleep with me,'” she said. But even with fresh company and a second pair of eyes, the eerie scene repeated itself. “Titi arrived, there was another bed over there, he lay down, said a prayer, everything. And we were falling asleep and suddenly, just when we were about to drift off, it happened again,” she added. To top it off, in the middle of the chaos, Cazzu received a message from a friend. A friend of mine, who has some crazy powers, wrote me: ‘Is everything okay?' And I'm like: ‘Guys, help.' And well, that's my paranormal story,” she concluded. By the end of her retelling, she admitted they didn't sleep at all. Reproduction of this article and its photographs in whole or in part is prohibited, even when citing their source.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cut-offs cut deep and wide, their emotional impact reverberating far beyond the combatants. Find out the answers to these questions and more with Psychology Today. Conspiracy theories circulate so persistently now that they spring easily to mind. The COVID-19 virus, as the malign fantasy goes, did not arise from animal disease reservoirs or from sloppy and risky laboratory processes. Instead, it is a bioweapon devised by evil Chinese geniuses to undermine American hegemony. A future (and soon-to-be ex) congresswoman rode to office on the claim that solar-powered energy weapons engineered by a devious, ancient banking family ignited California wildfires to, now get this, clear the way for a rapid-rail project. Sinister geoengineers have deployed weather-control technology to skew election results. After all, Fu Manchu will stay in the shadows. Even our most penetrating radar arrays cannot detect miniaturized space lasers. Now think, take a leap in faith; controlling the weather is not so hard if you conspire with aliens. We could probe for detail, and of the claimants, call for even a shred of supporting proof. Is it possible to shrink a powerful laser? How is it that we failed to notice the plasma bolts and searing beam blasts? Or what technology could possibly steer a cyclone? Wouldn't direct-mail campaigns better tilt an election? The cleverest conspiratorialists will respond with ever weaker and more elaborate evasions and excuses that mean to turn the tables on a reasonable listener. When pressed, the various claimants will ask, “Can you prove otherwise?” In a thought-piece written in 1952, the British philosopher and mathematician, Bertrand Russell, roguishly explored the resilience of fanciful and unfounded claims. For the crux of his argument, he devised a mischievous analogy. Suppose he were to assert that an ordinary table piece, a china teapot, were circling the sun somewhere between the orbits of Earth and Mars? “Nobody would be able to disprove my assertion,” Russell cautioned, “provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes.” This provision seems to trap the listener, as arguments against the floating teapot are seemingly no stronger than arguments for. For starters, how could we deny the existence of a space-teapot if we can't even find it? Russell pointed out that if the proposition of orbiting extraterrestrial household crockery cannot be disproved, it is still “talking nonsense” to say that it is proven. The same goes for claims of mystery particle beams and elusive super villains. What if, he asked, “the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school?” Non-belief would become a “a mark of eccentricity,” he noted wryly. Russell underlined the obvious, that “it is customary to suppose that, if a belief is widespread, there must be something reasonable in it.” And there lies the danger. What if millions fervently believe that dark, conspiratorial religious forces control our world? What if the claim that meticulously monitored elections can be stolen is drummed by revered rabble-rousers? (A pilfered election has become an article of faith among true believers.) Are we not being asked, insistently, to prove that the unprovable isn't true? The questions Russell raised three-quarters of a century ago pose unresolvable tensions for today. Clinicians still struggle to articulate the difference between delusion and devotion. Delusion, so the DSM holds, comprises fixed preoccupations rooted in extreme, false, overvalued, and harmful belief, individually adhered to and impossible to shake. By contrast, the clinical bible now frames faith generously as shared, sanctioned by tradition, confirmed by culture, bolstering, harmonious with reality, and as the text indicates, also open to doubt. In some fundamentalist corners, apostasy, once a capital crime, is still punished severely. Women still often bear the brunt of oppressive theocracy. Modern observers, for instance, feel hard pressed to distinguish visions and revealed “locutions” from visual and verbal hallucination. And this brings us to a real headache, the chronic kind that beset a 12th-century abbess, Hildegarde of Bingen, likely the composer of exquisite, dreamy medieval chant that church choirs still sing. She is less well known for her compelling art. Her illustrations and diary sketches picture the mystical, floating, draining, cloudlike state that she would fall into. Episodes during which she would hear the voices of angels. For modern explainers, crucially, her compositions feature bursts of intense flashing light, sparking stars, and jagged lines. Reaching back, it is useful to note that Sigmund Freud regarded religion as “wishful thinking”— at best an “illusion” (though the German original is closer to “deception”), and a “universal obsessional neurosis” at worst. “It was forbidden to raise questions of their authenticity,” he wrote. Hopefully, the mystifying would yield to dogged, rational examination. And so, those of us who experience the “fortification hallucinations” of migraine aura—a neon Las Vegas skyline that sizzles nauseatingly over half a visual field—will recognize a fellow, distant sufferer in Saint Hildegarde. Bertrand Russsell, “Is There a God?,” commissioned Illustrated Magazine, unpublished (1952); Oliver Sacks, Migraine (1970); Sigmund Freud, The Future of an Illusion (1927).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump was “fully briefed” on crashed UFOs, non-human bodies, and even alien–human hybrids living secretly among us, according to explosive new claims from whistleblower and retired Air Force Major David Grusch. U.S. President Donald Trump was 'fully briefed' on crashed UFOs, non-human bodies, and even alien–human hybrids living secretly among us, according to explosive new claims from whistleblower and retired Air Force Major David Grusch Grusch - now an advisor to Congress's UAP Task Force and the man who helped ignite Washington's UFO obsession - told Fox News that “members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality”, including the President. He added Trump is “very knowledgeable on this subject”. But Grusch insisted he personally saw classified materials, such as intelligence memos, photographs and data describing non-human bodies. He said Trump was briefed on at least four alien races - including so-called Nordics, who resemble fair-skinned humans and allegedly produced hybrid offspring. As for whether extraterrestrials come in peace, Grusch says the U.S. has observed “a mixed bag of activity”. He suggested: “Could it be because we have interesting genetic material on Earth? Despite once promising to declassify UFO files, Trump has also admitted he's “never been convinced” by alien claims. Still, Grusch believes Trump could become “the most consequential leader in world history” if he decides to go public.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bobby Singer was a beloved figure throughout Supernatural's run and a crucial figure for Sam and Dean specifically. From spending countless hours researching lore for a hunt and listening to Sam and Dean's grievances, Bobby was there through it all. Beyond the Winchesters themselves, Bobby operated a central network for hunters from his home. One specific episode in season 6 gave fans a look behind the curtain at Bobby, demonstrating his position as one of the most vital characters in the world of Supernatural. He had already been established as the father figure and lore expert whom Sam and Dean could rely on at any hour. One aspect of Bobby's character that the episode paints clearly is that he never gets a break from his duties. His job requires him to work and research around the clock with little recognition, and it has worn him down over the years. The central conflict revolves around Bobby as he attempts to reclaim his soul from the recently crowned King of Hell, Crowley. While Bobby tries to bargain with and trap Crowley, Sam and Dean are investigating their own case on the B-side of the episode. Bobby is unsuccessful in his first attempt at forcing Crowley's hand and has to sideline his attempts to help Sam and Dean research their hunt. Characters such as Castiel changed Supernatural's DNA, but Bobby kept the classic hunting thread and monster-of-the-week focus thriving. While aiding Sam and Dean, fans see Bobby simultaneously juggling various cases from other hunters. This one bit of research becomes a comedy of errors as viewers see just how much work it takes Bobby to find the necessary information for a single case. Viewers can see him becoming frustrated by the lack of appreciation, but he still does what needs to be done. Through many investigations, it seems they can handle everything on their own. After Bobby's introduction, it's obvious that's not the case. This episode specifically proves that even the best hunters need a supportive system to stay alive. What stands out about "Weekend at Bobby's" in retrospect is that this is but a single day in Bobby's life. It gives more insight into his generally grumpy nature. Supernatural lasted 15 years due to the strength of the cast as a whole, and two of those characters play a primary part in "Weekend at Bobby's." The episode also shows how Bobby sacrifices a potential relationship, as a romance is hinted at with the appearance of his neighbor, Marcy. Hunters struggle with maintaining serious relationships due to the nature of the job, and Bobby is no different. Marcy attempts to set up a date with Bobby, but he's either too stubborn to pick up the hints, too busy, or he is avoiding it altogether to keep her at a distance for her own safety. Understandably, he is in the middle of trying to save his soul from hell. Fans of The X-Files will be familiar with prolific character actor Steven Williams, who portrays Rufus Turner in Supernatural. Rufus is Bobby's old hunting partner and a recurring character in the series. Rufus enters the picture in "Weekend at Bobby's" as he is trying to dispose of the body of an Okami, a monster that has rarely been seen outside of Japan. Bobby and Rufus share similar character traits, which is why their on-screen chemistry works so well and why they needed a spinoff. While Bobby does help Rufus, Rufus is also the first to understand Bobby's situation with his soul and offer help. He's usually the one to help, and it's one of his character flaws that's made apparent in the episode. After explaining his problem with Crowley, Rufus understands the severity of Bobby's issues. He becomes an important piece of Bobby getting his soul back. Another character who offered Bobby a helping hand was the potential star of Supernatural's canceled spin-off series, Sheriff Jody Mills. As a hunter, Bobby is always involved with petty crimes and suspicious activity, leading to many of their early interactions. Eventually, she is pulled into the monster-filled realm and becomes a crucial ally. Specifically, in "Weekend at Bobby's," she uses her position in law enforcement to keep the FBI off Bobby's back. Rufus is being followed, and they suspect he came to visit Bobby with a body in the bed of his truck. Jody goes above and beyond to help Bobby when he needs it most in this episode. Rufus is arrested for burglary when attempting to obtain the signet ring. Bobby needs Jody to help extradite Rufus to Sioux Falls so that he can complete the summoning spell. Though this could cause her to lose her job, she ultimately frees Rufus, allowing Bobby to set the trap for Crowley. In addition to showing Bobby's daily struggles, the episode highlights his resourceful and clever approach to regaining his soul. Bobby is more than a networking necessity for the hunting world; he is a strategist and problem solver. When Rufus offers to get the signet ring for Bobby, he assumes that Bobby is going to use the ghost of Crowley's son as a bargaining chip to trade. He uses Gavin for information, not as a trading piece. This is after he lets them have it, of course. He takes time out of his busy day whenever they call, but they've forgotten that Crowley owns his soul. After summoning Crowley, Bobby reveals that he's learned the location of Crowley's human remains and that Sam and Dean are standing by to torch them should he refuse to return his soul. Crowley gives him what he wants, and Bobby also manages to keep the use of his legs, which was a part of his initial deal with Crowley. He has a wealth of knowledge of the occult and is a great hunter in his own right. It only makes sense that he can teach Sam and Dean how it's done from time to time. If it wasn't clear beforehand, "Weekend at Bobby's" makes sure to highlight Bobby's importance to the series. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FORT BRAGG, N.C.—The U.S. Army's Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Regiment demonstrated its rapidly expanding role in the modern information warfare environment during a recent Innovation Day, where Soldiers from across the Regiment showcased solutions designed to fill operational gaps, outpace near-peer adversaries and increase lethality in competition and conflict. Col. Clinton Meade, the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School Deputy Commander, delivered opening remarks, focusing on three key objectives during the PSYOP Regimental Week. 1st Class David Hargett, a Soldier assigned to 7th PSYOP Battalion, presented a Cognitive Battle Damage Assessment Framework focused on improving how the Army evaluates influence effects on the battlefield. The framework provides commanders with a repeatable, data driven way to assess and measure behavioral impacts with the same rigger applied to kinetic effects. “Teams around the globe are doing phenomenal work,” said Hargett. Hargett's framework integrates atmospheric, open- source indicators and field reporting into a forecastable model designed to inform decisions 30-120 days out. This model will provide timely, quantifiable measures that accurately reflect how target audiences are responding. The goal is standardizing behavioral assessments in a way that aligns with how kinetic effects are measured, ultimately improving resource allocation and operational planning. A critical factor in both friendly and adversary decision making, Will-to-Fight gives PSYOP Soldiers a standardized methodology to assess and integrate it into planning. “The matrix is designed for any individual or team to pick up and use,” said Compton. The result would provide commanders and planners with actionable insights to evaluate adversary resolve more accurately. 1st Class Brian Potts, an instructor with the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, showcased the Night Haunter: an ultralight, drone deployed deception speaker capable of producing over 100 decibels. The mounting devices offer rapid attachment to both military and civilian vehicles. “When teams are required to deploy on a short notice, they often have strict equipment and weight limits,” Potts stated. This low-cost mounting solution significantly reduces setup time and risk of equipment damage, filling a long-standing need for adaptable loudspeaker integration across mission sets. Across all presentations, one theme was constant: PSYOP Soldiers are building practical and urgently needed capabilities to fill real-world gaps. Whether through DIY fabrication, analytical tools or non-standard acquisition approaches, innovation is becoming an embedded part of the Regiment's culture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UFO whistleblower claims Donald Trump was briefed on recovered non-human craft and possible alien biologics, sparking global debate and controversy. He suggests that the US Government has concealed UFO retrievals, non-human biological remains, and the existence of alien life for decades. David Grusch is a current advisor to Congress's UAP Task Force. In a recent interview, he claimed that Trump has received reports of all such activities, and he is aware of the origin of extraterritorial being and their intentions. He said that soon, Trump is going to become the 'most consequential leader in world history' by disclosing these details publicly. Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject,' Grusch told Fox News. From 2019 to 2021, he represented the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on the UAP Task Force, but later became a whistleblower after reportedly learning about the US government denying congressional oversight of matters related to extraterrestrials. Reportedly, Grusch has stated under oath to Congress in July 2023 that he is aware of the multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program. He alleged that the US government possesses "non-human" spacecraft and "non-human biologics" based on interviews with over 40 witnesses. Even though no such reports had been corroborated by the White House, the US Army or NASA and no physical evidence exists to verify these claims. But, on the Lex Fridman Podcast in September 2024, Trump claimed that he would declassify files on the aliens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Supernatural is sadly ending its long-running tenure on Netflix later this month, it's already been given a new life on Amazon Prime Video. The wildly popular fantasy-drama series stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as demon hunters Dean and Sam Winchester, as we follow their many adventures and exploits chasing monsters while being frequently helped by the Angel Castiel (Misha Collins). The show just debuted on Prime Video, and Watch With Us thought we'd put together a breakdown of the show's most unmissable episodes. Here are our picks for five essential episodes from Supernatural. The final episode of season 5, “Swan Song” was meant to be the series' finale, before series showrunner Eric Kripke was replaced by executive producer Sera Gamble. Still, “Swan Song” handily manages to be one of the show's very best offerings. Sam and Dean team up with their brother Adam (Jake Abel) and together they battle a demon named Michael, who they've allowed to enter Adam's body. The episode concludes with them trapping both Lucifer and Michael, while Chuck's true identity is hinted at. Fans love this episode as it provides an immensely satisfying conclusion to several storylines from the prior two seasons, while being filled with entertaining action, humor and tragedy. While you need to watch the previous seasons to enjoy it, it's got truly nail-biting moments as well as scenes that will make you cry. This makes our list in part for being the first appearance of Castiel, played by Misha Collins, who would go on to be an integral and beloved character on Supernatural. Castiel brings Dean back from Hell after being dead and buried for months, and he, Sam and Bobby (Jim Beaver) spend a good chunk of the episode's runtime trying to figure out how he came back. This episode is very emotionally satisfying on top of being an epic introduction for a great character. Plus, it shakes things up by adding angels into a series already heavily focused on demons, which thus changes the trajectory of the story. This is a classic gimmick episode, but it's incredibly creative. Supernatural is notable for not just being a good drama, but occasionally featuring some genuinely hilarious comedy episodes. In particular, “Changing Channels' sees Sam and Dean face off against an old enemy named the Trickster, who sends the brothers into TV. In addition to being laugh-out-loud funny, “Changing Channels” also brings some massive plot developments as well, with the Trickster's true nature revealed, and Sam and Dean learning what they have to do to fight Lucifer and Michael. In Supernatural's fictional version of Supernatural, Sam and Dean can't act, they use sets never seen on the show and Jared has a pet alpaca.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And honestly, nobody could have hosted that show better than Robert Stack. His voice alone was enough to make you glance over your shoulder at least twice. But there was one episode that never left my mind. The episode was about the U.S. military dabbling in remote viewing, astral projection, and all sorts of psychic experiments. They interviewed some of the so-called participants, but of course, their faces were hidden in deep shadow, and their voices were distorted to sound like every ransom-call villain ever. I remember one guy describing how he supposedly left his body, travelled across the world, moved through time, and even felt whatever environment he landed in. He talked about crawling through the battlefields of a world war, feeling trenches, mud, and even piles of bodies. If I had the ability to teleport my consciousness anywhere, a war zone would not be my top choice. Anyway, that memory sent me down a rabbit hole again today, so here's the fascinating truth behind the real-life psychic spy program: Project Stargate. The idea sounds like something ripped straight out of an X-Files episode, but Project Stargate was very real. It wasn't one single project, either; it was an umbrella name used by the CIA for a cluster of experiments that ran from the early 1970s all the way until 1995. Because the U.S. caught wind that the Soviet Union was experimenting with psychic research, and the Cold War was basically a decades-long game of “anything you can do, we can do too.” A few researchers, Russell Targ, Hal Puthoff, and Ingo Swann, set out to study psychic abilities and determine whether they could be used for intelligence gathering. They focused on remote viewing: the supposed ability to mentally “see” distant places or hidden objects using only the mind. By 1983, the team believed remote viewing was something that could be taught. They developed a set of step-by-step instructions meant to help an average person reach reliable accuracy. Some remote viewers described vivid scenes, shapes, colours, structures, even sounds and smells. Of course, results varied wildly depending on who you ask. Some insiders said the project proved psychic functioning was real. Psychic abilities, remote viewing, ESP, telekinesis, and astral travel have always lived on the outskirts of mainstream science, even though almost every culture throughout history mentions them in some form. There are old Chinese legends about doctors who could literally “see” inside the human body to diagnose illnesses. Some traditions say humans once had far sharper intuitive abilities that faded over time. And honestly, with everything the mind can already do, who's to say what its upper limits really are? If remote viewing were possible, imagine the fun. “Give me a sec… yep, definitely baby giants.” So here's my question for you today: I'm genuinely curious how many of us would choose ancient mysteries… and how many would choose to peek at next week's lottery numbers. Writing stories that blend fiction and history, exploring the past with a touch of imagination. There are no comments for this story But have you ever stopped to notice how many famous heroes have an animal tied to their name and abilities? Think about it: Spider-Man, Batman, Catwoman, Hawkeye. Some are common, like the power of flight or breathing underwater, but then there are animals with skills so unbelievable, it's almost like they truly have a set of superpowers. Here are some real-life animal superheroes that would give the Avengers a run for their money! Squire "Ski" Reynolds still couldn't believe his eyes. His cellphone news feed just revealed that Scrape Norwood had been gunned down by a SWAT team member and subsequently lost his left leg during a shootout with police yesterday morning while attempting to rob Ganola Bank, the only Black-owned bank in the State of Washington, at gunpoint. Two members of Scrape's crew had also participated in the foiled heist. It wasn't the storm that frightened her, not anymore. Several years ago, my good friend asked me to write an affidavit or a formal letter about our long-term friendship and my knowledge and observation of his relationship with his partner. It had nothing to do with the fact that it was a same-sex marriage, which was already legal at the time. It had everything to do with my friend's partner being an immigrant. He had arrived in the US on a fiance visa which was later converted to a conditional green card. A couple of years later, they were petitioning to change the conditional green card to a non-conditional one, which would give my friend's partner a path to citizenship.

For years, right-wing media outlets have ruminated on the mysterious pipe bomber who planted explosives outside the Democratic and Republican National Committees ahead of January 6th. Was it a deep-state provocateur working for the FBI? Or perhaps a liberal out to ruin Trump's otherwise legitimate hopes of overturning the election?

Glenn Beck has called the pipe bomber's identity “the biggest scandal of my lifetime, maybe in the last hundred years.” During his talk-radio days before he became deputy FBI director, even Dan Bongino was convinced something nefarious was afoot. In Bongino's telling, the FBI knew the pipe-bomber's identity but were choosing to cover it up because its disclosure would be politically embarrassing. Referring to himself in the third person as “Danny Boobotz,” Bongino declared he had been right about a coverup all along.

“It's a freakin' inside job!” Bongino said in early January.

So right-wing media figures should have been relieved on Thursday when the FBI announced the arrest of 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr. as the pipe bomber suspect. Yet the response from conservative media has overwhelmingly been the opposite. They believe that </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People love a good UFO conspiracy theory, and according to Deadline, they love it a lot more than any of the big-budget blockbusters of the year. The Age of Disclosure is a documentary directed by Dan Farah, featuring testimony from members of the U.S. government regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) that have visited our planet and why this information has been kept under wraps. Within 48 hours of release on Prime Video, The Age of Disclosure has already broken the streaming service's record for highest-grossing documentary. In fact, it has outperformed major movies such as One Battle After Another, Jurassic World: Rebirth, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, and more. Numbers haven't been revealed, but in a press release, The Age of Disclosure producers said, “The documentary debuted at #1 and #2 (purchase and rental respectively) on Prime Video's chart of Best Selling Movies in all genres, where it remained for the first 8 days of its release, outperforming major studio titles such as Warner Bros. One Battle After Another, Weapons, The Conjuring Last Rights, Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth, Disney's Tron, and Paramount's Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning. Two weeks after release, the film remains in the top ten of Prime Videos New Releases Best Sellers chart, and #1 and #2 out of all documentaries.“ The timely documentary arrives amid historic bipartisan Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and the proposed UAP Disclosure Act, led by Senators Schumer, Rounds, and Gillibrand, calling for transparency about what the government knows about UAP and non-human intelligent life.“ Get the latest movie and TV news, first looks, reviews, and interviews, straight from the JoBlo crew to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year's 12th edition of the Scary Movies festival at Film at Lincoln Center premiered Ari Aster's extended version of “Midsommar” this past Saturday. Quite honestly, if there's any documentary that can convince you that UFOs do exist, it's probably this one. I'm not 100% convinced, but it makes a strong case. Regardless, the film is on VOD, and Deadline reports that within its first 48 hours of release on Prime Video, ‘The Age of Disclosure' has already broken the streaming service's record for highest-grossing documentary. In fact, it was #1 for its first eight days, easily outperforming every blockbuster movie available on the platform, including ‘One Battle After Another,' ‘Jurassic World: Rebirth,' ‘Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,' and more. The doc, Farah's debut feature, dives headlong into what it calls “an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life,” alleging a decades-long arms race among world powers to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial tech. “The Age of Disclosure” features testimony from 34 members of the U.S. government, military, and intelligence communities, including a few former CIA directors, all asserting that humanity's biggest secret has been hiding in plain sight. The documentary contains even bolder assertions than that. Some claims are so extraordinary that they raise questions about whether the intelligence officers interviewed might have their own agendas. One even alleges, on camera, that the military has been in direct contact with beings found inside the recovered craft. Farah is said to have spent three years developing the film in strict secrecy, tracking down insiders willing to speak publicly. It's similar ground to the project Joseph Kosinski is tackling for Apple TV — a forthcoming drama inspired by former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch, who testified before Congress that the government has been studying alien craft and bodies while keeping the information from the public. Its first teaser went viral almost immediately, amassing over 20 million views across social platforms and fueling speculation that this might be the documentary capable of reshaping the conversation.</p>
