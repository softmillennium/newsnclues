Before ICE descended on New Orleans, GOP lawmakers made it a crime to interfere with immigration enforcement.

When concerned residents of the New Orleans metro area stepped out into the streets with their whistles and phone cameras over the weekend, ready to protest and document the Trump administration's unwelcome assault on immigrant communities, they faced both widespread digital surveillance by state and federal authorities and a vague state law that makes hindering federal immigration enforcement a crime punishable by up to one year of hard labor in a Louisiana prison. 

Championed by Republicans and signed by Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, Act 399 went into effect August 1 and now looms over New Orleans as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol continue their latest invasion of a Democrat-led city as part of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign. The new law makes “any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with federal immigration enforcement” a crime.

On December 3, the ACLU of Louisiana filed a lawsuit challenging Act 399 on behalf of a local group, which stopped conducting know-your-rights trainings after organizers feared they could be criminalized under the law's broad language. Louisiana's attorney general conceded in a court filing that Act 399 covers “only actual obstruction of justice — conduct, especially violent conduct,”  and not constitutionally protected speech. 

Act 399 went into effect August 1 and makes “any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with federal immigration enforcement” a crime.

The ACLU of Louisiana dropped the lawsuit on December 5 after the judge and both sides agreed on the attorney general's interpretation of the law. While the lawsuit focused on the First Amendment rights of groups holding community defense trainings for immigrants and their families, the clarification also offered a green light for activists to deploy resistance tactics seen in other cities targeted by ICE.

Videos shared online show residents gathering for a series of protests over the past week against ICE deployments in New Orleans that began on December 3. In suburbs like Kenner, a working class city with a large immigrant population and a local police chief who works directly with ICE, activists on the ground said caravans of vehicles coordinated by ICE watch activists followed ICE patrols with whistles and bullhorns, warning anyone who could be profiled as undocumented that federal agents were nearby. Coalitions organized know-your-rights trainings for documenting immigration arrests and set up a hotline for reporting ICE activity to a network of neighborhood response groups. Businesses across the city posted signs refusing entry to ICE and Border Patrol.

“What we are hearing from our clients is exactly what we have seen in other cities — folks are being arrested indiscriminately, targeted for the color of their skin, the language that they speak, the location where they are working,” said Homero Lopez, legal director of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in New Orleans, in a press conference with local leaders on December 5. 

Meanwhile, a digital surveillance fusion center shared by federal law enforcement and state police is keeping tabs on the online activity of residents and protesters as ICE and Border Patrol fan out across the New Orleans metro area, according to records obtained by the Associated Press. The records showed agents monitoring message boards and social media posts “around the clock” to provide updates on the community's response and criticisms of the immigration crackdown in New Orleans.

“Online opinions still remain mixed, with some supporting the operations while others are against them,” noted an intelligence briefing circulated early Sunday to law enforcement and obtained by the Associated Press. Previous intelligence bulletins noted “a combination of groups urging the public to record ICE and Border Patrol” as well as “additional locations where agents can find immigrants.”

A local activist who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation from law enforcement said many immigrant families are unable to work and shop for basic necessities due to the crackdown and concerns over racial profiling.

However, New Orleanians have survived hurricanes and other disasters together, and already existing mutual aid networks sprang into action to deliver groceries and help people access medical care and other needs. “People are getting rides, people are getting food, people are being accompanied — that is not an issue because people know how to do mutual aid here,” the activist told Truthout.

Jeremy Jong, a staff attorney with the immigrant rights group Al Otro Lado in New Orleans, said both Act 399 and the digital surveillance are designed to stifle speech and dissent.

“It appears that there is a real chilling effect,” Jong said in an interview. “Obviously the government surveilling essentially everyone is super concerning. It's frankly infuriating that tax money is going to this fusion center that just monitors what everyone is saying on social media.”

Jong said many people in southern Louisiana may have heard about Act 399 or a separate state law restricting the filming of police officers — the latter was temporarily blocked by a federal court in January — but they may not understand how these attempts at repression impact their constitutional rights.

“We want to tell people they have the First Amendment right to go out there and blow a whistle and follow them around and record them — these are all things that are essentially protected by the First Amendment,” Jong      told Truthout. “But we get a lot of questions like, ‘but I don't know, it could be illegal.'”

Jong said he recently spoke to members of a church in the New Orleans area who were worried that they could be prosecuted under Act 399 if they refused to let ICE agents enter the church without a warrant. Jong noted that ICE still needs a warrant to enter private property under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects everyone in the United States against unreasonable search and seizure. Shortly after taking office, Trump ended a longstanding policy that prohibited ICE from making arrests at schools, churches, and other sensitive public locations.

“It's designed to scare people into giving up rights that they otherwise have,” Jong said.

“This system depends on people being scared, people unthinkingly complying.”

Steadfast in their repudiation of Trump's deportation efforts — as well as of Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who has been heckled by protesters and workers in viral videos as he patrols New Orleans — Crescent City residents are not easily intimidated. Jong pointed out that the Trump administration's stated goal is to arrest 5,000 undocumented people in the New Orleans area, but the records obtained by the Associated Press show only 38 arrests were made during the first two days of the operation.

Of the 38 people arrested, only about a third had a criminal record, further undermining ICE's debunked claims that immigration sweeps are focused on public safety threats. The total number of people arrested for civil immigration violations in New Orleans has not been publicly reported despite demands from city leaders. Masked ICE and Border Patrol agents also ignored pleas from city leaders not to conceal their identities in public.

Jong said people across the metro area are asserting their rights when confronted by federal agents, making it more difficult for ICE and Border Patrol to make indiscriminate arrests at Home Depots and construction sites, for example.

“People can't go to work, people can't make rent, can't go to the doctor's office — that's terrible, but one silver lining is it gives us the opportunity to talk to people and say, ‘no, you have rights, and if everyone asserts their rights, these terrible calamities can be resisted,'” Jong said. “It's really nice to see people feel empowered, to just say no, to withdraw their consent, because this system depends on people being scared, people unthinkingly complying.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Several Trump officials made unsubstantiated claims that the app encouraged or led to violent outcomes.

The developer of an iPhone app that allows users to report and track immigration enforcement operations across the U.S. is suing several Trump administration officials, alleging that they unfairly characterized his app's intent, leading to it being unduly removed from the Apple Store.

Joshua Aaron, the creator of the app, which is called ICEBlock, filed the suit this week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. He lists several Trump administration officials as defendants, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting director Todd Lyons, and White House border czar Tom Homan.

According to the lawsuit, Aaron created the app in early 2025 to allow “members of the public to report publicly observable locations of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.” By April, the app was available on the Apple App Store, and by October, it had been downloaded more than 1 million times. 

Around that time, however, Apple removed the app from the store, a decision that Aaron alleges came after public pressure from those officials, who falsely claimed that Aaron had sinister intent and that the app “invites violence” against immigration agents. 

White House officials “have falsely claimed that ICEBlock and similar apps are responsible for violent attacks on law enforcement officers,” the lawsuit states. “No actual evidence has ever been cited to support these claims.”

Bondi stated in October that direct comments to Apple were what led to the app's removal. By her own admission, the White House had “reached out to Apple demanding they remove the ICEBlock app” from its store — “and Apple did so,” she added. 

“The United States government used its regulatory power to coerce a private platform to suppress First Amendment-protected expression,” Aaron alleges in his complaint. 

ICEBlock has always displayed a disclaimer on the app, telling users it is for “information and notification purposes only” and that the app is not for “inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.”

“Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,” the lawsuit states. “Not only is it designed that way — with functionality that ensures it can only be used for informational purposes — but it also includes this express prohibition against any other use.”

Notably, the complaint's arguments are similar to those made by Republicans who sued social media companies in 2022, after the companies restricted their accounts due to their false claims regarding COVID-19 and vaccines.

In the past, Apple has removed apps from its store at the request of other countries' governments, but the removal of ICEBlock, at the request of the U.S. government specifically, is atypical, The New York Times reported. In comments about his app's removal, Aaron suggested that the decision demonstrates that Apple is “in bed with this administration or under threat from it.”

Indeed, Apple is one of many corporations that has donated sizable sums of money to help fund the construction of an extravagant ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, posing a possible conflict of interest for those companies and the Trump administration. 

Aaron's lawsuit seeks to have the actions of the officials listed as defendants deemed as an unconstitutional abridgment of his First Amendment speech rights. He is also seeking to “permanently enjoin Defendants…from coercing, threatening, or demanding Apple or other app distribution services in order to stop distribution of the App.”

It's not enough to accept US assurances that it's not using shared intelligence for unlawful strikes, the group said.

A leading human rights organization on Tuesday pushed allies of the United States to more forcefully condemn and take steps to stop President Donald Trump's deadly boat strikes in international waters, attacks that experts have characterized as extrajudicial killings.

“The UK, Canada, and other allied nations who partner with the United States on counternarcotics efforts have ample evidence that the US is unlawfully killing people at sea,” Sarah Yager, Washington director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said in a statement. “The rules-based international order depends on countries speaking out against violations, even when they're committed by powerful friends.”

HRW specifically urged countries at risk of complicity to closely examine their maritime cooperation and intelligence-sharing with the Trump administration, which claims — without evidence — that every vessel targeted was involved in drug smuggling operations that posed a threat to the US.

“The UK, France, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands have significant influence in the Caribbean due to their overseas territories in the region,” the group said. “All three governments are also participants in Campaign Martillo, a multinational counternarcotics detection, monitoring, and interdiction operation that includes US Navy and Coast Guard vessels, along with military and law enforcement units from a dozen other nations, including Canada.”

“Australia and New Zealand, which are part of the ‘Five Eyes' intelligence sharing community with the United States, UK, and Canada where the governments share all signals and geospatial intelligence by default, may also find themselves implicated in the strikes and should take steps to evaluate their own risks,” HRW added.

While officials from the nations named by HRW have criticized and distanced themselves from the Trump administration's strikes, their comments have largely been vague and tepid — especially when compared to the responses of some South American leaders. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, for instance, said her country “is not involved in these US actions” and that “it is for the United States to articulate the legal basis of its actions.”

HRW also pointed to Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand's statement that “the United States has made clear that it is using its own intelligence” to target the vessels in international waters.

“It is not sufficient to accept the US government's assurances that it is not leveraging shared intelligence for its unlawful strikes,” said HRW. “In contrast, when asked directly about the legality of the strikes, [Ahmed] declined to address the matter, saying instead that ‘it is within the purview of US authorities to make that determination.'”

Last month, the UK reportedly suspended some intelligence sharing with the US due to the boat strikes. But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the CNN reporting a “fake story,” and the UK's foreign secretary cited Rubio's comment when asked about the report.

HRW said major US allies “should make public any internal legal assessments as to whether the US strikes are violating international law, use their bilateral relationships to raise concerns directly with US officials, and push for individual criminal accountability for those responsible.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Ron DeSantis's legally dubious order designating Cair – and Muslim Brotherhood – follows similar move by Texas

Florida is declaring the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) – a US civil rights and liberties group – a foreign terrorist organization, the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, announced on Monday.

The move closely follows a similar order issued in November by Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, DeSantis's fellow Republican, even though only the federal government can designate terrorist organizations.

Cair and its supporters are among those who have dismissed the orders from DeSantis and Abbott as Islamophobia.

In a statement, the national and Florida Cair chapters described DeSantis's order as a “stunt” and accused him of signing a “defamatory and unconstitutional order baselessly smearing” them. The groups vowed to sue Florida as it has Texas, where Abbott has directed law enforcement officials to investigate whether a group in Dallas is operating courts under sharia law.

“Governor DeSantis knows full well that Cair-Florida is an American civil rights organization that has spent decades advancing free speech, religious freedom and justice for all,” including for the people of Palestine, the groups said in a statement.

DeSantis said the executive order naming Cair, one of the nation's largest Muslim advocacy groups, was “effective immediately”. His order also targets the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist group founded in 1928.

Neither the Muslim Brotherhood nor Cair are on the US government's list of designated FTO groups.

Nonetheless, “Florida agencies are hereby directed to undertake all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities by these organizations, including denying privileges or resources to anyone providing material support,” DeSantis said in a statement on X.

The order said Cair was “founded by persons connected to the Muslim Brotherhood,” which it connects to Hamas and the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. Cair denies ties to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Cair's Florida and national chapters said DeSantis through his order had prioritized “serving the Israeli government over serving the people of Florida” – and of diverting “millions in Florida taxpayer dollars to the Israeli government's bonds”.

DeSantis and Abbott, it added, want “to smear and silence Americans, especially American Muslims”, who criticize the US's support for Israel's war in Gaza.

In a separate statement on X, DeSantis said that members of the Florida legislature “are crafting legislation to stop the creep of sharia law, and I hope that they codify these protections for Floridians against Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood in their legislation”.

Abbott's order in Texas prohibited Cair and the Muslim Brotherhood from acquiring property in the state and authorizing legal action to shut down affiliated entities.

Cair sent a letter to Abbott in November saying it “has spent 30 years vocally speaking up against all forms of bigotry, including anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism, as well as all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism”.

Fellow golden retrievers sniffed each other furiously, while owners of all ages plopped down on picnic blankets and swapped stories with other attendees

A passerby could hear the cacophony from miles away in the Argentine capital, the unmistakable sound of 2,397 dogs barking – and breaking the unofficial world record for the largest-ever gathering of golden retrievers.

Excitement pulsed through Bosques de Palermo, a sprawling park in Buenos Aires, as golden retriever-owners from all over Argentina transformed the park's grassy expanse into a sea of bright yellow fur.

Dog owners of all ages, their clothes covered in dog hair and stained with slobber, plopped down on picnic blankets with their beloved goldens to take in the surreal sight of so many other, exceptionally similar-looking ones. Children squealed with delight and giddily petted every dog that pranced about.

Families posed for pet selfies under the blazing Southern Hemisphere's summer sun.

Sipping Argentina's traditional yerba mate drink, attendees swapped fun facts about their favourite breed – such as goldens' famed ability to sniff out low blood sugar and cancer – and shared stories of their retrievers comforting them throughout all of life's ups and downs.

“Since we were children, she's been a constant presence in our family. We've had vacations with her. We've done everything together,” said Nicolás Orellana, a 26-year-old wearing a T-shirt with a photo of a golden retriever on it. His family said they drove an hour and a half from their hometown in Buenos Aires province for the event.

“It's a type of dog that's known to create a special bond,” he said, kneeling to pet his contented-looking 13-year-old dog Luna.

Around them, fellow golden retrievers sniffed each other furiously, some decked out in costumes ranging from Argentine soccer jerseys and national flags to tutus and Star Wars bandanas.

Through the tsunami of tail-wagging and treat-giving, 10 dog-loving volunteers clad in yellow vests roved with clipboards to register each golden retriever in attendance.

After hours of meticulous counting, the final number came in late Monday. With 2,397 golden retrievers recorded, the event's organizer, Fausto Duperre, announced that Argentina had broken the informal world record set last year when an event in Vancouver drew 1,685 goldens.

“This is a historic event,” gushed Duperre, a 28-year-old Argentine actor who has become something of a golden retriever influencer on social media, where he regularly posts content about his 10-year-old golden named Oli.

“I'm truly grateful and happy, proud, excited and overjoyed all at once,” he added.

High hopes for a big group photo of the dogs alone on the field quickly faded as it became clear that no owner – nor dog – would withstand even a few moments of separation. Plus, there was the all-too-real fear of dogs getting lost among their thousands of furry counterparts. Owners yanked at leashes and wrangled with the most restive dogs to keep them close.

Some said they were expecting total chaos from Monday's event but were surprised to report that it turned out to be easy and delightful – like the dogs themselves.

“I was afraid I would lose her, I was afraid she would fight, I was afraid another dog would attack her,” said Elena Deleo, 64, stroking her golden retriever Angie. “But no, they're all affectionate, all gentle. ... It's just a very lovely experience.”

South Africa's international relations minister, Ronald Lamola, has accused an Israel-linked group of manipulating the country's visa system to orchestrate an unauthorized mass entry of Palestinians.

The incident, involving a South African-chartered aircraft carrying 153 Palestinians that remained grounded on the tarmac for more than 12 hours, forced the government into a humanitarian intervention as officials worked to verify the passengers and establish how the flight was organized.

Speaking on MacG's Podcast and Chill, Lamola said the group had made use of South Africa's visa-free arrangement with Palestine and that intelligence pointed to external interference.

”They exploited a loophole because of the situation in Palestine. We have a visa-free regime with Palestine. So, they exploited that loophole through some players that we suspect involve some of those that are linked to the Israel regime,” he said.

Lamola stressed that although the aircraft had valid landing rights, no authorization was given for a mass arrival of foreign nationals, a requirement under international norms when large groups are transported. ”That was a South African plane. They had the landing rights and everything and the people. But with such things, when we want to bring people en masse, there must be an agreement between the two governments. There was no such agreement,” he added.

Lamola defended Home Affairs Minister Dr Leon Schreiber's initial call to halt entry, saying the irregularities justified precaution. But as conditions on board deteriorated, the government was forced to step in.

”The minister of Home Affairs made the call, but we supported him because it was clear that now, we have to act on humanitarian grounds.”

Ultimately, Dirco and Home Affairs agreed to process the passengers, allowing those who wished to depart to do so and permitting others to remain subject to South African immigration law.

“We ended up agreeing that we should make a humanitarian intervention and process them through immigration, and those who wanted to leave left and those that wanted to follow our laws would do so.”

All arrivals were vetted, Lamola confirmed. Humanitarian organization Gift of the Givers provided food and accommodation during the processing period. However, Schreiber announced that national intelligence structures confirmed a pattern of deliberate abuse of the visa exemption, driven by external role-players connected to efforts to move Gazans out of the war zone under the guise of short-term travel. And so, the 90-day Palestinian visa waiver was pulled.

“Following investigations and recommendations by national intelligence structures and consultations within the Security Cluster – which confirmed the deliberate and ongoing abuse of the 90-day visa exemption for Palestinian ordinary passport holders by Israeli actors linked to ‘voluntary emigration' efforts for residents of the Gaza Strip – Home Affairs has withdrawn the exemption,” Schreiber said. He added that short-stay visa exemptions are commonly used by countries to encourage tourism and short-term travel.

The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) has placed its defenses on maximum alert after Burkina Faso's military government grounded a Nigerian Air Force plane for allegedly violating the country's airspace. The move comes a day after the Nigerian Army carried out operations to help foil a coup in neighboring Benin.

The authorities said on Monday that the C-130 aircraft, carrying 11 military personnel, was forced to land “following an in-flight emergency situation” in Bobo-Dioulasso, located in southwestern Burkina Faso, roughly 910km (565 miles) from Cotonou, Benin's economic capital.

“An investigation was immediately opened by the competent Burkinabe authorities and revealed the absence of authorization for the overflight of Burkinabe territory by this military aircraft,” according to an official statement.

The AES has condemned the “unfriendly act” by Nigeria as a “disregard of international law” and a violation of the sovereignty of its member states.

The group said it has taken measures to guarantee the security of its airspace, including placing its air defense systems on maximum alert and “authorized to neutralize any aircraft that violates the confederal airspace.”

Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger formed the AES in late 2023 and withdrew from the West African regional bloc ECOWAS after tensions sparked by military takeovers in the three former French colonies. Ouagadougou, Bamako, and Niamey accused ECOWAS of serving as a tool for foreign powers, particularly France, after the bloc threatened military intervention to restore constitutional order in Niger.

The AES has also previously accused Benin and Nigeria of serving as logistical hubs for French-backed operatives allegedly plotting to destabilize the Sahel, which has been grappling with a jihadist insurgency for more than a decade.

Abuja has dismissed the claims and, in its latest response, described the aircraft incident as a “safe precautionary landing” during a ferry mission to Portugal.

In a statement on Tuesday, Nigerian Air Force spokesperson Ehimen Ejodame said the crew noticed a technical fault after takeoff from Lagos and diverted to Bobo-Dioulasso, “the nearest airfield… in accordance with standard safety procedures and international aviation protocols.”

Ejodame claims the personnel are safe and have received “cordial treatment” from the “host authorities,” adding that plans are underway to resume the mission.

In a nation beset by civil war and corruption, foreign-aid cuts add to the struggle to support malnourished children

Outside a nutrition centre in South Sudan, 10-year-old Akem Akuot wraps her thin arms around her brother Garang, who is 3. His eyes are glossy, and his head falls heavily onto his sister's chest.

She props him up and tips a pink cup of porridge into his mouth. As it pools around his lips, dripping onto his chin, he motions for more.

It's a hot afternoon in November, not far from the town of Bor, which lies about 200 kilometres north of Juba, the capital. The children are at a cooking demonstration organized by Save the Children – an international non-governmental organization – where nutritionists gathered mostly pregnant and lactating mothers to teach them how to cook meals using a variety of food groups and local ingredients. But with many here having little access to food, the cooking demonstration is also a crucial opportunity to eat. 

The families at this cooking demonstration in Bor often have little access to food at home. There are other regions of South Sudan where the hunger crisis is even more acute.

More than a dozen women gather on blankets and chairs, many comforting their babies after cooking pots of rice, vegetables, fish and meat. Akem and her little brother came with a distant relative on this day, but aid workers often see the pair on their own. 

Akem walks on the shoulder of the wide and dusty road that's shared with cattle, goats, tuk-tuks and motorbikes to bring her brother here every Monday to pick up packages of Plumpy'Nut, a plastic-wrapped paste with the protein and vitamins that he needs to recover from malnutrition.

“It's challenging to take care of the little boy,” says Akem, who speaks so softly she's almost inaudible. But she doesn't have a choice, she adds, as her mother must go into the forest to collect charcoal, sometimes for days at a time. One of Akem's other siblings is responsible for selling it. 

If their mother comes home empty-handed, they go without food. Foraging in the forest for charcoal is dangerous work, with armed groups stalking the area. 

But this is what it's like in South Sudan, where people are struggling to survive. The hunger crisis, the result of a number of factors – including government corruption, escalating factional violence, extreme poverty and climate change – is further fuelled by a reduction in foreign aid from the United States and other Western countries. 

According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), nearly six million people are facing high levels of acute food insecurity and famine is looming in parts of the country.

The Globe and Mail recently visited Save the Children in South Sudan to report on how one of the largest hunger crises in the world is poised to become even worse. 

South Sudan became the world's newest country in July, 2011, when it separated from Sudan. By late 2013, the country was plunged into a civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.

A 2018 peace agreement was meant to end the war, stipulating that the parties led by President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar would share power, usher in a permanent constitution and prepare for elections. But the agreement was never fully implemented, and it's been undermined by violence between government and opposition forces.

Joanne Minns, Canada's ambassador to South Sudan, told The Globe that the country is at a turning point, and if its leaders fail to act quickly, it could be plunged back into war. “Collapse would not only impact South Sudan, it would deepen Sudan's instability and send shock waves across broader East Africa. The 2018 peace agreement is more than a framework. It is the only credible path to democracy and stability.”

And without stability in the country, its people will continue to starve. “People cannot farm. You go farming, you get shot by gangs,” said Daniel Akech, a senior analyst for South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, an independent policy organization. He pointed out that devastating floods have also made it difficult for farmers to cultivate.

But in addition to violence and climate change, the United Nations said in a September report that government corruption is also to blame for the humanitarian crisis. Yasmin Sooka, chairperson of the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, said in a statement that corruption is not only exacerbating the food shortage and armed conflict over resources but also collapsing the health systems. 

“The suffering of South Sudanese civilians is a direct consequence of the brazen plundering of public revenues since independence in 2011,” Ms. Sooka said.

The government told the Associated Press that many of the commission's allegations are “absurd.”

The UN also said public health, education and the justice system are in crisis, most civil servants are not paid, or not paid enough, and that the international community spends more on the country's basic services than the government does.

Edward Chol, a civil servant who works in nutrition in Bor, said the government launched a nutrition strategy and is working with partners to improve the situation. He said that a lack of resources has meant that he is no longer able to visit certain areas to conduct nutrition assessments, monitoring that is crucial to improving services. He hasn't been paid for eight months, he added.

“Lack of resources has affected our work. The team here at the state ministry of health, they have no motivation,” he said. “We are trying to manage.”

The International Crisis Group's Mr. Akech says the UN report only tells part of the story, and that the war in neighbouring Sudan has also had a huge impact on South Sudan's economy.

Political turmoil and conflict have meant that South Sudan has depended on foreign assistance for a long time, Mr. Akech said, but over the years, there has been donor fatigue, with international donors realizing they weren't getting much of a return on investment.

The Trump administration's reduction in foreign aid earlier this year has left the local government exposed, he said, because they haven't invested in their own emergency response systems. 

The reduced U.S. support meant Save the Children had to cut more than 200 positions in the country, said Abraham Kulang, the organization's head of program implementation in South Sudan. With fewer staff, some of the NGO's treatment centres have been forced to close, and the ones that remain aren't able to provide as much support to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers or malnourished children. 

“Early identification in the community always saves lives and reduces the severity of disease, and that has become limited because there are no staff who are going up to that level to identify cases earlier,” he said. 

Danny Glenwright, president of Save the Children Canada, said the result of aid cuts is stark. “Children are facing acute hunger, and we're closing those clinics where they go to get treated.” 

Other Western nations have failed to fill the gap, even inflicting their own aid cuts. The United Kingdom and other European countries have slashed their foreign assistance budgets. The Canadian government is cutting $2.7-billion from foreign aid over four years, but it has not yet said where the cuts will be made. 

Mr. Glenwright said that Save the Children is disappointed in the Canadian government's decision to cut foreign assistance, including to health programs, at a time when children are going hungry. 

“As you see, the cuts are directly impacting people and people's lives and livelihoods,” he said.

Funding cuts have forced the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) – the largest humanitarian organization that provides food assistance – to prioritize only communities facing emergency and catastrophic levels of hunger.

The organization had hoped to provide such aid for 4.2 million people in South Sudan, said Tomson Phiri, a spokesperson for WFP in the country, but they could only reach 3.7 million – and even then, with reduced rations. 

“In some areas, rations have been sliced by up to half, whereas in the worst-affected areas we have intensified rations to 70 per cent.” He said a shortfall of US$485-million in 2026 threatens the WFP's ability to prevent the crisis from deteriorating further.

UNICEF, the UN's children's rights agency, said that 186 nutrition centres have closed across South Sudan since the beginning of 2025, and so have more than a third of the safe spaces it supports for women and girls. After her visit to the country, UNICEF's executive director Catherine Russell said she is urging the government and the international community to step up efforts to protect children. 

In addition to nutrition centres, non-governmental organizations also support programs in hospitals. 

Inside the pediatric ward at the hospital in Bor, 23-year-old Nyaror Agau sits on a bed with her daughter in her arms. She's in a stabilization centre run by Save the Children, which is reserved for children who are severely malnourished and have compounding illnesses. Ms. Agau's daughter, who isn't yet two years old, has malaria and pneumonia.

Ms. Agau said she travelled by boat, holding her daughter, who was restless with a fever, to reach this hospital. Her child used to stand and play, but now she's too weak, she says. At the stabilization centre, her daughter will receive medication for her illnesses and be treated for malnutrition.

Nyaror Agau's daughter is recovering from malnutrition in Bor.

Once a baby is treated here, nutritionists enroll them in an outpatient program and follow their progress.

In the ward, women stretch out on beds with blankets they've brought from home under a web of tangled mosquito nets. A ceiling fan pushes around the hot, stale air, and occasionally a chicken or a cat wanders through.

Adol Bol, 22, props herself up with one arm and breastfeeds her six-month-old daughter, who was admitted for diarrhea and vomiting. She isn't feeding well and is growing thin, Ms. Bol says. “We even go days without food.”

A health care worker visits Ms. Bol's bedside and measures the circumference of her daughter's arm and weighs her. The little girl squirms and cries as she is laid down to have her height measured. The results show that she is at risk of malnutrition. At this stage, Save the Children nutritionists will advise her on how to take care of herself and her baby.

“I know if I go hungry, the child will have nothing to breastfeed. I won't be able to produce milk,” Ms. Bol says. “Go and tell those who were helping us that we still need support. We are hungry, we are suffering.”

Adol Bol worries about her six-month-old daughter, and the hunger they endure at home.

On the grounds of the hospital, where pigs and goats roam between buildings, other nutritionists sit at a long table inside a warm building where they treat malnourished children and offer their mothers advice.

Here, Aluel Kelei, a 31-year-old counsellor, talks to mothers about how to take care of malnourished children. She instructs them on how to eat the therapeutic foods they provide and tells them, because it's treatment, that sharing is not allowed. She gives them tips on hygiene to prevent disease and teaches them how to create a kitchen garden. 

Ms. Kelei says many more people in the community struggle with hunger since the aid cuts. And farming remains dangerous. 

“When you're able to go and cultivate and farm, people always come and shoot you while you're farming,” she says.

Criminals also abduct cattle and children. And on top of insecurity, the aid workers who are trying to support others are also struggling themselves.

“We are preaching balanced diets,” Ms. Kelei says, laughing and shaking her head. She says the aid workers themselves “cannot even eat two meals a day, even one. You can reach to the level of one meal a day.”

When the mothers complain that they have no money to buy food, and the centre is no longer providing it, Ms. Kelei explains that U.S. cuts have put them in that position.

“Now we tell them: ‘If God has blessed you today with something, try to eat that thing today, and tomorrow you look for another one.' ”

The afternoon sun begins to drop outside the nutrition centre, where 10-year-old Akem had been feeding her brother Garang.

She pulls over a plastic chair and talks about their routine. When there's food, she cooks porridge for them in the morning. In the afternoons, she washes his clothes, and when her mom doesn't make it home, she puts him to bed and then falls asleep beside him. Once a week, she brings him here to pick up his Plumpy'Nut. Studying Garang's face, she says she knows he's unwell and is worried about him.

This is the first time she's been to the cooking demonstration, she says, adding that she thinks it's helpful because her brother can eat different food.

When asked if it was also an opportunity for her to eat, she says she will if there's enough, but the priority is her brother. Akem says she had to quit school after primary because her family couldn't afford it, and she has to look after Garang. But she hopes to return one day, and eventually become a nutrition counsellor herself who can help kids like her brother.

“In the future, if maybe I go to school and finish school, I'll be supporting these kinds of malnourished children.”

Akem Akuot, feeding three-year-old Garang, hopes to one day be in a position to help other children struggling with malnourishment.

Armed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia entered a second day on Tuesday, both sides said, in defiance of calls from the United States to stop fighting and adhere to a months-old Trump-backed peace deal that now looks on the brink of complete collapse.
    


            At least eight people have been killed since the latest skirmishes began, according to reports from both sides. By Tuesday, the fighting had spread to more points along the disputed border, with accusations of rocket strikes and drone attacks in some areas.
    


            About 400,000 people living along the border that divides the Southeast Asian countries have been evacuated in the latest flare-up.
    


            And Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow hinted the clashes could escalate, telling CNN in a sit-down interview that military action would continue “until we feel that sovereignty and territorial integrity are not challenged.”
    


            The fighting, over decades-old competing territorial claims along their 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border is the heaviest between Thailand and Cambodia since a deadly five-day conflict in July.
    


            The already shaky peace agreement, signed in October in the presence of US President Donald Trump, who hailed it as proof of his ability to end wars, now looks in danger of disintegrating.
    


Here's what to know.



            We don't exactly know.
    


            Both sides accuse each other of firing first, and CNN is unable to verify who did.
    


            Cambodia had been mobilizing heavy weapons and repositioning combat units, the Thai air force said.
    


            Cambodia's Ministry of National Defense denied the allegations. The Cambodian army said Thai forces had “engaged in numerous provocative actions for many days,” without specifying details.
    


            On Tuesday firing was reported in six of the seven Thai provinces that share a border with Cambodia, according to the Thai military.
    


            The navy said Cambodian troops fired heavy weapons, including BM-21 rockets, into civilian areas, and accused Cambodia of deploying special operations units and snipers to the border, of digging trenches to fortify positions, and encroaching into Thai territory in the coastal Trat province “in a direct and serious threat to Thailand's sovereignty.”
    


            Cambodia's army said Tuesday that Thailand's military had carried out “uninterrupted firing throughout the night” in several border areas using “large-scale drones” and “poisonous smoke.”
    


            Seven Cambodian civilians were killed and about 20 others wounded, according to the country's Interior Ministry. Thailand said one of its soldiers was killed.
    


Thai Foreign Minister warns of continued military action



            The United Nations Secretary General and the European Union have urged restraint from both sides. The United States expressed concern at the continued fighting on Tuesday. “We strongly urge the immediate cessation of hostilities, the protection of civilians, and for both sides to return” to the peace agreement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.
    


            A senior US administration official told CNN Monday that “President Trump is committed to the continued cessation of violence and expects the governments of Cambodia and Thailand to fully honor their commitments to end this conflict.”
    


            But there appears to have been little in the way of de-escalation on the ground.
    


            Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak told CNN that Thailand wouldn't rule out further strikes, saying that military action would continue “until we feel that sovereignty and territorial integrity are not challenged.”
    


            And on Monday, Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters in Bangkok that “Cambodia must comply with (Thailand), in order to stop the fighting.”
    


            When asked about the Trump-backed peace agreement signed in Malaysia, he said: “I don't remember that anymore.”
    


            Hun Sen, the influential former leader of Cambodia and current Senate President said in a Facebook post Tuesday, “our armed forces of all types must strike back at all points where the enemy attacks.”
    


            The fiery rhetoric underscores the entrenched suspicion and distrust between the two neighbors that has come to define their relationship since the deadly July conflict that killed dozens of people and displaced about 200,000 on both sides of the frontier.
    


            That agreement was signed in Malaysia in October. Trump, who presided over the ceremony, had helped broker it – in part, by threatening he would not make trade deals with either country if they refused.
    


            But tensions had been simmering for weeks, including a landmine explosion that injured four Thai soldiers in November.
    


            Following that blast, Thailand suspended all work on the peace agreement, and accused Cambodia of violating the joint declaration by laying fresh landmines – a claim Cambodia vehemently denies. The tentative release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war captured during the July fighting was also halted.
    


            Trump had considered the peace agreement as a major diplomatic victory, and another boost to his much vaunted – and often over-exaggerated – campaign to have ended several wars.
    


            The dispute has its origins in the mapping of Cambodia's border by its former colonial ruler France, and analysts had cautioned of a long road ahead before a lasting peace deal would be achieved. The peace declaration did not resolve that territorial dispute.
    


            Asked by CNN if Thailand was planning to discuss the latest border clashes with Trump, Sihasak, the Thai foreign minister, said it was up to Cambodia and Thailand to “work things out.”

LUGANSK, December 9. /TASS/. Seven Russian civilians were killed and nearly 60 people, including a child, were injured over the past week as a result of Ukrainian attacks, Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador-at-Large for the crimes of the Kiev regime Rodion Miroshnik told TASS.

"Over the past week, 65 civilians were affected by Ukrainian shelling: 58 people were injured, including one minor, and seven people were killed. <...> The largest number of civilian casualties last week was recorded in the Belgorod, Kherson, Zaporozhye Regions and the Donetsk People's Republic," he said.

Miroshnik specified that Ukrainian strike drone attacks were the most common cause of death and injury to Russian civilians. He added that over the past week, more than 80% of the total number of victims - 55 people - were killed by Ukrainian drones. "Ukrainian militants actively targeted apartment buildings, private homes, commercial and social facilities, and civilian passenger vehicles," the diplomat noted.

Miroshnik added that the enemy continues to mine the area remotely. Last week, a 55-year-old resident of Yalta was killed when he stepped on a Ukrainian mine, and two more people were injured when they stepped on explosive devices in Dimitrov and Rovno.

According to the diplomat, the Ukrainian military fired more than 3,200 types of ammunition at Russian regions last week.

11:27 JST, December 9, 2025

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Admitting participation by Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki in the World Baseball Classic is “very delicate” following a World Series that stretched into November, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts isn't sure whether any limits will be placed on his team's Japanese stars.

Ohtani had elbow surgery in September 2023 and returned to the mound in June. The two-way sensation helped the Dodgers become the first repeat World Series champion in a quarter century, starting the Game 7 win over Toronto.

“I would like to think that it's going to be a dialogue as far as restrictions and limitations, in the sense of just trying to give them the opportunity,” Roberts said Monday at baseball's winter meetings. “They've come off some stuff, some long seasons, and certainly with Yamamoto and looking out for 2026. But right now there's no more clarity than we had before.”

Ohtani won his fourth unanimous Most Valuable Player award, hitting .282 with 55 homers, 102 RBIs and 20 stolen bases while going 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA over 14 shortened starts that included 62 strikeouts in 47 innings. He had eight homers and 14 RBIs in 17 postseason games along with a 2-1 record and 4.43 ERA in four postseason starts.

Roberts said he wasn't sure whether Ohtani will pitch for defending champion Japan in the WBC, which starts March 5 and ends March 17 — nine days before the Dodgers' opener against Arizona.

“I'm hoping he doesn't but I don't know,” Roberts said. “Shohei's — he's very in tune with his body. But I would say probably the thought is he's probably just going to hit.”

Ohtani was MVP of the 2023 WBC, when Japan beat the United States 3-2 in the final as Ohtani struck out then-Los Angeles Angels teammate Mike Trout for the final out. That tournament generally limited pitchers to 65 pitches in the first round, 80 in the quarterfinals and 95 in the championship, and also included mandatory off days after certain pitch counts.

Sasaki started the semifinal win over Mexico and Yamamoto followed in relief as Ohtani doubled to spark a ninth-inning rally.

“I don't want to be dismissive of what it means to them representing their country,” Roberts said. “I know the organization doesn't but I do think that the conversations need to be had, will be had, as far as what each individual is taking on and whatever role that they might be taking on and what potential costs there might be. … But you can't debate the emotion, what a player might feel of this potential opportunity.”

Limited to 90 innings by a triceps injury in his first season with the Dodgers after signing a $325 million, 12-year contract in December 2023, Yamamoto pitched 211 innings this year in the regular season and postseason combined.

Sasaki, in his rookie season, didn't pitch for the Dodgers between May 9 and Sept. 24 because of a right shoulder impingement and became their closer in the postseason.

Los Angeles plans to have Ohtani as a regular member of the starting rotation next season.

“But it's not going to be a regular five-man rotation,” Roberts said. “I don't want to go down the six-man rotation road, but I do feel that giving him six, seven, eight days off to kind of allow him to continue to stay rested and build up, I think that's in our process. But again we have a long way to go but we've got some viable candidates.”

After leading the Dodgers to their third title in six seasons, Roberts has tried to detach and relax. He told Amazon Prime's “Good Sports” last week that he favors a salary cap, which some in management are advocating be proposed during collective bargaining next year. Baseball is the only U.S. professional major league without a cap.

“You know what? I'm all right with that,” Roberts said. “I think the NBA's done a nice job of kind of revenue sharing with the players and the owners, but if you're going to kind of suppress spending at the top, I think that you got to raise the floor to make those bottom feeders spend money, too.”

“I'm entitled to an opinion, as we all are,” Roberts said Monday. “My opinion shouldn't move the needle.”

Los Angeles projects to a major league-record $509.5 million in payroll and luxury tax this year. The New York Mets, who didn't make the playoffs, project second at $428.8 million.

“We have an organization that whatever rules or regulations, constructs are put in front of us, we're going to dominate,” Roberts said. “And so just give us the rules, let us know the landscape and then I'll bet on our organization.”

Donald Trump said he is considering “very severe” tariffs on imports of fertilizer from Canada, as the U.S. prepares a multibillion-dollar funding package for its own farmers, who have been battered by months of trade-war uncertainty.

The new White House focus on agriculture suggests the possibility of fresh trade turbulence, with little sign that the White House intends to depart from its pursuit of tariffs, whose revenue Mr. Trump said will be used to deliver US$11-billion in new money to row-crop farmers.

The White House called it a financial bridge to a less subsidy-dependent future.

The funds, which will be paid by the end of February, are an echo of payments made to farmers during Mr. Trump's first term, when they were called trade aid and explicitly described as compensation for Chinese reprisals against White House policies.

This year, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins called the cash a restitution for the policies of former president Joe Biden. 

The US$11-billion, and an additional US$1-billion held in reserve to help farmers of specialty crops, is needed to transition to a “new golden age for farmers, where, instead of farming for government cheques, they can farm to feed their family and sell their products and pass it on to the next generation,” she said. 

“This bridge is absolutely necessary based on where we are right now.”

U.S. and Canada discussed tariff-rate quota for steel before trade talks halted

In hearings on the future of the USMCA, business leaders call on Trump to drop tariffs

The funds amount to “Christmas early for farmers,” Iowa farmer Cordt Holub told Mr. Trump Monday, speaking from inside the White House.

But it's not clear how much the new funds will accomplish for an agricultural sector doubly bruised by Mr. Trump's trade war, which has raised input costs and, for much of the fall, led to a plunge in prices after China staged a retaliatory pause in the purchase of goods such as soybeans.

The White House has said China agreed to purchase 12 million tons of soybeans this year, a deal that prompted a late-fall rally in prices. Those prices, however, have more recently sagged as Chinese purchases of 2.25 million tons for the current harvest remain far from the target. 

For some farmers, the White House funds brought little reason for celebration.

“I'm not thrilled about it,” said Elliott Uphoff, who farms 2,000 acres with his father in central Illinois.

What he hoped for was “an official trade deal with China, and then we would see the price rally. That would have been the ultimate win.”

Instead, he said, what farmers have seen is “the same cycle from the first presidency,” which was marked by trade havoc and many billions of dollars in payments to those who suffered.

How Trump's tariffs are squeezing Canadian factories

Worse, he said, is the idea that Mr. Trump may hike tariffs on fertilizer, a product that makes up more than a fifth of total U.S. production costs for crops such as corn, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has estimated. 

One key product, potash, is largely mined outside the U.S., which imports 90 per cent of what it uses – with 80 per cent of that coming from Canada. 

Raising the cost of those imports “would be very painful,” Mr. Uphoff said. 

Mr. Trump, however, continues to see tariffs as a versatile solution to a broad range of problems, from foreign wars to domestic agricultural needs. 

“A lot of it does come in from Canada. And so we'll end up putting very severe tariffs on that, if we have to” to bolster U.S. output, Mr. Trump said Monday. Do that, he said, and “you'll be making your own fertilizer.”

It was only last month that Mr. Trump signed a presidential order lifting tariffs on most fertilizers. 

But the U.S. Department of Agriculture has “a whole plan in place, including the reshoring of fertilizer and the opportunity to do it in America,” Ms. Rollins said Monday.

Trump may use USMCA withdrawal as a bargaining tactic, trade experts warn

What's not clear is what that can accomplish. Canadian reserves of potash, for example, are nearly five times larger than those in the U.S., according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 

It may be possible for the U.S. to expand its production of nitrogen fertilizer, but that may not benefit farmers. 

“It seems like it would be expensive,” said Joe Janzen, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.

Any rise in U.S. fertilizer output that is propelled by tariffs, he said, would mean producers in that country “are being protected from cheaper foreign imports.” For farmers, all of that “would raise costs.”

It all suggests that the US$11-billion in new funds to farmers marks not an end of the cycle of agricultural subsidies, but a new beginning. 

Indeed, the Trump administration's approach may prove counterproductive, said Michael Langemeier, who is director of the Center For Commercial Agriculture at Purdue University, where he is a professor of agricultural economics.

“In some ways, these trade and tariffs discussions just distort things temporarily,” he said. For export-dependent commodities such as soybeans, anything that keeps U.S. goods from competing globally risks ceding ground to competitors.

“We have to be competitive in soybeans, because Brazil just keeps ramping up production,” he said. 

“If we really do not want to subsidize in the long-term, we need to move towards open markets – free markets, in terms of exports.”

BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Tuesday that the Trump administration's new national security strategy underscores the need for Europe to become “much more independent” from the United States in terms of security policy.

Merz also pushed back against the notion that European democracy needs saving. 

The U.S. strategy, published Friday, paints European allies as weak, while offering tacit support to far-right political parties, and was critical of European free speech and migration policy. On Monday, European Council President António Costa warned the U.S. against interfering in Europe's affairs and said only European citizens can decide which parties should govern them.

Merz, the leader of the European Union's most populous nation and its biggest economy, said he wasn't surprised by the substance of the strategy as it was largely in line with a lecture U.S. Vice President JD Vance gave to European allies in Munich in February.

Parts of the document are understandable, but “some of it is unacceptable for us from the European point of view,” he told reporters in the western German city of Mainz.

“That the Americans want to save democracy in Europe now, I don't see any need for that,” Merz said. “If it needed to be saved, we would manage that alone.”

He added that the new U.S. document “confirms my assessment that we in Europe, and so also in Germany, must become much more independent from the U.S. in terms of security policy. This is not a surprise, but it has now been confirmed again. It has been documented.”




Merz said that Vance's speech earlier this year had “set off something in me as well, and you can see that today in our defense spending.” 

Merz's government, in office since May, has enabled higher spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt — adding to an effort to bolster Germany's military that has been underway since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine started in 2022. 

Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, NATO members, including Germany, agreed in June to a massive hike in the alliance's defense spending target.

“In my talks with the Americans, I say: ‘America first is fine,' but ‘America alone' can't be in your interest. You need partners in the world too,” Merz said Tuesday. “And one of the partners can be Europe. And if you can't do anything with Europe, then at least make Germany your partner.”

The Heritage Foundation's EJ Antoni joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how President Donald Trump can tackle affordability as he takes his economic message to residents in Pennsylvania.

President Donald Trump declared the U.S. economy is strong and holds an "A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus" grade under his leadership despite inheriting a "mess" from the Biden administration. 

"The word affordability... I inherited a mess," Trump told Politico in a sit-down interview published Tuesday. "I inherited a total mess. Prices were at an all-time high when I came in. Prices are coming down substantially. Look at energy. You and I discussed before the interview, energy... energy has come down incredibly. When energy comes down, everything... 'cause it's so much bigger than any other subject. But energy has come down incredibly. Prices are all coming down. It's been 10 months. It's amazing what we've done."

The Trump White House is facing a crisis over its economic messaging after Democrats swept a series of elections in November while campaigning on platforms focused on "affordability," lowering the current cost-of-living prices skyrocketing from grocery store shelves to rent, while touting a vote for Democrats was a vote against Trump and his policies. 

The Democratic election wins earlier in 2025 — which included the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and the mayoral race in New York City — are viewed as a bellwether ahead of the 2026 midterms, lighting a spark among Republicans to fine-tune their messaging on the economy.

The White House and Trump increasingly have amplified blame for the current affordability woes on former President Joe Biden's leadership as voters' financial anxiety grows at peak holiday shopping season. 

"Putting an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump," White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital Monday morning when asked about the White House's message on affordability. 

"Every Trump administration official has been playing their part over the past year to deliver on this priority, from slashing costly regulations to securing historic drug pricing deals — efforts that have cooled inflation and raised real wages," he continued. "Much work remains, but President Trump is highlighting the meaningful progress that his Administration has made and will continue to make to turn Joe Biden's economic disaster around." 

VANCE ACKNOWLEDGES VOTERS 'IMPATIENT' ON AFFORDABILITY, REJECTS 'TOTALLY BULLS--- NARRATIVE'

Voters have reported they are spooked by the current state of costs in the U.S.

Some 76% of voters, however, reported that they view the economy negatively, up from the 67% who reported the same in July, and the 70% who said the same at the end of Biden's term, a November Fox News national survey found. 

The survey found that voters overwhelmingly blamed Trump over Biden. About twice as many voters polled reported that Trump, rather than Biden, is responsible for the current economy, with three times as many voters reporting that Trump's economic policies have hurt them, which is on par with their feelings during Biden's final year in office. 

Andrew Bates, who served as the Biden White House's deputy press secretary, pointed to the voter survey when asked for response to the Trump administration's heightened comments, pinning blame for economic concerns on policies held over from the Biden White House. 

"Democrats and the Biden-Harris Administration warned Trump against making the biggest health care cuts in history so billionaires could get tax breaks; just like they warned against the tariffs that are a record-level tax hike on working people," Bates said in an emailed comment to Fox News Digital. "Maybe Donald Trump can't remember prices were lower last year. That's what I wondered when he started building himself an assisted living ballroom."

The White House on Tuesday told Fox News Digital: "The fact of the matter is that Joe Biden inflicted a generational economic crisis on the American people. 

"Turning this crisis around has been a Day One priority for the Trump administration, which has already delivered cooled inflation, multi-year low gas prices, trillions in investments, and historic drug pricing deals to dramatically cut costs for American patients," White House spokesman Desai said. "Biden flacks who insisted Biden was in absolute peak health and wasn't dropping out of the 2024 presidential race just days before Biden did just that need to get a grip on reality."

Trump continued in his Politico interview that he grades the current economy as "A-plus."

"I do want to talk about the economy, sir, here at home. And... and I wonder what grade you would give your economy," Politico asked Trump. 

Trump: "A-plus."

Politico: "A-plus?"

Trump responded: "Yeah, A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus."

The Biden administration oversaw the highest inflation to rock the nation in 40 years, 30-year mortgage rates that rocketed to roughly 8%, up from under 3%, and the sharpest rise in interest rates in decades.

REPUBLICAN POPULISM CRATERS AS TRUMP STUMBLES, DEMOCRATS SURGE

Trump hammered again in the interview that Democrats created the current affordability woes while stressing that they are the party that would bring prices down. 

"You talk about affordability, the Democrats love to say affordability, afford... but then they never talk about it," he said. "They're the ones that gave us the high prices. I'm the one that's bringing them down."

Trump is set to travel to Pennsylvania Tuesday, a key battleground state that helped deliver him his 2024 victory, to promote his administration's economic policies and growth amid voters reporting financial anxiety.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed Trump's speech during an appearance on "Fox & Friends" Tuesday, which included taking shots at the Biden administration's economic record. 

"We greatly look forward to going to northeast Pennsylvania tonight," Leavitt said. "And President Trump is going to give a positive, economic focused speech where he talks about all that he and his team has done to provide bigger paychecks and lower prices for the American people."

She added: "And don't forget, a year ago, President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in modern American history from the Biden administration. And I have watched every single day as President Trump and his tremendous economic team have been working to fix it. And they have, through a very simple economic formula, which President Trump will talk about tonight."

Day 9 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar

Day 9 of the 2025 Space Telescope Advent Calendar: A Cosmic Cat's Paw. Emission nebula NGC 6334, otherwise known as the Cat's Paw Nebula, lies about 4,000 light-years away. Instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope recently took a detailed look at one of its “toe beans,” a star-forming region where the energy from bright young stars is blasting away dense nearby clouds of gas and dust.

Europe is “decaying” due to a group of “weak” leaders too focused on being “politically correct,” President Donald Trump said on Monday in his latest criticism of the leaders of traditional U.S. allies.

“I think they're weak, but I also think that they want to be so politically correct,” the president told Politico in an interview. “I know the good leaders. I know the bad leaders. I know the smart ones. I know the stupid ones. You get some real stupid ones, too. But, uh, they're not doing a good job. Europe is not doing a good job in many ways. They're not doing a good job.”

The president's criticism of European leaders focused on unchecked migration, and their position on the Russia-Ukraine war reflects the policy positions outlined in the administration's recently released National Security Strategy.

In it, the 33-page guiding document for the president's “America First” foreign policy agenda argued that Europe faces “civilizational erasure” due to mass migration, which he warned could prevent traditional U.S. allies from maintaining those statuses.

“And if it keeps going the way it's going, Europe will not be … in my opinion, uh, many of those countries will not be viable countries any longer,” Trump said. “Their immigration policy is a disaster. What they're doing with immigration is a disaster. This is one of the great places in the world, and they're allowing people just to come in and … unchecked, unvetted.”

The president praised Hungary and Poland, saying the countries have “done a good job” regarding immigration, but added that “most” European nations are “decaying.”

The administration has been putting pressure on European countries to change their domestic immigration policies, including issuing guidance for U.S. embassies in Europe to report “violent crimes and human rights abuses perpetrated by migrant populations.”  

Trump said in the interview that he would be open to endorsing candidates for elections in Europe, as he has in the past with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Argentine President Javier Milei.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the Trump administration's National Security Strategy “confirms my assessment that we in Europe, and so also in Germany, must become much more independent from the U.S. in terms of security policy.”

Merz noted that the administration's viewpoint “is not a surprise, but it has now been confirmed again. It has been documented.”

Under pressure from the Trump administration, the NATO alliance agreed to increase the minimum defense spending threshold from 2% of a member's gross domestic product to 5%, although it is a long-term goal that most countries will not reach for years.

Trump said, “NATO calls me daddy.”

Congress is seeking to put some guardrails on the administration's ability to reduce the military's presence on the European continent.

Lawmakers added a provision to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026 that prohibits the Pentagon from reducing “the total number of members of the Armed Forces permanently stationed in or deployed to the area of responsibility of the United States European Command below 76,000 for longer than a 45-day period.”

NSS EMPHASIZES TRUMP'S ‘AMERICA FIRST' PRIORITIZATION OF US'S BACKYARD

It also blocks the military from divesting, redeploying, or permanently moving equipment or physical property with an “initial purchase value of more than $500,000” still in the area as of June 1 and prevents the department from giving up the U.S.-held role of NATO's supreme allied commander.

Last month, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matt Whitaker, said he looked forward to the day Germany would take over the Supreme Allied Commander Europe position, though he caveated it with, “We're a long way from that.”

NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday granted the Justice Department's request to publicly release grand jury transcripts and other material from Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case, citing a new law that requires the government to open its files on Jeffrey Epstein and his longtime confidant, but he cautioned that people shouldn't expect to learn much new information from them.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer, who along with other judges had previously rejected Justice Department unsealing requests before the transparency law was passed, said the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.”

“They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's,” Engelmayer wrote. “They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes.”

Engelmayer, in Manhattan, ruled Tuesday after the Justice Department had asked judges in the wake of the law's passage last month to lift secrecy orders in Maxwell's and Epstein's cases that had kept some records under wraps. A request to unseal records from Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case is pending.

Engelmayer is the second judge to act after the Epstein Files Transparency Act created a narrow exception to rules that normally keep grand jury proceedings secret. Last week, a Florida federal judge ordered the release of transcripts from an abandoned Epstein federal grand jury investigation in the 2000s.

The law, signed by President Donald Trump after months of public and political pressure, requires the Justice Department to provide the public with Epstein-related records by Dec. 19.

AP correspondent Marcela Sanchez reports investigative materials, possibly in the hundreds or thousands, will soon be released in the sex trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell.




The fate of the government's Epstein files has dominated the first year of Trump's second term in office. The Republican campaigned for reelection last year on a promise to release the files, and his administration did disclose some records earlier this year — almost all of them already public — but suddenly stopped in July after promising a “truckload” more.

Forced to act by the new transparency law, the Justice Department says it plans to release 18 categories of investigative materials gathered in the massive sex trafficking probe, including search warrants, financial records, notes from interviews with victims, and data from electronic devices.

Epstein, a millionaire financier, was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges and killed himself in jail a month later. Maxwell, a British socialite, was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. After giving an interview to the Justice Department's second-in-command in July, she was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas.

The Justice Department said it was conferring with victims and their lawyers and planned to redact or black out portions of records to protect victims' identities and prevent dissemination of sexualized images. Engelmayer said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton must personally certify that records have been “rigorously reviewed” to avoid an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Maxwell's lawyer told Engelmayer last week that unsealing records from her case could spoil her plans to file a habeas petition, a legal filing seeking to overturn her conviction. The release “would create undue prejudice so severe that it would foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial,” Maxwell lawyer David Markus wrote. The Supreme Court in October declined to hear Maxwell's appeal.

Annie Farmer, a vocal Epstein and Maxwell accuser, fought for the transparency act's passage and supports the release of court records. She said through her lawyer, Sigrid S. McCawley, that she “is wary of the possibility that any denial of the motions may be used by others as a pretext or excuse for continuing to withhold crucial information concerning Epstein's crimes.”

In August, Engelmayer and Judge Richard M. Berman denied the department's requests to unseal grand jury transcripts and other material from Maxwell's and Epstein's cases, ruling that such disclosures are rarely, if ever, allowed.

Tens of thousands of pages of records pertaining to Epstein and Maxwell have already been released through lawsuits, public disclosures and Freedom of Information Act requests.

Many of the materials the Justice Department plans to release stem from reports, photographs, videos and other materials gathered by police in Palm Beach, Florida, and the U.S. attorney's office there, both of which investigated Epstein in the mid-2000s.

Last year, a Florida judge ordered the release of about 150 pages of transcripts from a state grand jury that investigated Epstein in 2006. On Dec. 5, at the Justice Department's request, a Florida judge ordered the unsealing of transcripts from a federal grand jury there that also investigated Epstein.

That investigation ended in 2008 with a then-secret arrangement that allowed Epstein to avoid federal charges by pleading guilty to a state prostitution charge. He served 13 months in a jail work-release program.

Fox News senior foreign policy correspondent and anchor Gillian Turner reports on efforts to advance a Ukraine-Russia peace deal on ‘Special Report.'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his country is ready to propose details for a new peace deal with Russia to the U.S. on Tuesday.

Zelenskyy made the announcement on social media, saying Ukrainian and European negotiators had come to a more solid agreement on a proposal. Ukraine had previously ruled out any peace proposal that involved ceding land to Russia.

"We are working very actively on all components of potential steps toward ending the war. The Ukrainian and European components are now more developed, and we are ready to present them to our partners in the U.S. Together with the American side, we expect to swiftly make the potential steps as doable as possible," Zelenskyy wrote.

"We are committed to a real peace and remain in constant contact with the United States. And, as our partners in the negotiating teams rightly note, everything depends on whether Russia is ready to take effective steps to stop the bloodshed and prevent the war from reigniting. In the near future, we will be ready to send the refined documents to the United States. Glory to Ukraine," he added.

President Donald Trump had expressed frustration with Zelenskyy earlier this week, arguing he had been sluggish in responding to a proposal from the Russian side this weekend.

Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner for five hours last week.

The Russian leader stuck to his maximalist demands in the interview, arguing his war will only end when his country takes Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Ukrainian troops withdraw.

Fox News senior foreign policy correspondent and anchor Gillian Turner reports on efforts to advance a Ukraine-Russia peace deal on ‘Special Report.'

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are in talks with a reluctant Belgium over what to do with billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in the country.

According to the Belgian government, at least €197 billion (approximately $224 billion) of sanctioned Russian assets are held in Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial institution. The European Commission wants to seize these assets and transfer them to Ukraine as part of a €165 billion financial package for Ukraine (approximately $190) to help pay its bills and fund the war effort.  

Prime Minister Bart De Wever is concerned that taking Russia's assets could be interpreted as an act of war by Russia and provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin to retaliate against Belgium.

EU OFFICIAL WARNS 'IMPUNITY' FOR RUSSIA WOULD MARK 'HISTORIC MISTAKE OF HUGE PROPORTIONS'

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of the country's Security Council, even threatened Brussels and its European allies in an inflammatory post on X.

"If the crazy EU does steal frozen Russian assets for a "reparations loan," we may view it as a casus belli with all the relevant implications for Brussels & Co.," the former Russian president said.

EU leaders are up against a tight clock, as Ukraine is projected to run out of funds for the war in April and EU leaders will convene on Dec.18 to make a final decision on how to support Ukraine's budgetary needs for the next two years.

Key European leaders have traveled back-and-forth to Belgium to convince the government to sign on to the reparation proposal. The plan has widespread support within the European Union, but Belgium's prime minister has so far stood in the way.

"Belgium's particular situation regarding the use of the frozen Russian assets is undeniable and must be addressed in such a way that all European states bear the same risk. We agreed to continue our discussions with the aim of reaching a consensus at the European Council meeting on December 18," von der Leyen posted on X after meeting with Merz and De Wever.

Merz said after the meeting that Belgium's concerns were legitimate and must be heard.

"What we decide now will determine Europe's future: Belgium's particular vulnerability in the issue of utilizing the frozen Russian assets is indisputable and must be addressed in such a way that all European states bear the same risk," Merz said on X.

Robert Kremzner, an associate analyst with the New Lines Institute and an expert in Russian gray zone warfare, said Russia has a number of ways it can target Belgium that fall below the threshold of open hostilities.

"Russia has been very active in using something called gray zone warfare, which sees Russia undertaking hostile actions against other nations that are below the threshold of war, and thus not that easy to respond to," Kremzner told Fox News Digital.

He said some examples include information warfare, cyberattacks, election interference, GPS spoofing, cutting undersea cables, and increasingly arson attacks and assassinations.

The Belgian government, along with Euroclear, are looking for financial guarantees from fellow EU member states before committing to supporting the plan. De Wever fears that Belgium will ultimately be held responsible and be forced to pay back the assets that are seized in the event a sanctions deal is negotiated with Russia as a way to end the war in Ukraine.

The European Commission said it put in place safeguards to protect Member States and financial institutions from possible retaliatory measures from Russia.

If Belgium remains recalcitrant, von der Leyen could resort to the EU's Article 122 emergency powers, which would allow the commission to move forward with the proposal on a majority-rule basis.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Belgian government and Euroclear but did not hear back before publication.

            A federal judge in New York on Tuesday granted the Justice Department's request to unseal records from the investigation and criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            The ruling from Judge Paul Engelmayer opens the door for the department to publicly release evidence it had gathered against Maxwell, an associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            The trove of documents, which will be redacted to protect victims' identities and other identifiable information, includes grand jury transcripts, financial records, travel documents, and notes from victim interviews obtained during the investigations.
    


            It is not yet clear when the department plans to make the documents public or how much of the material will be new. Some of the evidence in the case came out during Maxwell's trial and Congress has released a trove of records in recent weeks.
    


            “Contrary to DOJ's depiction, the grand jury materials would not reveal new information of any consequence,” Engelmayer wrote.
    


            Engelmayer is the second judge to order investigative files be made public since the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law last month. A judge in Florida made a similar ruling last week.

            The Justice Department has also filed a request to unseal records to a third judge who oversaw Epstein's short-lived prosecution in New York. That judge has not yet issued a ruling.

Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says his walk across Pocahontas Island reminded him how 'petty squabbles' over politics can be solved by listening to the other side first.

Education has been on my mind a lot lately as I continue my Walk Across America through the gentle hills of North Carolina. Part of why I'm doing this walk is that I have seen how the lowering of education standards over the last 60 years has devastated Black communities, such as the one I live in on the South Side of Chicago. Without a proper education, one cannot go far in life in America. It is my ambition to reverse this insidious and life-sucking trend everywhere in America and when I reached the city of Raleigh I decided to visit two schools that I heard were successful.

The school for the boys is called Iron Academy and the girls' school is called Academy31. They both sit on the same campus in separate buildings and yet their mission is the same: Raise kids the way God designed for them, strong in faith and ready for life.

When I walked into Iron Academy, the boys looked me in the eye and shook my hand like men. They talked about responsibility like it was normal. I'm so used to stressing responsibility to my own youth that it is sometimes startling when I see it ingrained in a child. All of these kids were regular boys who understood that the purpose of school was to go home each day having learned something of consequence.

MY WALK ACROSS AMERICA IS A LESSON IN GRATITUDE AND GIVING THANKS

The small classes (15:1 ratio) were led by Christian teachers who actually knew each student's name. Their mission is to "develop young men of biblical manhood and integrity." Each student is required to lead an initiative of some sort, and that is core to the program. In addition to the books, there is a heavy emphasis on physical training, public speaking, working with their hands and using Scripture as the guiding foundation.

The results show improvement: grades jump, attitudes straighten and young men start acting like somebody's counting on them, because somebody is. Every year, Iron Academy publishes outcome data that shows an average 8.7-point IQ increase after the first year of enrollment.

RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IS AMERICA'S CORE RIGHT. WE MUST DEFEND IT FOR KIDS AND PARENTS

Then I walked the path across the campus to Academy31. The vibe in the air was different but the strength and conviction were the same. The girls greeted me with quiet confidence. They resembled the Proverbs 31 woman: smart, capable, kind and fearless.

I saw these girls studying Latin, logic and literature right alongside cooking, finances, and how to run a home or a business. They were surrounded by mentors who were the older students discipling the younger ones. The school felt like a house full of sisters who decided the world doesn't get to tell them who they are — God already did.

FROM A CHICAGO ROOFTOP TO 3,000-MILE JOURNEY, HERE'S HOW I'M FIGHTING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S SOUL 

What I loved about these two North Carolina schools was that there was no co-ed chaos, no watering down of standards or behavior to keep everybody comfortable. Boys get to be boys and figure out what it means to strive for biblical manhood without apology.

Girls get to be girls and grow into biblical womanhood without competition. Growth is the key word here. Both the boys and girls are given the time and space to grow into their own selves and that allows their roots to grow strong and firm. And because the schools sit right next to each other, the boys learn to respect the girls and the girls learn to respect the boys — the old-fashioned way that still works.

I stood there on that campus thinking about the kids back on the South Side. Fatherless boys wandering the block, looking hard because nobody ever showed them how to be strong the right way. Girls raising babies while they're still babies themselves because nobody taught them their worth. We keep throwing money at programs that treat symptoms and wonder why nothing changes.

This is the answer I've been praying for.

We don't need another government report or celebrity PSA. We need places where boys become men of God and girls become women of God, separate when it helps them grow, together when it teaches them honor.

North Carolina already has the blueprint. Iron Academy and Academy31 are proving it works, one young man and one young woman at a time.

When I get back to Chicago, Project H.O.O.D. is starting two schools of our own, one for boys and one for girls. Small at first. Biblical from the foundation. No excuses, no shortcuts. We'll teach reading, writing and arithmetic, but more than that, we'll teach character, courage and Christ.

Because strong boys and strong girls don't just happen. Somebody has to build them on purpose.

A federal judge has ruled the Justice Department can release investigative materials from the criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, citing the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

Judge Paul Engelmayer has granted the DOJ's motion to unseal the grand jury transcripts and exhibits in Maxwell's criminal case with some redactions.

Engelmayer's ruling comes just ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to release records related to the Epstein case. 

"In the case of the Maxwell and Epstein grand juries, under the Act, public disclosure of such materials is the rule, subject to the limited exceptions set out in the Act. The Act thus requires the Attorney General to make public the Maxwell grand jury materials, subject to the withholdings and redactions that the Act permits," Engelmayer's ruling reads.

Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking charges in December 2021, is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Her attorney said that she took no position on the requested unsealing of records but noted that the release could harm Maxwell's plan to file a habeas petition, according to The Associated Press.

HOUSE VOTES OVERWHELMINGLY TO FORCE DOJ TO RELEASE JEFFREY EPSTEIN FILES

Engelmayer's decision is the second in the past week approving the release of Epstein-related files. Last week, Judge Rodney Smith moved to allow the DOJ to release transcripts from an abandoned federal grand jury probe from the 2000s.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act requires the DOJ "to publish (in a searchable and downloadable format) all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in DOJ's possession that relate to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein." The act was passed in November and paves the way for the public to have more insight into the infamous cases against the late disgraced financier.

There is a possibility that a judge could rule to release grand jury transcripts from the 2019 Epstein criminal case prior to the deadline under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The AP noted that attorneys for the Epstein estate did not take a position on the unsealing of records.

The DOJ is reportedly working with survivors and their attorneys to redact records to protect survivors' identities and prevent the dissemination of sexualized images, according to the AP.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.

The trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.

The president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.

“We're bringing prices way down,” Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability' or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it.”

The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.




As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.

It's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.

Trump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation's closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.

Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.

“We're actually going to turn that on its head,” Wiles said, “and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.” 

Wiles added, “So I haven't quite broken it to him yet, but he's going to campaign like it's 2024 again.”

The challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.

Asked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”

Trump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.

Trump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.

The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.

Since the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

            Months into a pressure campaign that has seen the US military move thousands of troops and a carrier strike group into the Caribbean and President Donald Trump issue repeated threats against Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, the Trump administration is working on day-after plans in the event Maduro is ousted from power, according to two senior administration officials and another source familiar with the discussions.
    


            The plans are being quietly drafted and closely held at the White House, the sources said.
    


            They include multiple options for what US action could look like to fill the power vacuum and stabilize the country if Maduro voluntarily leaves as part of a negotiated departure or is forced into leaving after US strikes on targets inside Venezuela or other direct action, the sources said.
    


            Publicly, officials have said that the goal of the military buildup in the Caribbean and the drug boat strikes is to drive down the flow of drugs into the US, but the internal planning is a clear signal of Trump's consideration of forcing out Maduro, which administration officials have privately acknowledged.
    


            CNN has reported that Trump has not made a decision as to how he will resolve the standoff, and there are multiple factions within the administration with sharply contrasting views on potential military or covert action to remove Maduro. While Trump has repeatedly threatened an escalation, including land strikes, two senior administration officials said there was no appetite for ramped up US engagement in the country.
    


            Trump spoke by phone with Maduro late last month, just days before the US designation of Maduro and his government allies as members of a foreign terrorist organization went into effect. A senior White House official said that while the call was not necessarily contentious, the president did give something of an ultimatum to the dictator, telling him that it was in Maduro's best interest to leave the country and that Trump intended to keep “blowing up” boats.
    


            In an interview with Politico published on Tuesday, Trump said he didn't want to say how far he'd go to oust Maduro but added that “his days are numbered.”
    


            Trump has refused to rule out directly participating in regime change, and the planning by those at the White House preserves his options.
    


            “It's the job of the federal government to always prepare for plans A, B and C,” said a senior administration official, noting that the president would not be making the threats he's making if he did not have a team ready with a series of options for any potential outcome.
    


            Another source familiar with the planning said that it is “the responsibility of the US government to prepare for all scenarios around the world that may or may not unfold.” The plans are being closely held at the Homeland Security Council at the White House, the source added, which is led by Stephen Miller who has worked closely with Secretary of State and acting national security adviser Marco Rubio on the efforts related to Venezuela in recent months.
    


            The Venezuelan opposition led by María Corina Machado and Edmundo González has been working on day-after plans for years and has shared elements of those plans publicly. Their efforts would address security, economy, energy, infrastructure and education, among other focuses, opposition leader David Smolansky told CNN.
    


            The opposition has been formulating “100 hour” and “100 day” plans for next steps if Maduro is ousted, and those plans have been shared with different parts of the Trump administration, a source familiar said. It is unclear how much the administration has incorporated any aspects of those plans into its thinking, the source said.
    


            The Trump administration had said that Gonzalez is the “rightful president” of Venezuela after the US claimed that he won the most votes in the country's election last year. Over the summer there were informal conversations inside the administration tied to Machado and Gonzalez leading the country if Maduro was out of the way, officials said. Machado has publicly praised Trump and said that Venezuela would work closely with the US.
    


            But now the day-after planning is more intense, having to account for a number of different situations wherein Maduro could leave leadership. It is not clear that the administration has decided how they might move to oust Maduro, complicating the already fraught task of developing detailed day-after plans.
    


            The US would have to determine how much and what kind of support it would give the country to prevent it from descending into conflict and chaos, and how it would push to influence the country's governance if Maduro leaves after leading the country for more than a decade. While putting US troops on the ground is unlikely even while Trump has not ruled it out, there would need to be plans for economic, security and intelligence support, experts said.
    


            Multiple administration officials said Trump is not interested in a long, drawn-out negotiation with Maduro. Maduro will be given a shorter leash for negotiations than Trump has given to other world leaders, one of the officials said. The officials also do not consider a negotiated departure for Maduro to be likely given past failures.
    


            “The problem is Maduro has made five deals with different parties over the last 10 years and has broken every single one of them,” Rubio told Fox last week, adding that Maduro's track record doesn't mean that Trump shouldn't try to strike a deal.
    


            In October, Trump said that he had authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation, but stopped short of saying it would have authority to remove Maduro.
    


            Experts welcomed the preparation plans inside the administration to consider what comes after a potential Maduro fall, given how complicated and dangerous the situation could become.
    


            “It is a good sign. If they intend to change the regime, which they seem to be intent on, they need to have an alternative ready to go on day one,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' defense and security department. “In 2003 in Iraq the US did not have a clear plan for the day after, and the Trump administration would not want to replicate that situation.”
    


            Cancian also pointed out that having those plans could make it harder for Trump to step back from any regime change efforts.
    


            Any attempt to build a new leadership structure would put the US in the position of trying to navigate ensuring the legitimacy of a new government in the estimation of both international and domestic audiences.
    


            “When and how do you restore recognition of the Venezuelan government? If it is Maria Carina Machado and Edmundo Gonzalez who take over immediately its very clear, they would be considered a legitimately elected president so the US would restore recognition from day one,” said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist who has studied Venezuela.
    


            “But if it's a transitional government that includes people from Chavismo, how and when do you recognize the government? Recognition will determine the lifting of sanctions and access to economic support which will be critical to stabilizing the country,” he said, referencing the political movement of former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez.
    


            While the administration remains in touch with the Venezuelan opposition there are not regular meetings at a high level with officials such as Rubio, multiple sources said. The opposition's own plan for governance of the country after Maduro leaves is not an administration sanctioned endeavor, they added.
    


            Smolansky welcomed the Trump administration's ongoing efforts on Venezuela, but could not speak to the day-after planning that the administration is currently undertaking.
    


            “We are aligned with the US about having a freer and safer hemisphere reducing the influence of Cuba, Iran, Russia, and China in the hemisphere where Venezuela is the hub for those external actors,” said Smolansky, a senior security and foreign affairs adviser to Gonzalez and Machado.

Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream breaks down how the U.S. Supreme Court is considering the extent of presidential power to fire members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Trade Commission on 'Special Report.'

President Donald Trump pushed back on calls for Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas to step down, calling them both "fantastic."

Trump made the remark to Politico this week as the outlet reported that some members of the Republican Party are hoping the court's two oldest conservatives consider stepping down before the midterm elections. That would enable Trump to nominate conservatives to take their place while the Republican Party is still guaranteed control of the Senate.

"I hope they stay," Trump said, adding, "'Cause I think they're fantastic."

Alito, 75, has no plans to retire from the Supreme Court anytime soon, a source close to the justice told The Wall Street Journal in November 2024 after Trump was elected.

"Despite what some people may think, this is a man who has never thought about this job from a political perspective," a person close to Alito said to the newspaper.

"The idea that he's going to retire for political considerations is not consistent with who he is," this person added. 

Alito was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2006 by President George W. Bush.

Thomas is 77 years old. He was appointed to the court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991.

Sonia Sotomayor, appointed by President Obama in 2009, is 71. 

In 2022, a handful of House Democrats demanded that Thomas step down or be impeached because he would not recuse himself from cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Shohei Ohtani is catching up with more legends.

The baseball superstar ends 2025 by winning The Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the fourth time, tying him with Lance Armstrong, LeBron James and Tiger Woods for most among male honorees.

“Receiving this award multiple times is something truly special,” Ohtani said in Japanese in an exclusive interview with the AP.

Ohtani received 29 of 47 votes in balloting among sports journalists from the AP and its members after his two-way dominance culminated in a repeat World Series title for his Los Angeles Dodgers – delivering perhaps the greatest single-game individual performance in sports history along the way. He previously won the award in 2024, his first season with the Dodgers, and in 2023 and 2021, when he was with the Los Angeles Angels.

Baseball's biggest star has won the AP's top honor for a male athlete once again. Correspondent Gethin Coolbaugh reports.

The AP honor has been given out since 1931. Multisport standout Babe Didrikson Zaharias won six times over the 1930s, '40s and '50s, the most by a man or woman.

The ultra-competitive Ohtani's latest win broke a tie with Michael Jordan, who along with Woods, he followed while growing up in Japan.

“Last year, I said I wanted to win this award again, and I will work hard so that I can win it again next year as well,” he said.

Swedish-American pole vaulter Armand Duplantis, who won his third consecutive world title and has set the world record 14 times, including four times in 2025, was second with five votes in balloting announced Tuesday. Carlos Alcaraz, the world's top-ranked tennis player who won titles at the French and U.S. Opens, was third with four.




The AP Female Athlete of the Year will be announced Wednesday.




Ohtani has shown remarkable consistency since joining the Los Angeles Dodgers on a then-record $700 million, 10-year contract in December 2023.

He won his fourth career Most Valuable Player award (second with the Dodgers) by unanimous vote, the first player in major league history to do so.

This year, he posted a 1.014 OPS and hit 55 home runs. Returning to the mound for the first time since 2023, he had a 2.87 ERA and 62 strikeouts in 47 innings over 14 starts.

Ohtani saved his best for the postseason.

In Game 4 of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, he pitched six scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts and hit three home runs to earn MVP honors. He said it was his greatest game in a career full of incredible feats.

“If you think about it in terms of a single game, I'd say that's probably true,” he said. “It was a crucial game in the postseason, and I personally feel I played quite well in that game.”

Does he surprise himself?

“Well, yes, there are times when I feel that way about myself, and of course there are times when I think I'm not good enough,” he said, “so I suppose athletes experience both kinds of feelings.”




Ohtani showed he's human in Game 7 of the World Series. He singled in the first inning and then took the mound on short rest, but he struggled with his command. He gave up a three-run homer to Toronto's Bo Bichette along with five hits in 2 1/3 innings.

But he and the Dodgers raised a second straight World Series trophy after outlasting the Blue Jays in the most scintillating Series in recent memory.

“Shohei obviously has the weight of the world on his shoulders as far as expectations, being probably the face of baseball, certainly when you're talking about the world,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after Game 7. “It's just really special what he's done. Just a great person and a great competitor.”

Ohtani's presence has been transformative for MLB's global reach. Game 7 of this World Series averaged 13.1 million viewers in Japan, the most-watched World Series game on a single network there ever, and 51 million watched worldwide to make it the most-viewed since Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.

“I think the higher your goals are, the more you have to do, and the more you want to do,” he said. “If you're satisfied with where you are now, I don't think it's possible to achieve your goals without putting in the effort. So, setting goals high is what I believe is most important.”

The Dodgers carefully managed Ohtani's return to pitching this year by gradually increasing his workload after rehabbing from elbow surgery in September 2023. His innings were initially capped before he was allowed to make longer starts as he felt better.

“When it comes to feeling nervous, being on the mound definitely makes me more tense,” he said. “It's a position where you can single-handedly ruin a game, and at the same time, it's also a position where you can contribute to a win. So, in my mind, I feel that being a pitcher is truly a special role.”

At 31, Ohtani has undergone three major surgeries: two on his right elbow and another on his left shoulder. Regardless of the physical and mental wear and tear, he plans on remaining a two-way player his entire career.

“I think it's best to keep doing it right up until the moment I retire,” he said.

Ohtani plans to play for Japan in the World Baseball Classic in March.

“I'm still not sure whether I'll be pitching,” he said. “I've been given permission to play in the tournament, but as for how much and in what way, including on the batting side, that's something we'll be discussing.”

Winning a third consecutive World Series championship is among Ohtani's biggest goals in 2026.

“Staying healthy and appearing in every game without injury, that's the smallest goal I have,” he said.

Ohtani became a father for the first time when his wife, Mamiko Tanaka, gave birth to their daughter in April. He carefully guards against revealing her name and any details about his home life. No word on how his beloved dog Decoy reacted to having a new sibling, either.

Ohtani's American fans enjoy hearing him speak English on the rare occasions he's done so publicly, including at both World Series celebrations. He understands most of the language, although he uses an interpreter in interviews.

“I think it would be best if I could speak in English, so even if it's just small steps, I want to keep working at it,” he said. “Whether it's with fans or in different situations, being able to speak directly in English might help bridge the gap between us.”

In the meantime, he'll keep letting his bat and arm speak volumes.

“Fog of war” is the least of it.

The post-modern philosopher Jean Baudrillard infamously argued in 1991 that the Gulf War did not take place, by which he did not mean that no fighting had actually occurred, but that the real events were something entirely separate from the carefully choreographed presentation the world saw thanks to the novel phenomenon of 24-hour cable news.

It's tempting to wonder what Baudrillard would have made of the current US military buildup targeting Venezuela, a campaign that often appears to be driven by narratives with only a tangential relationship to actual events taking place.

Take, for instance, President Donald Trump's dramatic announcement on his Truth Social platform a little over a week ago: “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.”

As Reuters reported, US officials “were surprised by Trump's announcement and unaware of any ongoing U.S. military operations to enforce a closure of Venezuelan airspace.” The US not only took no actions to affect the “closure” of Venezuelan airspace; a migrant repatriation flight from the US landed in Venezuela just a few days later.

Or take Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's invocation of the “fog of war” to justify the deadly US strike in September, in which defenseless survivors of an initial strike were allegedly killed by a follow-up. “Fog of war” is a phrase that generally refers to uncertainty in the midst of combat, and it's hard to understand how it would apply to a situation where the targets could not plausibly be a threat to those firing on them.

While there are Trump administration hawks who have wanted US action to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from office for years, the ostensible justification for the military buildup in the Caribbean and the related ongoing campaign of strikes against alleged drug boats is that the US is under siege from deadly narcotics pushed by the Venezuelan “narcoterrorists.”

Lawmakers have defended the deadly US strike in September, saying it “probably saved thousands of American lives.” This echoes Trump himself, who has claimed that “Every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives.”

These numbers would make some sense if the drug in question were the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl: The Drug Enforcement Administration claims that one kilogram of fentanyl has the potential to kill 500,000 people. Trump has explicitly said on several instances that the boats were carrying “mostly fentanyl.”

But these boats are almost certainly not carrying fentanyl, which is almost entirely shipped into the US overland from Mexico, often by US citizens — not on speedboats from South America. Assuming these boats really are carrying drugs, which has been disputed in some cases, it's almost certainly cocaine, which is hundreds of times less deadly. Cocaine also causes thousands of overdose deaths in the US every year, though most of what's moving on these boats is likely headed for Europe.

This shouldn't come as much surprise to Americans, including Trump supporters, given that the administration spent much of its early months blaming China, Mexico, and (less credibly) Canada for the fentanyl crisis.

In any event, Venezuela is a major transhipment point for narcotics, but it's not a major producer of them. The idea that it's the key to solving America's drug crisis (fentanyl, cocaine, or any other drug) doesn't make much sense.

If the case for military force is based on confusing and contradictory premises, that would make sense, given that it's not always clear what the actual target is either.

Adding to the sense of a virtual buildup is the administration's decision to designate Venezuela's “Cartel de los Soles” as a foreign terrorist organization, naming Maduro itself as its leader. “Cartel de los Soles” is not actually a cartel or even really an organization. It's a term used by Venezuelans to refer to the cadre of senior military officials involved in a range of criminal activities. But the designation appears to be part of an effort to build a political case for military action, though it actually conveys no such legal authority. The administration has also claimed, contradicting its own intelligence agencies, that Maduro is in control of the criminal gang Tren de Aragua.

Trump is not the only one contributing to a sense of unreality. The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was criticized recently for amplifying baseless claims, repeated by Trump, that the Maduro government meddled in the 2020 US election.

With accusations of the manipulation of intelligence and growing momentum for regime change, the Venezuela situation has been compared to the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war. But there's been far less effort to produce evidence for the Trump administration's narrative around Venezuela than there was to sell evidence that Saddam Hussein's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction.

The other key difference is that even if the US ultimately does launch strikes inside Venezuela, or even seeks to oust Maduro, there's little chance of a protracted Iraq-style ground invasion. The forces the US has deployed to the region simply aren't set up for that. There's still a strong possibility that the US will launch some demonstrative airstrikes against drug labs or rebel camps in Venezuela and then move on to the next issue. It feels less like Iraq war redux than the sort of thing an AI model trained on histories of the Iraq war era might produce.

The lives of the nearly 90 people killed so far in US boat strikes are real, as are the Venezuelan civilians and US service members who would be put at risk if strikes on land begin, as are the thousands of Americans killed by drug overdoses every year and those living under Maduro's crumbling dictatorship. But in contrast to other recent military actions, there's a sense of unreality about this buildup.

Seniors' rising political influence is a threat to economic growth.

America is getting old.

Between 1960 and 2024, the share of Americans over 65 doubled — from 9 percent to 18 percent. And the US will only grow grayer in the coming years. Within a decade, America's seniors will outnumber its children for the first time in history, according to Census Bureau projections. By 2060, those over 65 are expected to comprise about one quarter of the population.

This demographic transition will be a defining fact of the 21st century, shaping nearly every part of American life. But its political implications are liable to be especially profound — and immediate: Seniors already accounted for 29 percent of the US electorate in 2024.

Older voters have always exerted disproportionate political influence, due to their exceptionally high turnout rates. Historically, however, seniors' power was limited by their small share of the population. Now, that constraint is steadily loosening.

This could be a problem for America's rising generations. US public policy has long disfavored the young. By international standards, our welfare state offers meager support to families with children, even as it provides robust benefits for retirees. And the latter programs are likely to consume an ever-larger share of the federal budget in the coming decades, a shift that could burden younger Americans with higher tax rates or borrowing costs, while crowding out new spending on their needs. Our nation's housing policies, meanwhile, privilege (disproportionately older) homeowners over renters.

Seniors' growing electoral clout could deepen these imbalances. And there are signs it already has. As the electorate has aged over the last few years, economic policy has grown even more tilted against the young.

This drift towards gerontocracy — government of, by, and for the old — doesn't just undermine the interests of millennials or zoomers. It also threatens the prosperity of America as a whole.

In states across the country, governments have recently shifted tax burdens away from older generations and toward younger ones.

In some cases, this elder bias is explicit and intentional. Since 2022, Texas, Colorado, Iowa, and Pennsylvania have all slashed property taxes specifically for homeowners 65 or older. At the same time, a slew of states have begun exempting retirement income from taxation. Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and West Virginia ended taxes on Social Security benefits, while Iowa abolished the taxation of all forms of retirement income — from 401(k) withdrawals to pension benefits — for residents over 55.

The principal function of these measures is not to rescue cash-strapped seniors from poverty. Federal rules already shield indigent retirees from income taxes. Broad exemptions deliver the bulk of their benefits to the affluent. An analysis of Illinois's long-standing tax breaks on retirement income found that households earning over $175,000 collected 60 percent of the benefits. Research into the distributional implications of other states' exemptions has yielded similar findings.

And tax policies that explicitly favor the old are only part of the story. There has also been a broader turn against property taxes on all existing homeowners — a shift that tends to benefit affluent seniors at younger families' expense.

The present rebellion against property taxation has been remarkably widespread. Texas has enacted especially steep cuts, reducing property taxes by $18 billion in 2023. But less sweeping reductions have passed in Georgia, North Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Idaho, among other places. And more ambitious reforms may be in the offing: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has floated a plan to eliminate all property taxes in his state.

The aging of the electorate did not singlehandedly kick off this tax-cutting trend. Rather, the primary trigger was post-COVID inflation, which raised homeowners' tax bills by increasing their properties' nominal value (if the price level goes up, the market value of your home typically will too).

Nevertheless, policymakers' focus on this dimension of the cost-of-living crisis likely reflected seniors' disproportionate political influence. Although plenty of millennial homeowners have benefited from property tax cuts, younger Americans as a whole stand to gain less — and lose more — from such measures than older ones do.

The reasons for this are simple. Nearly 79 percent of US seniors own their homes, while only 39 percent of Americans under 35 do. And property tax cuts deliver larger benefits for homeowners than for renters.

This wouldn't be much of a problem for younger generations, if property tax cuts did not need to be paid for. But they generally do. In the long run, maintaining lower levies on property typically requires states to either charge higher sales and income taxes or pare back government services. In either case, younger Americans will disproportionately bear the burdens. Working-age people pay more in income taxes than retirees, and they're also more likely to have young children, whose school systems rely on property tax revenue. Funding constraints are already leading some municipalities to scale back their commitments to public education. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of US school districts in session only four days a week jumped from 650 to nearly 900.

Meanwhile, some recent property tax cuts massively favor longtime homeowners over first-time buyers. In 2024, Georgia and Alabama both capped the amount that a homeowner's assessed property value can rise in a given year. Over time, these policies can have radically inequitable consequences.

This is well-illustrated by Florida's longstanding cap on assessment growth. In the Sunshine State, a home's taxable value cannot rise by more than 3 percent annually, no matter how much its market price has changed, so long as its current homeowner maintains possession. Since much of Florida's real estate has appreciated at a far faster pace, this policy has opened up a massive gap between how much longtime homeowners and new buyers must pay in taxes for the same properties. According to a report from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a young family purchasing a Miami townhouse in 2024 would owe three times as much in property taxes as an older neighbor who'd been occupying an identical unit since 2006.

As state lawmakers were tilting tax codes in seniors' favor, Congress was shifting social spending in the same direction.

As already noted, America's welfare state has long given short shrift to young families. In 2021, the United States spent just 0.6 percent of its GDP on benefits for children and their parents — far below the OECD average of 2.3 percent.

That same year, America spent 7.2 percent of GDP on public pensions, placing it only a bit behind the OECD average of 8.5 percent. And this disparity is partly attributable to the fact that America is younger than the typical rich country.

The federal budget's age bias would have deepened over the past four years, even if legislators hadn't changed a single policy. The baby boom generation's drift into retirement — combined with the healthcare sector's climbing costs — would have been sufficient to push up the share of spending dedicated to seniors.

But Congress accelerated this trend by expanding social benefits for the old, while cutting spending on programs that primarily benefit working-age Americans.

The Biden administration did not intend this outcome. With the aid of a Democratic Congress, it established a new monthly benefit for families with young children in 2021. But the White House only found the political will to fund this program for a single year.

By contrast, Biden oversaw a permanent expansion in elder benefits. At the end of 2024, Congress passed a bill effectively increasing Social Security payments to public-sector workers, at an annual cost of nearly $20 billion.

This law addressed a nuance in the pre-existing entitlement system: Many public sector workers are not subject to Social Security taxes, as they pay into their own separate pension plans instead. For this reason, they traditionally did not receive full Social Security benefits in addition to their public pensions, even if they worked briefly in the private sector before retirement. The 2024 law changed this, enabling public-sector workers to collect both their pensions and full Social Security benefits.

Many analysts decried this arrangement as unfair. In their view, a worker who did not pay into Social Security with every paycheck should not receive the same benefits as one who did. And providing full benefits to workers who are already receiving public pensions may undermine the progressivity of the Social Security program, while accelerating the exhaustion of its trust fund.

Nevertheless, in a striking testament to older voters' political clout, congressional Republicans supported the law. Which is to say: The GOP increased welfare benefits for an overwhelmingly Democratic constituency (public sector workers are left-leaning), in a manner that struck many technocratic experts as excessively generous. It is hard to imagine conservatives getting on board with such a proposal, were its beneficiaries younger than 65.

Yet Trump's GOP has largely embraced social spending that is explicitly earmarked for seniors. Under Donald Trump, Republicans have forsworn cuts to Social Security and Medicare — and created new tax benefits for the old — even as they've made large spending cuts to programs that primarily benefit Americans under 65.

To be sure, the GOP did finance its regressive tax cuts this year with large reductions in Medicaid spending, which will adversely impact many older Americans. But Medicaid primarily benefits non-retirees. And Trump concentrated his cuts on prime-age Americans, many of whom will lose coverage due to Medicaid's new work requirements, which do not apply to seniors.

The president's policies are most lamentable for their socioeconomic implications, not their generational ones. As a result of his Medicaid cuts, more low-income Americans of all ages will struggle to secure the care they need. And his food stamp cuts will make it harder for the impoverished to feed themselves. His agenda has, in effect, taken from the poor to give to the upper middle class and wealthy.

Yet it is also true that the past four years of policymaking have left America with a welfare state even more heavily weighted towards seniors than it had been before.

The economic conflicts between the generations should not be exaggerated. Most young people plan to get old someday. Americans of all ages, therefore, have an interest in their government maintaining robust Medicare and Social Security benefits. And there is no reason in principle why such entitlements must come at the expense of social spending on the young.

If the United States raised taxes on the rich and middle-class, forced down our medical providers' exorbitant payment rates, and enacted growth-enhancing economic reforms, then we could plausibly sustain generous entitlement benefits while creating a child allowance for young parents, expanding unemployment benefits for the jobless, and guaranteeing healthcare coverage for all.

But this is not our current social bargain. Rather, America's present arrangement entails:

The losers of this system are not uniformly young, and the winners aren't universally old. Nonetheless, there is reason to fear that the graying of the US electorate will reinforce our political economy's pathologies. After all, seniors are relatively insulated from its inequities and inefficiencies. And across countries, older voters tend to prioritize their narrow material interests over both spending on children and economic growth, while also opposing liberal immigration policies. Partly for these reasons, democracies older than the US — such as Italy and Japan — have suffered from tepid growth and wildly age-biased public spending.

America isn't necessarily doomed to continue on its present trajectory.

Although seniors' share of the electorate is steadily growing, the vast majority of voters will remain under 65 for decades to come. Older Americans owe their influence not merely to sheer numbers, but also to their higher rates of political engagement and organization. The young could theoretically choose to follow their elders' example and organize in defense of their own interests.

The Yes in My Backyard (YIMBY) movement offers a case in point. Composed largely of young renters, YIMBY organizations across the country have agitated against zoning policies that privilege homeowners over tenants. YIMBYs' fundamental aim — to make housing abundant and affordable —would benefit renters of all ages and make America as a whole more prosperous. Nevertheless, tight restrictions on homebuilding impose greater costs on the young than the old. Thus, absent YIMBYs' mobilization, America was likely to adopt more restrictive housing policies as it grew older. Instead, municipalities across the country have made it easier to build homes in recent years.

If younger voters stand up for their broader material interests in a similar fashion, America's political economy just might age gracefully.

            When the announcement broke that the Trump administration would halt and rereview immigration cases for certain refugees who arrived during the Biden presidency, Jafar Wahidi's phone started ringing nonstop.
    


            “People are really concerned about this,” Wahidi said. “They are really worried.”
    


            Wahidi helps run Afghan Hope Community Development, a volunteer-led nonprofit that assists Afghan refugees and families in the Sacramento, California, area. They've helped more than 5,000 Afghan families in the past five years, he says, and the fear spread almost instantly, and well before the shooting near the White House.
    


            “Even people who are here legally, they are calling me because they are afraid,” Wahidi said.
    


            One family called him asking whether they should still plan to attend their citizenship test in early December. Others, already scheduled for naturalization interviews this month, worry showing up could expose them to scrutiny or arrest.
    


            “People worry any action might cause separation of children or spouse,” Wahidi said. “The communities and the families – they are hopeless, completely.”
    


            From recent arrivals still waiting for work permits or green cards to longtime residents trying to reunite with spouses and children still in Afghanistan or in the region, he says many are now “giving up” on the idea of a stable future in the United States.
    


            After working as an interpreter for the American coalition in Afghanistan, Wahidi resettled in California with his wife and seven children in 2017. Now, he says the life he built may not be available to many he is trying to help.
    


            The panic Wahidi describes is rippling across the Afghan diaspora after a rapid one-two punch of policy shifts and breaking news right before the holidays.
    


            First, an internal memo dated November 21 showed the Trump administration planned to reinterview and rereview refugees admitted under President Joe Biden.
    


            The memo, which CNN reported November 24, instructed officers to reassess whether refugees met criteria at the time of admission; allowed for termination of refugee status with no right to appeal; and ordered a hold on pending green card applications for refugees until further notice. A year after refugees are admitted to the country, they are required under US law to apply for permanent status.
    


            Refugee advocates called the move “unspeakably cruel,” warning that threatening to revoke protections could re-traumatize people who had already undergone years of intensive US security vetting.
    


            Then came the attack near the White House on November 26 in which two West Virginia National Guard members were ambushed and shot, one fatally. Within hours, after authorities identified the suspect as an immigrant from Afghanistan, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it would stop processing all Afghan-related immigration cases “indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
    


            Days later, Trump said the pause in asylum request processing could be in effect for “a long time.” “We don't want those people,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One. “You know why we don't want them? Because many of them are no good and they shouldn't be in our country.”
    


            The Department of Homeland Security identified the alleged gunman as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the United States in 2021 through Biden's Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration.
    


            Altogether, more than 190,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US since 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome and its successor, Enduring Welcome, according to the State Department. Another 260,000 Afghans remain abroad waiting for US entry, often in precarious conditions, according to Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, an organization that relocates and resettles Afghan people. Many of them are in Afghanistan and face persecution by the Taliban, he told CNN.
    


            Wahidi said he noticed immediate changes on the ground in California when he tried to get in touch with Citizenship and Immigration offices. “No one was answering the phone, no one was responding (to) emails, so then we knew that something happened,” Wahidi said. “They stopped the process.”
    


            Most of his clients are waiting for work permits, green cards or asylum decisions﻿. Clients scheduled for citizenship interviews in early December have flooded his office with questions: Should they still go? Will the appointments be canceled? “I told them we don't have any update,” Wahidi said.
    


What is Operation Allies Welcome, the program officials say brought the DC shooting suspect to the US?



            On December 1, Wahidi said, he received an alert from the nonprofit NorCal Resist warning of what it described as “an increase in ICE arrests of Afghan neighbors,” claiming multiple Afghans had been detained at the Sacramento Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office and many others had been called to report immediately. “A young Afghan mother of a toddler was placed on surveillance through an ankle-monitor,” the alert read, adding a phone number for a legal aid hotline at the bottom.
    


            CNN could not independently verify those arrests, and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            The alert reflects the level of anxiety gripping Afghan communities in Northern California. Inside Wahidi's office, he says, the toll is visible. “When they come to our office, we can see it in their faces,” he said. “They are scared.”
    


            Many of the families he hears from are split across continents: a husband in California, a wife and young child in Afghanistan, relatives waiting in Qatar for final visa steps that have now paused indefinitely. “They are worried about their futures,” he said. “Especially for the people who live in Pakistan, in Doha, and here, we completely lost our hope.”
    


            Across the country, Afghan American organizations are trying to balance grief for the National Guard members with deep concern about politicization of the attack.
    


            Joseph Azam, board chair of the Afghan-American Foundation – the largest national Afghan American advocacy organization in the United States – said in a video message anyone responding to the shooting should begin with “unequivocal condemnation” of the “heinous” violence against the two Guard members and their families. But he sharply criticized political leaders and media figures who he said have seized on the attack to generalize about Afghans.
    


            “It has been absolutely disgraceful,” Azam said, to watch people use “this moment of tremendous pain and agony and fear in our country as an opportunity to create division – to scapegoat Afghans, to scapegoat American Muslims, to scapegoat immigrants.”
    


            “Anybody who is able to commit such an abhorrent, horrific and heinous act is committing an act that's beyond the pale of humanity,” he added. “That is the baseline from which our response should start.”
    


            Azam urged Americans to remember the tens of thousands of Afghan Americans who serve “across our armed forces and in harm's way,” including some currently serving in the National Guard units now shaken by the shooting – even as their communities face heightened scrutiny.
    


            Other organizations have issued similar calls. AfghanEvac issued a statement within hours of the shooting condemning it and asking Americans to not demonize an entire country because of the actions of one person.
    


            “Those who would twist this moment to attack Afghan families aren't seeking safety or justice – they're exploiting division and endangering all of us,” the statement read.
    


            In practice, the sentiment in these communities is they are being left behind.
    


            A grassroots group calling itself the Afghan Coalition of the United States said in a statement to CNN, “for two decades, the Afghan people stood alongside U.S. forces in the fight against terrorism. Thousands of Afghan soldiers, police officers, interpreters, staff, and civilians sacrificed their lives for this shared mission. The wrongdoing of one person must not overshadow this historic partnership and collective sacrifice.”
    


            While Afghans in the United States brace for new scrutiny, Afghans still waiting abroad – including those who once worked closest to American forces – say the freeze has placed them in immediate danger.
    


            Mohammad, a former Afghan National Army officer who asked that his full name not be made public for fear of retaliation, said he spent more than a decade working “shoulder to shoulder with coalition forces.” From 2015 to 2018, he was an escort to Taliban detainees at Bagram Air Base – a role that, he says, left him recognizable to the very people now in power.
    


            Once the Biden administration announced Afghans with active cases could move to a second country for processing, Mohammad says, he got his wife and two young children ready. “Because of that, we sold everything we owned, including our household items, thinking we would be able to leave.”
    


            He said he envisioned his children growing up in California or Virginia, in communities with Afghan families and safe schools.
    


            When the Afghan government collapsed in 2021, he says, the Taliban summoned him for interrogation and later attempted a night arrest. He fled first to the capital, Kabul, then across the border into Pakistan with his family.
    


            In Pakistan, he says, he was accepted into the US P-1 refugee referral program. “It felt like a door to safety had finally opened for me and my family,” he said. “After years of danger, I finally felt hope.”
    


            But instead of advancing, his case stalled. And then, last month, everything collapsed.
    


            On November 25, during Thanksgiving week, Mohammad says the Pakistani government told him he could no longer stay in the country, and he was deported the same day to Afghanistan. His children, ages 5 and 7, traveled with him on what he described as a long, punishing journey back into Taliban-controlled territory.
    


            “Now we have nothing, and we are living in very difficult conditions in someone else's house,” Mohammed said.
    


            Since returning to Afghanistan, Mohammad says, he has been in hiding, fearing Taliban members might recognize their former jailer.
    


            “If they recognize me, they would hang me,” he said. “My life and my family's lives are under threat.”
    


            Mohammed says the entire time he worked with US soldiers, there was mutual respect. “Many of them understood the risks we were taking and cared about the Afghan people. We shared the same mission, and their support kept us alive in dangerous situations,” he said.
    


            “I want Americans to know that people like me did not just work a job,” he said. “We put our lives and our families' lives at risk to stand with them. We believed in the values of safety, freedom and justice. We were their partners, their eyes and ears on the ground. Many of us are still in danger because of that service. We are not asking for favors; we are simply asking for safety and the chance to live without fear.”
    


            With US processing now frozen, he says, he is weighing other options. One of them is Brazil, which created a special humanitarian program for Afghans after the Taliban takeover and has since issued more than 13,000 visas, but now requires local organizations to sponsor each application. Others in a similar situation to Mohammed have told CNN they are also considering Ireland, which has resettled 700 Afghans since 2021 and also requires community sponsorships, and Mexico – the latter on a temporary basis, for its proximity to the United States.
    


            “Right now, the best-case scenario is simple,” he said. “Safety. I hope my family can reach a country where my children can go to school and where I can work and rebuild our lives. If the US can accept us, that would be ideal because my case was already in process there. But any safe country that gives us protection would be a blessing.”
    


            Advocates warn that thousands of Afghans like Mohammad – former partners of US forces who moved to third countries for processing – may now be stranded indefinitely, vulnerable to Taliban retribution and worsening economic hardship.
    


            Back in Sacramento, Wahidi says his community feels abandoned.
    


            “Every day I receive calls from my people – ‘My green card isn't approved, my asylum isn't approved, I don't have food, I don't have a job,'” he said. “It is too hard for them to live here in America. Now this has made it even harder.”
    


            Afghans who staked their lives on the US mission are now questioning whether the country still wants them, he says.
    


            “We sacrificed for American people and for America and for Afghanistan,” he said, pointing to the thousands of Afghans who were killed while fighting on America's side. “We hope they help us here, too.”

A strange porn subculture reveals what life online is doing to us.

Open the internet today, and you'll find entire worlds most of us never encounter. Spaces built around practices so strange, so hyper-specific, they read like satire at first glance.

One of the most unsettling of these worlds calls itself the GoonVerse. It's a digital subculture organized around endless pornography and what can only be described as ritualized masturbation. The surface is absurd. The deeper story is not. GoonVerse is a distorted mirror held up to the rest of us, a warning about what happens to a culture — and to our own minds — when constant stimulation becomes the only reliable source of comfort.

Few writers have explored this frontier more vividly than Daniel Kolitz. His Harper's essay, “The Goon Squad,” is part ethnography, part cultural diagnosis, and part prophecy about where the internet may be taking all of us. I invited Kolitz onto The Gray Area to talk about what he discovered inside these communities and what “gooning” — he'll explain below — reveals about the rest of us.

As always, there's much more in the full podcast, which drops every Monday, so listen and follow us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What's your simplest definition of gooning?

Gooning is really two things. On one level, it's a new way of masturbating that's built around edging. If people aren't familiar with the term, edging is when you bring yourself to the point of climax without climaxing. The goal is to hold that heightened state for as long as possible.

Gooners push that to extremes. They edge for hours, sometimes for days, trying to reach what they call the “goon state,” a kind of masturbation nirvana. They describe it as total bliss, where the world falls away and they're fully immersed in pornography. Some people compare it to advanced meditation, except the object of focus is porn.

The second meaning is communal. Gooning is also the online subculture that's formed around this practice. There are big Discord servers and Twitter pockets where gooners gather. They goon together on camera, play porn-themed games, trade porn, talk about porn. Some of it's ironic, some of it's role play, and some of it is very sincere. Many present themselves as extreme porn addicts who openly embrace being consumed by porn.

Why did you think something this weird and fringe was worth writing about? 

At the surface level, the sheer luridness is fascinating. Once you enter these spaces, you find an incredibly elaborate vocabulary and subculture. Not just “goon state” but “goon fuel,” “goon caves,” all these niche terms. You look around and think, Someone needs to document this.

But there were bigger forces pulling me in. When I started reporting, softcore content was exploding on major social platforms and funneling people toward OnlyFans. I wasn't scandalized, but I did find it striking that I could open Instagram in the afternoon and basically be served porn.

When you logged into these Discords, what did you see that stunned you?

One of the first servers I entered was called the GoonVerse, which had around 50,000 members when I joined. That's huge for such a niche porn community. I clicked on a stream without knowing what to expect, and it looked like a Zoom call where every square was a different person masturbating to the same video. The camera frames were neck down, but everyone was enthusiastically going at it while chatting together.

And the porn itself wasn't normal porn. It was hyper-edited, rapid-fire montage. Nothing stayed onscreen for more than a second or two. The cuts were constant. The pacing was frantic. It felt like a sensory assault. That was my entry point, and it was so bizarre that I had to understand who these people were.

You start digging around, talking to people, trying to understand how this fits into their lives. And a lot of them wanted to talk. This wasn't like pulling teeth.

Not at all. They were thrilled. And that surprised me. This isn't something you can talk about at work or at a family dinner. You can't say, I spent the weekend in my goon cave. So you end up with this huge part of your life that's basically unspeakable.

And for many of them, it really is a hobby. They invest money in gear, spend tons of time, form friendships. It's a lifestyle. But it's a lifestyle you can't explain to anyone outside the community. So when someone shows up and says, I'll listen and you'll be anonymous, people open up. Many seemed relieved to finally talk about what had taken over so much of their mental space.

You use the word “hobby.” Is that how most gooners think of it? Is this a hobby, an identity, a lifestyle, an addiction?

It's complicated. Start with the addiction piece. The whole conceit of being a gooner is that you're addicted to porn. Gooning is a kink where the kink is the idea that you're a hopeless porn addict. People fantasize about worlds completely dominated by porn, like porn on billboards in Times Square. It's a kind of meta pornography.

But this overlaps with real debates about addiction. There's a big argument, both in academia and in amateur anti-masturbation circles, about whether porn addiction is a meaningful clinical diagnosis. The mainstream view right now is that porn use doesn't fit the established criteria for addiction the way heroin or gambling does. Studies often show that people's sense of being addicted tracks closely with how ashamed they feel.

So the line between hobby and addiction is blurry. And when the digital economy is engineered to make us dependent on stimulation, it's hard to know where that line even is. Gooners lean into this ambiguity. It's a hobby, an identity, a lifestyle, and in many cases, it feels like an addiction, whether or not a clinician would call it that.

You assumed, and I would've assumed, that most of these people would be deeply maladjusted incel types. But you say a lot of them were “distressingly normal.” What was distressing about the normality?

They didn't fit the stereotype. They weren't frothing misogynists. They weren't socially incoherent. Most were twenty-somethings who were polite, self-aware, sometimes even sweet. That made it more unsettling, because it forced me to abandon the idea that this was just fringe pathology.

It doesn't mean nothing troubling was happening. There are ethical questions around porn and objectification. But if the incel stance is “I hate women because they won't sleep with me,” the gooner stance is closer to, “I can't get a date, that's fine, I love women anyway, and I'll masturbate for 15 hours.” It's less outward anger and more a surrender to the screen.

How many of the gooners you talked to still have sex with actual people?

In my questionnaire, over 100 people responded. Roughly 40 percent said they were sexually active in some capacity. That could mean a lot of things, but the majority identified as “pornosexual,” which means they have no real interest in physical sex. Porn is their sex life.

For some, that's tied to a nihilistic posture. They eroticize being unlovable or broken. For others, it's framed as stability. They say, I work out, I have my games, my friends, my porn, and I avoid romantic relationships because they're too chaotic.

Older gooners were more likely to have relationships. Younger ones, raised entirely online, often said they had no interest in sex at all. There's that guy in the piece who says he can't have sex because he can't tolerate not knowing what's in someone else's mind. That feels incredibly specific to this era.

That level of inwardness only happens when your entire social world is mediated. When you interact primarily through screens, you get used to hyper-controlled communication. So the ambiguity of real relationships becomes terrifying. Younger gooners grew up in curated digital spaces. They have gaming friends, Discord circles, parasocial bonds with creators, and porn that never talks back. Real relationships feel not just hard but unnecessary.

This is where the story becomes about a lot more than porn. When did you realize you were looking at a funhouse mirror for the whole attention economy?

Last winter, when I was at peak goon anthropology. I'd wake up dreading the day because I knew I'd be opening my laptop and immersing myself in PMVs [porn music videos] and Discord streams. I watched hundreds of PMVs. I could feel my brain decaying. It wasn't just the porn. It was the editing, the pace, the inability to rest on a single image.

And then I started noticing the same dynamic everywhere. On the subway, people weren't reading. They were watching TikToks or Family Guy clips or gameplay replays. Video was swallowing everything. The stimulation wasn't unique to porn. It was built into every platform.

Around that time, a friend gave me Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death. Postman was writing about television decades ago, arguing that a visual culture erodes our ability to sustain attention. He worried about Sesame Street. Now we've taken those concerns and put them on steroids.

So you start asking, how different is gooning from the way the rest of us use the internet? If you set the masturbation aside, how different is it from compulsively watching YouTube or binging Netflix?

Fundamentally, it's not. If you zoom out and look at what the person is doing physically, they're sitting in front of a screen chasing stimulation. The content matters less than the behavior.

The mechanics are identical. Infinite scroll, the dopamine hit of the next thing, the constant craving for novelty.

PMVs are just the most stimulating version of that. They're freebasing content. And when platforms started allowing more softcore content, that wasn't surprising. If your goal is engagement, porn is the most potent tool. Gooning just takes that logic and strips away the pretense.

Is this where the internet was always going? Was gooning inevitable?

We've always had the capacity to destroy ourselves with entertainment. David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest imagines a film so pleasurable people watch it until they die. That book came out before the modern internet.

Once you can produce endless stimulation, it'll be exploited. Maybe the internet could've been designed differently at the edges. But a global system that connects everyone instantly was always going to tilt toward hyperstimulation. I don't want to erase the good. The internet shaped my friendships and my career. But the same tools that create connection also create this.

U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro gives an update on the National Guard shooting investigation and the condition of one of the victims on 'The Story.'

FIRST ON FOX: Senate Republicans are teeing up an investigation into former President Joe Biden's immigration parole programs, which they argue are what allowed the alleged D.C. National Guard shooter into the country.

Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., are set to lead a hearing looking into the Biden administration's parole policies later this month, Fox News Digital has learned.

The announcement of the hearing, slated for Dec. 16, comes on the heels of the shooting of two National Guard members — U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, who was wounded, and U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, who was killed — allegedly by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan man that entered the country under Biden's Operation Allies Welcome in 2021.

Operation Allies Welcome was launched in the midst of Biden's botched withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, which led to the eventual Taliban takeover of the country after U.S. forces exited.

Biden at the time directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to coordinate the resettlement of "vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked alongside us in Afghanistan for the past two decades, as they safely resettle in the United States," according to an archived explainer from the Biden-led DHS.

BONDI WARNS OF VETTING FAILURES AFTER 'FRIGHTENING' ARREST OF AFGHAN NATIONAL FOR BOMB THREATS IN TEXAS

Josh Hawley (R-MO) questions acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. and Deputy Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Paul Abbate during a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Government Affairs committees in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on July 30, 2024 in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla)

Cornyn, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that he had been warning of repercussions that the policy would have, and that "now those concerns have become reality, with deadly consequences."

"There will be no greater stain on Joe Biden's legacy than that of his failed immigration parole programs, which he abused time after time to welcome into the U.S. hundreds of thousands of unvetted illegal aliens and potential terrorists who hate our country and want to kill Americans," Cornyn said.

Hawley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that he had been sounding the alarm on "the Biden Administration's refusal to vet evacuees," since 2021.

The lawmaker noted in a post on X at the time that an email shared with him by a U.S. official present during the evacuation in Afghanistan that he was ordered by Biden to "fill up the planes — even without vetting."

"And now their recklessness has opened the door to terrorism within our borders, including the deadly attack on our national Guardsman two weeks ago," Hawley said. "There needs to be accountability."

Their hearing also follows demands from several Senate Republicans in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which Cornyn also signed on to, that vetting standards for Afghan nationals be revisited and beefed up in the wake of the shooting in Washington, D.C.

Jay Glazer gave updates on Jayden Daniels' return, changes to the Philadelphia Eagles' offense and more.

The Los Angeles Chargers forced Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts to commit a career-high in turnovers, including a game-winning interception in overtime near the end zone to seal a 22-19 victory on "Monday Night Football."

Both the Eagles and Chargers came into this game with an 8-4 record, but it's the latter who helped their playoff chances as they move to 9-4.

Meanwhile, the Eagles, still owners of the NFC East lead, moved to 8-5.

It was a turnover-filled game for both of these teams, but it was Hurts who had five total turnovers as he threw four interceptions, including one on what could've been a game-winning drive in overtime.

On first-and-10 from the Chargers' 17-yard line and down three points, Hurts sold a play-action to Saquon Barkley and rolled out to his right. He was looking to hit Jahan Dotson near the goal line, but Cam Hart, who had one of the interceptions earlier in the game, laid out and made a tremendous tip of the pass.

Safety Tony Jefferson was streaking over to cover Dotson, and he quickly located the football in the air, secured it and stayed in bounds as SoFi Stadium erupted.

EAGLES STAR TURNS THE BALL OVER TWICE IN ONE CHAOTIC PLAY VS CHARGERS

It was a play that helped the Chargers squeak out a victory at home, but it wasn't easy as the Eagles' defense kept their team in the game with forced turnovers themselves.

Justin Herbert, who was seven days from having his left hand surgically repaired, was also intercepted and saw a strip-sack go the Eagles' way on back-to-back drives near the end of the first half.

But while Herbert struggled in the pass game (12-of-26 for 139 yards and a touchdown pass to Omarion Hampton on the opening drive), he was able to get the job done with his legs.

Herbert rushed 10 times for 66 yards to lead his team in the ground game, which included 26 yards on the final drive in regulation to allow Cameron Dicker the chance to nail his fourth of five field goal attempts to force overtime.

He did so again when the Chargers first got the ball in overtime, where Dicker would bury a 54-yard attempt to go a perfect 5-for-5 to take the 22-19 lead.

Philadelphia would catch a massive break in their overtime drive after Odafe Oweh was called for a neutral zone infraction on fourth-and-4, allowing a fresh set of downs on what could've been the game-ending play.

Nonetheless, this Chargers' defense came through when they needed another turnover all night long, and it was only right they sealed the deal in the end.

The leading receiver for the Chargers was Kimani Vidal, who took a short pass 60 yards on the opening drive for Los Angeles that ultimately set up Hampton's touchdown catch in his return from breaking his left ankle in Week 5.

For the Eagles, they were able to sack Herbert seven times, as Jalyx Hunt led the way with 2.5 sacks on the night. On offense, Hurts connected well with A.J. Brown, as he secured six of his 13 targets for 100 yards. Dallas Goedert added 78 yards on eight catches, while DeVonta Smith had four catches for 37 yards.

Barkley, who the Eagles and its fanbase have been hoping could break out like he did in 2024, managed to fly for 52 yards into the end zone at the beginning of the fourth quarter for a touchdown that made it 16–13 Eagles. He had 122 yards rushing on 20 touches in the backfield.

Hurts finished the game 21-of-40 for 240 yards with no touchdowns — one to Brown was called back earlier in the game due to a Jordan Mailata holding penalty — and his four interceptions.

Hurts also fumbled on a play where he was intercepted, as he scooped up an initial fumble by the Chargers defender who picked him off, but the ball was knocked out of his hands and recovered by Los Angeles.

The Eagles will hope to break their three-game losing streak next week when they host the Las Vegas Raiders at home.

Meanwhile, Herbert and the Chargers will look to keep it rolling against their bitter AFC West rival, the Kansas City Chiefs, who are desperate to keep their own playoff hopes alive at 6-7.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — On a recent afternoon, Giselle Garcia, a volunteer who has been helping an Afghan family resettle, drove the father to a check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She warned him and his family to prepare for the worst.

The moment the father stepped into the ICE office in California's capital city, he was arrested.

Coming just days after the shooting of two National Guard troops by an Afghan national suspect, federal authorities have carried out increased arrests of Afghans in the U.S., immigration lawyers say as Afghans both in and outside the country have come under intense scrutiny by immigration officials.

Garcia said the family she helped had reported to all their appointments and were following all legal requirements. 

“He was trying to be strong for his wife and kids in the car, but the anxiety and fear were palpable,” she said. “His wife was trying to hold back tears, but I could see her in the rearview mirror silently crying.”

They had fled Afghanistan under threat by the Taliban because the wife's father had assisted the U.S. military, and they had asked for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border, Garcia said. She is not identifying him or his family for fear other members could be arrested.

Since the Nov. 26 Guard shooting, The Associated Press has tracked roughly two dozen arrests of Afghan immigrants, most of which happened in Northern California. In Sacramento, home to one of the nation's largest Afghan communities, volunteers monitoring ICE activities say they witnessed at least nine arrests at the federal building last week after Afghan men received calls to check in there.

Many of those detained had requested asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border in the last two years. Others were among the 76,000 Afghans brought to the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome, created by former President Joe Biden's administration after the chaotic withdrawal of the U.S. from their country.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Dec. 1 that the Trump administration is “actively reexamining” all the Afghan nationals who entered the U.S. during Biden's administration.

The AP couldn't independently determine each of the Afghans' immigration statuses or the reasons put forward by authorities for their arrests. In one case, the man had been arrested twice on suspicion of domestic violence, according to the government. 

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland, said in an email that the agency “has been going full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and criminal illegal aliens that came in through Biden's fraudulent parole programs and working to get the criminals and public safety threats OUT of our country.” 

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the 29-year-old Afghan suspect in the shooting, was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

Since the shooting, the U.S. government introduced sweeping immigration changes, including pausing asylum applications and requiring increased vetting for immigrants from certain countries. The administration also took steps specifically targeted at Afghans, including pausing all their immigration-related applications and visas for Afghans who closely helped the war effort.

Those who work with Afghans say the stepped-up enforcement amounts to the collective punishment of a population, many of whom risked their lives to protect U.S. troops.

“Not to discount the horrific killing that happened, but that was one bad actor who should be prosecuted by the full extent of the law,” Democratic Rep. Ami Bera, whose California district includes Sacramento, said of Lakanwal. “A lot of these people kept our troops safe and served side by side with our soldiers for two decades in Afghanistan.”

In Sacramento, Afghan men arrived one by one to the ICE office Dec. 1 after being asked to immediately report there, drawing the attention of volunteers who have been at the federal building for more than six months to monitor ICE activities and alert immigrants.

As each man entered the office, agents handcuffed them, said Garcia, a volunteer with NorCal Resist.

“What we saw on Monday was an influx of Afghan immigrants called randomly starting at 6 a.m. and asked to do a check-in and report immediately,” Garcia said. “Most of these Afghan men already had ankle monitors on them.”

In Des Moines, Iowa, Ann Naffier, with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, said her Afghan client was detained Dec. 2 on the way to work by agents who called him a “terrorist.” He was held for two hours before he was released with an apology.

Wahida Noorzad is an immigration attorney in Northern California who has two Afghan clients who were arrested last week by ICE. Both entered the U.S. in recent years through the southern border. One used the app set up by the Biden administration to make an appointment to request asylum at the border.

Noorzad felt both had strong cases to eventually be granted asylum in the U.S. She also said she found no criminal records for them.

Spojmie Nasiri, another immigration attorney in Northern California, said she's received numerous calls from worried Afghans, including a man who called her terrified as agents stood outside his home. He put her on speaker phone so she could tell them that her client was a U.S. citizen.

Iqbal Wafa, an Afghan immigration consultant in Sacramento, said officials told his client when he went to his appointment last week that that interviews for Afghans are canceled, and he observed interviews for other Afghan immigrants were canceled as well inside a federal building in Sacramento.

Garcia said she listened through the wall of the waiting room at the ICE office and heard agents handcuff the father of the family she was helping.

“I'm screaming his rights through the wall so he could hear me. ‘Remain silent! Please don't sign anything!'” she said. She left after security approached.

When she walked out of the building without him, she said his wife broke down sobbing.

Their daughter tried to console her, telling her, “Mommy, don't cry. Everything will be OK when daddy comes.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law. 

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful. 

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump's Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity. 

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration's unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration's reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.” 

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”




White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden's war on American energy and unleashed America's energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press. 

The coalition that opposed Trump's order argued that Trump doesn't have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states' economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they've invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states' claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court's jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn't halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects. 

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government's leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association. 

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation's electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,'' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,'' Kennedy said. 

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,'' she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.''

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) questioned lawmakers' ability on Monday to address expiring Obamacare subsidies before they lapse at the end of the year, but expressed cautious optimism that bipartisan negotiations could eventually restart.

Thune said he sees an impending legislative defeat for Democrats as a motivator to return to the negotiating table once the chamber votes down a Democratic bill later this week for a three-year extension of the enhanced premium credits. He cautioned against the prospect of any deal in the Senate's final two working weeks of the calendar year.

“If there is going to be some meeting of minds on this, it is going to require that Democrats sort of come off a position they know is an untenable one and sit down in a serious way and work with Republicans,” Thune said.

The vote, likely to occur on Thursday, is part of a bipartisan deal last month to end the government shutdown, but it's a nonstarter proposal for Republicans and will fall well short of the 60-vote filibuster threshold. The endeavor will offer Democrats their latest healthcare messaging opportunity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a singular plan to address the subsidies for recipients with marketplace insurance.

“Republicans are nowhere on healthcare, and the clock is ticking,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said. “Americans' livelihoods are at stake. Our healthcare system is at stake.”

Thune indicated Republicans will not counter Democrats with a vote on a GOP alternative. He cited a perceived “political messaging effort” by Democrats, but Republicans also lack the unity to settle on a singular healthcare proposal. Most oppose a straight extension of the subsidies, which they said do more to line the pockets of insurance corporations and cause fraud than lower healthcare costs.  

“This is not a real effort by Democrats. This is their political messaging effort,” Thune said. “And the question is, when that's over with, will they really want a solution? Because I think we have some people that are really interested in a constructive outcome.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), the most outspoken supporter among his GOP colleagues to extend the Biden-era subsidies, lambasted Republican leadership for not rallying around an alternative to Democrats. Hawley indicated that he was still considering whether to vote for the Democratic extension.

“What signal will it send if Republicans say, ‘Yeah, we're going to say no to the Democrats' plan, but we're not going to offer anything.' The message that will send is, ‘Good luck to the American people,'” he said. “I'm willing to try just about anything, but I'm not willing to sit back and do nothing.”

Thune rejected the notion of attaching any sort of healthcare measure to the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act that Congress is working to advance in the coming days. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have floated Jan. 31, the next government funding deadline, as another opportunity to address insurance subsidies, despite them lapsing on Jan. 1.

SENATE DEMOCRATS SETTLE ON THREE-YEAR OBAMACARE SUBSIDY BILL, DRAWING GOP JEERS

There are varying proposals from Senate Republicans, including a mixture of income eligibility caps, fraud prevention measures, and a multiyear phaseout of the subsidies. Yet others, such as a measure from Senate Health Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) that is modeled after President Donald Trump and supported by Thune, would give money directly to people for health savings accounts rather than to insurance companies.

“We'll see whether the Democrats, when this is all sort of said and done on this political messaging exercise, want to have a serious conversation about how to fix it,” Thune said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday that he would allow Nvidia to sell an advanced type of computer chip used in the development of artificial intelligence to “approved customers” in China.

There have been concerns about allowing advanced computer chips to be sold to China as it could help the country better compete against the U.S. in building out AI capabilities, but there has also been a desire to develop the AI ecosystem with American companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.

The chip, known as the H200, is not Nvidia's most advanced product. Those chips, called Blackwell and the upcoming Rubin, were not part of what Trump approved.

Trump said on social media that he had informed China's leader Xi Jinping about his decision and “President Xi responded positively!” 

“This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,” Trump said in his post.

Nvidia said in a statement that it applauded Trump's decision, saying the choice would support domestic manufacturing and that by allowing the Commerce Department to vet commercial customers it would “strike a thoughtful balance” on economic and national security priorities.

But a group of Democratic senators objected to the chip sales.

“Access to these chips would give China's military transformational technology to make its weapons more lethal, carry out more effective cyberattacks against American businesses and critical infrastructure, and strengthen their economic and manufacturing sector,” said the statement. 




The group included Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Andy Kim of New Jersey, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.

The senators noted that Chinese AI company DeepSeek recently said the lack of access to advanced American-designed chip was their biggest challenge in competing with U.S. companies involved in AI, with companies including OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, Perplexity and Palantir making major investments in developing the technology.

Trump said the Commerce Department was “finalizing the details” for other chipmakers such as AMD and Intel to sell their technologies abroad.

The approval of the licenses to sell Nvidia H200 chips reflects the increasing power and close relationship that the company's founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, enjoys with the president. But there have been concerns that China will find ways to use the chips to develop its own AI products in ways that could pose national security risks for the U.S., a primary concern of the Biden administration that sought to limit exports.

Nvidia has a market cap of $4.5 trillion and Trump's announcement appeared to drive the stock slightly higher in after hours trading.

Luigi Mangione watched stoically Monday as prosecutors played surveillance videos of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing on a New York City sidewalk and of Mangione's arrest five days later at a Pennsylvania McDonald's.

NEW YORK (AP) — Moments after Luigi Mangione was handcuffed at a Pennsylvania McDonald's, a police officer searching his backpack found a loaded gun magazine wrapped in a pair of underwear.

The discovery, recounted in court Monday as Mangione fights to keep evidence out of his New York murder case, convinced police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that he was the man wanted in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan five days earlier.

“It's him, dude. It's him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione's Dec. 9, 2024 arrest, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.

Wasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pretrial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.

The testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald's and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.




Mangione's lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police didn't have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.

Wasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect's property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.

On body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald's. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.

Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.

The hearing, which was postponed Friday because of Mangione's apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Prosecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.

Thompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company's investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.

Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call about a McDonald's customer resembling the suspect.

Wasser testified that she went to the McDonald's on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson's killing on Fox News, including the surveillance video of the shooting and images of the suspected shooter.

Wasser began searching Mangione's bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.

By then, a handcuffed Mangione had been informed of his right to remain silent — and invoked it — when asked if there was anything in the bag that officers should be concerned about.

Wasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald's because she didn't want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.

“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.

“No. I didn't find a bomb yet,” Wasser responded.

According to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.

Then she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.

Satisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione's laptop computer, was transported to the police station in a brown paper McDonald's takeout bag, body-worn camera video showed.

Wasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice,” according to body-worn camera footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she hadn't searched at McDonald's.

Later, while cataloging everything in the bag in what's known as an inventory search, she found the notebook and other notes, including what appeared to to-do lists and possible getaway plans.

“Isn't it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search, according to the body-worn camera video. 

Asked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo on Monday that she was proud of her police department's work in helping to capture Thompson's suspected killer. 

A Blair County, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York City detectives investigating Thompson's killing.

As he has throughout the case, Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson's killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” — terms that Mangione's lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.

Judge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he's “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.

China has resumed buying U.S. soybeans, but still lags goals set by a trade agreement with President Donald Trump, an NBC News analysis found.

China previously was a top buyer of U.S. soybeans, but last spring stopped purchasing American soybeans because of a trade war launched by Trump.

The country resumed purchasing soybeans in October after reaching a trade agreement with the United States.

Under that deal, China promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025.

But China has bought just 2.85 million metric tons of soybeans since Oct. 30, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data compiled by NBC News.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said that China is on track to purchase 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of February. The Trump administration has said China would buy at least 25 million tons of soybeans in the next three years. 

Trump on Monday announced that he was giving $12 billion in aid to American farmers who have been affected by his trade war. Trump said that the aid will come from U.S. tariff revenues.

Canada's budget watchdog is walking back his most charged criticisms of Mark Carney's fiscal policy, but says the government's decision to drop its debt-to-GDP guideline is a major shift that warrants more public debate.

Soon after Jason Jacques was appointed interim parliamentary budget officer in September, he called the Canadian government's debt position “unsustainable” and “stupefying,” pointing to the prime minister's mounting spending pledges.

Crypto:

Wall Street's biggest Bitcoin bulls are dialing back their near-term forecasts after the recent downdraft, but their long-term conviction hasn't wavered.

Standard Chartered Plc, a longtime crypto proponent, halved its Bitcoin price forecasts as demand from corporate treasuries collapses and ETF flows falter. The bank now expects the original cryptocurrency to climb to $150,000 by the end of 2026, down from a previous projection of $300,000, and has delayed its $500,000 long-term target to 2030 from 2028.

A new exchange-traded fund from Bitwise that began trading Tuesday will give retail investors and financial advisors access to a broad range of cryptocurrencies in one shot, as opposed to the ETFs so far that have mostly just tracked just one or two cryptocurrencies.

The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (BITW) holds the following 10 digital assets: Bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot. The conversion makes BITW the first ETF by a major crypto asset manager to include Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot, Bitwise CEO and co-founder Hunter Horsley told CNBC.

"This really meaningfully expands the audience that can access exposure to these different assets, [and] of course, for assets that don't have spot ETF, all the more," Horsley said Monday. 

The fund offers exposure to crypto-assets for financial advisors as well as other smaller investors who are using funds from an IRA or retirement account "where their only choice is to use ETFs," said the CEO.

The ETF was converted from an index fund which held the same coins and it starts trading with more than $1 billion in assets. Along with broader permissions to trade and hold, ETFs offer other advantages over funds that may make them more attractive to some investors, including increased trading flexibility and tax efficiency, as well as lower fees. 

This move follows the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of a rash of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. Since then, asset managers have jockeyed for approvals to launch ETFs tracking a wider range of digital assets, from altcoins like sui and aptos to memecoins such as official Trump and dogecoin. 

The ETF launches amid a series of recent pullbacks in the crypto market that saw bitcoin trade as low as $85,000 earlier this month,  more than 30% off its record high of just north of $126,000 hit in October. Smaller coins with fewer institutional vehicles were hurt even more during the recent sell-off, exposing a risk this ETF will lead to bigger losses for smaller investors.

On the flipside, as the cryptocurrency market matures and the coins began trading more on their own merits, an ETF like this offers the potential for diversification, like a broad index fund such as the S&P 500 does with equities.

"It's the perfect time for a lot of investors who've now been paying attention since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, but want a more comprehensive solution to allocating to digital assets than having to pick specific assets and size a bunch of different exposures," said Horsley.

To be sure, the exposure to the smaller coins in the fund is limited. BITW allocates 90% of its holdings to assets that are held by existing single-coin exchange-traded products— Bitcoin, ether, solana and XRP. It caps the combined weight of all other tokens in the fund at 10%. 

The fund will be rebalanced every month — more frequently than most ETFs, which rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. 

Bitwise manages more than $15 billion in client assets and has a suite of more than 40 digital asset investment products. 

BITW, which is technically an exchange-traded product, was 1.5% higher Tuesday on its new home at the NYSE Arca exchange.

Pfizer on Tuesday said it has struck an up to $2.1 billion licensing deal with YaoPharma to develop and commercialize its obesity pill, furthering the pharmaceutical company's push into the weight loss space. 

Pfizer will pay YaoPharma, a subsidiary of Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, an up-front payment of $150 million. YaoPharma could also receive up to $1.94 billion in milestone payments, along with tiered royalties on sales if the drug is approved. 

YaoPharma's drug works by targeting the same gut hormone, GLP-1, as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. But the pill is still in early-stage development, which means it will take several years to reach patients. 

The deal will help Pfizer beef up and diversify its obesity drug pipeline after a string of setbacks, including its decisions to scrap two different pills over the past two years. The drugmaker boosted its prospects in the competitive space with its up to $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last month, following a fierce bidding war with Novo Nordisk. 

"We look forward to contributing our expertise and resources to continue the development of this investigational GLP-1 small molecule which complements and strengthens our growing portfolio of novel candidates for treating obesity and its adjacent diseases," said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, in a statement. 

Under the terms of the agreement, YaoPharma will conduct a phase one trial on its drug, while Pfizer will take control of later development. Pfizer also plans to conduct studies combining YaoPharma's treatment with its own drug targeting another gut hormone receptor called GIP, which is currently in mid-stage development.

That combination isn't new in the space: Eli Lilly's weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro use a dual approach targeting both GLP-1 and GIP. 

In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said limited information is available on YaoPharma's drug, called YP05002. But Seigerman said he views "obesity diversification as promising in the short term" for Pfizer. 

He added that Pfizer's $150 million up-front payment reflects "prudent capital conservation in light of the recent Metsera bidding war."

The opportunity to enter the booming weight loss drug market could be huge for Pfizer. Some analysts expect the weight loss drug space could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s.

It's unclear exactly how many people are using GLP-1s in the U.S., especially for obesity in particular. But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced its biggest management shake-up in decades on Monday, including a surprise exit, a retirement, and a new position.

Close followers welcomed the moves, but two warned they could mark the start of a wider exodus as the legendary investor enters his final weeks as CEO after six decades in charge.

Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire's non-insurance operations, is poised to take the reins from Buffett on January 1.

Carolyn Dewar, a senior partner at McKinsey and coauthor of "A CEO for All Seasons," told Business Insider that a leadership shuffle often accompanies a CEO change.

"Getting the top team right is the CEO-elect's most important early decision," Dewar said, adding that a CEO's "real leverage comes through leaders" and if they're "not aligned, capable, and energized for the next chapter, no strategy can take hold."

John Longo, a finance professor at Rutgers Business School and the author of "Buffett's Tips," told Business Insider there are parallels to a "new football coach wanting to install his own offensive and defensive coordinators."

Dewar also said a CEO transition is often an "unfreezing moment" for a company's leaders, prompting them to "step back and reflect" on whether they want to keep working under the new boss or make a change as well.

Berkshire's finance chief of nearly four decades, Marc Hamburg, will hand over his responsibilities to Berkshire Hathaway Energy's finance boss, Charles Chang, in June 2026, but hold off on retiring until June 2027 to ease the transition.

Adam Mead, the author of "The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway," told Business Insider that Hamburg was "probably the least appreciated person in Berkshire from the outside looking in." Mead said his "contributions to structuring deals and managing the financials can't be overstated."

Hamburg's willingness to work with his successor for a full year is a "testament to his commitment to Berkshire and its longevity," Chris Bloomstran, the president of Semper Augustus Investments and a Berkshire shareholder for 25 years, told Business Insider.

He likely remained in his role for so long "out of loyalty to Berkshire and to Warren," Bloomstran added.

NetJets CEO Adam Johnson has been appointed president of Berkshire's 32 consumer products, service, and retailing businesses — a group that includes See's Candies, FlightSafety, and Fruit of the Loom.

"Installing a respected senior operator to support dozens of business-unit CEOs both strengthens those businesses and creates needed bandwidth for Greg as he assumes overall responsibility," Lawrence Cunningham, the author of several books about Berkshire and the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center, told Business Insider.

As CEO, Abel will continue to oversee Berkshire's other non-insurance businesses, such as the BNSF Railway, Pilot, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger, told Business Insider that he expected Abel to pick someone to supervise those "very large" businesses in the near future.

Mead predicted Abel would appoint more divisional heads, emulating a Berkshire-owned conglomerate named Marmon, which has divisional presidents overseeing its more than 100 businesses.

Buffett hired Todd Combs in 2010 and Ted Weschler in 2011, tasking the hedge fund managers with helping him to pick stocks for Berkshire. Combs also took over as Geico's CEO in 2020 and spearheaded the auto insurer's rebound this year.

Combs, widely seen as a key leader of post-Buffett Berkshire, is leaving to head up a new investment unit at JPMorgan and be a special advisor to CEO Jamie Dimon.

Kass predicted Berkshire would find a replacement for Combs to help Weschler manage Berkshire's more than $350 billion worth of cash and roughly $300 billion stock portfolio.

Bloomstran said Weschler might take charge of a larger chunk of Berkshire's portfolio and be a "sounding board" for Abel on major investments, or at least take over Combs' allocation if he hasn't already.

Geico's operating chief, Nancy Pierce, has replaced Combs as CEO after nearly 40 years at the company. She's "tremendously qualified" for the job, Bloomstran said.

Pierce's appointment is "pure continuity," Cunningham said, adding that her long tenure, deep experience, and strong endorsement from insurance boss Ajit Jain are "all very on brand for Berkshire."

Michael O'Sullivan will become Berkshire's first-ever general counsel on New Year's Day. Prior to joining Snap as general counsel in 2017, O'Sullivan spent more than two decades at the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, cofounded by Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger.

Cunningham said O'Sullivan's appointment is a "prudent modernization and a natural evolution of the Munger lineage inside Berkshire."

Bloomstran said the new position was "interesting but not surprising" as Berkshire has long relied on Munger, Tolles & Olson as external counsel, and cofounder Ron Olson recently retired from Berkshire's board, where he likely served as an informal legal advisor.

Kass underscored that no other senior leaders are leaving Berkshire and said it's "critically important" that Jain and other senior insurance bosses, such as Joe Brandon, "remain in place to smooth this management transition."

Meyer Shields, a managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who's been covering Berkshire for more than 15 years, said in a research note that his team "expect more turnover" in the months ahead, as the cachet of "working for Mr. Buffett's successor is not (at least yet) the same as working for Mr. Buffett himself."

Brett Gardner, the author of "Buffett's Early Investments," told Business Insider there's "justifiable concern that some people want to work for Warren Buffett and not Berkshire Hathaway."

Gardner said that might not be the case with the latest moves, but it's "something to watch out for."

Complicating matters is the reality that many of Buffett's most trusted lieutenants are "past retirement age already," he added.

Regional bank Fifth Third on Tuesday announced a deal making fintech firm Brex the provider of its commercial cards and expense management tools for business clients. 

The program will run on Brex's embedded payments platform, which lets banks issue corporate cards and automate expense reporting using artificial intelligence tools, the companies said in a release.

The move shows how some banks are choosing to partner with fintech firms rather than building their own platforms to keep up with clients' evolving technology expectations. Fifth Third is in the process of acquiring Comerica, a deal expected to make it the ninth largest U.S. bank with about $288 billion in assets.

"Our partnership with Brex is a commitment to redefine how companies leverage financial technology," Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence said in a statement. "By combining the strength of a leading bank with Brex's AI-driven innovation, we're creating intelligent solutions that simplify complexity, drive efficiency and enable businesses to scale globally with confidence."

Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

A New York federal judge on Tuesday ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials and other documents related to the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite convicted in 2021 of procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge Paul Engelmayer's order came at the request of the Department of Justice, which cited the Epstein Files Transparency Act that Congress passed last month.

The act mandates that the DOJ disclose investigative material about Epstein, a former friend of President Donald Trump who killed himself in jail in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term for her conviction.

Grand jury materials are normally permanently sealed by law.

Because of that, Engelmayer denied the DOJ's initial request over the summer to unseal grand jury materials in Maxwell's case.

In his order on Tuesday, the judge noted that the Epstein files "Act does not explicitly refer to grand jury materials."

But, Englemayer added, "The Court nonetheless holds — again in agreement with DOJ — that the Act textually covers the grand jury materials in this case."

Englemayer's order authorizes the DOJ to publicly disclose grand jury transcripts and exhibits, as well as extensive material that federal prosecutors disclosed to Maxwell's defense attorneys for her 2021 criminal trial.

But he also modified a protective order in the case to put in place a mechanism "to protect victims from the inadvertent release of materials ... that would identify them or otherwise invade their privacy."

It is not clear when the DOJ will release the material covered by Engelmayer's order. CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ and from Maxwell's defense lawyer. 

The public is not likely to learn much, if anything, new about Epstein or Maxwell from the unsealed grand jury material.

Englemayer, in his order Tuesday, said that the DOJ's original motion to unseal the files "misled victims — and the public at large in holding out the Maxwell grand jury materials as essential to the goal of 'transparency to the American public,' when in fact the grand jury materials would not add to public knowledge."

"The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor," Englemayer wrote in August when he rejected the DOJ's first bid to unseal the material.

"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes," the judge had written. "They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation."

Although he granted the DOJ's request to unseal the materials, the judge slapped prosecutors for again not giving notice to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims before asking that the materials be made public. 

"In its two rounds of applications to this Court to disclose records, DOJ, although paying lip service to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims, has not treated them with the solicitude they deserve," Engelmayer wrote. 

"In applying on November 24, 2025 for leave to release records pursuant to the Act, DOJ again acted without notice to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims," the judge wrote.

"The Court ... were compelled again to direct DOJ forthwith to notify these victims of its latest motion, and to set a deadline for victims' submissions.

In one of New York City's most fashion-forward neighborhoods, Target is unveiling its latest effort to keep up with trends and lead the way on style. 

The Minneapolis-based retailer, which is in the middle of a turnaround effort and on the cusp of a CEO change, gave a makeover to its big-box store in SoHo at 600 Broadway.

The one-of-a-kind concept store, which opens Tuesday, will have rotating merchandise, curated displays chosen by celebrities and influencers and other kinds of special programming, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said.

The SoHo store is part of a broader push by incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to win back Target's reputation for style and sharp merchandise. When he was named Target's next leader in August, he said that would be one of his top three priorities, along with improving the customer experience and rolling out technology to make Target faster and more efficient. He will start the role in February, succeeding longtime CEO Brian Cornell.

Target is trying to get back to growth after roughly four years of stagnant annual sales due to self-inflicted challenges and a more difficult economic backdrop. Store foot traffic and sales have fallen as shoppers have responded to sloppier stores, out-of-stock and locked-up items and the company's decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Consumers across the country have also become more selective about buying discretionary merchandise, which has long been Target's sweet spot, as they pay more for necessities like groceries, electricity and housing.

At an event previewing the store on Monday night, Fiddelke described the SoHo location as "a punctuation point" for Target's sense of style and its plans for the future. 

In an interview with CNBC, Sylvester said the store's merchandise has completely changed. The location, which opened about seven years ago, drew many shoppers and had strong sales, but sold mostly items found in drug and convenience stores, she said. It didn't carry any of Target's clothing or home decor, which felt both out of step with the neighborhood and like a missed opportunity for Target, she said.

"We said, 'This is the style and fashion capital. We have to be able to showcase the best,'" she said, recalling the inspiration for the project.

From start to finish, the store's redesign took four months as the company raced to get the project done ahead of the holidays, Sylvester said. It has redone the store's first floor and plans to redesign the basement floor in the coming year, she added.

The SoHo store is reopening at a time when holiday shoppers and tourists flock to the major shopping district for holiday gifts and party outfits — and as Target chases sales across the country during the critical shopping season. It is one of 42 stores that the retailer has in New York City and nearly 2,000 that is has in the U.S.

"The world looks at New York to see what's new and what's next," Sylvester said in remarks at the launch event. "And we want them to look at Target when they see what's new and what's next."

When customers step inside of the Target's SoHo store, they will enter a long, red hallway that resembles the inside of Target's Bullseye logo. The area of the store is called "The Drop," and Target will display merchandise there chosen around themes that feel relevant for the time of year, Sylvester said. 

Like most of the store, the rotating area will swap out about every four-to-six weeks, she added.

As the store opens, "The Drop" is themed around the holidays — including outfits and items that a shopper may need for going out, lounging at home or giving a gift to a party host. The store displays range across categories, mixing in clothing, home decor, beauty items and more. For example, "The Drop" currently includes a table of products that a shopper might want if they're hosting a night at home with friends, such as card games, an espresso martini mix and eye-catching glassware for the cocktails.

Sylvester said the company's merchants are already working on the next two themes for "The Drop," which will be focused on wellness in January, the season of New Year's resolutions, and Valentine's Day in February.

Customers can step inside of Target's "Broadway Beauty Bar," which is designed for selfies and social media posts. It will have a rotating assortment of Target's beauty merchandise, including fragrance brands like Fine'ry that are exclusive to Target, and trendy mini versions of face washes, lip glosses and more from national brands.

At launch, Target is featuring items chosen by celebrity makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes. 

Along with the "Beauty Bar," the store sells items typically found at the big-box retailer, including large shampoos, body washes and cotton balls.

Near the beauty area, shoppers can also press a button and snap a black-and-white selfie.

Though the store's layout is new, it shares a similarity with some of Target's other New York City locations — some items are locked behind glasses cases that an employee needs to unlock.

In the back of the store's first floor, Target will have a rotating "Curated By" display of items from across the retailer's beauty, fashion and home categories, picked by celebrities and other creators known for their sense of style. Shoppers can browse and buy that person's favorites or scan a QR code to see a list of them.

Target's first "Curated By" features favorites from Megan Stalter, an actress and comedian who is in HBO's "Hacks." Some of her picks include a throw pillow, a pair of hot pink slippers, metallic water bottles and Universal's "Wicked: For Good" movie-themed clothing items.

Also at the store, shoppers can find Target's "Gifting Gondola," which features merchandise exclusive to Target. 

Currently, the display includes holiday-themed plush penguins, bears and other products from Target's toy brand, Gigglescape. It also includes some giftable items themed around the retailer's Bull Terrier, Bullseye, including special edition Haribo gummy candies and a Bullseye Pez dispenser.

Over time, Sylvester said Target may introduce some items that are unique to the SoHo store and can only be bought there.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison isn't taking his loss to Netflix in the bidding war for Warner Bros. on the chin. Paramount announced yesterday that it's going directly to WBD shareholders with a $30 per share, all-cash hostile bid, with Ellison telling CNBC that he wants "to finish what we started."

Here's what to know:

Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.

Trump announced yesterday that Nvidia will be allowed to ship its H200 artificial intelligence chips to "approved customers" in China and other countries. The caveat: Only if the U.S. gets a 25% cut.

The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, Trump said in a social media post, adding that "the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel" and other U.S. firms. Shares of Nvidia, AMD and Intel all rose in overnight trading. Trump also said that Chinese President Xi Jinping "responded positively" to the plan. 

Meanwhile, House Democrats are creating a commission on AI, hoping to position themselves as leaders on the issue. As CNBC's Emily Wilkins notes, the move comes as the tech industry ramps up its presence in D.C. and its campaign spending.

Meta has poured billions of dollars into overhauling its AI strategy. But as CNBC's Jonathan Vanian reports, the shift has led to internal confusion and a haphazard strategy.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the year by touting Meta's Llama family of AI models, which he said would become the "most advanced in the industry." But CNBC has learned that Meta is now focused on a new AI model codenamed Avocado that could be proprietary instead of open source.

Elsewhere in Big Tech, Apple has seen significant churn among its top brass in recent days, including the departures of its head of AI and its top lawyer. The iPhone maker's chip leader, Johny Srouji, reassured staff in a memo yesterday that he isn't planning to leave "anytime soon," following a report that he was considering departing.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

Trump announced a $12 billion aid package for farmers impacted by tariffs yesterday, saying the funds would come from revenues generated by the tariffs.

A White House official told CNBC that up to $11 billion of that sum will go to the Agriculture Department's new Farmer Bridge Assistance program to distribute one-time payments to row crop farmers. The other $1 billion will be held as the department evaluates the market, the official said.

Trump, meanwhile, suffered a blow in court yesterday. A federal judge overturned his ban on new wind power projects, saying it was "arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law."

McDonald's is putting its franchisees under a more intense microscope in 2026. The fast-food titan said it will look at how their prices align with value goals as McDonald's aims to woo more price-conscious consumers, according to a memo viewed by CNBC.

McDonald's will update its standards for franchisees — who run about 95% of McDonald's restaurants — and "holistically assess" their pricing, the memo shows. If franchise owners do not comply with the new standards, they could face penalties such as being barred from opening additional stores or having their agreements with the company terminated.

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna joined CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" yesterday to discuss the company's acquisition of data streaming platform Confluent in an $11 billion deal. Confluent shares soared 29% following the announcement.

San Francisco's Downtown Development Corporation, launched in April by Mayor Daniel Lurie, said on Tuesday that it's received over $60 million in early commitments from donors including Google and OpenAI to help revive the city's center.

"I think people view this as a generational moment," Shola Olatoye, CEO of the SFDDC, told CNBC in an interview. "San Francisco has captured the world's, and the country's, imagination as a global hub of innovation and industry. The folks who want to build businesses, raise their families here, and visit, recognize the important work that is underway and want to see it continue."

In October, Lurie said the group, a nonprofit public benefit corporation, had raised $50 million for its efforts, up from $40 million at the time of its debut. When campaigning for mayor last year, Lurie touted his ability to fundraise, drawing on his past experience at the anti-poverty nonprofit Tipping Point Community, laying the groundwork for public-private partnerships to help revitalize San Francisco. 

In addition to Google and OpenAI, SFDDC has raised money from backers including Visa, Thoma Bravo, Ripple, Salesforce, Amazon, Emerson Collective, Sixth Street and Gap. The funds will help support Lurie's Heart of the City initiative, which prioritizes street safety and cleanliness, small business support and more.

Olatoye said some of the funding will also be deployed to fill vacant spaces in key retail spots such as along Powell and Stockton streets.

"We're going to provide direct grants to these businesses to provide business support, marketing support and legal support," Olatoye said. "And then actual below market capital from some of our lending partners to go in and actually fix up these spaces and get those businesses in there, get people spending money and generating economic activity for the city of San Francisco."

Money will also be dedicated to a new Embarcadero Park, inspired by New York City's Bryant Park. Lurie has often cited Michael Bloomberg's efforts as mayor of New York as inspiration for his work, and the DDC is drawing on models used in New York as well as Detroit.

While a number of metrics show that San Francisco has bounced back dramatically from its pandemic lull, the city has a lot of work to do to prepare for an active 2026. Super Bowl LX is coming to the area in February, along with the Pro Bowl Games. In the summer, people will pack into the Bay Area for some of the FIFA World Cup. 

"When downtown thrives, our residents, families and small business owners all benefit," Lurie said in a statement. "By strengthening public safety, cutting red tape and leaning into our arts and culture, we are bringing people back to our streets." 

The first-term mayor notched a significant political win in October as President Donald Trump reversed his decision to deploy the National Guard in downtown San Francisco, saying Lurie was making "substantial progress" on crime in the city. Trump also said he was swayed by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. 

The city has been boosted over the last year by a surge in investment and activity related to artificial intelligence. CBRE data on venture funding show 2025 is expected to surpass the record reached in 2021, thanks in large part to AI investments in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

In addition, crime rates are down 30% from 2024, with event bookings and tourism on the rise, and residential and commercial real estate heating up.

"There's no doubt that there is a lot of attention on us and we are super focused on outcomes and using data to ensure we can hold ourselves accountable," Olatoye said.

In this article

Nvidia has approval from the U.S. government to sell its more advanced H200 AI chips to China. But the question is whether Beijing wants it or will let companies buy it.

The company can now ship its H200 chip to "approved customers", provided the U.S. government gets a 25% cut of those sales. It had been effectively banned from selling any semiconductors to China earlier this year, but since July sought to resume H20 sales, a less advanced chip designed specifically to comply with export restrictions. 

Reports had suggested Beijing prohibited local companies from buying the H20. Nvidia is not baking in huge China sales into its forecasts as a result. After the ban was lifted, the Financial Times reported China would "limit access" to the H200, citing unidentified sources.

Look at what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said this year, and what Chinese tech giants and Beijing have done, and you'll see potential hints as to how this lifting of the ban will play out.

The H200 is one of Nvidia's most advanced chips for training and running AI on the market, but China has been on a drive to wean itself off American technology and boost local semiconductor development for AI. 

"While this move reopens the door for U.S. revenue, the strategic train has already left the station," Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC on Tuesday.

Huang said in a Bloomberg interview in May that Chinese tech giant Huawei's semiconductor products for AI are "probably comparable" to Nvidia's H200. 

Alibaba and Baidu, as well as other Chinese startups, are also racing to bring competitive products to Nvidia to the market. 

Huawei has been ramping up its Ascend line of AI products and using massive clusters of chips to try to get performance that is on par with Nvidia.

Huang told CNBC in June that Huawei would have the country's chip needs covered if Nvidia were never allowed to sell there.

Meanwhile, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have been using stockpiled Nvidia chips from before the ban, combined with local semiconductors, to develop models that have become advanced.

With China's drive to self-sufficiency resulting in advanced products, will Beijing want to allow its local companies to buy American products from Nvidia?

"Capability wise, the Chinese ecosystem is catching up fast from semi to stack with models optimized on the silicon and software for significant local consumption," Shah said. He added that China getting "locked in" to Nvidia chips is a "liability with a hanging sword of political uncertainty." 

"This makes domestic self-sufficiency the only viable long-term strategy for Beijing," Shah said. 

Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping "responded positively" to the approval of H200 exports to China.

And while China held off on H20 purchases, there are reasons the country's companies could want to purchase the H200 product.

The H200 is far more advanced than the H20, which could be tempting for China. Meanwhile, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said there were supply shortages across the entire semiconductor supply chain. 

"I think there will be demand for H200 as it is a better chip than H20 and there is a shortage of chips in China," Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC on Tuesday. "The big Chinese tech companies will want to use Nvidia and AMD if possible."

China's semiconductor industry remains behind that of the U.S. and elsewhere. In particular, China struggles to manufacture the most advanced chips, putting it behind the world's largest chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. China is also restricted from buying chipmaking tools that could advance its capabilities.

Meanwhile, domestic alternatives to Nvidia remain behind in performance. This makes Nvidia's H200 an attractive proposition.

"What is not in China's favor right now is the supply — ramping up advanced AI chips in terms of performance or yields still remains elusive, making it a less economically efficient push," Shah said."The gap between Nvidia, AMD and Huawei and others is still quite wide when it comes to performance and power efficiency."

Even if Chinese firms begin buying Nvidia's product, Beijing's longer-term trajectory of self-sufficiency will continue.

"In the long run, for the next five to ten years, China's 'self-reliance' strategy for its own tech and innovation won't change. Jensen Huang of Nvidia has a good time window to sell H200 but it won't be ... forever," George Chen, partner and co-chair, digital practice, The Asia Group, told CNBC on Tuesday.

"Xi will not be foolish that today Trump can sell H200, and then China just totally relies on U.S. chips. Huawei, Alibaba and other Chinese tech developers remain strategically important for China's marathon to win the AI race and this will be a long race," he added.

Johnny C. Taylor, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, was heading to the trade group's annual holiday party on December 5 when he received bad news.

In a video sent to SHRM staff, Taylor described learning that a Colorado jury had just hit the organization with an $11.5 million verdict in an employee discrimination and retaliation case.

"While as a lawyer, you all know, I respect the judicial process, we vehemently disagree with the decision," Taylor said in the video, which was seen by Business Insider. He added that the case lacked merit and would go down as "just a blip in the history of SHRM."

He also urged SHRM employees not to talk to the press about the case or any other company matters.

The case was filed by Rehab Mohamed, who worked at the organization as an instructional designer from 2016 to 2020.

SHRM's holiday party was held at a Washington, D.C., restaurant called The Hamilton, according to two people, one of whom was an attendee.

SHRM said in a LinkedIn post that it plans to file an appeal "to the highest courts in the land," a response that has since drawn more than 100 comments, many of them critical.

"An $11.5 million verdict doesn't happen in a vacuum; it reflects patterns, dismissed concerns, and a lack of internal accountability," one user wrote.

"We understand the heightened attention surrounding this case because SHRM exists to advance workplace excellence. A verdict like this can create questions, and we take those concerns seriously," SHRM spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in a statement to Business Insider. "As an employer, we are appealing this verdict because our employees trust us to walk the walk. We maintain that the defendant in this case was not discriminated against."

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.

Mohamed, whose lawyers have said she is Black and Egyptian, was awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages by the jury.

That amount meets the threshold of what is commonly known in the legal and insurance industries as a "nuclear verdict."

The median federal race-discrimination verdict in a seven-year period ending in 2021 tracked by the legal data company Westlaw was $150,000. The largest such verdict in Westlaw's dataset was less than $7 million.

The size of the verdict "is a staggering figure" for an employee-discrimination case, said Allison Williard, an employment lawyer with Washienko Law Group in Boston. "Getting a punitive damages award in and of itself is difficult because it is such a high bar to prove that the conduct at issue is extreme and outrageous."

The extraordinary award likely speaks to the jurors' understanding of how SHRM brands itself as an expert in HR best practices, Williard added.

"It's not unreasonable to think that they want to punish SHRM," she said. "SHRM, of all organizations, really should have known better."

In September, SHRM asked the court to bar Mohamed from introducing evidence or argument that the organization is a specialist in HR best practices.

US District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher later denied SHRM's request, saying its "asserted expertise in human resources is integral to the circumstances of this case and cannot reasonably be excluded."

The jury deliberated for about four and a half hours before delivering its verdict, said Ariel DeFazio, one of Mohamed's lawyers.

Court records show that jurors sent one note, asking two questions: "Who receives punitive damages AND is there a formula or max value for punitive damages?"

The impact of the case on SHRM's reputation could have harmful consequences for its more than 575 local chapters around the world, said the president of a US chapter, who asked not to be named due to concerns about retaliation.

Describing the verdict as "mind-blowing," this person said they worry the chapter could lose both members and sponsors — sources of income that local affiliates need to survive.

Business Insider Edition 

A C-130 aircraft transporting 11 Nigerian servicemen is reportedly being detained in Burkina Faso following accusations of airspace violation. 


        This information was disclosed by the state-run news agency Agence d'Information du Burkina in a joint statement published by the Alliance of Sahel States.

        “An aircraft belonging to the Air Force of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, type C-130, was forced to land today in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, following an in-flight emergency situation while it was operating in Burkinabe airspace,” the statement read partly.
    


        The statement asserts that the Nigerian aircraft's flight through Burkina Faso's airspace constitutes an "unfriendly act," which has resulted in a high alert and the authorization to "neutralize any aircraft" found to violate the confederation's airspace.
    


        Some reports suggest that the Alliance, which comprises Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, is considering taking action against the Nigerian soldiers for what the country considers a violation.
    


        The three Sahel countries denounced the incident as a breach of sovereignty, asserting that the body "condemns with the utmost firmness this violation of its airspace and the sovereignty of its member States."
    


        As seen in the Punch, the Sahel countries also warned that “air and anti-aircraft defences of the Confederate space put on maximum alert…were authorised to neutralise any aircraft that would violate the Confederate space.”
    


        This incident is coming just days after Nigeria launched airstrikes against coup plotters in the West African state of Benin.
    


        The airstrikes were in response to a botched coup by some members of the Beninese army.
    


        The countries that make up the Alliance of the Sahel States are currently under junta rule following successful military coups.
    


        On Sunday, the Nigerian government disclosed that its fighter jets and ground forces helped Benin's army thwart an attempted coup in Cotonou.
    


        According to a statement published by Nigeria's presidential spokesperson, Bayo Onanuga, the Benin administration, through a Note Verbale, requested that Nigeria deploy fighter jets to safeguard its airspace and expel soldiers led by Colonel Pascal Tigri, who had seized the national television station and announced the suspension of democratic institutions.
    


        "Acting on two separate requests from the Government of Benin, President Tinubu first ordered Nigerian Air Force fighter jets to enter the country and take over the airspace to help dislodge the coup plotters from the National TV and a military camp where they had regrouped," the statement read.
    


        General Olufemi Oluyede, Nigeria's Chief of Defence Staff, announced that all demands were fulfilled, with Nigerian ground soldiers now operating in Benin only on missions approved by Beninese authorities.
    


        Within hours, loyal forces, aided by Nigeria, reclaimed the national broadcaster and put down the coup attempt.

UNITED NATIONS, December 9 (IPS)  - More than one year since its adoption, the UN Pact for the Future is held up as a critical framework for countries to address today's issues through global cooperation. Its agenda for global governance and sustainable development is ambitious, and it is for this reason the Pact poses implementation challenges when it comes to the direct impact on local communities. It will require the joint efforts of governments, civil society and international organizations to achieve the goals laid out in the Pact.


The efforts of the International Communities Organisation (ICO), a UK-based international NGO, demonstrate what implementing the Pact would look like. Since 2016, ICO has worked to empower minority communities in conflict-affected areas through education and capacity-building opportunities. ICO focuses on directly supporting efforts to build up underrepresented groups' involvement in community initiatives and diplomatic dialogue and address systemic, societal inequalities.

On December 3, ICO launched its flagship report, For Our Future: Best Practice for the Implementation of the UN Pact for the Future, at the UN Headquarters in New York, presenting a practical framework to support UN member states in advancing the objectives outlined in the Pact for the Future. Several Permanent Missions to the UN, including Bahrain, Guyana, Hungary, Kuwait, Samoa, Singapore, Tajikistan, and Uganda, co-sponsored the event.

The UN Pact for the Future represents a shared set of global commitments to sustainable development, peace and security, and redefining global governance for member states. While its adoption marks a decisive moment of global consensus, there remains the challenge of translating the Pact's guiding principles into meaningful action at the national and regional levels.  Through its ‘Best Practices' blueprint, the ICO report distills their findings into an adaptable methodology designed to equip policymakers with the tools they need to implement the Pact's goals effectively.

James Holmes, ICO founder and Secretary General, said, “The Pact reminds us that the strength of nations is measured not only by the power of their armies or the size of their economies, but also by the inclusiveness of their societies and the recognition of all who live within.” “How we treat minority peoples, those who are few in number, vulnerable, or historically marginal, is the true test of our progress and the true test of whether the fact for the future is being successful.”

H.E. Abdulla Shahid, ICO International Ambassador and former President of the 76th United Nations General Assembly, said it was crucial for the world to unite.

“The UN Pact for the Future calls for renewed unity in tackling humanity's greatest challenges. This report demonstrates that lasting peace is built not only at negotiation tables but also through empowering communities themselves, ensuring that no group is left behind.”

“As UN Secretary-General António Guterres noted at the opening of the ‘Summit of the Future' in September 2024, ‘21st-century challenges require 21st-century solutions: frameworks that are networked and inclusive and that draw on the expertise of all humanity.'

He added that the ICO's report embodies this principle, showing how global aspirations can intersect with local action.

Prominent UN diplomats and civil society members were present at the launch event, demonstrating and remarking on their commitment to the Pact for the Future, and specifically to ICO's work on the ground. Current and former high-ranking UN officials were also in attendance.

“One year after the adoption of the Pact, this discussion is timely,” said Themba Kalua, the UN Director, Pact for the Future Implementation Kalua remarked during the event. “While the world has grown more complex since the adoption of the Pact for the Future, the Pact continues to be central in realizing multilateralism, navigating the current geopolitical complexities and shaping our collective action on the global agenda.”

Kalua noted the efforts made by the UN system towards the Pact, including global panels on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI) and the political declarations that emerged from UN conferences on social development in Qatar and financing for development in Spain. He expressed that the Pact was a “strategic priority” for the UN and its Secretary-General, António Guterres.

“From our side in the UN system and the Secretariat, we are committed to doing our part in supporting the implementation of the Pact,” Kalua told IPS.

Presenting the report, ICO's UN Programme Manager Mia Sawjani broke down its findings and recommendations. She emphasized that countries would need to empower and promote the agency of local actors. This includes building up their capacity and skills to enact positive change in their communities. Countries must recognize adaptability in assessing situations on the ground, particularly in conflict settings that transform institutions and structures.

“The implementation of the Pact can be tangibly realized for all, but particularly to serve marginalized communities. It's a transformative opportunity and it is our collective responsibility to follow through,” said Sawjani.

After the event, Holmes was heartened by the outpouring of support for ICO's work, noting that many more countries had agreed to partner with them for future projects. By maintaining their focus on working with minority communities, ICO can “play a major global role” in implementing the Pact for Future.

“I have a big vision, and I have a lot of ambition for ICO,” Holmes told IPS. “We already have a global team, and I see that growing, and I see us having a bigger and bigger role in helping to implement the Pact.”

Local actors and stakeholders, namely governments, academia, the private sector and civil society, would play a key role in implementing the Pact's agenda. Organizations like ICO could serve as a bridge to translate the issues to the national context.

“The more we are able to bridge communities, the more successful it will be for states to deal with Track I diplomacy,” Shahid said to IPS, referencing the formal channel of diplomacy between governments on international issues.

Implementing the Pact for the Future must also mean recognizing the specific needs and challenges that these countries face. Island states like Samoa and Tonga, for example, are uniquely impacted by climate change, energy, and the global financial structures that need to better serve developing countries.

“For us in the Pacific, progress is measured not by rhetoric, but by real improvements that are felt in our villages, outer islands and vulnerable communities,” said Viliami Va'inga Tōnē, the Permanent Representative of Tonga.

Accountability and transparency will also be crucial to ensure countries follow through on the promises of the Pact. This must be present at all levels. Participants at the event emphasized the need for monitoring mechanisms that would measure progress.

The timing of the report coincides with the ongoing reform negotiations under the UN80 Initiative introduced this year. Discussions around the Pact went hand in hand with recognizing the critical step toward reforming the UN system that will optimize its ability to live up to its founding principles and the Pact's promises.

If the Pact represents ‘what' the UN and member states need to achieve in the global agenda, then UN80 represents ‘how' the UN can implement the agenda.

“The UN80 initiative is really part of the UN response to how it can deliver on the ground,” said Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru, the Permanent Representative of Samoa. He said to IPS, “When you look at all the individual actions that need to be taken, these are at the global level, the UN [level], regional level, and national level. They're all important, because we can't continue to work in silence. Everything is interconnected now. So we need to make those connections and work together, and you don't want duplication.”

While New York hosts reform discussions around the UN and its mandates, the organization's impact will ultimately be felt by local communities across the world.

Dr. Agnes Mary Chimbiri-Molande, Permanent Representative of Malawi, told IPS that the people who serve in multilateral systems like the UN need to “renew or even rebuild trust” with local communities. At a time when people are questioning the UN's relevance, she said, these discussions must be held and all perspectives need to be respected.

“We need to hear the voices of the local people. Because here we are working for them. We are not working for ourselves,” Chimbiri-Molande said. “So in fact, to be hearing the voices of those peoples, it's very, very important to inform our work here, whether we are making an impact or we are making differences in the lives of the people in the community.”

Shahid reiterated that the decisions made in the halls of UN Headquarters will affect local communities, adding that the UN's success is also contingent on its partnerships with civil society and how important it is for civil society to recognize the UN's relevance.

During his time as President of the General Assembly from 2021-2022, the world was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. His ‘presidency of hope' championed the progress made by the international system despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic. He also made efforts to promote inclusivity by opening the General Assembly to more participants, including civil society groups.

Shahid invited young diplomats from underrepresented member states to the President's office to witness international diplomacy firsthand.

Even after his presidency ended, he told IPS, he wanted to continue to deliver on the ideals that defined his tenure.

“I thought that there's no need to end the presidency of hope after one year. Let us keep delivering the message of hope through other platforms. And ICO provides me the platform, because it is a platform through which I can actually reach out to communities at [the] household level and inspire them not to give up. Keep working, keep aiming to change the status.”

UN Pact for the Future Requires Global Solidarity and Localized Solutions, Inter Press Service, Tuesday, December 09, 2025 (posted by Global Issues)

Oops, something went wrong

A hacker made off with more than $440,000 in USDC after a wallet owner unknowingly signed a malicious “permit” signature, according to a Monday tweet by Scam Sniffer.

The theft comes amid a surge in phishing losses. Roughly $7.77 million was drained from more than 6,000 victims in November, Scam Sniffer's monthly report found, representing a 137% jump in total losses from October, even as the number of victims fell by 42%.

“Whale hunting intensified with a top hit of $1.22 million (permit signature). Despite fewer attacks, individual losses grew significantly,” the company noted.

Permit-based scams revolve around tricking users into signing a transaction that looks legitimate but quietly hands an attacker the right to spend their tokens. Malicious dapps may disguise fields, spoof contract names, or present the signature request as something routine.

If a user fails to scrutinize the details, signing the request effectively grants the attacker permission to access all of the user's ERC-20 tokens. Once granted, scammers typically drain the funds immediately.

The method exploits Ethereum's permit function, which is designed to make token transfers easier by allowing users to delegate spending rights to trusted applications. The convenience becomes a vulnerability when those rights are granted to an attacker.

“What's particularly tricky about this attack type is that the attackers can either conduct the permit and transfer of tokens in one transaction (a smash and grab type approach) or they could give themselves access via the permit and then lay dormant waiting to transfer away any later added funds (as long as they set an appropriately far away access deadline within the permit function metadata),” Tara Annison, head of product at Twinstake, told Decrypt.

“The success of these types of scams relies on you signing something that you don't quite realise what it will do,” she said, adding that, “It's all about the human vulnerability and taking advantage of people's eagerness.”

Annison added that this incident is far from isolated. “There are many big value and high volume examples of phishing scams designed to trick users into signing something they don't fully understand. Often done under the guise of free airdrops, fake project landing pages to connect your wallet to [or] fraudulent security warnings to check if you've been impacted,” she added.

Wallet providers have been rolling out more protective features. MetaMask, for example, warns users if a site appears suspicious and attempts to translate transaction data into human-readable intent. Other wallets similarly highlight high-risk actions. But scammers continue to adapt.

Harry Donnelly, founder and CEO of Circuit, told Decrypt that permit-style attacks are “quite widespread” and urged users to check sender addresses and contract details.

“That's the clearest way to know that if it's a protocol that doesn't match where you're actually trying to send the funds, then that likely is someone trying to steal funds,” he said. “You can check the amount, so often they'll try and give unlimited approvals, like that.”

Annison emphasized that vigilance is still users' strongest defense. “The best way to protect yourself from a permit, approveAll or transferFrom scam is to ensure that you know what you are signing. What actions will actually be done in the transaction? What functions are being used? Do these match up to what you thought you were signing?”

“Many wallets and dapps have improved user interfaces to ensure that you're not blindly signing something and can see what it will result in, as well as warnings for high risk functions being used. However it's important that users are actively checking what they're signing and not just connecting their wallet and hitting the sign,” she said.

Once stolen, the recovery of funds is unlikely. Martin Derka, co-founder and technical lead at Zircuit Finance told Decrypt the chances of getting the funds back was “basically zero.”

“In phishing attacks, you're dealing with an individual whose entire goal is to take your funds. There's no negotiation, no point of contact, and often no idea who the counterparty is,” he said.

“These attackers play a numbers game,” Derka said, adding that, “Once the money is gone, it's gone. Recovery is essentially impossible.”

              Highlights            



                        Stablecoins were born from necessity and arose to move dollars on-chain, becoming crypto's core money layer.                      


                        Efforts to balance speed, trust, decentralization and efficiency produced competing models, centralized, crypto-collateralized and algorithmic, with each exposing unavoidable compromises.                      


                        Major failures (TerraUSD) and near-failures (USDC's depeg) showed that stablecoins are fragile promises whose risks can cascade, underscoring that their future hinges on hard-earned lessons, not linear progress.                      

Stablecoins take the most trusted thing in finance, the dollar, and put it onto an open, programmable, always-on network, the blockchain.

Over the past 11 years, stablecoins have evolved from a niche workaround for traders into the backbone of cryptocurrency markets and, increasingly, have become a candidate for global payments infrastructure. Today, policymakers, banks and FinTech firms are racing to define stablecoins' role as future “digital dollars for the internet.”

That future, however, cannot be understood without examining the messy, improvised and at times catastrophic path that got stablecoins here. Understanding their evolution matters because it reveals the trade-offs that cannot be wished away. Speed versus safety. Decentralization versus efficiency. Innovation versus regulation.

Stablecoins, after all, did not emerge from an elegant theory of money. They emerged from necessity in the crypto space. And only time will tell if they ultimately become similarly necessary across traditional payments and financial services.

Stablecoins have packed a lot of history into the past 11 years of their existence. As crypto markets grew, traders needed a stable, on-chain substitute for cash that could move quickly without touching banks, which led to Tether being created in 2014 under the name “Realcoin.”

When Tether launched, cryptocurrency markets faced a basic operational problem. Bitcoin could be transferred globally without banks, but dollars could not. Exchanges struggled to maintain banking relationships, cross-border transfers were slow and traders needed a way to move in and out of volatile assets without touching the traditional financial system.

Tether's proposition was simple: each token would represent one U.S. dollar held in reserve. The execution, however, was anything but clean. Tether has faced persistent questions about whether it actually holds sufficient reserves, due to opaque disclosures and fragile banking relationships, and also faced questions around its role in market manipulations.

Still, despite the controversies, or perhaps because it was the only option, Tether grew rapidly. Liquidity matters more than trust when markets are moving fast, and Tether today boasts a roughly 60% share of the stablecoin market.

Fast forward four years, to 2018, and crypto had grown enough to support alternatives to Tether. Circle and Coinbase launched USD Coin (USDC) together with a different pitch: regulatory compliance and transparency. Reserves would be audited. Banking partners would be disclosed. The token would be redeemable at par under clear legal frameworks.

At the same time, stablecoins were no longer just a trader's tool. They became the unit of account for crypto markets themselves. Bitcoin, ether, and thousands of other tokens increasingly traded against stablecoins rather than fiat. In effect, stablecoins became cryptocurrency's base layer of money.

By the 2020–2021 bull market, stablecoins surpassed bitcoin in transaction volume. They were used not only for trading, but also for lending, borrowing, yield farming and remittances. Entire decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems ran on stablecoin liquidity.

Of course, stablecoins also ran against the die-hard crypto ethos of decentralization. Not everyone in the Web3 space was comfortable relying on centralized issuers holding dollars in banks to issue stablecoins. That discomfort fueled experiments in decentralized stablecoins, most notably MakerDAO's Dai.

Dai was backed not by dollars, but by cryptocurrency collateral locked in smart contracts. Its value stability was enforced through incentives, liquidations and governance decisions rather than bank accounts. For crypto purists, this was the holy grail: money that was stable, censorship-resistant, and independent of the traditional financial system.

But decentralization came at a cost. Dai required overcollateralization, making it capital-inefficient. As markets evolved, Dai increasingly relied on centralized assets like USDC as collateral, blurring the line between decentralized idealism and practical compromise.

Other projects pushed even further. Basis attempted a fully algorithmic, non-collateralized stablecoin, adjusting supply dynamically to maintain its peg. It shut down in 2018 after regulatory pressure. Ampleforth (AMPL) experimented with elastic supply rather than price stability, redefining what “stable” could mean.

The most dramatic stablecoin failure came in 2022 with the collapse of TerraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin that relied on market confidence and arbitrage incentives rather than collateral. When confidence broke, UST entered a death spiral, wiping out tens of billions of dollars and triggering contagion across crypto markets, ultimately leading to the collapse of FTX and the exposure of its leadership team's criminal acts.

Centralized stablecoins were not immune either. In March 2023, USDC temporarily de-pegged after Silicon Valley Bank, where Circle held a portion of its reserves, collapsed. The peg was restored, but the episode underscored an uncomfortable truth: stablecoins inherit the risks of the financial system they depend on.

Stablecoins are promises. When the mechanism enforcing that promise fails, the damage can propagate quickly.

It is tempting to see stablecoins' future as a straight line toward mainstream adoption. But their history suggests something more complex.

Stablecoins did not succeed because they were well-designed from the start. They succeeded because they solved immediate problems faster than traditional finance could.

Stablecoins settle instantly, operate 24/7, and move at internet speed. They can be embedded in software, automate compliance, and reduce reliance on correspondent banking networks. For emerging markets, they offer dollar access without dollar accounts.

But achieving this vision may depend on lessons learned the hard way.

Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies are suddenly flying high on Tuesday, surging in value ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting conclusion that's widely expected to bring a third interest rate cut. And that's led to a growing pile of short positions getting liquidated—a rarity of late.

Bitcoin was recently trading above $94,400, the highest price registered since mid-November, according to price aggregator CoinGecko. The price of the leading cryptocurrency had been hovering around the $90,000 mark prior to Tuesday morning's spike, with the coin now showing a 5% climb over the past 24 hours. It's now up about 4% on the week.

Altcoins are faring even better, however, with Ethereum extending its recent rebound with an 8% daily spike to a recent price of $3,359, pushing its weekly gain to more than 16%—the largest spike among the top 10 cryptocurrencies during that span.

XRP, meanwhile, is up about 5% on the day to $2.17, with Solana rising 6% to $144 and Dogecoin up 6% to $0.15.

Crypto traders betting on the future performance of top assets are being hit with liquidations on Tuesday, and while most of the major liquidation days in recent months have been focused on long positions hit by falling prices, it's mostly shorts getting pummeled on the day.

Over $376 million worth of positions have been liquidated over the last day, per data from CoinGlass, with shorts making up $297 million of those. Bitcoin currently dominates the crypto carnage, accounting for about $153 million worth of impacted positions, with Ethereum next up at $110 million.

What's driving Tuesday's price surge? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its latest meeting on Tuesday, with the gathering expected to produce the year's third rate cut when the meeting ends on Wednesday. According to CME FedWatch data, interest rate traders currently project a nearly 90% chance that the Fed issues another 25 bps rate cut.

Bitcoin and other risk assets typically perform well in a low interest rate environment, though Tuesday's crypto surge could mean that traders are buying the rumor—with plans to sell the news on Wednesday.

Users on Myriad—a prediction markets platform operated by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—are increasingly bullish on the prospect of Bitcoin returning to a price of $100,000 sooner than it will crash to $69,000, giving the spike a nearly 80% chance as of this writing. That mark has climbed by 9% over the last day.

The Middle East has a chance to become "the Switzerland of the 21st century" by embracing bitcoin-backed banking, credit, and digital money, said Strategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor.



In a wide-ranging presentation at Bitcoin MENA, Saylor urged the region to seize what he described as a $200 trillion opportunity by enabling banks to custody bitcoin, offer BTC-backed credit, and eventually launch yield-generating digital money products.



“If you are interested in making your nation the digital banking capital of the world ... if you'd like to be the Switzerland of the 21st century, then these are the three ideas: the big, the bigger, and the biggest," Saylor told the audience.



A “big idea,” said Saylor, was for sovereign wealth funds to invest in bitcoin. A “bigger idea” was to build banks that custody bitcoin and extend credit on it. The “biggest” idea was to create digital money accounts backed by BTC credit instruments, offering up to 8% yield with no volatility.



“You won't draw a little bit of bitcoin,” Saylor said. “You will actually pull billions and tens of billions and hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars of capital from people that don't understand bitcoin.”



Saylor claimed that the U.S. now leads the global regulatory shift toward bitcoin, pointing to what he described as near-unanimous support from government officials. “There is a profound consensus amongst everyone running the United States,” he said. “Donald J. Trump says he is intent on making America the bitcoin superpower, the crypto capital of the world, the leader in digital assets.”



He added that he had spoken personally with the Vice President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the head of the SEC, the Commerce Secretary, and other top officials, all of whom, Saylor claimed, view bitcoin as a strategic asset.

Saylor also said U.S. banks that once refused to touch bitcoin are now actively moving to support it.

“All of the large banks in the United States have gone from not banking bitcoin 12 months ago to, in the past six months, I have been approached by BNY Mellon, by Wells Fargo, by Bank of America, by Charles Schwab, by JPMorgan, by Citi,” he said. “They are all starting to issue credit against either Bitcoin or against Bitcoin derivatives like IBIT.”



Strategy holds more than 660,000 BTC and is now issuing a range of BTC-backed credit instruments, including perpetual preferred stocks and short-term notes that pay monthly dividends.

“We're converting 120 months or 240 months of duration into one month,” he said. “Pay me now.”

Saylor framed these innovations as the foundation for a new kind of financial system. “Digital capital creates digital credit, and digital credit creates digital money,” he said. “That's the killer app.”

As it progresses its explorations into a prospective UK central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Bank of England (BoE) is wanting to speak to businesses with a view on how a digital pound could ‘add value.'

A decision has yet to be made on whether to introduce a CBDC in the UK but the BoE, like many similar authorities worldwide, has been exploring how to create what has been described as a ‘major national infrastructure project.'

The central bank is currently in a ‘design phase' for a potential digital pound with the aim of establishing a ‘clear proposition' for a UK CBDC. A digital pound would only be introduced with Parliament's approval and would need primary legislation.

In an update on the ‘digital pound' page of its website (3 December), the central bank says it is ‘looking for participants to help us explore how the digital pound could impact existing companies who choose to integrate it alongside traditional payment methods in the future.'

The exercise is modest – the central bank is ‘looking for two to four participants' that would get involved on a ‘voluntary, unpaid basis.' It will ‘consist of a series of bilateral conversations in Q1 2026 with each the participants based on previously published information.'

RELATED ARTICLE BoE publishes findings on point-of-sale testing for digital pound payments – a news story (2 June 2024) on experimentation testing the technical feasibility of using point-of-sale (POS) hardware for potential CBDC payments

Information about the exercise are specifically found on a BoE webpage titled ‘digital pound – case studies', which is aimed at showcasing ‘how existing companies may choose to integrate a digital pound into their business models.'

The study's aim is to provide insight into two topics: where a ‘retail digital pound' could add value to different businesses; and features ‘expected to be the most/least valuable for different kinds of businesses.'

The BoE states that it anticipates exploring features including: conditional payments; instant settlement; international interoperability; offline payment capabilities; and tourist (digital) wallets.

The BoE kicked off this year (2025) on the CBDC front by revealing plans to create a ‘Digital Pound Lab' as a ‘technology sandbox environment [to] enable hands-on experimentation' through which it would test application programming interface (API) functionality, ‘innovative use cases', and potential business models for payment interface providers (PIPs) and external service interface providers (ESIPs). 

The BoE states (on the case studies webpage) that it is ‘particularly keen to engage with companies that are interested in the digital pound, but have not yet been involved in the Digital Pound Lab.'

‘The case studies are designed to sit alongside and complement the Digital Pound Lab by improving our understanding of the business impact of different potential digital pound features for merchant adopters,' the central bank explains. 

Applications are open until 9 January 2026 after which the central bank will choose successful applicants by late January. Bilateral are workshops scheduled for February and March.

The BoE's Digital Pound Lab webpage contains details of experimentation to date.  

It states that during ‘phase one' participants were invited to test a small number of use cases across point of sale, ‘tiered' digital wallets, ‘micro merchants', conditional business-to-business payments, omni-channel payments and temporary tourist wallets.

Fluxpay explored point-of-sale digital-pound transactions using both alias-based payments and QR codes, tiered wallets and tourist wallets. It developed a proof-of-concept digital wallet platform with tiered know-your-customer (KYC) features and a link to a simulated foreign exchange service for cross-border transactions.

LINK, in collaboration with Consult Hyperion, focused on cashback at point of sale. Their solution used the LINK messaging network to demonstrate point of sale payments and cash withdrawals (cashback with and without purchase) through digital pound wallets.

NOBO Finance, in collaboration with Applied Blockchain, explored conditional business-to-business payments. Their solution demonstrated how cross-border trade finance could be ‘streamlined and made more accessible' for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Yotra explored omni-channel payments, tiered wallets and tourist wallets. Its solution was a ‘transport payment platform designed from the perspective of transport operators residents, and visitors, enabling a frictionless payment experience across travel networks.'

Senior BoE figures involved include Diana Carrasco, who joined as head of digital pound a couple of years ago from Lloyds Banking Group. She has also previously worked at HSBC and Visa, among other companies.

Oops, something went wrong

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) has taken aim at the GENIUS Act—which provides a legislative framework for stablecoins in the U.S.—alleging that it contains a “loophole” for introducing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

“I support crypto but I will never support giving the government the ability to turn off your ability to have full control of your money and to buy and sell,” Greene tweeted.

A CBDC is a digital currency issued, regulated, and backed by a country's central bank, comparable to fiat currency. Economies around the world are trialing CBDCs, including the European Union. But they have proved controversial in the US as Republican lawmakers have claimed they could enable increased government control and surveillance.

Greene explained that she voted against the GENIUS Act in July because “it contained a back door to a central bank digital currency (CBDC).”

The representative also criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson, claiming he had “promised conservatives” that he would include the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act in this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) but ultimately failed to do so, keeping what she described as a loophole open.

“As usual, he didn't keep his promise,” she added.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act was passed by the US House of Representatives in July 2025 but has yet to be approved by the Senate. The act, if passed, would prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a CBDC or a “substantially similar product” for public use. The bill invokes numerous anti-surveillance concerns and financial-privacy arguments.

The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is the annual legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President authorizing the Department of Defense's budget, spending, and policy for the year ahead.

Greene was one of just 12 Republican lawmakers who voted against the GENIUS Act in July, versus over 200 in favor. She would later compare CBDCs to the “Mark of the Beast”, quoting a passage from the Bible's Book of Revelation. Greene has invested $60,000 in BlackRock's IBIT Bitcoin ETF fund this year, as per House disclosures.

Braden Perry, a litigation, regulatory, and government-investigations attorney with Kennyhertz Perry LLC, says that Greene's claims about a CBDC loophole do not “have a real legal basis,” adding that her statement is “more political commentary than legal analysis.”

“A CBDC is a digital dollar issued by the Federal Reserve, while the GENIUS Act regulates private stablecoins and keeps them distinct from government money,” he told Decrypt.

Perry noted that the GENIUS Act explicitly says that stablecoins “are not securities, not bank deposits, and not central bank money.”

“Some people worry that regulated stablecoins may perform functions similar to a digital dollar, but that does not make them a back-door CBDC,” he added.

Greene is one of a number of Republican lawmakers who have spoken out against CBDCs. As far back as 2022, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), claimed they could be used as a “financial surveillance tool by the federal government,” drawing parallels with the policies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Tempo, a payments-focused blockchain backed by Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm, has launched its public testnet, a key step in its effort in making stablecoin payments for mainstream use.

Tempo has also unveiled a roster of new additions to the network's partner group, including buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, predictions market Kalshi, payments giant Mastercard and Swiss global bank UBS. They join a group of earlier design partners such as Deutsche Bank, Visa, Shopify, OpenAI and Nubank.

Initially introduced in September, Tempo is designed to handle high-volume financial transactions with low fees, instant finality and native support for stablecoins. With the testnet now being live, developers and corporate partners can begin experimenting with real-world payments on-chain.

The move fits into the latest trend of building blockchains for stablecoin payments as adoption of digital dollar is soaring globally. Currently a $300 billion asset class, stablecoins are projected to become an integral part of cross-border payment rails with business-to-business (B2B), peer-to-peer (P2P) and card payments driving growth, a recent report by Keyrock and Bitso said.

Tempo aims to solve common pain points in blockchain-based finance, like network congestion and volatile transaction fees. The network charges around one-tenth of a cent per transaction, payable in U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins and eliminating the need for a volatile gas token.

The news comes on the heels of Bridge, Stripe's stablecoin infrastructure firm, helping Klarna issue its own digital dollar next year.

         December 09, 2025
      

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has announced a major milestone in its push to clean up cookie-consent practices across the UK web.

More than 95 % of the top 1,000 UK websites now pass the ICO's compliance checks. This gives an estimated 80 % of UK internet users – about 40 million people aged 14+ – greater control over how they are tracked online.

That success follows months of targeted assessments: the ICO evaluated whether sites loaded non-essential advertising cookies only after users made an explicit choice, whether rejecting non-essential cookies was as easy as accepting them, and whether any cookies were dropped without consent.

As a result, 979 websites passed and 564 corrected their practices after intervention. Only 21 remain non-compliant.

Looking forward, the watchdog will continue to periodically test the UK's top 1,000 websites, ensuring they meet the legal requirements.



Many popular websites rely on questionable methods: consent banners designed to nudge users toward “Accept” – or even to silently drop tracking cookies before consent. That makes personalized advertising easier, but at the expense of true user choice.

The ICO's enforcement signals a turning point: privacy-friendly practices are no longer optional, and refusal must be as easy and effective as acceptance.

For businesses and publishers, this shift also opens the door to “privacy-friendly online advertising models,” giving them a way to monetize content without undermining user trust or running afoul of data-protection laws.



The ICO announcement aligns with the findings in our 2025 Consumer Cybersecurity Survey, which paints a compelling picture of how people actually deal with cookies, consent, and online privacy.

According to our survey, 48% of respondents accept all cookies without reading the consent notice, and 75% either skim or completely ignore the terms — prioritizing speed over privacy.

This suggests that even as websites improve compliance, many people remain effectively “opt-in by default” because they don't engage with the complicated cookie choices.

Our report argues that convenience and complacency often collide with real cyber-risk. Even though users worry about scams, identity theft and financial loss, their online habits (like blindly accepting cookies) often make these threats easier.

The ICO's push is thus vital, yet not enough by itself. Real privacy protection depends not only on websites doing the right thing, but also on users engaging consciously with consent settings.



The ICO's success should encourage more websites to adopt compliant, transparent cookie practices by default. At the same time, the findings of our survey highlight the importance of user vigilance:

“Going forward, following our consultation earlier this year, we are continuing to work with a range of stakeholders to help us understand whether publishers could deliver privacy-friendly online advertising to users who have not granted consent, where there is a low risk to their privacy,” the ICO said. “We are working with government to explore how it could amend legislation to reinforce this. The next update on our work will be provided in 2026.”

IBM just acquired Confluent for $11 billion. 

When I was at IBM, I watched enterprises struggle with the same problem over and over again.  Their data was always a step behind their decisions.  

This acquisition may look like a classic enterprise AI move, but its implications stretch well beyond artificial intelligence. This deal signals a deeper shift in how companies will build intelligent systems, manage real time data, secure digital transactions, and create trust in a world where AI and blockchain are colliding.

At its core, Confluent is the world's leading real time data streaming platform, designed to continuously move events, transactions, signals, and intelligence across distributed systems. In a world increasingly run by AI agents, decentralized applications, tokenized assets, and on-chain governance, real time data is no longer a feature. 

It is the infrastructure layer.

IBM is not simply buying a data company. It is buying the connective tissue of next-generation intelligent systems.

The most obvious impact is on AI.

Large language models and enterprise AI agents require real-time awareness, continuous data ingestion, and event driven triggers. Traditional batch processing cannot keep up with the velocity of intelligent automation.

Confluent solves this problem by turning data into a streaming nervous system.

Through this acquisition, IBM is strengthening three pillars of its AI strategy:

In short, this acquisition accelerates IBM's AI strategy by reinforcing what AI actually needs to function at scale: trustworthy, reliable, real time data.

What is less obvious but equally important is how the deal impacts blockchain and Web3.

Blockchain adoption has consistently been slowed by the gap between on-chain and off-chain information. Enterprises want the trust and transparency of blockchain, but they also rely on fast-moving off-chain systems: payments, identity, compliance, logistics, and operational data.

Today, many companies stitch these worlds together through brittle integrations or custom tools. Confluent changes that.

Real time data streaming is the missing link between blockchain and enterprise operations. 

With Confluent, IBM can now support:

Hybrid on-chain/off-chain systems. Tokenized assets, digital identity, and decentralized finance require fast synchronization between blockchain networks and enterprise systems. Streaming bridges that gap.

Programmable money and settlement. As more institutions experiment with stablecoins, tokenized treasuries, and on-chain clearing, they will need real-time price feeds, compliance signals, and settlement events. Confluent already powers many financial pipelines today.

Web3 identity and provenance. For decentralized identity, every attribute change, credential update, or verification event must be instantly logged. Streaming ensures that identity remains accurate and tamper-evident.

Risk, fraud, and compliance automation. Blockchains are transparent but noisy. AI monitoring powered by real-time streams can detect anomalies, flag suspicious transactions, and automate compliance reporting.

This acquisition positions IBM to offer a unified AI + blockchain infrastructure stack. In the next decade, as AI agents begin transacting autonomously on-chain, these capabilities will become essential.

The real story behind IBM's acquisition is the convergence of three forces:

We are entering a world where transactions, identity, compliance, and insights must all move at streaming speed. Batch processing is simply not fast enough for autonomous AI systems or financial markets built on tokenized assets.

This is why Confluent matters.

Its technology sits at the intersection of trust and intelligence. Blockchain ensures that data is verifiable. AI brings the interpretation and action. Confluent delivers the timing and coordination.

IBM's move reinforces the idea that the future of digital infrastructure is not AI-only or blockchain-only. It is a fusion of intelligence + trust + real-time data, integrated into one enterprise stack.

For CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, and CIOs, this acquisition highlights three strategic realities:

1. AI agents will require new operational models.This includes real-time decision streams, continuous monitoring, and auditable logs. Infrastructure investments like this one are early signals of where the market is heading.

2. Tokenization and Web3 are moving into mainstream enterprise.As stablecoins, tokenized treasuries, and Real World Assets (RWA) markets grow, companies will demand real-time interoperability. IBM is now well-positioned to serve that need.

3. Trust will define competitive advantage.Enterprises will choose systems that can prove what happened, when it happened, and why. AI and blockchain will intertwine around that requirement.

This deal is more than a technology acquisition. It is a marker of where intelligent enterprises are going next and it reinforces that the next decade will be shaped by the convergence of AI, blockchain, and data streaming into a single, trusted ecosystem. 

IBM's acquisition of Confluent is not simply a bet on AI. It is a bet on a future where AI and blockchain systems operate together, powered by a streaming backbone that makes real time trust possible. IBM is betting on the convergence.

Blockchains are public databases. That's an immediate roadblock for large institutions like banks, whose clients largely don't want their balances and payments history open to prying eyes. Now, the crypto giant Circle has partnered with the blockchain Aleo to launch a “private” version of its stablecoin called USDCx, which will obscure transaction histories, Howard Wu, cofounder of Aleo, told Fortune.

“People don't want to reveal their business revenues. They don't want to reveal business intelligence,” Wu said. “But the way that transparent blockchains work today unfortunately means that every time you transact, you are leaking that data.”

The new Circle-backed token, which like other stablecoins is pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, won't be truly private. Every transaction of the token will include what Wu called a “compliance record,” which Circle will be able to access in case law enforcement or other authorities reach out about specific transactions. Still, for public users looking at a blockchain log, the transactions will look unintelligible and like “blobs of data,” Wu said. 

“This is banking-level privacy, as opposed to ‘privacy privacy,'” he added.

The launch of USDCx comes amid a broader push from the crypto industry to persuade big banks and institutions to use blockchain technology. That effort appears to be gaining traction, especially in the realm of tokenization, or the act of putting real-world assets like mortgages or even the U.S. dollar in blockchain wrappers.

The asset management giant BlackRock has launched its own tokenized money market fund BUIDL, the online brokerage Robinhood has dabbled in blockchain-based stock trading, and fintech giants like Stripe have invested huge sums of capital into stablecoins. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” Larry Fink, cofounder and CEO of BlackRock, said in his 2025 letter to investors.

Wu, the cofounder of Aleo, has seen interest in privacy-enabled stablecoins from a swathe of potential customers, including the crypto payroll processors Request Finance and Toku. He also said that prediction markets, or locales where gamblers can bet on real-world events and sports, are also interested in experimenting with stablecoins like USDCx.

Aleo, which specializes in private blockchain transactions, isn't the only privacy-first technology of its kind in crypto. There are other cryptocurrencies—most famously Zcash—which also promise users encrypted transactions. However, these cryptocurrencies are much more volatile than stablecoins, which, as their name implies, are designed to stay stable relative to the U.S. dollar or other currencies.

Tether's USDT just secured regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi's financial hub, officially recognised as a fiat-referenced token by ADGM. This move allows licensed firms to offer regulated custody and settlement services using USDT. This makes investors confident enough to explore early-stage crypto projects again. And DeepSnitch AI is quickly rising to the top. With 77% of its presale already completed and over $720K raised, DSNT is shaping up to be one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025.



Tether gains regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi's financial hub Tether's USDT has been officially recognized as an “accepted fiat-referenced token” by the Abu Dhabi Global Market. This enabled licensed firms to offer regulated custody, trading, and settlement services using the stablecoin.



ADGM had previously recognized USDT on Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, but this latest designation expands its regulatory use.



Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino welcomed the approval, calling stablecoins “essential components” of modern finance. The decision follows similar recognition for Ripple's RLUSD and precedes a potential dirham-pegged stablecoin.

Top 3 best altcoins to buy in 2025 DeepSnitch AI Even though the charts have had traders on edge lately, the real strength is playing out behind the scenes. Tether's USDT just got recognised as an official fiat-referenced token in Abu Dhabi, and both China and Japan are injecting massive liquidity into their economies. That's the fuel for what could be a monster bull run in 2026.



And that's exactly why investors are piling into early-stage gems like DeepSnitch AI. The team has built five AI agents that plug into a unified dashboard, giving you a full-on intelligence hub for navigating crypto like a pro.

The presale has already rallied 77%, with over $720K raised so far. And people are calling it one of the best altcoins to buy. With Gartner projecting $1.5 trillion in global AI spend this year alone, and the entire sector expected to 25x, the timing couldn't be better.

At just $0.02682, DSNT is an early opportunity experienced investors wouldn't pass on. Add the live bonus codes DSNTVIP50 and DSNTVIP100 into the mix, and this might be one of the best altcoins to buy in the past two cycles.

https://youtu.be/HVnjHC08u_Y?si=fVFWtqeY7aqoiB74 Hyperliquid HYPE was holding just above the $29-$30 support zone on December 9. This level has triggered rebounds before, but now the price is stuck after a choppy week. Ali Martinez spotted a rounding top on the daily chart, hinting at weakness. If $29 breaks cleanly, HYPE could drop to $16.

Still, long-term bulls haven't backed off. CryptoGodJohn's Fib model points to future targets at $35.32, $48.81, and even $59.23. But that path only opens if HYPE reclaims $34-$36.

Whales are holding $45.85 million in long positions, according to Coin Bureau. That shows conviction in HYPE's role within Hyperliquid's perp ecosystem. All eyes are on $29–$30. A bounce here could trigger a run to $34 or even $40.

Solana Solana was holding firm above $133 on December 8, showing strength while the rest of the market wobbles. After a clean bounce off the 75% Fibonacci level, SOL looks ready for another move.

The $131-$133 range has soaked up recent selling. With sellers thinning out, attention is shifting to $140 as the next key zone. Market makers are eyeing that cluster. TedPillows notes sell-side depth is fading, hinting at a return of volatility.

As long as SOL stays above $131, momentum favors bulls. Analysts like Elja and 0xBossman see long/short liquidations and trend exhaustion building beneath the surface: early signs of a new base forming for one of the best altcoins to buy right now.

Closing thoughts SOL and HYPE might still have some fuel left, but their 100x days are behind them. They're both sitting in the top 20 biggest cryptocurrencies. At this stage, you're more likely to see steady growth than explosive gains.

That's exactly why whales are rotating into earlier plays like DeepSnitch AI. Priced at just $0.02682, DSNT feels like Solana in 2018. With the newly launched bonus codes (DSNTVIP50 for 50% bonus, DSNTVIP100 for 100%), DSNT becomes one of the best altcoins to buy now.

FAQs What are the most undervalued altcoins to watch right now? DeepSnitch AI is topping the list of undervalued altcoins thanks to real AI utility, a working dashboard, and live staking. With its low presale price, DSNT offers serious upside before launch.

Which breakout altcoin picks should I consider in 2025? While many coins have peaked, DeepSnitch AI is just getting started. Its 77% presale run and growing adoption make it one of the most promising breakout altcoin picks heading into 2026.

What altcoins have strong upside potential right now? Altcoins with strong upside are rare in this cycle, but DeepSnitch AI is one of them. Backed by five AI agents and CEX rumors, it's quickly becoming 2025's top-performing presale.

The competition simply doesn't measure up where it matters the most.

In crypto, a handful of blockchains are in the process of trying to become the financial plumbing for the next era of the global economy. These fintech coins exist to move and manage value for banks, financial institutions, and major corporations. And being close to those capital flows has traditionally been a way to make a ton of money by taking tiny tolls along the way.

Assuming this trend holds, I predict that XRP (XRP +3.93%) will prove to be the best fintech coin investors can buy with $2,000 between now and 2027. Here's why.

Image source: Getty Images.

As you doubtlessly know by now, XRP is the native coin of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a network designed to handle international payments with fast transaction settlement and minuscule fees.

Ripple, the coin's issuer and the company behind much of the chain's ecosystem, offers a bunch of different financial services that lets banks and fintechs send money in seconds instead of days by using XRP and stablecoins as bridge assets rather than using prefunded accounts. The idea is to work with banks and offer a solution that updates their financial infrastructure, which is a friendlier narrative for regulators and risk committees than some of XRP's peers, which sometimes claim to be trying to replace outdated sections of the financial system entirely.

Where XRP really starts to look like a highly competitive fintech solution is in its compliance tooling, which, as boring as it might sound, is actually one of the most critical features for the target users (banks). There's simply no way that a major financial institution is willingly going to use a piece of technology that's difficult to audit or that adds a significant regulatory compliance burden. The XRPL offers compliance features that allow issuers to restrict who can hold a coin and let them halt suspicious accounts if needed, among many other benefits.

On top of that, Ripple recently launched RLUSD, a U.S. dollar stablecoin. Ripple explicitly positions it for use in cross-border payments, as a treasury holding, and as tokenized real-world asset (RWA) trading collateral. It's an important part of the chain's capital base and its ecosystem, and with a market cap of $1.2 billion, it's actually large enough to be useful in the size that financial businesses need.

In other words, most of the components you would want in a fintech are available for those who are willing to hold XRP to pay transaction fees. And in the long run, that's likely to pay off for those who secure some of the supply now.

The rest of the fintech coin category includes projects like Stellar, Algorand, and even stablecoin platforms like Tron. Each targets parts of the financial stack, but none, save for XRP, can offer the whole package.

Stellar's design is aimed at cross-border remittances. MoneyGram, for example, uses Stellar's network to power cash-to-crypto on- and off-ramps in multiple markets. But there's no institutional finance story here, which caps the upside by quite a bit.

Algorand, for its part, has been a testbed for central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilots and asset tokenization experiments. Banks and governments are attracted by its high throughput and low latency. Still, the compliance tooling on Algorand is not as tightly vertically integrated as what Ripple is building.

Tron, meanwhile, began as a platform for digital entertainment and content sharing. Over time it expanded into payments and decentralized applications, but its strongest brand identity still centers on consumer entertainment and high throughput for stablecoin transfers rather than regulated finance.

XRP's edge is that it is building horizontally across this landscape. Ripple is spending heavily to acquire companies that will help it to stitch payments, stablecoins, lending, and tokenized assets into one big institution-ready package. And then it's marketing that package directly to the customers it wants to attract.

And that's just one more reason to predict that by 2027, XRP will turn out to have been the best fintech coin to buy with $2,000. Expect some volatility along the way, and be ready to hold through this coin's next leg of growth.

The Russell 2000 Index, which comprises approximately 2,000 small-cap companies, has long served as a barometer of investor appetite for growth and high-risk equities. Analysts quickly noticed its correlation with the crypto market.

When risk-on sentiment spreads into the crypto market, it can help push Bitcoin and altcoins higher. The details below illustrate how this dynamic unfolds.

Russell 2000 Flashes a Breakout Signal, Raising Hope for Crypto

If the S&P 500 represents large-cap blue-chip companies, the Russell 2000 focuses on small-cap stocks.

The index is not as famous as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones. However, it remains important, especially for investors who seek higher risk. This risk appetite aligns closely with many crypto investors.

In December, the Russell 2000 recorded a major turning point when it broke above a long-term resistance level. This move often signals strong upside momentum.

The breakout is considered a clear risk-on signal. This suggests that capital is shifting back to riskier assets, which can serve as fuel for Bitcoin BTCUSD and altcoins.

The Bitcoin Vector — an institutional Bitcoin report published by Swissblock — noted that in late 2020, the Russell 2000 broke through new highs and later turned that level into support. Bitcoin surged 380% after that.

“Last time this setup appeared, BTC delivered over 390% upside. This time the structure is different, but we're starting from an environment that precedes liquidity expansion. And when liquidity turns, risk assets take the lead,” Bitcoin Vector stated.

Negentropic, co—founder of Glassnode, added that the Russell 2000 breakout signals a broad return of investors to risk assets.

Several analysts also believe this is a bullish sign for altcoins.

“Russell 2000 is the biggest indicator for Altseason, and it's about to hit a new all-time high,” Ash Crypto said.

By comparing the altcoin market capitalization with that of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF — a fund that tracks US small-cap equities — analyst Cryptocium highlighted a correlation. Altcoin market cap (OTHERS) often surges when the iShares Russell 2000 ETF breaks above its previous all-time high.

This pattern has appeared twice: once in 2017 and again in 2021. It now suggests a potential altcoin boom in 2026.

But a Deeper Look Reveals Internal Weakness

A closer look inside the Russell 2000 rally shows a different picture.

Analyst Duality Research noted that, although the index rose in 2025, small-cap ETFs within the index still recorded net outflows of approximately $19.5 billion this year. This contrasts sharply with past rallies, which have typically been accompanied by strong ETF inflows.

This perspective weakens the bullish argument for a tight correlation between the Russell 2000 and the crypto market. If risk-on sentiment fails to last and the breakout turns into a false move, that negative shift may spread and extend the bearish mood in the crypto market.

Despite the recent altcoin downturn, one analyst believes a major indicator is flashing green and could kickstart a major bull run. Ash Crypto, the analyst in question, has over 2 million followers on X (formerly Twitter), and he believes the altseason is right around the corner after the Russel 2000, a US-based small-cap market-cap index, hit new highs recently.

The influencer tweeted:

“Russell 2000 is the biggest indicator for Altseason, and it's about to hit a new all-time high.

Same Cycle, Same Breakout Point

– Both Russell 2000 and ALTS MCAP peaked in Nov 2021, marking the cycle top.

– Both entered a long bear market (2022–2023).

 – Now, Russell is retesting its Nov 2021 highs, a key resistance zone.

– A breakout above these levels confirms the start of a major bull run in 2026.

History shows that the US Alts market (Russell 2000) and crypto ALTS often move in sync. If Russell breaks out, ETH and alts will follow it.

The crypto market is in a state of fear following the 10/10 flash crash, and all leverage is flushed, which means it's a perfect scenario for a parabolic pump to start.

Must keep an eye on Russell as it will give an idea of how alts will move in the coming weeks.”

According to this graph, Ash Crypto is trying to show the similarity between the price trends of altcoins and the Russel 2000 and argue that the latter is a major signal of an incoming altseason. According to reports, there has been a 0.75 annual correlation between the Russell 2000 and altcoins since early 2024. 

The Russell 2000 is a market-cap-based index that details the performance of approximately 2,000 small-cap companies in the U.S. equity market. It is opposed to the regular stock market, which hosts some of the world's largest publicly traded companies, aka blue-chip companies. In essence, it is an index that has historically attracted blue-collar workers seeking to capitalize on its volatility. 

Liquidity plays a major role in the performance of the Russel 2000 index, which has seen a sharp spike in the second half of the current calendar year due to the ongoing QT relaxation. Currently, it is hovering around its ATH above 2500 points, a roughly 17% increase since June 11. The index is poised to go ballistic, and cryptos like Solana, XRP, BNB, and others could follow suit immediately. 

The Russel 2000 index represents the stock market in the same way altcoins represent the larger cryptocurrency market. The small-cap digital currencies are more volatile and are made up of thousands of smaller projects, just like the Russel index. 

So, when the Russel 2000 records a new ATH due to improving liquidity, analysts believe that the similarly positioned altcoins are also in for a major price rebound. 2025 has been a massive disappointment for an overwhelming number of these smaller coin projects, so traders are waiting for a major bullish activity in 2026 and looking for clues regarding it. Ash Crypto believes the Russel 2000 is the biggest such indicator out there, and the altcoin market is right around the corner.

Imagine a busy city where every neighborhood has its own roads, yet none of them connect. Moving across the city becomes slow and confusing.

LiquidChain ($LIQUID) approaches the crypto world as if it were that city, and it builds the missing highway that links everything together. Its Layer-3 system brings liquidity from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into one organized layer, giving the market a cleaner structure for cross-chain movement.

Separate chains often create independent environments that do not interact well. LiquidChain addresses this through a Layer-3 structure that sits above Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This shared layer acts as a single access point for liquidity. Applications can rely on it without switching between several tools.

The shared layer supports a routing system designed for clear movement between chains. Each transfer follows a consistent path, which helps reduce delays. This creates a smoother experience for platforms that depend on quick transfers.

Security forms a central part of LiquidChain's design. The network uses verification steps that confirm activity on every connected chain. This protects the ecosystem from errors and inconsistencies. The method supports trust for teams that need precise cross-chain activity.

LiquidChain also aims for simplicity. Instead of separate bridges and external tools, the network uses one organized framework. This helps builders reduce the number of pieces they manage and gives them a more efficient environment to create new products.

The $LIQUID token supports the main functions of the LiquidChain ecosystem. Its tokenomics focus on balance, stability, and long-term development. This gives the network a steady foundation as more platforms interact with the shared Layer-3.

A clear token allocation supports the overall framework. Development is assigned 30% of the supply, the treasury holds 25%, and marketing receives 20%. Rewards are set at 15%, with the last 10% reserved for listings. This structure aims to keep the ecosystem stable and create conditions for steady growth as LiquidChain develops.

Fees across the connected chains remain low. This supports builders who depend on consistent costs when sending or receiving assets. Predictable fees also help new applications connect to the Layer-3 without facing sudden cost changes.

The token provides utility throughout the ecosystem. Each transfer across LiquidChain includes an interaction with $LIQUID. This helps maintain activity inside the network and strengthens the token's value within its natural function. These tokenomics place $LIQUID in a stable position as adoption grows.



The LiquidChain presale gives the project early visibility as it builds the Layer-3 system. The current presale price stands at $0.01245, marking an important stage in the network's development. This phase supports further progress on routing tools, integrations, and technical features.

Staking forms a major part of the ecosystem. Current estimates place staking rewards at over 13,000%, highlighting the strong role that early participation plays in the network. These rewards help maintain steady liquidity inside the shared layer. They also create a reliable pool of support as the project develops.

The combination of the presale and staking model strengthens the foundation of the network. It gives LiquidChain the structure it needs to grow across several major chains. The model also supports long-term planning for developers who need a stable environment.



LiquidChain enters the market with a clear focus on unified liquidity and simpler cross-chain movement. Its Layer-3 system provides a structured environment for activity across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This approach positions the project well as demand for multi-chain tools increases.

The roadmap includes plans for additional integrations and updated routing technology. These improvements aim to increase capacity across the shared layer. As more applications adopt multi-chain models, LiquidChain's role becomes even more meaningful.

The market continues to show interest in tools that support cleaner cross-chain communication. LiquidChain offers a design that fits this trend with clarity and purpose. Its tokenomics, crypto presale structure, and staking system all contribute to a stable long-term direction.

The next phase will focus on broader adoption. More applications can connect to the Layer-3 system as LiquidChain builds out its ecosystem. This positions the project as one of the leading names in advanced multi-chain development.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), expressed his support for blockchain and stablecoin on Monday, stating that the banking giant is open to leveraging the technology to improve services for its clients.

During an interview with Fox Business, Dimon said blockchain technology is “real” and is growing more “efficient” and “effective” as people find it faster and cheaper.

Smart contracts would probably be real. We are working on a stablecoin,” Dimon said. “We are going to do the same thing, in tokenization.”

“As a payment system, a network, if we can use things like that to do something better, faster, cheaper for clients, we're going to,” said the CEO of America's largest bank.

Dimon emphasized the need for regulatory “guardrails” around these technologies, citing the bank's adherence to rules, regulations, pricing, anti-money laundering, know your customer, and regular government oversight.

“I hope they come up with rules and regulations that make it a rational, usable, fair product,” Dimon stated.

JPMorgan rolled out a deposit token, JPM Coin, to its institutional clients last month. The token, which represents dollar deposits at the world's largest bank, allows users to send and receive money via Coinbase‘s (NASDAQ:COIN) public blockchain Base.

The bank's upcoming collateralization program, expected to go live by late 2025, will let institutional clients pledge Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) for secured loans

Dimon has recognized the utility of blockchain technology and stablecoins in the past, but continues to be very critical of Bitcoin.

Dimon believes that the leading asset lacks intrinsic value and is primarily utilized by criminals. He even suspected Bitcoin's scarcity narrative, asking how the 21 million supply cap was determined.

Price Action:  Shares of JPMorgan closed 0.05% higher at $315.21 during Monday's regular trading session, according to data from Benzinga Pro. 

JPM ranked moderately high on the momentum and growth metrics as of this writing. To check out how other banking stocks stack up, visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings for more details.

Every tissue in the human body contains exceptionally small fibers that help coordinate how organs move, function and communicate. Muscle fibers guide physical force, intestinal fibers support the motion of the digestive tract, and brain fibers carry electrical signals that allow different regions to exchange information. Together, these intricate fiber systems help shape the structure of each organ and keep them operating properly.

Many diseases disrupt these delicate networks. In the brain, damage to fiber connections appears across nearly all neurological disorders, where it contributes to changes in neural communication.

Although these microscopic structures play essential roles, they have long been challenging to study. Researchers have struggled to determine how fibers are oriented inside tissues, which has made it difficult to fully understand how they change in health and disease.

A Simple Method for Revealing Hidden Microstructure

A research team led by Marios Georgiadis, PhD, instructor of neuroimaging, has now introduced an approach that makes these hard-to-see fiber patterns visible with exceptional clarity and at a relatively low cost.

Their technique, described in Nature Communications, is known as computational scattered light imaging (ComSLI). It can reveal the orientation and organization of tissue fibers at micrometer resolution on virtually any histology slide, regardless of how it was stained or preserved -- even if the slide is many decades old.

Michael Zeineh, MD, PhD, professor of radiology, served as co-senior author with Miriam Menzel, PhD, a former visiting scholar in Zeineh's laboratory.

"The information about tissue structures has always been there, hidden in plain sight," Georgiadis said. "ComSLI simply gives us a way to see that information and map it out."

How ComSLI Maps Fiber Orientation

Traditional imaging strategies come with significant limitations. MRI can highlight large anatomical networks but cannot capture tiny cellular structures. Histology techniques often require specialized stains, high-end equipment and carefully preserved samples, and they still struggle to depict fiber crossings clearly.

ComSLI relies on a basic physical principle: when light encounters microscopic structures, it scatters in different directions based on their orientation. By rotating the light source and recording how the scattering signal changes, researchers can reconstruct the direction of the fibers within each pixel of an image.

The method requires only a rotating LED light and a microscope camera, making the setup accessible compared with other forms of advanced microscopy. After the images are collected, software analyzes delicate patterns in the scattered light to generate color-coded maps of fiber orientation and density, known as microstructure-informed fiber orientation distributions.

ComSLI is not limited by sample preparation. It works with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (a standard in hospitals and pathology labs) as well as fresh-frozen, stained or unstained slides.

Scientists can also revisit slides originally created for unrelated projects, even those stored for decades, allowing new structural insights without altering the samples.

"This is a tool that any lab can use," Zeineh said. "You don't need specialized preparation or expensive equipment. What excites me most is that this approach opens the door for anyone, from small research labs to pathology labs, to uncover new insights from slides they already have."

Mapping Neural Microstructure and Disease

A major goal in neuroscience has been to chart the brain's microscopic pathways with high precision. Using ComSLI, Georgiadis and colleagues visualized full formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human brain sections and standard-sized slides, revealing detailed fiber structures throughout the tissue.

They also examined how these fibers change in neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis, leukoencephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease.

One focus was the hippocampus, a deep-brain region central to memory formation and retrieval and often affected early in neurodegeneration. When comparing a hippocampal section from a patient with Alzheimer's disease to a healthy sample, the team observed clear structural deterioration. Fiber crossings that normally help connect regions of the hippocampus were greatly diminished, and a major pathway responsible for bringing memory-related signals into the region (the perforant pathway) was barely visible. The healthy hippocampus, in contrast, showed a dense and interconnected network of fibers across the entire area. With these detailed maps, researchers can see how memory circuits break down as disease progresses.

To test the limits of the method, the researchers analyzed a brain section prepared in 1904. Even in this century-old sample, ComSLI identified intricate fiber patterns, allowing scientists to study historical specimens and explore how structural features evolve across generations of disease.

Applications Beyond the Brain

Although first designed for brain research, ComSLI also works well in other tissues. The team used it to study muscle, bone and vascular samples, each revealing unique fiber arrangements tied to their biological functions.

In tongue muscle, the method highlighted layered fiber orientations linked to movement and flexibility. In bone, it captured collagen fibers that align with mechanical stress. In arteries, it showed alternating collagen and elastin layers that support both strength and elasticity.

This ability to map fiber orientation across species, organs and archival specimens could significantly change how scientists investigate structure and function. It also means that millions of stored slides around the world may contain untapped microstructural information.

"Although we just presented the method, there are already multiple requests for scanning samples and replicating the ComSLI setup -- so many labs and clinics would like to have micron-resolution fiber orientation and micro-connectivity on their histology sections," Georgiadis said. "Another exciting plan is to go back to well-characterized brain archives or brain sections of famous people, and recover this micro-connectivity information, revealing 'secrets' that have been considered long lost. This is the beauty of ComSLI."

By creating a new graphene material, engineers were able to facilitate the movement of ions and increase the power and energy capacity of their supercapacitors.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Supercapacitors are the answer to power and energy burnout. With more power density (or power per unit of space) than batteries and more energy density than dielectric capacitors (which store electric charge), these hybrids of the future should be able to merge superfast charging with a power boost. But they currently have one major drawback: The materials they are made of are not able to take advantage of their entire storage capacity. 

Graphene is one of the materials often used to make the electrodes in these atomic fuel tanks, as its carbon's superior conductivity allows ions to travel faster and provides more surface area on which to store them. The issue is that only a fraction of that surface area is actually available, and previous efforts to optimize surface area have still not been enough.

Enter mechanical engineer Mainak Majumder and his research team at Monash University in Australia. Aware that demand for high volumes energy density is increasing right alongside demand for compact and portable electronics, Majumder set out to devise a solution for supercapacitor setbacks. The reason that current technology falls short is because of chemical interactions that make it impossible for ions to adhere to spaces between sheets of graphene in 3D structures. While the design flexibility of graphene makes it possible to create denser electrodes, which in turn make it easier for ions to move around, they are still not using much of the potential storage capacity they have. 

“We design[ed] a graphene structure tailored to deliver volumetrically-efficient capacitive energy storage,” Majumder said in a study recently published in Nature Communications. “By integrating nano- and meso-scale features of graphene in micron-sized particles, we demonstrate that a multiscale structure, benefiting from each scale, enhances ion accessibility, transport kinetics, energy storage capacity and long-term stability.”

The team realized they needed to change how they treated graphene with heat. Australia has vast reserves of graphite, from which graphene is created. The team heated graphite oxide powder rapidly and cooled the resulting substance—an emerging material known as multiscale reduced graphene oxide (M-rGO)—slowly so that it could be more workable and prevent internal stress that could cause it to break.

Unlike graphite, graphene has the advantage of chemical interactions between its sheets, whose carbon atoms are arranged in honeycomb structures. (These sheets are as thick as one atom, making them two-dimensional.) These interactions create what Majumder calls “reactive energetic hotspots” that facilitate movement for ions. Normally, pathways for ions in stacked graphene sheets limit capacity because they are difficult for the ions to maneuver through. But after heating and cooling, the transformed M-rGO structure's curved nanocrystals and disordered graphene sheets served as both highways and reservoirs for ions that significantly increased storage capacity. 

The new electrodes were incorporated into pouch cell devices. These flexible, lightweight cells—which are far more efficient than most batteries—allow for a higher energy density, making them ideal for use in electronics. They can be found in not just in electric vehicle batteries, but in gadgets like drones, tablets, and smartphones. Majmuder's supercapacitors not only outperformed previous graphene structures with especially high energy and power densities, but remained stable, and charged in almost no time. They were so successful that commercialization is already on the horizon.

“Thanks to an extended voltage window […] these pouches deliver a [high] volumetric energy density,” he said. “High volumetric energy and power densities in both organic and ionic liquid electrolytes highlights the powerful role of multiscaling to manipulate active sites, energy storage mechanisms and ion transport.”

They also dated the pits to 2480 B.C.E. and determined they may have been part of a ceremonial boundry.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The 16 uniformly shaped massive pits found at the Neolithic Durrington Walls henge just north of Stonehenge were not a random natural occurrence. Ever since their discovery in 2020, research teams from a range of institutions have studied the site, and the conclusion is clear: The pits were manmade, likely all dug around the same time in 2480 B.C.E. 

“The recent work confirms that the circle of shafts surrounding Durrington Walls is without precedent within the UK,” Vince Gaffney, professor and lead archaeologist from the University of Bradford, said in a statement from the school. “These features were not simply dug and abandoned—they were part of a structured, monumental landscape that speaks to the complexity and sophistication of Neolithic society.” 

The team's findings were detailed in a study published by Internet Archaeology, showing just how this structure, the largest of its type ever found in Britain, likely came to be. The 16 pits form a circle over 1.25 miles wide at Durrington Walls, itself one of the largest prehistoric enclosures in Britain, enclosing an area greater than one square mile. Many of the pits are nearly 33 feet in diameter and up to 16 feet deep.

Using borehole coring, sediment analysis, geochemistry, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and environmental DNA the team confirmed the pits were human-dug and dated to the Late Neolithic period, around the same time Durrington Walls was constructed. 

“The new dating evidence, coupled with the remarkably consistent geochemical signature seen within the fills at the pits provides definitive evidence that they were constructed by people living at the site over a very short time period,” Tim Kinnaird of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences Dating Laboratory at the University of St Andrews, said in a statement from the university. “The synchronous timing of this could only have been achieved by a dedicated and coordinated action.” 

Data on the two arcs around the site show that the pits were a cohesive structure, likely representing an elaboration of the Durrington Walls monument complex at a “massive and completely unexpected scale.” 

“The skill and effort that must have been required not only to dig the pits, but also to place them so precisely within the landscape is a marvel,” Richard Bates, professor at St Andrews, said in a statement. “When you consider that the pits are spread over such a large distance, the fact they are located in a near perfect circular pattern is quite remarkable.” 

Archaeologists believe the pits may have marked a sacred boundary linked to ceremonial activity at Durrington Walls, like what happened at Stonehenge. The fine clay-silt layers now found in the pits suggest gradual infilling over time. 

“It is rare to have the opportunity to apply so many geophysical and geochemical techniques together to investigate a site,” Bates said, “but demonstrates the power of doing so when you do.”

The discovery of the settlements over the years has led to a new understanding of the Asia Minor and Anatolia regions.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Taken together, the discovery of 483 Late Bronze Age settlements in what was then Asia Minor/Anatolia tells an entirely new story about the region, including the powerful role it may have played with a culture completely independent of others. 

According to a new study published in Nature Scientific Data, a team of archaeologists, geologists, and geodata specialists wrote that they had identified 483 major settlements from the Middle and Late Bronze Age (2000 to 1300 B.C.E.) that give evidence of an entire culture lost to time. 

Tucked between Mycenaean Greece and Hittite Anatolia, the data “provides solid empirical support for the thesis that an independent cultural sphere once existed in western Asia Minor—namely the Luwian culture,” the team wrote in Popular Archaeology. 

The modern-day region in western Turkey across from Greece largely went unstudied for centuries, according to the scholars, leaving a void in the history books about an area that may have been highly influential in its time. The team believes that influence was separate from nearby cultures, and one that encompassed the Sea Peoples, or Luwian. 

The team has scoured the study area, roughly the size of Germany, since 2011 to understand the region and exposed 483 settlements, each of which was home to at least several hundred inhabitants and had continuous occupation throughout the second millennium B.C.E. The study is now open to the public at LuwianSiteMap, opening the exploration on the eastern side of the Aegean to more people via a comprehensive digital catalog of the sites from 2000 to 1200 B.C.E. 

“We can examine how large a settlement's catchment area was, how densely its networks were structured, and how closely communities clustered around critical mineral resources,” the authors wrote. “The capacity to study these relationships on a regional scale is entirely new for Western Anatolia.” 

The team said that while the ancient settlements may have numbered twice what they have found so far, it's clear that fertile farmland was the deciding factor in choosing a settlement site. Communities also typically avoided floodplains, opting for villages on slightly elevated ground near reliable water sources. Hilltops were key, as they commanded control of strategic passes and allowed villagers to fortify their sites. 

The team found that settlements often appear at roughly 17-kilometer (10.5 miles) intervals, approximately a day's travel. On the coast, the sites align with natural harbors. 

In the past, understanding of the region came from written perspectives offering the point of view of the Hittites, but further exploration of what is there can expose more of this culture, which included a Luwian language scholars believe was completely independent. The region long remained a blank space on the archaeological map, which the team suggests was due to political and ideological bias.

They note that the historical value of the area has been largely ignored, even as western Asia Minor was full of early literary sources, three of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and many Greek thinkers prior to Socrates. The region was also home to the well-known city of Troy.

“If we wish to address the unresolved questions of Mediterranean archaeology outlined at the beginning, we must inevitably bring Troy and the culture of its surrounding regions—the Luwians—into our reconstructions,” the authors wrote. “Once we do so, long-standing puzzles begin to fall into place: who the Sea Peoples were, why the Hittite kingdom collapsed, and whether there was, in fact, something akin to a Trojan War.”

Biologists achieved a landmark in protein design last year: using artificial intelligence (AI) to draw up entirely new antibody molecules1. Yet the proof-of-principle designs lacked the potency and other key features of commercial antibody drugs that rack up tens of billions in annual sales.

After a year of progress, scientists say they are on the cusp of turning AI-designed antibodies into potential therapies. In recent weeks, numerous teams have reported successfully using proprietary commercial AI tools and open-source models to make antibodies that have properties of antibody drugs.

‘A landmark moment': scientists use AI to design antibodies from scratch

‘A landmark moment': scientists use AI to design antibodies from scratch

“These latest efforts are remarkably powerful advances that enable a democratization of antibody engineering,” says Chang Liu, a synthetic biologist at University of California, Irvine.

The latest wave of success with de novo antibody design “will have a big impact on how quickly and how many de novo therapeutics we will see in clinical trials”, adds Timothy Jenkins, a protein engineer at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.

Therapeutic antibodies are usually made by screening vast numbers of diverse antibodies to find ones that can recognize a certain target. But sometimes, these screens turn up only antibodies that bind weakly to the target or recognize the wrong region on it.

“There isn't much precision,” says Surge Biswas, chief executive of antibody-design company Nabla Bio in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Instead, scientists hope to specify an antibody's desired target — the active site of an enzyme implicated in disease, for instance — and have an AI model suggest designs. “The promise of AI-guided design is that you can be atomically precise,” Biswas adds.

Antibodies — immune proteins that recognize foreign molecules, such as those made by pathogens, with exquisite specificity — have been a challenge for AI to design. AI models such as AlphaFold have struggled to predict the shape of flexible loop regions of antibodies, which they use to recognize their targets.

But new tools developed in the past year — including an updated version of AlphaFold — have proven better at modelling these flexible regions, says Gabriele Corso, a machine-learning scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Progress in antibody design has followed.

In October, Corso and his colleagues described the BoltzGen model in a preprint2, showing that it can adroitly design ‘nanobodies' — small, simple antibodies resembling molecules made by sharks and camels — against proteins implicated in cancer, viral and bacterial infections and other diseases. In most cases, the researchers identified antibodies with strong target binding after expressing just 15 of the most-promising designs in cells and testing them in laboratory experiments. However, the molecules were not tested in disease models.

Other teams are making similar progress. For instance, a team at Stanford University in California and the Arc Institute in Palo Alto, California, has also released a model that can design nanobodies with high efficiencies3. And last month, the team behind the 2024 breakthrough — led by Nobel-prizewinning biophysicist David Baker at the University of Washington in Seattle — reported in Nature4 marked improvements in their nanobody design efforts, using another open-source tool.

The boldest claims in AI antibody design come from companies working on the challenge. Last month, scientists at Nabla and Chai Discovery in San Francisco, California, said they had made ‘drug-like' antibodies using AI tools.

Both teams said that, in addition to nanobodies, which are composed of a single chain of amino acids, they had generated full-length antibodies. Baker's team reported such designs in their report as well4. Lab experiments showed that some of the designer molecules recognized diverse disease targets — including molecules called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which have challenged conventional antibody design efforts — at potencies similar to those of commercial antibody drugs. They also boasted useful properties that can make or break drug candidates, such as the capacity to be produced at high levels and to recognize only their intended targets5.

Food Intelligence: The Science of How Food Both Nourishes and Harms Us Julia Belluz & Kevin Hall Avery (2025)

In 2019, Kevin Hall, a physicist turned nutrition researcher, published a landmark study1. In it, 20 adults ate one of two diets, which were identical in nutrients and differed only in their level of processing. Participants who ate ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumed about 500 kilocalories more per day and gained weight, whereas those on a minimally processed diet lost weight. The results offered strong evidence that many industrially produced foods can override satiety signals and drive overeating. And it made Hall one of the most influential figures in nutritional science.

Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says

Are ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says

Understandably, expectations were high for his book, Food Intelligence, co-written with Canadian journalist Julia Belluz. It digs deeper into the implications of the 2019 study — that the harms of processed foods can't be reduced to their fat, sugar or salt content alone, and that the prevalent government strategy of politely asking companies to tweak their recipes by cutting salt or sugar content, say, is unlikely to address rising obesity rates. Unfortunately, the execution only partly lives up to the promise.

In this wide-ranging primer on food science, Hall and Belluz revisit many food-related misconceptions. They debunk the idea that cutting 500 kilocalories a day reliably leads to the loss of half a kilogram a week and that “broken metabolism” explains obesity — as Hall highlighted in his role as a scientific adviser to the reality television programme The Biggest Loser, in which contestants attempt extreme weight loss.

Are you what you eat? How food shapes self-image

Are you what you eat? How food shapes self-image

The authors challenge the current obsession with protein, noting that most people already consume enough through ordinary diets. They are equally dismissive of the booming supplements industry, arguing that many products lack clinical evidence or have been shown to offer no real benefit. Their scepticism extends to continuous glucose monitoring in people without diabetes, which they warn might provoke needless anxiety without providing clear advantages. The critique culminates in a forceful take down of the personalized-nutrition industry — diet plans based on genetics, which they argue have no solid scientific basis.

By tracing the origins of the limited control the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exerts over food additives and supplements, the authors provide valuable context for why the US food environment is particularly problematic. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ensured that dietary supplements do not require premarket approval. The FDA also allows companies to introduce additive chemicals into food if these are merely ‘generally recognized as safe'.

This lax regulatory framework, shaped heavily by food-industry lobbying, stands in stark contrast to the stricter regimes in much of Europe and Latin America. Some countries now warn the public about highly processed foods, yet nutrition-guideline committees in the United States and United Kingdom still decline to mention them as potentially harmful, even as the FDA has been asked to consider the issue in its upcoming review. The status quo persists despite multiple observational studies, Hall's influential 2019 clinical trial and studies that have replicated his findings.

In terms of solutions, the book argues that “personal responsibility” plays little part in nutrition — a point that, if pushed too rigidly, can feel disempowering. The authors insist that the real challenge lies in reshaping the “toxic food environment” that drives overconsumption. They call for tighter regulation and greater transparency on additives, reformulation of industrial products, and taxes on ultra-processed foods to shift diets towards whole foods, fruit and vegetables.

It's a powerful message, and one that deserves wider attention, even if the book's practical diet suggestions are underwhelming: eat less meat, eat more fruit and vegetables, and store junk food out of sight.

Breakthrough in Digital Screens Takes Color Resolution to Incredibly Small Scale

These miniature displays can be the size of your pupil, with as many pixels as you have photoreceptors—opening the way to improved virtual reality

By Simon Makin edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Visual displays have steadily gotten smaller and held closer to our eyes as our viewing habits have shifted from cinema screens to TVs to computers, smartphones and virtual reality. This shift has required higher image resolution (usually through increased pixel counts) to provide enough detail. Conventional light-emitting pixels work poorly below a certain size: brightness drops, and colors bleed. The same isn't true for reflective displays such as those used in many e-readers, whose pixels reflect ambient light rather than emitting their own—but creating those pixels typically requires larger components.

A new reflective display could shatter those restrictions with resolutions beyond the limit of human perception. In a recent study in Nature, scientists describe a reflective retina e-paper that can display color video on screens smaller than two square millimeters across.

The researchers used nanoparticles whose size and spacing affect how light is scattered, tuning them to create red, green and blue subpixels. The material is electrochromic, so its light absorption and reflection can be controlled with electrical signals. With this setup, “metapixels” consisting of the three subpixels can generate any color if you deliver appropriate signals.

Each pixel is only 560 nanometers wide, creating a resolution above 25,000 pixels per inch—more than 50 times that of current smartphones. “We can make displays a similar size as your pupil, with a similar number of pixels as photoreceptors in your eyes,” says study co-author Kunli Xiong of Uppsala University in Sweden. “So we can create virtual worlds very close to reality.”

E-paper screens also have relatively low energy requirements; the pixels retain their color for some time, so power is generally needed only when colors change. “It uses ultralow power,” Xiong says. “For very small devices, it is not easy to integrate large batteries, so that energy saving becomes even more important.”

The team demonstrated the technology with a version of The Kiss by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt and a three-dimensional butterfly image. “People have made these kinds of materials before, but usually they produce poor colors,” says Jeremy Baumberg, a nanotechnologist at the University of Cambridge, who studies how nanoscale materials interact with light. In comparison, the design of Xiong and his colleagues' subpixels “generates colors that look more compelling than I've seen before,” Baumberg says.

These pixels can be rapidly controlled, enabling a reasonable refresh rate—but the necessary electronics for such a high resolution do not yet exist. Xiong and his colleagues anticipate that engineering companies will begin to develop such systems.

Meanwhile Xiong's team plans to optimize other aspects of the technology such as its speed and lifetime. “Every time you switch [colors], the material's structure changes, and eventually it crumbles,” Baumberg says—similar to how batteries decay. He estimates that it'll be five to 10 years before we see commercially available devices.

Reducing calorie intake through dietary restriction (DR) slows tumour growth in mammals, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we show that DR enhances anti-tumour immunity by optimizing CD8+ T cell function within the tumour microenvironment (TME). Using syngeneic xenograft tumour models, we found that DR induces a profound reprogramming of CD8+ T cell fate in the TME, favouring the expansion of effector T cell subsets with enhanced metabolic capacity and cytotoxic potential, while limiting the accumulation of terminally exhausted T cells. This metabolic reprogramming is driven by enhanced ketone body oxidation, particularly β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), which is elevated in both the circulation and tumour tissues of DR-fed mice. βOHB fuels T cell oxidative metabolism under DR, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and tricarboxylic acid cycle-dependent pathways critical for T cell effector function, including acetyl-CoA production. By contrast, T cells deficient for ketone body oxidation exhibit reduced mitochondrial function, increased exhaustion and fail to control tumour growth under DR conditions. Importantly, DR synergizes with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, further augmenting anti-tumour T cell responses and limiting tumour progression. Our findings reveal that T cell metabolic reprogramming is central to the anti-tumour effects of DR, highlighting nutritional control of CD8+ T cell fate as a key driver of anti-tumour immunity.

The balance between cancer cell proliferation and anti-tumour functions of the immune system influences tumour growth1. Cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells (Teff cells) provide essential protective immunity against cancer2,3. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment landscape for various malignancies, in part by promoting the expansion of CD8+ T cell subsets that limit tumour progression4. However, given their central role in controlling tumour growth, CD8+ T cells are often the target of immune evasion and suppression mechanisms. Chronic exposure to tumour antigens and inflammatory conditions in the TME can promote CD8+ T cell dysfunction (also known as exhaustion), a terminally differentiated state characterized by reduced proliferative capacity, impaired cytokine production and increased expression of inhibitory receptors (that is, PD1, LAG3, TIM3) that limit T cell effector function5,6. The accumulation of terminally exhausted T cells (Tex cells) in tumours is driven by the transcription factor thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box (TOX) and is reinforced through epigenetic programming7,8,9,10, ultimately limiting the ability of CD8+ T cells to control tumour growth. Understanding mechanisms that drive CD8+ T cell fate decisions in the TME is critical for developing new approaches to counter T cell dysfunction and overcome ICI resistance during tumour progression.

Metabolism is a key determinant of CD8+ T cell function and survival that underlies effective anti-tumour immunity11. Activated CD8+ T cells rewire their metabolism to produce both energy (that is, ATP production) and the biosynthetic molecules required for cell proliferation and effector function, and they use both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to fuel these processes12,13,14. T cell dysfunction is also influenced by environmental conditions in the TME that impact T cell metabolism15,16. Chronic antigen stimulation, hypoxic stress and PD1 signalling all promote metabolic and mitochondrial derangements in CD8+ T cells that precede their dysfunction17,18,19,20. Conversely, CD8+ T cell effector function is enhanced by exposure to nutrients that fuel mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) levels, including ketone bodies and acetate21,22,23. Nutrient levels in the TME are highly influenced by diet24. Therefore, dietary strategies that modulate metabolic conditions in the TME have the potential to influence anti-tumour immune responses—either in isolation or in combination with ICI treatments—by metabolic reprogramming of CD8+ T cell function.

DR, a feeding regimen that reduces caloric intake without malnutrition, extends lifespan in mammals and delays the onset of age-related diseases, including cancer25,26,27,28,29. Dietary interventions that limit tumour growth—such as DR, fasting-mimicking diets or low glycemic diets—are presumed to act by altering growth factor (that is, insulin, IGF-1) signalling and/or nutrient availability (that is, glucose) for cancer cells30,31,32,33. Yet the contribution of the immune system to the anti-tumour effects of DR, either in isolation or in combination with ICI treatment, is poorly understood. Although malnutrition has deleterious effects on the immune system34,35, DR has been shown to enhance certain aspects of immune function36. Despite lower calorie intake, DR has been shown to enhance natural killer, myeloid and memory T cell responses in vivo37,38,39,40. Similarly, T cells isolated from calorie-restricted patients show enhanced proliferation and effector responses in vitro41. Here, we show that DR-driven changes in ketone body metabolism direct CD8+ T cell fate and function in the TME to suppress tumour growth.

To assess the impact of lowering food intake on tumour growth in immunocompetent mice, we used an established model of DR in which daily food availability is reduced by 50% with no change to nutritional content (Supplementary Table 1)38. C57BL/6J mice were fed either ad libitum (AL) or subjected to 50% DR for 7 days before establishment of subcutaneous syngeneic tumour allografts (Fig. 1a). Consistent with previous reports38, this transient reduction in food intake resulted in an approximately 15–20% loss in body weight compared to AL-fed animals after 2 weeks (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Consistent with previous reports, this 50% DR produced a marked reduction in fat mass with minimal loss of lean mass after 2 weeks (Fig. 1c)38. Strikingly, syngeneic melanoma (B16) and breast cancer (E0771) tumours grew more slowly in mice adapted to DR, resulting in a 30–80% extension of tumour-free survival (Fig. 1d–e). These results from DR are comparable to the delay in tumour growth observed in animals fed a fasting-mimicking diet42.

T cells have a critical role in controlling tumour cell growth. We quantified the impact of DR on CD8⁺ T cell infiltration into syngeneic EO771 breast cancer tumours by immunohistochemistry. DR-fed mice showed a marked increase in CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) compared to AL controls (Fig. 1f). Flow cytometry analysis of TILs from B16 melanoma tumours demonstrated a similar increase in the frequency of effector CD8⁺ (PD1lo) T cells in mice conditioned to DR versus AL-fed mice (Fig. 1g). Strikingly, the delay in tumour growth conferred by DR was lost in Rag2−/− mice, which lack mature T cells and B cells (Fig. 1h). Depletion of CD8+ T cells also abrogated the anti-tumour effects of DR (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Similarly, we observed no difference in B16 tumour growth in athymic nude mice that lack mature T cells, regardless of diet (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Together, these data indicate that the anti-tumour effects of DR require CD8⁺ T cells.

To determine how DR impacts immune cells in the TME, we performed cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes coupled to next-generation sequencing (CITE-seq) on live CD45+ cells sorted from B16 tumours from AL-fed or DR-fed mice. We identified several cell type clusters that were categorized into three main groups: myeloid cells, T cells and natural killer cells (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Table 2). Although recent work suggests that DR can boost natural killer cell-mediated anti-tumour immunity39, tumour-infiltrating natural killer cell populations were similar between dietary conditions (Fig. 2a). Notably, the proportion of tumour-infiltrating CD45+ T cells was increased under DR, marked by an increase in the proportion of Gzmb-expressing CD8+ Teff cells (Fig. 2a–b).

To determine the impact of DR on CD8+ Teff cell function(s) in the TME, we isolated TILs from excised B16 melanoma tumours from mice fed different diets. The majority of CD8+ TILs under DR conditions expressed low levels of the inhibitory receptor PD1 (Fig. 1g). Moreover, PD1lo CD8+ TILs from B16 tumours from DR-fed mice displayed elevated TBET (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and granzyme B (GZMB) expression (Fig. 2b), consistent with heightened effector function. Although interferon-γ (IFNγ) levels in PD1lo CD8+ TILs were similar between AL and DR conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2e), LY108/SLAMF6 expression was significantly higher in Teff cells under DR, suggesting a more stem-like phenotype (Fig. 2c). Collectively, these findings indicate that DR both expands the CD8+ Teff cell population within tumours and enhances features of cytotoxicity.

We next evaluated mechanisms underlying the effects of DR on CD8+ T cell effector function. Animals on the DR regimen displayed normal levels of physical activity (Extended Data Fig. 3a) but consumed 50% less food and water on average (Extended Data Fig. 3b), resulting in weight loss that plateaued after 3–4 days (Extended Data Fig. 3c). EchoMRI analysis of mice subjected to various levels of DR (that is, 30%, 40% or 50% DR) for 2 weeks revealed greater body-weight loss that plateaued by day 4 (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). Although 50% DR elicited the largest mean weight reduction, it was not significantly greater than that seen with 40% DR (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Importantly, weight loss under DR was driven almost entirely by fat-mass depletion—with >50% loss in mice on 50% DR—while lean mass loss was similar between the 40% and 50% DR groups (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g). Consistent with these effects on host metabolism, tumour onset was delayed under all DR regimens, with the greatest and most consistent protection seen with 50% DR (Extended Data Fig. 3h).

Baseline immune profiling revealed an overall decrease in immune cell numbers in the spleens of DR-fed mice, although the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations between diets was not dramatically altered (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Table 3), consistent with previous reports38,40. To control for systemic effects of DR on CD8+ T cell homoeostasis, we used a T cell adoptive transfer model coupled to Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) infection, which elicits robust CD8+ Teff cell responses in vivo21,43,44. Thy1.1+ OT-I T cell receptor transgenic CD8+ T cells were transferred into AL or DR-fed mice, followed by infection with attenuated Lm-expressing ovalbumin (LmOVA), and splenocytes extracted 7 days post infection (dpi) for ex vivo functional analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Similar to CD8+ TIL from DR-fed mice, OT-I T cells responding to LmOVA infection under DR-fed conditions displayed increased effector function when analysed ex vivo, characterized by an increase in the percentage of IFNγ-producing T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b), higher IFNγ production on a per-cell basis (Extended Data Fig. 5c) and an increased percentage of GZMB+ CD8+ Teff cells (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Elevated GZMB protein levels displayed by DR-conditioned OT-I T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5e) was consistent with the elevated GZMB production displayed by CD8+ TIL under DR (Fig. 2b). Ex vivo OT-I CD8+ T cells displayed increased effector function in DR-fed mice despite an overall reduction in expansion following LmOVA infection (Extended Data Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 4).

To identify mechanisms by which DR enhances CD8+ Teff cell function, we analysed changes in global protein levels in OT-I T cells isolated from AL-fed or DR-fed mice following LmOVA infection (as in Extended Data Fig. 5a). At 7 dpi, OT-I Teff cells isolated from DR-conditioned mice displayed enrichment of a distinct set of 277 proteins associated with anabolic growth and metabolism (that is, G2M checkpoint, E2F and MYC targets, interleukin-2 (IL-2) signalling) (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 5g and Supplementary Table 4). Using the fold-change data from Fig. 2d (with proteins first mapped to gene symbols) and the results in Supplementary Table 4, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) against the Hallmark, C2 and C5 gene collections. This analysis revealed significant enrichment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pathway (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 4), which underpins both bioenergetic and biosynthetic functions in CD8⁺ T cells11. Consistent with this observation, OT-I Teff cells isolated from DR-conditioned mice responding to LmOVA infection displayed increased levels of TCA cycle metabolites compared to control-fed animals (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5h). Seahorse analysis of OT-I Teff cells isolated from LmOVA-infected mice revealed an increase in both the extracellular acidification rate (a measure of glycolysis) and oxygen consumption rate (a measure of OXPHOS) in DR-conditioned Teff cells compared to AL-fed controls (Fig. 2g,h). This corresponded to significant increases in both oxidative and glycolytic ATP production in Teff cells from DR-conditioned mice compared to AL-fed controls (Fig. 2i) and almost a doubling in maximal ATP production capacity (Extended Data Fig. 5i). Moreover, OT-I Teff cells responding to LmOVA infection displayed increased mitochondrial membrane potential (as determined by TMRM staining) under DR conditions compared to AL-fed controls (Fig. 2j). Collectively, these data indicate that restricting food intake (by DR) enhances CD8+ Teff cell metabolic fitness through effects on the TCA cycle and OXPHOS.

Our findings indicate that DR increases the proportion of functional CD8+ Teff cells within the TME. Therefore, we used our CITE-seq datasets to characterize how DR impacts CD8+ T cell subsets within TIL populations. Cell clusters were classified based on a combination of gene features, gene density, antibody-derived tags (ADTs) and MSigDB pathway analysis (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Table 5). Cellular indexing of both protein epitopes and transcriptional profiling revealed two major CD8+ TIL populations in B16 tumours based on gene expression for Tox, a key transcriptional regulator of T cell exhaustion7,8 (Fig. 3a). The accumulation of Tex cells in tumours is driven by TOX and is reinforced through epigenetic programming7,8,9,10, ultimately limiting the ability of CD8+ T cells to control tumour growth. In B16 tumours, the Toxlo population consisted of five main subclusters, including two Mki67+ proliferating Teff cell populations (Prolif1 and Prolif2), two progenitor Tex cell populations (TexProg1, TexProg2), an intermediate exhausted (TexInt) population and a small naive-like cell population (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Toxhi CD8+ T cells displayed elevated transcript levels of inhibitory receptor genes (Lag3+Havcr2+Pcdc1+) but clustered into two distinct groups: a conventional terminally exhausted (TexTerm) population and a proliferating (Mki67+) effector-like exhausted population (TexEff) (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b)5. Fast gene set enrichment analysis (fgsea) identified the TexEff cluster as having the most effector-like properties, including enrichment for immune response and cell cycle genes (Fig. 3b). TexEff cells also displayed increased expression of genes encoding effector molecules (that is, Ifng, Tnfa and Gzmb) (Fig. 3b), despite elevated expression of transcripts encoding Tox and inhibitory receptors (that is, Pdcd1, Lag3, Havcr2) (Extended Data Fig. 6b).

Single-cell hashtagging strategies allowed us to track CD8+ TIL populations in B16 tumours from either AL-fed or DR-fed mice. Analysis of CD8+ TIL populations revealed two major trends induced by DR feeding. First, for the Toxlo CD8+ TIL subset, we observed an expansion in proliferating Teff cell populations (Prolif1, Prolif2) and a decrease in TexInt cells in animals conditioned to DR (Fig. 3c,d). Second, the type of Tox-expressing Tex cells found in tumours was highly dependent on diet. Tumours from AL-fed mice contained more TexTerm CD8+ T cells, while tumours from DR mice contained a greater proportion of TexEff (Fig. 3c,d). To determine whether the diet-induced changes in Tex cell populations reflect differences in CD8+ T cell differentiation, we used RNA velocity analysis, a computational method that infers cellular differentiation trajectories based on the relative abundances of spliced and unspliced transcripts in single cells45. Under AL conditions, RNA velocity inference showed a directional flow away from the proliferating effector population towards TexInt and ultimately TexTerm populations (Fig. 3e). By contrast, under DR, the direction of CD8+ T cell trajectory culminated in the effector-like TexEff population (Fig. 3e). This change in differentiation trajectory corresponded to a major shift in the ratio of effector to terminally exhausted T cell populations in B16 tumours, moving from an equal ratio of effector (proliferating and TexEff) to TexTerm cells under AL-fed conditions to a 4:1 ratio under DR (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Collectively, these results suggest that DR alters CD8+ TIL fate, shifting CD8+ T cells away from terminal exhaustion and towards a more effector-like state that favours tumour control.

We next used flow cytometry to characterize the impact of DR on CD8+ T cell function within the TME. Consistent with our CITE-seq analysis, the number of CD8+ TexTerm cells—as determined by reduced TOX and inhibitory receptor (PD1+TOX+) expression—decreased significantly in tumours from DR-conditioned animals compared to AL-fed mice 14 days post tumour implantation (Fig. 3f). TOX-expressing CD8+ TILs from DR-fed mice displayed increased expression of stemness markers (LY108/SLAMF6) while showing reduced features of terminal exhaustion (that is, lower PD1 and TOX expression) compared to AL-fed controls (Fig. 3g). Using conventional markers for terminally exhausted (LY108−TIM3+) versus progenitor exhausted (LY108+TIM3−) cells4, the majority of PD1+ CD8+ TILs in B16 tumours from DR-fed mice were progenitor exhausted or an intermediate phenotype (LY108+TIM3+) (Fig. 3h). To validate our observations in an independent tumour model, we analysed TILs from EO771 breast cancer tumours and found a similar reduction in PD1+TOX+ CD8+ T cells within tumours from DR-conditioned mice compared to AL-fed controls (Fig. 3i). Indeed, TOX-expressing CD8+ TILs from E0771 tumours grown in DR-fed mice exhibited increased IFNγ production (Fig. 3j) and elevated TCF1 levels, a marker of cell stemness (Extended Data Fig. 6d). These findings indicate that DR enhances both the frequency and functional capacity of effector CD8⁺ T cells, promoting a less exhausted, more stem-like phenotype across tumour models.

CD8⁺ T cells rely on glycolysis and OXPHOS to fuel their proliferation and effector function12,13,14, but are capable of metabolizing a diverse set of metabolic substrates to fuel these processes21,46,47. Given the impact of DR on CD8+ T cell fate in the TME, we assessed whether DR alters the metabolic programming of CD8+ T cells needed for tumour control. We first conducted metabolism-focused GSEA on our CITE-seq datasets to define the metabolic features of CD8+ TIL subsets. This analysis revealed two distinct metabolically active CD8+ TIL populations in B16 tumours. CD8+ T cells with effector properties (Prolif1, TexEff) displayed the highest glycolytic signature (Fig. 4a), consistent with their high proliferative rate. Notably, TexEff cells—which preferentially expand in tumours under DR (Fig. 3a,b)—displayed the highest OXPHOS signature of all CD8+ TIL subsets (Fig. 4a). Moreover, like DR-conditioned Teff cells responding to Listeria infection (Fig. 2j), CD8+ TILs isolated from B16 tumours displayed increased TMRM staining (mitochondrial membrane potential) under DR conditions compared to CD8+ TILs from AL-fed controls (Fig. 4b). Therefore, the most metabolically active CD8+ TIL subsets—by gene expression signatures and mitochondrial membrane potential—are the effector cell populations enhanced by DR treatment.

Dietary modifications that alter systemic metabolism in mice can impact nutrient availability in the TME24,30,48. Therefore, we reasoned that DR impacts CD8+ T cell metabolism, in part, by altering the availability of specific nutrients in vivo. Indirect calorimetry revealed that mice conditioned to DR displayed a significant decrease in their respiratory exchange ratio during the fasted—but not the fed—state (Extended Data Fig. 7a), indicating increased lipid oxidation in DR-fed mice. We next used mass spectrometry to profile diet-induced alterations in lipid and metabolite abundance in B16 tumours. We observed a general decrease in fatty acid and lipid abundance in DR tumours compared to AL-fed controls (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 7b and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). This change in tumour lipid abundance is consistent with lipid mobilization from adipose tissue and a decrease in respiratory exchange rate, favouring oxidation triggered by DR30,38 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). By contrast, only a small number of metabolites were enriched in tumours from DR-treated mice, including increased abundance of the ketone body βOHB (Fig. 4c). Elevated βOHB levels were observed in both tumours and serum from DR-fed mice compared to AL-fed mice (Fig.4d).

The increase in circulating and intratumoral βOHB levels under DR was notable, given recent evidence linking ketone body metabolism to enhanced T cell effector function22,49. Using Seahorse bioenergetic analysis and 13C-labelled metabolic tracers, we observed a striking difference in βOHB use by CD8+ Teff cells based on diet. First, in ex vivo assays, augmenting DR-conditioned OT-I Teff cells with βOHB further increased their maximal oxygen consumption rate (Fig. 4e). This change corresponded to an approximately fourfold increase in maximal oxidative ATP production capacity compared to CD8+ Teff cells from AL-fed animals (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). Next, we cultured OT-I Teff cells from LmOVA-infected mice ex vivo in physiologic medium (VIM)21 containing fully labelled [13C6]-glucose and partially labelled [2,4-13C2]-βOHB. In this strategy, breakdown of [13C6]-glucose generates M + 2 labelled TCA cycle intermediates, whereas [2,4-13C2]-βOHB generates M + 1 labelled intermediates (Fig. 4g), thereby facilitating a direct comparison of the contribution of each fuel type to TCA cycle metabolism22. We observed a small but significant increase in [13C6]-glucose-derived citrate (M + 2) in DR-conditioned CD8+ Teff cells (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 8); however, citrate labelling from [2,4-13C2]-βOHB (M + 1) doubled in CD8+ Teff cells from DR compared to AL-fed mice (Fig. 4i). DR-conditioned OT-I Teff cells also displayed a lower ratio of [2,4-13C2]-βOHB-labelled malate-to citrate (Fig. 4j), indicative of increased export of mitochondrial citrate to the cytosol50. Consistent with these observations, steady-state acetyl-CoA levels were twofold higher in CD8+ Teff cells from DR-fed mice relative to T cells from AL-fed controls (Fig. 4k). Thus, DR increases both systemic βOHB availability and its use by CD8+ T cells.

Chronic exposure of CD8+ T cells to tumour antigens in the TME is a precursor to terminal exhaustion. We therefore modelled this process using an in vitro chronic stimulation system and assessed metabolic changes on T cell self-renewal and terminal differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 8a)20. Chronic stimulation of in vitro-activated CD8+ T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies promotes several features of T cell exhaustion, including increased expression of TOX and inhibitory receptors (that is, PD1, TIM3) (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 8b), as well as reduced cytokine polyfunctionality (TNF and IFNγ production; Extended Data Fig. 8c), compared to acutely stimulated CD8+ T cells maintained in IL-2. Notably, chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells displayed increased abundance of TCA cycle intermediates compared to acutely stimulated T cells (Fig. 5b).

The increase in TCA cycle intermediates in chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells was similar to that observed in vivo under DR (Fig. 2h), leading us to speculate that chronic antigen stimulation alters T cell nutrient use. Using different 13C-labelled metabolic tracers at their normal physiologic concentrations21, we found that βOHB and glutamine were the greatest contributors to citrate production under chronic stimulation in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 8d), with 13C-βOHB contributing predominantly to the first turn of the TCA cycle (M + 2 citrate; Extended Data Fig. 8e). In vitro chronic stimulation promoted increased 13C-βOHB uptake by CD8+ T cells compared to controls (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 9), while 13C-labelled glucose uptake and entry into glycolysis (measured by formation of 13C-labelled glucose-6-phosphate) was unchanged between conditions (Fig. 5d). Chronically stimulated T cells displayed higher βOHB oxidation in the TCA cycle as determined by increased levels of 13C-βOHB-derived citrate and malate compared to controls (Fig. 5e). Although both acetate and βOHB are major fuels for citrate production in Teff cells—contributing over 60% of the carbon for citrate (M + 2) production in Teff cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e)—only citrate production from βOHB was maintained under chronic stimulation conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g).

Ketone bodies and acetate are two major fuel sources for acetyl-CoA production in CD8+ T cells22,51, with Tex cells losing the ability to process acetyl-CoA from acetate52. In vitro chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells displayed a reduced malate-to-citrate ratio (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Table 9), suggesting a net export of βOHB-derived citrate to the cytosol for acetyl-CoA production like DR-conditioned Teff cells (Fig. 4j,k). Consistent with this concept, we observed increased βOHB-derived acetyl-CoA production in chronically stimulated versus acutely activated CD8+ T cells based on increased acetyl (M + 2) labelling of metabolites, including the nucleotide sugar UDP-GlcNAc and acetyl-methionine (Fig. 5g). Therefore, chronic stimulation promotes metabolic rewiring of oxidative metabolism in CD8+ T cells, with βOHB serving as a central fuel for TCA cycle metabolism and acetyl-CoA production.

One of the defining features of CD8+ TILs from DR tumours is the expansion of proliferating TOX+ Tex cells with effector-like properties (that is, TexEff cells; Fig. 3c,d). To define the metabolic properties of these cells, we analysed transcriptional profiles of CD8+ TIL subsets from human tumours. Similar to CD8+ TILs from mouse tumours (Fig. 3), we identified CD8+ Teff cells and two Tex TIL clusters from human tumours (Fig. 5h). The dysfunctional or exhausted-like (Tex) cell populations were distinguished from each other by the expression of the proliferation marker MKI67 (TexEff vs TexTerm; Fig. 5i). TexEff cells from human tumours most closely associated with the TexEff TIL cluster in mice (Fig. 3a). Proliferating TexEff cells (human TIL) displayed the highest ketone body metabolism (ketolysis) gene signature of all human TIL subsets (Fig. 5j), driven by increased expression of βOHB dehydrogenase (BDH1), which encodes the first rate-limiting enzyme required for βOHB breakdown, and 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1 (OXCT1), which converts βOHB to acetoacetate (AcAc) (Fig. 5k). Notably, both human Teff and TexEff cells displayed significant increases BDH1 transcript expression (Fig. 5k), which was associated with βOHB oxidation by both acutely activated and chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Therefore, ketolysis is a metabolic signature of human TILs with effector-like properties.

Next, we assessed the contribution of βOHB metabolism by T cells to the anti-tumour effects of DR. To test this effect, we generated mice with T cell-specific deletion of the enzymes required to process ketone bodies—βOHB dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) and succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA-transferase (SCOT; encoded by Oxct1)—by crossing Cd4-Cre transgenic mice to mice with floxed alleles targeting the Bdh1 and Oxct1 genes (Bdh1fl/fl; Oxct1fl/fl Cd4-Cre; Fig. 6a). BDH1 mediates the conversion of βOHB to AcAc, while SCOT converts AcAc to acetoacetyl-CoA, ultimately leading to the production of acetyl-CoA that enters the TCA cycle (Fig. 6b). Depletion of BDH1 and SCOT proteins in double-knockout (DKO) T cells (from Bdh1fl/fl; Oxct1fl/fl Cd4-Cre+ mice) was confirmed by immunoblot (Fig. 6c). Deletion of BDH1 and SCOT ablated the βOHB-induced increase in oxidative ATP production in CD8⁺ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential were similar between activated wild-type (WT) and DKO CD8⁺ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c), as were cell viability and proliferation kinetics over 72 h of activation (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e). EchoMRI analysis of control and DKO mice subjected to 50% DR for 2 weeks revealed similar changes in body weight, fat mass and lean mass, regardless of genotype (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Finally, ex vivo [13C6]-glucose and [13C4]-βOHB tracing in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (OT-I) isolated from DR-fed LmOVA-infected hosts confirmed that DKO T cells retain the ability to use [U-13C6]-glucose for TCA cycle metabolism but fail to channel [U-13C4]-βOHB into TCA intermediates (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 10a). These results establish that deleting Bdh1 and Oxct1 genes in CD8⁺ T cells specifically impairs their ability to oxidize βOHB, while maintaining whole-body metabolic responses to DR feeding.

We next asked whether ketone-body oxidation fuels the increase in CD8⁺ T cell bioenergetics induced by DR. Seahorse analysis of control (WT, from Cre− Bdh1fl/flOxct1fl/fl mice) or DKO (Cre+) OT-I CD8+ T cells isolated from LmOVA-infected mice demonstrated that loss of BDH1 and SCOT reversed the boost in OXPHOS and ATP production induced by DR feeding (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). TMRM staining of WT and DKO CD8+ Teff cells revealed that the increase in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by DR was also dependent on T cell-intrinsic ketolysis (Fig. 6f). Together, these data indicate that T cell-intrinsic ketone body oxidation drives the heightened bioenergetic capacity of CD8+ T cells induced by DR feeding.

Finally, we assessed the contribution of T cell-intrinsic ketolysis to the anti-tumour effects of DR by challenging control (that is, WT) or DKO mice with syngeneic B16 melanoma tumours. We observed no difference in B16 melanoma tumour growth between DKO and control mice under AL conditions; however, tumour growth was significantly accelerated in DKO mice specifically under DR conditions (Fig. 6g). Analysis of CD8+ TILs from these mice revealed that the diet-induced change in CD8+ T cell fate within tumours was altered when T cells could not process ketone bodies. Tumours grown in DKO mice displayed a greater accumulation of PD1hiTOXhi Tex cells under DR when compared to WT animals on the same diet (Fig. 6h,i), with ketolysis-deficient (that is, DKO) CD8+ TILs maintaining high TOX levels even under DR feeding conditions that normally reduce TOX expression in WT CD8+ TILs (Fig. 6j). Together, these data link T cell-intrinsic ketone body oxidation to the anti-tumour effects of DR, with CD8+ TILs unable to process ketone bodies displaying increased features of exhaustion.

Overcoming resistance to ICI therapy is a major challenge for cancer treatment. Given that DR enhances T cell-mediated control of tumour growth, we tested the efficacy of combining DR with anti-PD1 immunotherapy in mice bearing B16 melanoma tumours, which display resistance to PD1 blockade53. AL-fed or DR-fed C57BL/6J mice were administered anti-PD1 or IgG control antibodies beginning once tumours were palpable (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Anti-PD1 treatment promoted a small but significant increase in tumour-free survival under AL conditions; however, DR feeding greatly enhanced the efficacy of PD1 blockade, extending the tumour-free survival of animals over both anti-PD1 treatment under AL feeding and DR feeding alone (Fig. 7a). Strikingly, ~15% of animals on DR treated with anti-PD1 immunotherapy remained tumour-free after 80 days (Fig. 7a).

Source data

Proliferative Tex cells expressing LY108/SLAMF6 are highly responsive to ICI therapy4,54,55. Given that DR synergizes with anti-PD1 treatment to slow tumour growth (Fig. 7a), we investigated the impact of DR on anti-tumour CD8+ T cell populations following ICI treatment. B16 tumour-bearing C57BL/6J mice subjected to DR were administered either anti-PD1 or control IgG antibodies 7 days post tumour implantation, and CD8+ TIL phenotypes were analysed after 15 days of treatment (as in Extended Data Fig. 10d). Combining DR with anti-PD1 treatment shifted the effector versus exhausted CD8+ TIL populations within the tumours (Fig. 7b). Specifically, PD1 blockade promoted an increase in CD8+ Teff (PD1loTOXlo) cells and an approximately threefold decrease in the frequency of CD8+ Tex (TOX+PD1+) cells within tumours compared to DR treatment alone (Fig. 7c). PD1lo TILs from anti-PD1-treated mice displayed elevated GZMB production on a per-cell basis (Fig. 7d). Conversely, TOX-expressing CD8+ TILs from DR-fed mice were more functional following anti-PD1 treatment, expressing lower levels of TOX (Extended Data Fig. 10e) and displaying increased cytokine polyfunctionality (that is, IFNγ+TNF+ cells; Fig. 7e) and GZMB production (Fig. 7f). Importantly, the synergy between anti-PD1 treatment and DR feeding was abolished when T cells were unable to process ketone bodies; under DR feeding, DKO mice treated with anti-PD1 antibodies showed no extension in tumour-free survival compared with IgG controls (Fig. 7g). These findings reveal that ketone body oxidation is essential for diet-induced enhancement of CD8⁺ T cell-mediated anti-tumour responses triggered by immune checkpoint blockade.

The tumour-suppressive effects of reduced calorie intake have long been presumed to act directly on cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that DR works more broadly to limit tumour growth by stimulating CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumour immunity. We show that DR induces a profound reprogramming of CD8+ T cells in the TME, promoting the expansion of tumour-controlling effector (Teff-like and TexEff) cells while limiting terminal T cell exhaustion. DR enhances CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumour immunity by increasing circulating ketone body levels, which in turn enhance TCA cycle metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics of CD8+ T cells. T cells that cannot metabolize ketone bodies display metabolic deficits, undergo premature exhaustion and fail to control tumour growth under DR conditions, identifying T cell-intrinsic ketolysis as a central mechanism for the anti-tumour effects of DR. These findings, along with our previous research identifying ketolysis as a regulator of CD8+ T cell cytolytic function22, suggest that DR regulates a nutrient-sensitive checkpoint within the TME—mediated by ketone bodies—that promotes the expansion of tumour-controlling effector (Teff-like and TexEff) T cells over terminal exhaustion, thereby improving tumour control. Overall, our study highlights how altering systemic nutrient availability through diet can influence CD8+ T cell fate within tumours to limit cancer progression.

βOHB is preferentially oxidized over glucose for ATP production in CD8+ T cells and boosts T cell effector responses22,49. Our data indicate that ketolysis is a metabolic signature of Tex cells and that βOHB uptake and oxidation is prioritized by chronically stimulated CD8+ T cells to fuel bioenergetic and biosynthetic processes. Increased BDH1 expression in CD8+ T cells, which we observed in TILs from human tumours, facilitates greater βOHB oxidation in TILs as they infiltrate solid tumours. Many tumours are nutrient-poor24,56. By increasing ketone body availability approximately fourfold compared to AL-fed conditions, DR boosts the available βOHB supply in the TME, fuelling the TCA cycle to meet the oxidative demands of CD8+ TILs. Consistent with this observation, CD8+ T cells that are adapted to DR display increased mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative ATP production. This metabolic advantage promotes the expansion of TexEff cells, which retain proliferative capacity and effector function, over TexTerm cells, which have high inhibitory receptor expression and diminished functionality. These metabolic advantages are lost in ketolysis-deficient (that is, DKO) T cells, contributing to their premature exhaustion. Thus, DR aligns systemic nutrient supply with the metabolic needs of T cells at the tissue level.

Acetyl-CoA is a critical metabolite for CD8+ T cell effector function, and failure to produce sufficient levels of cytosolic acetyl-CoA is a precursor for terminal exhaustion52. Additionally, diet directly impacts acetyl-CoA homoeostasis in CD8+ T cells, as acetyl-CoA levels in T cells double under DR-fed conditions. Our data indicate that chronic T cell receptor stimulation enhances acetyl-CoA production through βOHB oxidation and suggest that DR may enhance acetyl-CoA production through this route by increasing circulating ketone body levels. Acetyl-CoA has functions in addition to biosynthetic growth (that is, de novo lipogenesis) and energy production: it is the limiting substrate for histone acetylation reactions that regulate T cell differentiation and effector function51,57. Our results argue that nutritional regulation of ketone body metabolism is a critical determinant of CD8+ T cell fate in the TME, shifting differentiation between terminally exhausted (TexTerm) and effector-like (TexEff) states. Consistent with this idea, pantothenate/CoA increases CD8+ T cell differentiation towards effector lineages to enhance tumour control23. We speculate that dietary interventions or therapeutics that boost acetyl-CoA production in T cells, such as DR, limit tumour growth by driving CD8+ T cell differentiation towards effector lineages and away from dysfunctional states.

The mammalian immune system evolved under cyclical periods of feast and famine. Immune challenges such as infection and cancer further impact systemic nutrient availability by disrupting feeding behaviours and remodelling host metabolism58,59,60. Mobilizing stored energy from adipose tissue into ketone body production provides the host with a versatile fuel to maintain acetyl-CoA production under conditions of metabolic stress61,62. In this vein, we speculate that T cells evolved the use of ketolysis to buffer against metabolic perturbations that negatively impact T cell bioenergetics and function. Our findings reveal the potential to exploit this system through nutritional interventions that enhance anti-tumour immunity. PD1 blockade amplifies the anti-tumour effects of DR by promoting the expansion of effector T cells (Teff and TexEff cells) to limit tumour growth, highlighting the potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies through nutritional intervention.

Using DR in clinical settings may face challenges regarding feasibility owing to patient health and compliance. However, combining ICIs with pharmacological agents that reduce appetite and food intake, such as GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide (that is, Ozempic), may mimic some metabolic effects of DR without necessitating strict dietary regimens63. Our findings also have potential implications for adoptive T cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, in which the metabolic state of T cells before infusion is critical for their persistence, functionality and anti-tumour efficacy in patients64. Exposing chimeric antigen receptor T cells to a DR-like environment during expansion or enhancing their capacity to oxidize ketone bodies may improve their metabolic fitness and resistance to terminal exhaustion in vivo, thereby increasing therapeutic efficacy. Understanding how dietary interventions such as DR impact T cell metabolism and differentiation fate in the TME may help inform evidence-based nutritional guidelines that complement or enhance current cancer immunotherapy strategies.

Our findings establish a role for DR in reprogramming CD8⁺ T cell fate and function in transplantable syngeneic tumour models (that is, B16 melanoma, EO771 breast cancer). Although these models are useful for mechanistic evaluation of anti-tumour T cell responses, they do not fully capture tumour evolution, stromal remodelling or the cellular and antigenic heterogeneity characteristic of human tumours. The effects of DR on anti-tumour T cell function in spontaneously arising or genetically engineered mouse tumour models, therefore, remain to be determined. Although we demonstrate that CD8⁺ T cells are required for the anti-tumour effects of DR, the Cd4-Cre model used in our study deletes Bdh1 and Oxct1 in both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cell lineages; therefore, we cannot exclude a contribution of ketolysis in CD4⁺ T cells to the observed effects. In addition, metabolic analysis of CD8⁺ TILs was limited by the number of cells that could be recovered from tumours. To overcome this limitation, we used our established LmOVA infection model to examine the metabolism of DR-conditioned Teff cells ex vivo; however, this system may not fully capture the nutritional and environmental cues of the TME under DR. We also show that DR elevates circulating and intratumoral βOHB, but the relative impact of DR compared to other methods of increasing ketones (for example, exogenous ketone esters or ketogenic diets) on CD8⁺ T cell anti-tumour function remains unclear. Finally, although effector-like Tex cells isolated from human tumours display a prominent ketolysis signature, the available datasets lack donor-matched dietary and metabolic metadata (for example, fasting state, BMI, βOHB levels). Consequently, these data cannot be used to establish a causal relationship between diet and TIL phenotype in patients.

All research described in this study was conducted in accordance with relevant institutional and national ethical guidelines and regulations. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Van Andel Institute (VAI) and performed in compliance with institutional and federal regulations governing the humane treatment of research animals.

This study used the following mouse strains: C57BL/6J (RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664); B6.PL-Thy1a/CyJ (Thy1.1; RRID: IMSR_JAX:000406); B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1+); and Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb (OT-I; RRID: IMSR_JAX:003831), all ordered from The Jackson Laboratory. The Bdh1fl/fl; Oxct1fl/flCd4-Cre line was generated by crossing Bdh1fl/flCd4-Cre mice22 and Oxct1-floxed mice (provided by P. Crawford65,66). Bdh1fl/fl; Oxct1fl/fl Cd4-Cre OT-I mice were generated by crossing Bdh1fl/fl; Oxct1fl/flCd4-Cre mice with the Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb mouse line. All mice were bred and housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions at VAI, following approved protocols. Genotyping was conducted using DNA extracted from tail or ear biopsies, with primer sets listed in the Key Resources Table. The study included both male and female mice aged 8–14 weeks.

B16-F10 murine melanoma cells expressing OVA (B16-OVA67) and EO771 breast cancer cells (CRL-3461) were cultured in DMEM from Wisent, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco) and 6 mM L-glutamine. All cell cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Male and female C57BL/6J, Bdh1fl/fl; Oxct1fl/fl (WT), or Bdh1fl/fl; Oxct1fl/fl Cd4-Cre (DKO) mice were maintained on a 5010 diet. Mice fed AL were allowed free access to food at all times and never ran out of food. The mice on the DR regimen received 50% of their average daily (normal) intake of food. Mice on DR were given pre-weighed pellets between 09:00 h and 11:00 h every day of the experiment. Following 1 week on their respective diet, mice were subcutaneously injected with 2.5 × 105 (EO771) or 5 × 105 (B16-OVA) cells into the right abdominal flank. Tumour volume was measured every 2–3 days with a calliper once tumours became palpable. Tumour initiation was scored as a tumour volume of ≥250 mm3. Mice were euthanized when the tumour volume reached 1,500 mm3. For experiments involving anti-PD1 treatment, mice received 200 µg of IgG (BP0091; RRID: AB_1107773) or anti-PD1 (BP0033-2; RRID:AB_1107747) antibodies intraperitoneally every 3 days, for a total of five injections (1 mg of antibody total). Treatment was initiated 7 days after tumour cell injection. The maximal tumour size permitted by the ethical regulations was 1,500 mm3, and this limit was not exceeded in any experiment. Animals were monitored regularly for signs of discomfort or distress, and any animal reaching predefined humane endpoints was euthanized in accordance with approved protocols.

TIL were isolated from palpable tumours 12–14 days post tumour cell injection. Tumours were mechanically homogenized in a six-well plate and then passed through a 100 µm cell strainer, followed by a 40 µm cell strainer. The single-cell suspension was incubated with red blood cell lysis buffer for 1 min at 20–22 °C (room temperature), after which three volumes of T cell media (TCM) were added to halt the lysis reaction. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 RCF for 5 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of TCM and processed for flow cytometry.

CD8+ T cells were purified from mouse spleens through negative selection using magnetic bead-based isolation kits (StemCell Technologies). T cells were cultured in TCM: Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM; Wisent) containing 10% Nu-Serum IV culture supplement (Corning), 50 U ml−1 penicillin, 50 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Gibco), 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco; final concentration 6 mM). T cells (1 × 106 cells per ml) were activated in vitro by stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3ε (clone 145-2C11; 2 µg ml−1) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51; 1 µg ml−1) antibodies for 48 72 h. After activation, cells were cultured in IMDM with 50 U ml−1 recombinant murine IL-2 (Peprotech) and re-seeded at 4 × 105 cells per ml in fresh medium supplemented with IL-2 every 2 days.

For induction of in vitro chronically stimulated cells, CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro for 48 h as described above, followed by culture on fresh plate-bound anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 antibodies for an additional 48 h as previously described20. Acutely activated cells were maintained in IL-2 (50 U ml−1) without restimulation.

Mice were intravenously injected with a sublethal dose of recombinant L. monocytogenes expressing OVA (LmOVA, 2 × 106 CFU), following a previously established protocol22. For adoptive transfer studies involving analysis at 6–7 dpi, 5 × 103 OT-I CD8⁺ T cells (Thy1.1⁺ or CD45.2⁺) were transferred intravenously into C57BL/6J recipients (Thy1.2⁺CD45.2⁺ or CD45.1⁺) on day −1, and LmOVA infection was induced 24 h later (day 0). Splenocytes were collected at 7 dpi to evaluate OVA-specific CD8⁺ T cells through Thy1.1 or CD45.2 staining. Cytokine production was measured using intracellular cytokine staining following re-stimulation with OVA peptide (OVA257–264) for 4 h (GolgiStop added at 1 µg ml−1 after 2 h of restimulation) at 37 °C.

For metabolic analysis of LmOVA-specific Thy1.1+ OT-I T cells ex vivo, Thy1.2+ C57BL/6 mice received 5 × 104 Thy1.1+ OT-I T cells at day −1, followed by LmOVA infection on day 0. LmOVA-specific CD8+ OT-I T cells were isolated from the spleen of infected mice by positive selection using the EasySep mouse CD90.1 positive selection kit (StemCell Technologies) as previously described43,68. For ex vivo 13C isotope tracing, 5 × 104 Thy1.1⁺ OT-I CD8⁺ T cells were injected into Thy1.2⁺CD45.2⁺ C57BL/6J mice, followed by LmOVA infection the next day. At 7 dpi, activated Thy1.1⁺ OT-I T cells were isolated from the spleens using magnetic bead purification43,68 and cultured in vitro for 2 h in VIM medium21 containing 1.5 mM βOHB.

To monitor blood ketone levels, blood was collected from the submental vein of restrained mice, and ketone test strips (Keto-Mojo) were used to quantify blood ketone levels.

For T cell tracing and metabolite profiling studies, metabolites were extracted by mixing with ice-cold acetonitrile:methanol:water (4:4:2, v/v)69, sonicating for 5 min and incubating on wet ice for 1 h. Extracts were centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was collected and dried under vacuum. Extracts were resuspended in 50 μl of water for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis. For tissue and plasma metabolite and lipid profiling, samples were extracted with chloroform:methanol:water (2:2:1.8 v/v)69,70. For plasma, this was accomplished by mixing 40 μl of plasma with 690 μl 1:1 chloroform:methanol. For tissue, 690 μl of 1:1 chloroform:methanol was added to 40 mg of tissue and homogenized with a beadmill homogenizer. For both sample types, 310 μl of water was added, incubated on wet ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min to induce phase separation. Then, 495 μl and 100 μl of the upper aqueous and bottom organic layers, respectively, were collected into separate tubes and dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The aqueous layer was resuspended in 100 μl of water for metabolomics analysis. The organic layer was resuspended in 200 μl of 50:50 (isopropanol:acetonitrile, v/v) for lipidomics analysis.

Metabolomic profiling and stable isotope tracing data were collected using a Vanquish liquid chromatography system coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 240 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) source in negative mode as previously described22,69. A total of 2 μl of each standard and/or sample was injected and run through a 24-min reversed-phase chromatography Zorbax RRHD extend-C18 column (1.8 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Agilent, 759700-902) combined with a Zorbax extend-C18 guard column (1.8 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Agilent, 821725-907). Mobile phase A consisted of LC–MS-grade water (W6, Fisher) with 3% LC–MS-grade methanol (A456, Fisher), mobile phase B was LC–MS-grade methanol and both mobile phases contained 10 mM tributylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 90780), 15 mM LC–MS-grade acetic acid (Fisher, A11350) and 0.01% medronic acid (v/v; Agilent, 5191-4506). For the wash gradient, mobile phase A was kept the same, and mobile phase B was 99% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher, A955). Column temperature was kept at 35 °C, flow rate was held at 0.25 ml min−1 and the chromatography gradient was as follows: 0–2.5 min held at 0% B; 2.5–7.5 min from 0% B to 20% B; 7.5–13 min from 20% B to 45% B; 13–20 min from 45% B to 99% B; and 20–24 min held at 99% B. A 16-min wash gradient was run in reverse flow direction between every injection to back-flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–3 min held at 100% B and 0.25 ml min−1; 3–3.5 min held at 100% B and ramp to 0.8 ml min−1; 3.5–7.35 min held at 100% B and 0.8 ml min−1; 7.35–7.5 min held at 100% B and ramp to 0.6 ml min−1; 7.5–8.25 min from 100% B to 0% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min−1; 8.25–15.5 min held at 0% B and ramp to 0.25 ml min−1; and 15.5–16 min held at 0% B and 0.25 ml min−1. MS parameters were as follows: source voltage −2,500V; sheath gas, 60; aux gas, 19; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 320 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 250 °C. Full scan data were collected using an Orbitrap with a scan range of 70–850 m/z at a resolution of 240,000 and RF lens at 35%. Fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) collision energies at 15, 30 and 45%. Orbitrap resolution was 15,000, the isolation window was 2 m/z and data-dependent scans were capped at five scans.

For acetyl-CoA measurements, samples were analysed with a Vanquish liquid chromatography system coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an H-ESI source in positive mode. A total of 2 μl of each standard and/or sample was injected and run through a 5-min reversed-phase chromatography Cortecs T3 Column (1.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Waters, 186008500) combined with a Cortecs T3 VanGuard Pre-column (1.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Waters, 186008508). Mobile phase A consisted of 100% LC–MS-grade water (Fisher, W6), 0.01% ammonium hydroxide (Fisher, A470) and 5 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 73594), and mobile phase B consisted of 99% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher, A955). Column temperature was kept at 30 °C, flow rate was held at 0.3 ml min−1, and the chromatography gradient was as follows: 0–0.5 min held at 0% B; 0.5–1 min from 0% B to 10% B; 1–4 min from 10% B to 50% B; 4–4.1 min from 50% B to 99% B; and 4.1–5 min held at 99% B. A 5-min wash gradient was run between every injection to flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–2 min held at 100% B; 2–3 min from 100% B to 0% B; and 3–5 min held at 0% B. MS parameters were: source voltage, 3,500 V; sheath gas, 70; aux gas, 25; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 300 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 250 °C. A targeted single ion scan was performed in the Orbitrap to target acetyl-CoA and all of its carbon-13 isotopologues with a centre mass of 810.133 m/z and an isolation window of 48 m/z. Resolution was set at 60,000, RF lens at 60% and scan time was set for 2–4 min of the chromatographic gradient described above. Data-dependent MS2 fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted HCD collision energies at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% as well as with collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a collision energy of 35%. For both MS2 fragmentations, Orbitrap resolution was 30,000, the isolation window was 1 m/z for HCD and 1.5 m/z for CID, and the total cycle time was 0.6 s.

For βOHB quantification in serum and tumours, metabolites were extracted with a 40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol and 20% water solution. An external standard curve for βOHB was generated from 10 µg ml−1 to 0.01 µg ml−1 by half-log serial dilutions. Standards were processed identically to tissue and serum samples throughout the workflow. Tissues were extracted at a concentration of 40 mg tissue per ml, and serum at 40 µl serum per ml of extraction solvent. Extracts were dried and reconstituted in water (200 µl for tissue, 1 ml for serum) containing 100 ng ml−1 of internal standard ([U-13C4]-βOHB). Samples and standards were analysed on an Orbitrap Exploris 240 (Thermo) in ESI-negative mode using tributylamine ion-paired chromatography as described above. Data were processed using Skyline, and internal standard-normalized peak areas were used to calculate βOHB concentrations, which are reported in units of mg g−1 for tissues and mM for serum.

Lipidomics samples were analysed with a Thermo Vanquish dual liquid chromatography system using two alternating methods, referred to as chromatography 1 and chromatography 2, coupled to an Orbitrap ID-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an H-ESI source in positive and negative mode, respectively. A total of 2 μl of each standard and/or sample was injected, column temperatures were kept at 50 °C and the flow rate was held at 0.4 ml min−1. For both chromatography 1 and 2, mobile phase A consisted of 60% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, A955), 40% LC–MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, W6), 0.1% LC–MS-grade formic acid (Fisher Scientific, A117) and 10 mM ammonium formate (Fisher Scientific, 70221), and mobile phase B consisted of 90% LC–MS-grade isopropanol (Fisher Scientific, A461), 8% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile, 2% LC–MS-grade water, 0.1% LC–MS-grade formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. Chromatography 1 used a 30-min reversed-phase chromatography Accucore C30 column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 27826-152130) combined with an Accucore C30 guard column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 10 mm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 27826-012105), and the gradient was as follows: 0–1 min held at 25% B; 1–3 min from 25% B to 40% B; 3–19 min from 40% B to 75% B; 19–20.5 min 75% B to 90% B; 20.5–28 min from 90% B to 95% B; 28–28.1 min from 95% B to 100% B; and 28.1–30 min held at 100% B. A 30 min wash gradient was run between every injection (in parallel with chromatography 2) to flush the column and to re-equilibrate solvent conditions as follows: 0–2 min held at 100% B and 0.3 ml min−1; 2–2.1 min from 100% B to 25% B and held at 0.3 ml min−1; 2.1–4 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min−1; 4–6 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.6 ml min−1; 6–17 min held at 25% B and 0.6 ml min−1; 17–17.1 min held at 25% B and ramp to 0.4 ml min−1; and 17.1–30 min held at 25% B and 0.4 ml min−1. Chromatography 2 used a 30-min reversed-phase chromatography Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm; Waters, 186005297) combined with a a VanGuard pre-column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; Waters, 186005303), and the gradient was as follows: 0–1 min held at 25% B; 1–3 min from 25% B to 40% B; 3–4 min from 40% B to 50% B; 4–16 min from 50% B to 65% B; 16–17 min from 65% B to 70% B; 17–25 min from 70% B to 75% B; 25–27 min from 75% B to 100% B; and 27–30 min held at 100% B. A 30-min wash gradient was run between every injection (in parallel with chromatography 1) that used the same gradient as the chromatography 1 wash gradient. For both methods, MS parameters were as follows: source voltage, +3,250 V or −3,000 V depending on method polarity; sheath gas, 40; aux gas, 10; sweep gas, 1; ion transfer tube temperature, 300 °C; and vaporizer temperature, 275 °C. Full scan data were collected using the Orbitrap with a scan range of 200-1,700 m/zat a resolution of 500,000 and RF lens at 45%. Data-dependent MS2 fragmentation was induced in the Orbitrap using assisted HCD collision energies at 15, 30, 45, 75 and 110% as well as with CID at a collision energy of 35%. For both MS2 fragmentations, Orbitrap resolution was 15,000, and the isolation window was 1.5 m/z. A m/z 184 mass trigger, indicative of phosphatidylcholines, was used for CID fragmentation. Data-dependent MS3 fragmentation was induced in the ion trap with the scan rate set at Rapid, using CID at a collision energy of 35%. MS3 scans were triggered by specific acyl chain losses for detailed analysis of mono-, di- and triacylglycerides. Total cycle time was 2 s. Lipid identifications were assigned using LipidSearch (v.5.0; Thermo Fisher Scientific).

For data analysis, peak picking and integration was conducted in Skyline (v.22-23) using in-house curated compound lists of accurate mass MS1 and retention time of chemical standards69. For lipidomics studies, the Lipidsearch identifications were used to populate the target compound list for Skyline. For tracing studies, this list was expanded to include all possible carbon isotopologues, and natural abundance correction was completed using IsoCorrectR71.

Chronic stimulation of CD8+ T cells was conducted as previously described20. In brief, female P14 Thy1.1 C57BL/6 mice aged 8–12 weeks were used as a source for primary T cells. CD8+ (P14) cells were isolated from spleens and peripheral lymph nodes using the EasySep Mouse CD8+ T cell isolation kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Following isolation and flow cytometry-based purity assessment, 5 × 106 live P14 cells resuspended in TCM containing 10 ng ml−1 IL-2 were placed in overtop chambers of a six-well dish that were coated 24 h prior (at 4 °C) with 3 μg ml−1 anti-mouse CD3 (eBioscience, Clone 145-2C11) and 1 μg ml−1 anti-mouse CD28 (eBioscience, Clone 37.51) in 1× PBS (Wisent, 311-010-CL). After 48 h incubation (37 °C incubator, 5% CO2), cells were gently displaced from the coated wells, counted and 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in fresh media containing 10 ng ml−1 IL-2 in a final volume of 5 ml in VIM medium21. For continuous stimulation conditions, cells were placed in three wells coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the same fashion as mentioned above, while for acute stimulation conditions, cells were placed directly in three uncoated wells of a six-well dish in VIM containing IL-2. Then, 48 h post incubation, the media were changed, and cells were seeded in the same fashion as the previous passage.

For flow cytometric assessment of CD8+ T cells in vitro, 3 × 105 live cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, followed by resuspension in 200 µl TCM with 50 U ml−1 IL-2. Acute and continuously stimulated cells were seeded in 96-well round-bottom plates and re-stimulated with PMA (50 ng ml−1) and ionomycin (500 ng ml−1) for 4 h (37 °C incubator, 5% CO2), with protein transport inhibitor GolgiStop (1:1,500 dilution; BD Biosciences, 5102092KZ) added for the last 2 h, followed by processing for downstream FACS analysis. For unstimulated controls, T cells were only treated with GolgiStop for 2 h.

For 13C-tracing experiments, 1–2 × 106 T cells were either cultured for 4 h at 37 °C in VIM medium containing IL-2 and either 5 mM 13C-glucose/0.85 mM 12C-βOHB or 5 mM 12C-glucose/0.85 mM 13C-βOHB. For unlabelled controls, T cells were cultured in VIM containing 5 mM 12C-glucose/0.85 mM 12C-βOHB. Following incubation, cells were pipetted into 15 ml conical tubes and centrifuged at 600g for 3 min. The medium was aspirated, then cells were washed twice with 5 ml ice-cold 0.9% w/v NaCl (saline) and spun at 600g for 2 min. Samples were immediately frozen on dry ice for 5 min, then transferred to a −80 °C freezer until processing for metabolomics.

Ex vivo stable isotope labelling experiments with CD8+ T cells isolated from mice using LC or gas chromatography coupled to MS were performed as outlined previously21,22. Antigen-specific T cells were isolated from AL or DR LmOVA-infected mice (BDH1/OXCT1 DKO or WT mice) using magnetic bead isolation as previously described22,43. CD8+ T cells were cultured for 2 h in VIM medium containing 1.5 mM 13C4-βOHB, followed by metabolite extraction as described above. For 13C co-tracing experiments, CD8+ T cells were cultured for 2 h in VIM medium containing 50 U ml−1 IL-2 and 5 mM 13C6-glucose and 1.5 mM 2,4-13C2-βOHB (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Identical unlabelled controls were performed using VIM medium containing 12C-glucose and 12C-βOHB. After the 2 h incubation period, cells were centrifuged at 600g for 4 min, media were collected and flash-frozen over dry ice and cell pellets were washed twice with 0.9% NaCl before flash-freezing and storage at −80 °C for downstream metabolomics analysis.

Immunoblotting was performed by lysing cells in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) on ice for a minimum of 30 min as previously described72. Protein quantification was done using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein from whole cell lysates were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved on a 10% SDS–PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% non-fat milk prepared in TBS-T, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies against BDH1 or SCOT (1:1,000 dilution in 5% non-fat milk). After washing three times in 1× TBS-T (5 min per wash), membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted in 5% non-fat milk). Membranes were washed again three times with 1× TBS-T before being developed using ECL solution (Cytiva). Details of the antibodies used are provided in the Key Resources Table.

T cell oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate were measured using a Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer, as previously described22. Antigen-specific Thy1.1+ OT-1 CD8+ T cells isolated from LmOVA-infected mice were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in Seahorse XF medium containing 5 mM glucose and 0.5 mM glutamine, with or without 1.5 mM βOHB (depending on experimental conditions). Cells were centrifuged onto a poly-D-lysine-coated XF96 plate, and cellular bioenergetics were evaluated at 5 min intervals after the sequential addition of oligomycin (2 µM), FCCP (1.5 µM), rotenone/antimycin A (0.5 µM each) and monensin (20 µM). Data were normalized to cell number. Bioenergetics data interpretation followed previously established protocols73.

Single-cell suspensions were prepared from mouse spleens by mechanical dissociation. Red blood cells were lysed using red blood cell lysis buffer containing 0.15 M NH₄Cl, 10 mM KHCO₃ and 0.1 mM EDTA, followed by neutralization with three volumes of TCM. For cell staining, single-cell suspensions were incubated with a cocktail of fluorescently labelled antibodies and dyes as listed in the Key Resources Table. Cell viability was assessed using Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocols. To assess cytokine production following LmOVA infection, splenocytes collected from infected mice at 7 dpi were stimulated with 1 µg ml−1 OVA257–264 peptide (Anaspec) and 50 U ml−1 IL-2 for 4 h at 37 °C. TIL were re-stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. GolgiStop protein transport inhibitor (BD Biosciences) was added at a 1:1,500 dilution during the last 2 h of incubation to block cytokine secretion. After stimulation, cells were stained with surface marker antibodies in staining buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 1 h. Intracellular staining was performed by incubating cells with fluorescently labelled antibodies targeting intracellular markers for either 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. Flow cytometry data were acquired using a CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter), Aurora Cytek or BD Accuri C6 Plus cytometer. Cell sorting was performed on an Astrios (Beckman Coulter) or BD FACSAria Fusion cell sorter. Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo software.

C57BL/6J mice aged 10–12 weeks were allocated to either AL feeding or DR for 1 week before tumour cell injection. Following the feeding regimen, each mouse was subcutaneously injected with 5 × 105 B16-OVA melanoma cells. At 13 dpi, tumours were dissected from the mice for further analysis. To prepare single-cell suspensions, excised tumours were mechanically dissociated and filtered sequentially through 100 µm and then 50 µm cell strainers. Throughout all procedures, cells were kept on ice to preserve viability. The resulting cell suspensions were counted, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. To prevent nonspecific antibody binding, cells were blocked with TruStain FcX Plus (BioLegend, 156603) in Cell Staining Buffer (CSB; BD Biosciences, 420201) for 10 min at 4 °C. Each tumour sample was then labelled with a specific antibody (Hashtags 1–8, product information in Key Resource Table) according to the manufacturer's protocol, including appropriate incubation and washing steps.

After hashtag labelling, cells were stained with a panel of fluorescently labelled antibodies targeting surface markers to identify live CD45⁺ leucocytes while excluding red blood cells (Ter119⁻), tumour cells (CD105⁻) and dead cells (DAPI+). This staining facilitated the isolation of the desired cell population during flow cytometric sorting. Cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and live CD45⁺ cells were collected into tubes containing IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS. After sorting, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in CSB, and cell viability was reassessed. Based on cell counts, CD45⁺ cells were adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per 50 µl and blocked again with TruStain FcX Plus for 10 min at 4 °C. During this blocking step, TotalSeq C antibodies were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioLegend). The TotalSeq C antibodies were then added to the CD45⁺ cells and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to label cell surface proteins for subsequent analysis.

Following antibody staining, cells were washed three times with CSB to remove unbound antibodies. Cells were then resuspended in 1× PBS containing 0.04% pure BSA at an approximate concentration of 2,200 cells per µl. The prepared cell suspension was used for downstream library preparation and sequencing.

Libraries were generated and sequenced by the VAI Genomics Core. Cells were processed with 10× Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5ʹ GEM kit (v.1.1) according to the manufacturer's instructions to target an output of 13,000 cells per sample using a 10× Genomics Chromium Controller. In brief, single-cell suspensions in PBS + 0.04% BSA were assessed for quantity and viability on the CytoFLEX S (Beckman Coulter), then 20,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the Chromium Controller. Single cells were captured in gel beads in emulsion, where they were lysed. Released RNA was barcoded and then converted to cDNA. Using beads, cDNA was separated from the hashtag oligonucleotides (HTO), and each was used to generate adaptor-ligated libraries. Quality and quantity of the finished gene expression and HTO libraries were assessed using a combination of Agilent DNA High Sensitivity Chip (Agilent Technologies) and QuantiFluor dsDNA System (Promega). Then, 2 × 100 bp, paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using an S2, 200-cycle sequencing kit (v.1.5) to a minimum depth of 20 K reads per cell. Base calling was done by Illumina RTA3, and output was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Cell Ranger (10× Genomics, v.3.1.0).

Following library preparation, FastQ files were processed using Cell Ranger (v.7.0.1) to map and quantify expression profiles for both the transcriptome and epitopes. Single-cell 5′ paired-end sequencing chemistry was used, and the sequencing data were aligned to the mouse reference genome m10-2020-A. The resulting raw_feature_bc_matrix, containing both transcript-level and epitope quantifications, was imported into R using the Read10X function from the Seurat package (v.5.0.0). Initial data processing involved separating the gene expression (GEX) data, ADTs and HTOs, which was critical for downstream analysis. A Seurat object was created using the CreateSeuratObject function. Quality control and normalization steps were then performed: HTO data were normalized using the NormalizeData function with the method set to ‘CLR' (centred log ratio transformation), and the HTODemux function was used to classify cells based on HTO signals into ‘singlets', ‘doublets' and ‘negative' categories. Further quality control filtering was applied by retaining cells with ADT counts of at least 150, RNA counts of at least 200, an HTO classification of ‘singlet' and mitochondrial gene expression percentage less than 20%. The GEX matrix was normalized using the SCTransform function (sctransform v.0.4.1), and ADT data were normalized using the NormalizeData function. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on both RNA and ADT data using the RunPCA function, including all ADTs for dimensionality reduction.

To generate a joint uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embedding that integrates both GEX and ADT data, the FindMultiModalNeighbors function was used, followed by the RunUMAP function, resulting in a weighted nearest-neighbour UMAP. Cluster identification was achieved by integrating gene expression profiles, ADT data and gene expression density visualizations using the plot_density() function from the Nebulosa package (v.1.14.0). Details of cluster identification are provided in Supplementary Tables2 and 4 and Extended Data Figs.2 and 6. Statistical analyses for violin plots were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by pairwise Wilcoxon comparison tests with Bonferroni P value adjustment. Sequencing data from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE267070.

To infer cellular trajectories from the scRNA-seq data, we performed RNA velocity analysis using the Python implementation of Velocyto (v.0.17.17), following previously described methods45. In brief, spliced and unspliced counts were generated using the velocyto run10x subcommand, outputting a loom file for importing into Python or R. Next, we used scvelo to infer RNA velocity vectors and projected them onto the UMAP embeddings generated above. This approach enabled us to determine the directional changes of cells between dietary conditions. Code used to make RNA velocity plots can be found at https://github.com/rgjcanada/DR_CITESEQ_2025.

For analysis of the human scRNA-seq dataset74, count data were normalized and transformed through the SCT normalization method in Seurat, with 5,000 variable features retained for downstream dimension reduction techniques. Integration of data was performed on the patient level with canonical correlation analysis as the dimension reduction technique. Cells were clustered using the Louvain algorithm with multi-level refinement. PCA was performed, with the first 50 PCs used in UMAP generation. The data were subset to CD8+ T cells, which were identified using the labels provided in a prior work75 and confirmed by singleR using the ImmGen database76 and cell type annotation with the ProjectTILs T cell atlas77. These CD8+ T cells were subsequently normalized through the SCT method, with 3,000 variable features retained. Owing to the low number of cells on a per-patient level, Harmony was used to integrate the data at the patient level rather than Seurat78. PCA and UMAP dimension reduction were performed as above for clustering into distinct groups, Teff_ITGB1, Teff_TYROBP, Teff_TRIM34, TCM, Trm_TM, Trm_TMEM2, Trm_BAG3, Trm_ZNF20, IEL, Tex_MKI67 and Tex_CLNK, based on previously defined markers79. To simplify the analysis, we combined Teff_ITGB1, Teff_TYROBP and Teff_TRIM34 into the ‘T effector (Teff)' cluster, while grouping TCM, Trm_TM, Trm_TMEM2, Trm_BAG3, Trm_ZNF20 and IEL into the ‘T memory (Tmem)' cluster. Additionally, Tex_MKI67 and Tex_CLNK were combined into the ‘T exhausted (Tex)' cluster.

Samples were processed using the EasyPep Mini MS Sample Prep Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A40006) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were resuspended in 50 µl of lysis solution and proteins were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227) following the vendor-supplied protocol. Plates were read at an absorbance of 562 nm using the Synergy LX Multi-Mode Reader, and Gen5 software was used for data analysis (BioTek/Agilent). Polynomial regression was used in the Gen5 software to calculate protein concentrations from a protein standard curve after an average blank absorbance subtraction. Then, 25 µg of protein per sample was reduced and alkylated at 95 °C for 10 min, and samples were digested overnight with Trypsin/Lys-C at 30 °C at a ratio of 10:1 (protein:enzyme (w/w)). Resulting peptides were cleaned with the supplied peptide clean-up columns in the EasyPep mini kit and then dried down in a Genevac SpeedVac before resuspension for instrument analysis. Samples were resuspended in 12.5 µl 0.1% formic acid (Fisher Scientific, LS118-1) and diluted 1:1 with 6 µl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Fisher Scientific, LS119-500) in autosampler vials.

Data-independent acquisition analyses were performed on an Orbitrap Eclipse coupled to a Vanquish Neo system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a FAIMS Pro source (Thermo Fisher Scientific) located between the nanoESI source and the mass spectrometer. A total of 2 μg of digested peptides were separated on a nano capillary column (20 cm × 75 μm inner diameter, 365 μm outer diameter, 1.7 μm C18; CoAnn Technologies, HEB07502001718IWF) at 300 nl min−1. Mobile phase A consisted of LC–MS-grade H2O (Fisher Scientific, LS118-500), mobile phase B consisted of 20% LC–MS-grade H2O and 80% LC–MS-grade acetonitrile (Fisher Scientific, LS122500), both containing 0.1% formic acid. The LC gradient was 1% B to 24% B in 110 min; 85% B in 5 min; and 98% B for 5 min; with a total gradient length of 120 min. The column temperature was kept constant at 50 °C using a customized column heater (Phoenix S&T). For FAIMS, the selected compensation voltage was applied (−40 V, −55 V and −70 V) throughout the LC–MS/MS runs. Full MS spectra were collected at 120,000 resolution (full width half-maximum; FWHM), and MS2 spectra at 30,000 resolution (FWHM). Both the standard automatic gain control target and the automatic maximum injection time were selected. A precursor range of 380–985 m/z was set for MS2 scans, and an isolation window of 50 m/z was chosen with a 1 m/z overlap for each scan cycle; 32% HCD collision energy was used for MS2 fragmentation.

Data-independent acquisition data were processed in Spectronaut (v.19; Biognosys) using direct data-independent acquisition. Data were searched against the Mus musculus proteome. The manufacturer's default parameters were used. In brief, trypsin/P was set as the digestion enzyme, and two missed cleavages were allowed. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, and methionine oxidation and protein amino-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Identification was performed using a 1% q value cutoff on precursor and protein levels. Both peptide precursors and protein false discovery rate (FDR) were controlled at 1%. Ion chromatograms of fragment ions were used for quantification. For each targeted ion, the area under the curve between the XIC peak boundaries was calculated.

Proteomic values were imported into R from an Excel file and processed with dplyr and readxl. Replicate columns for each condition (AL-WT, AL-DKO, DR-WT, DR-DKO) were coerced to numeric and averaged to obtain per-protein means. Differential abundance was calculated as log2(fold change) (for example, DR-WT / AL-WT), and Welch's t-tests were performed between the corresponding replicate groups to obtain P values. Proteins lacking sufficient replicate measurements were excluded.

For GSEA, proteins were mapped to gene symbols (duplicated symbols collapsed by the entry with the largest absolute log2(fold change). A pre-ranked vector was generated using the sign of the log2(fold change) multiplied by −log10(P value) (equivalent results were obtained using log2(fold change) alone). Mouse gene sets were retrieved from MSigDB via msigdbr (Hallmark ‘H', curated ‘C2' and Gene Ontology ‘C5' collections); sets with <15 or >500 genes were discarded. Enrichment analysis was performed with fgsea (10,000 permutations, default weighting), returning normalized enrichment scores, nominal P values and FDR-adjusted q values (Benjamini–Hochberg). Only pathways with an FDR q < 0.05 were considered significant and are displayed in the figures. Bar plots of normalized enrichment scores and volcano plots were generated in ggplot2 and EnhancedVolcano, respectively.

Mice were individually housed in Promethion metabolic cages (Sable Systems International) for comprehensive metabolic phenotyping. Before data collection, animals underwent a 24 h acclimation period within the cages to minimize stress and ensure steady-state measurements. Following acclimation, continuous monitoring was performed over a desired period under controlled environmental conditions (temperature, humidity and a 12–12h light–dark cycle) as specified by the manufacturer's guidelines.

The Promethion system simultaneously recorded oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and energy expenditure, as well as food and water intake and locomotor activity. Calibration of the sensors and verification of system performance were conducted in strict accordance with Sable Systems International's operating protocols. Data acquisition and subsequent analysis were carried out using the proprietary Promethion analysis software, ensuring that all measurements met the company's quality control standards.

Body composition was measured using an EchoMRI-100 on conscious mice. Before each session, the instrument was calibrated with manufacturer-provided oil standards. Individual mice were weighed, placed in a ventilated acrylic restraining tube with an internal insert to minimize movement and scanned (standard mode; water stage on–off as indicated in figure legends). Each scan yielded fat mass, lean mass, free water and total water; values were exported directly from the EchoMRI software for downstream analysis. Restraining tubes were disinfected between animals with 70% ethanol or facility-approved disinfectant.

Full-resolution SVS images of HDAB-stained tissue sections were imported into QuPath (v.0.5.1)80 for analysis. For all tissues to be analysed, a region of interest contouring the tissue was created, using the SAM plugin (v.0.6.0) for QuPath81,82 with the following settings: vit_h (huge) model, foreground with rectangle draw prompt and single mask output on live mode. To detect nuclei, an average of the deconvolved haematoxylin, DAB and residual channels was generated to create a fluorescence-like single-channel image using a custom script (hosted on https://github.com/vaioic). Random regions from the samples were used for CellPose's human-in-the-loop training based on the livecell_cp3 model to improve the detection of nuclei containing DAB staining83,84,85. Detections were then generated on the average channel image using the custom-trained CellPose-based model using the CellPose plugin for QuPath (v.9.0) (https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-extension-cellpose). The detections and tissue outline were exported as an object GeoJSON and imported to the original HDAB-stained image. Detection measurements were generated with QuPath's built-in Add Intensity Features with the following settings: pixel size, 0.5 µm; region, region of interest; tile diameter, 0; channels, haematoxylin, DAB; basic features, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median. Nuclei were then classified as positive or negative for DAB staining using the mean DAB signal at a threshold of 0.117. A pixel thresholder was used to measure the area covered by DAB staining. A training image generated from an equal number and size of random rectangles from each image was used for parameter setting. QuPath's Create Thresholder was used with the following settings: resolution, very high (1.01 µm per pixel); channel, DAB; prefilter, Gaussian; smoothing sigma, 1; threshold, 0.25. The measure option was then run on the tissue outline to quantify the area of the tissue covered by DAB staining.

Data are presented as means ± s.d. for technical replicates or means ± s.e.m. for biological replicates, as indicated in figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, v.10.4.1) unless otherwise noted. Comparisons between two groups were conducted using unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-tests. For comparisons involving more than two groups, one-way or two-way ANOVA with post hoc multiple-comparison corrections (Tukey's or Sidak's test, as appropriate) were applied. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons when indicated. Data distribution was assumed to be normal. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05, with significance levels represented as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 and ****P < 0.0001. The statistical tests used for each dataset are specified in the corresponding figure legends when deviating from the above.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. All data were included in the analyses. In rare cases for which data were excluded, exclusion occurred because of animal health concerns (for example, sickness or tissue necrosis) or based on statistical outlier identification using standard outlier exclusion tests. Investigators were blinded to outcome assessment but not to experimental allocation during data collection. All experiments were independently repeated as described in the figure legends, and similar results were obtained, confirming reproducibility.

Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) controls some of the most powerful inflammatory lipids in vertebrates by releasing their metabolic precursor, arachidonic acid, from the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Ca2+ and INM tension (TINM) are thought to govern the interactions and activity of cPLA2 at the INM. However, as compensatory membrane flow from the contiguous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may prevent TINM, the conditions permitting nuclear membrane mechanotransduction by cPLA2 or other mediators remain unclear. To test whether the ER buffers TINM, we created the genetically encoded, Ca²⁺-insensitive TINM biosensor amphipathic lipid-packing domain inside the nucleus (ALPIN). Confocal time-lapse imaging of ALPIN– or cPLA2–INM interactions, along with ER morphology, nuclear shape/volume and cell lysis revealed a link between TINM and disrupted ER–nuclear membrane contiguity in osmotically or ferroptotically stressed mammalian cells and at zebrafish wound margins in vivo. By combining ALPIN imaging with Ca2+-induced ER disruption, we reveal the causality of this correlation, which suggests that compensatory membrane flow from the ER buffers TINM without preventing it. Besides consolidating the biomechanical basis of cPLA2 activation by nuclear deformation, our results identify cell stress- and cell death-induced ER disruption as an additional nuclear membrane mechanotransduction trigger.

Cells constantly reshape and hence must tell innocuous shape changes from deformations that endanger their integrity. Plasma membrane mechanotransduction is tuned for sensitivity: stretch-activated channels, integrin adhesions and other mechanisms sense minute strains at the cell body surface and its periphery. By contrast, nuclear membrane mechanotransduction (NMMT) engages when the cell body is subjected to severe confinement, stark osmotic swelling or other stresses that pressurize and stretch the nuclear envelope (NE)1. In other words, the nuclear membrane is tailored to detect bulk deformations that may threaten cell and tissue viability and call for an extension of its adaptive range, emergency repair or inflammatory signalling. One of the most powerful and versatile bioactive lipid signalling mechanisms involved in all these aspects, the eicosanoid cascade2, is controlled by NMMT. Specifically, inner nuclear membrane tension (TINM)-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activation leads to arachidonic acid release from the NE. Arachidonic acid-derived prostaglandins, leukotrienes, oxoeicosanoids and other bioactive lipids control diverse physiological processes ranging from inflammation to musculoskeletal adaptation3,4.

The cPLA2–NMMT pathway has been reported to control the osmotic surveillance of epithelial barrier integrity by leukocytes; mitotic entry; confined migration of embryonic, immune and cancer cells; dendritic cell chemotaxis; and cell differentiation5,6,7,8,9,10. Via conserved hydrophobic residues in its Ca2+-dependent membrane-binding C2 domain and its catalytic site, cPLA2 adsorbs to TINM-induced lipid-packing defects (LPDs)11. Notably, a similar (that is, LPD) mechanism mediates curvature sensing by amphipathic lipid-packing sensor (ALPS) domains, for example, of ARFGAP1, on nanometre-sized vesicles12,13. Although the concept of LPD-dependent mechanosensing is well established14,15,16 and has been thoroughly explored in the context of membrane curvature sensing13,17,18, its physiological relevance in the context of NMMT is just emerging.

NMMT assumes that strong nuclear deformation causes TINM, but this premise has been questioned. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is contiguous with the nuclear membrane, forming a large membrane reservoir. Before TINM can expose a hydrophobic binding surface, nuclear membrane invaginations and evaginations must be unfolded. If a contiguous ER were to behave like a large nuclear membrane reservoir, TINM may not develop until this reservoir is exhausted. If the ER were to instantly quench TINM by compensatory membrane flow, NMMT would be impossible. But whether or how the ER affects TINM and NMMT has never been experimentally tested. To this end, we developed the Ca2+-independent, intranuclear lipid-packing probe ‘amphipathic lipid-packing domain inside the nucleus' (ALPIN), which allowed us to monitor TINM dynamics during nuclear swelling in the presence or absence of a contiguous ER.

The ER is normally contiguous with the nuclear membrane, but different types of stress can disrupt this connection through Ca2+-dependent ER vesiculation19,20,21,22,23,24,25. Intriguingly, simultaneous imaging of eGFP–KDEL (ER lumen), eGFP–SEC61B (ER membrane) and cPla2–mKate2–inner nuclear membrane (INM) adsorption during hypo-osmotic swelling showed that cPla2–INM adsorption and ER disruption (ER area↓ and ER circularity↑) were highly correlated (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Video 1). Confocal time-lapse analysis revealed that transient nuclear volume increases and envelope smoothening coincided with ER vesiculation and cPla2 adsorption to the INM (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). These acute osmotic responses (‘shock' phase) reversed within ~10–15 min probably through regulatory volume decrease (RVD)26. It is known that the cell nucleus behaves like an osmometer that follows cytoplasmic volume changes upon osmotic shock and RVD, respectively27,28,29,30.

The RVD-related nuclear volume decrease was accompanied by lamina shrivelling and cPla2–INM desorption, in line with NE relaxation (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d). Thereafter, the nuclear volume remained steady for ~1–2 h despite the ongoing osmotic stress, while ER vesiculation proceeded. As ER vesiculation plateaued, nuclear swelling, NE smoothening and cPla2–INM adsorption rebounded, indicating TINM. This second nuclear swelling was perhaps caused by RVD failure related to cell damage and/or metabolic exhaustion. The progressive nuclear shrinkage that followed markedly differed from RVD-related nuclear shrinkage: it took hours not minutes and did not involve nuclear shrivelling or cPla2desorption, arguing against NE relaxation. Conceivably, nuclear volume loss, unlike during RVD, was accompanied by a nuclear surface decrease of unknown mechanistic origin. Whether the ER–outer nuclear membrane (ONM) vesiculation directly contributed to the putative surface loss remains an interesting question for future research.

After ~3 h of osmotic differential (ΔΠ) = 270 mOsm, cell lysis became visible by nuclear Sytox blue positivity (or earlier after ΔΠ = 303 mOsm shock). Nuclear rupture sometimes preceded plasma membrane rupture. In such cases, cytoplasmic cPla2 fluorescence became an inverse cell lysis marker, whose loss mirrored the rise of the Sytox blue signal (Extended Data Fig. 1b). At ΔΠ = 220 mOsm, ER vesiculation rarely occurred, at ΔΠ = 303 mOsm it did not reverse (Fig. 1b). Apparently, ER vesiculation is linked to critical (that is, outside the adaptive range), rather than mild, nuclear volume perturbations.

Super-resolution imaging (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Videos 2and 3) confirmed that ER vesiculation split the ER from the NE. Furthermore, fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments revealed that diffusional eGFP–KDEL or eGFP–SEC61B marker exchange between the vesiculated ER and the NE (Fig. 1d,e) was completely abrogated, in line with previous findings25. By severely disrupting ER–NM contiguity, far more than any previously described ER shape factor mutation, this phenomenon offered itself to probe the role of the ER in TINM/NMMT regulation.

The LPD-binding capacity of zebrafish cPla2 renders it sensitive to TINM, but only in the presence of Ca2+(refs. 5,11), which we wanted to use to disrupt ER–NM contiguity22. The codependence of Ca2+ for both sensing TINM and disrupting the ER renders the relationship between both parameters hard to disentangle by using the INM adsorption or enzymatic activity of cPla2 as TINM proxy. To obtain a Ca²⁺-independent TINM readout, we turned to the ALPS domain of ARFGAP1. Its TM sensitivity has been previously confirmed by micropipette aspiration (cycling between 0.1 and 0.3 mN m−1) and osmotic swelling experiments using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs)11,13. Each ALPS motif forms an amphipathic helix that inserts its hydrophobic face into LPDs created by membrane tension (Fig. 2a), positive curvature or conical lipids17. As predicted by its lack of known Ca2+ binding sites, the tension dependent GUV interactions of ARFGAP1–ALPS were Ca2+ insensitive (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Just like the C2 domain of cPla2, ALPS motifs target LPDs but because nuclear membranes are mostly flat, tension—not curvature—is the dominant generator of LPDs in this compartment. On stretched synthetic bilayers, ARFGAP1–ALPS competes with cPla2 for the same LPD sites, confirming a shared TINM-sensing mechanism. However, its apparent affinity for GUVs (Kd′ ≈ 150 nM) is roughly eightfold lower than that of the cPla2 C2 domain (Kd′ ≈ 20 nM at 20 µM Ca²⁺, ΔΠ = 240 mOsm)11. Nevertheless, computational image processing of confocal midsections allowed us to robustly measure ALPS recruitment to the nuclear rim despite its lower sensitivity (Methods).

We fused either one (ALPIN1) or both (ALPIN2) ALPS motifs of ARFGAP1 to a triple nuclear-localization signal (3×NLS) to create nuclear-targeted sensors (Fig. 2b). Both constructs located to the nucleoplasm and—unlike cPla2—also to nucleoli (Extended Data Fig. 2b). ALPS motifs attain their α-helical amphipathic conformation upon binding LPDs of stretched or curved membranes31. If no LPDs are available, ALPS domains are largely unstructured, which may favour their nucleolar sequestration32,33.

Hypotonic shock caused partial nucleolar dissolution as previously reported34,35 along with ALPIN1 adsorption to the INM (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Video 4). Compared with ALPIN1, ALPIN2 showed a stronger baseline INM binding along with constitutive cytoplasmic vesicle association (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Video 5). These perinuclear ALPIN signals distracted our single-channel TINM detection method (nuclear edge segmentation along with rim:centre normalization based on the ALPIN channel; Methods), which allowed us to use the green and blue channel for simultaneous imaging of ER morphology and cell lysis (Sytox blue), respectively. When fluorescence channels are not limiting, ALPIN2 imaging with normalization by NE marker (eGFP–Lmnb1) fluorescence might yield more sensitive TINM detection, given its higher membrane affinity (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2d).

Like cPla2, ALPIN1 showed reversible membrane adsorption during the acute phase and persistent INM-binding during and beyond the prelytic phase of hypotonic shock. Again, ER vesiculation and INM adsorption were correlated (Fig. 2cand Extended Data Fig. 2e) as previously observed for cPla2 (Fig. 1a). Apart from its nucleolar localization and lower membrane binding, ALPIN1 mimicked the cPla2 response to osmotic shock, but without the Ca2+ requirement.

By contrast, the cytosolic ALP-sensor amphipathic lipid-packing sensor domain inside the cytosol (ALPIC2; ARFGAP1–ALPS without NLS fusion) showed little ONM binding upon osmotic shock (Extended Data Fig. 2f). The discrepancy between the shock-induced INM or ONM adsorption of ALPIN or ALPIC (compare Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2f), respectively, could be due to a ONM–INM membrane tension gradient. Perhaps compensatory lipid flow between the INM and ER–ONM is throttled by the nuclear pores36. It has previously been shown that the nuclear shape-sensing function of cPla2 depends on its nuclear localization6. Consistent with these results, our data highlight the INM as a ‘privileged' mechanosensing surface.

To more closely examine how ER–NM continuity shapes TINM, we tracked ALPIN1 in a permeabilized cell assay where Ca²⁺ levels and colloid osmotic stress (ΔΠcolloid) can be independently altered (Fig. 2d)5,11. Using low-dose digitonin, we removed cholesterol from the plasma membrane, perforating it while leaving the cholesterol-poor nuclear membrane intact. The permeabilization buffer contains 360-kDa polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to balance extra- and intranuclear colloid osmotic pressure upon lysis; stepwise dilution of PVP then produces controlled nuclear swelling at adjustable Ca²⁺ concentrations. In permeabilized cells, micromolar Ca2+ disrupts the ER, unlike nuclear swelling (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2g). Even with a contiguous ER, we observed ALPIN1–INM adsorption responding to colloid osmotic shock (Fig. 2f), suggesting that compensatory membrane flow from the ER does not prevent the INM from becoming tense and developing LPDs during nuclear swelling.

This raised the question of whether the ER buffers TINM at all. To address this, we measured ALPIN1 adsorption upon increasing ΔΠcolloid in the presence (0 μM Ca2+) or absence (50 μM Ca2+) of an intact ER (Fig. 2g). The ALPIN1–INM adsorption, despite being itself Ca2+ independent (Extended Data Fig. 2a), was consistently higher when the ER membrane reservoir was severed from the nucleus by micromolar Ca2+. These data argue that the ER incompletely buffers TINM, even when ER–NM contacts are intact. Despite its overall structural contiguity, only parts of the ER seem to serve as nuclear membrane reservoir. Accordingly, we never witnessed an overall collapse of the ER into the nucleus.

Even when digitonin-permeabilized cells were kept at colloid osmotic equilibrium (2.5% PVP) so that their nuclei did not show overt swelling, Ca2+-dependent ER vesiculation promoted ALPIN1–INM adsorption (Extended Data Fig. 2h). This suggests that TINM rises not only when the nuclear water influx outpaces the ER-supplied membrane area, but also when ER–ONM vesiculation withdraws membrane from the contiguous ONM–perinuclear ER, reducing the accessible area required to accommodate a given nuclear volume. Accordingly, ER vesiculation may directly elevate TINM and engage NMMT, even in the absence of overt nuclear swelling. Since ER vesiculation (equal to surface loss) has been observed under pathophysiological stress conditions that boost cytoplasmic Ca2+, and since such conditions are tightly linked to cell damage and death22,24, we wondered whether TINM and NMMT may be more broadly linked to critical cell stress and death, beyond the previously characterized mechanical perturbations (ΔΠ, compression).

Indeed, we had previously observed cPla2–INM adsorption in the prelytic phase of ferroptotic cell death caused by the glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor ML162 (ref. 37); however, we did not consider possible contributions of the ER at this time. Therefore, we repeated the experiment, using eGFP–KDEL and eGFP–SEC61B as ER markers, and cPla2 and ALPIN1 as TINM sensors.

Starting ~40 min after ML162 exposure, we observed continuous nuclear shrinkage and ER vesiculation, along with ALPIN1/cPla2 adsorption to the INM (Fig. 3a–d and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), reminiscent of the prelytic phase of osmotic stress (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Nuclear swelling after ML162 treatment, if at all noticeable (Extended Data Fig. 3a), was milder and more inconsistent than upon osmotic shock (Fig. 3a,c,d and Extended Data Figs. 1b and2c). Akin to the prelytic phase of osmotic shock (Extended Data Fig. 1c), nuclear shrinkage after ML162 treatment was accompanied by NE smoothening (Extended Data Fig. 3b), arguing against relaxation. Towards the end of the experiment and just before plasma membrane failure, we frequently noticed pronounced NE blistering, consistent with previous reports38. These blisters contained eGFP–KDEL and appeared to expand at the expense of nuclear volume (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Ferroptosis, like other necrotic or hypo-osmotic insults, produces prelytic cell swelling37,39, which dilutes cytosolic colloids and—provided NE area can be supplied—should drive nuclear volume expansion. However, depletion of the NE area reservoir (for example, via ER–ONM vesiculation or NE blistering) may reduce the envelope's accessible area and elevate TINM at near-constant (or even reduced) nuclear volume, thereby engaging NMMT, as observed.

The original evidence for the pathophysiological relevance of NMMT in vivo comes from the zebrafish wound model40. Zebrafish are freshwater animals, and when their epidermal barrier is damaged, cells and nuclei around the wound site swell by hypotonic shock5,41. The wound-induced osmotic shock elicits wave-like cPla2 activation (travelling at ~50 μm s−1 through the tissue) with irreversible cPla2–INM adsorption observable exclusively at the wound margin. By contrast, reversible cPla2–INM adsorption is typically seen farther away, in cells not directly compromised by the injury procedure itself, such as perivascular macrophages5,42,43. The hypotonic shock causes cPla2-dependent arachidonic acid release5,44,45. Enzymatic or non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation converts arachidonic acid into chemotactic oxoeicosanoids that attract distant immune cells to the wound margin and regulate mucosal resilience46,47,48,49

To test whether the correlation between ER vesiculation and NMMT holds in live tissue, we turned to the well-established zebrafish tail fin wounding model. Using confocal microscopy, we simultaneously imaged cPla2 translocation (cPla2–mKate2) and ER morphology (eGFP–KDEL) in vivo. In larvae, transient cPla2 adsorption to the INM occurs extremely fast and lasts only ~10 s. To better capture transient INM translocation at the reduced time resolution of two-channel acquisition (that is, 15 s per frame), we depolymerized F-actin with latrunculin, which prolongs the osmotic swelling response to injury5, perhaps in part by modulating regulatory volume regulation50.

Epithelial cells directly adjacent to the blast zone showed instant, irreversible ER fragmentation with permanent cPla2 translocation, as in the prelytic phase of osmotic shock and ferroptosis (Figs. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 3c and Supplementary Video 6). In line with previous work5,42,43, cells further away displayed transient cPla2 recruitment without ER disruption. Expectedly, the reversible cPla2–INM adsorption was harder to temporally discern without latrunculin treatment, but the correlation of ER vesiculation and cPla2translocation directly at the wound margin was nevertheless evident (Extended Data Fig. 3c). This lasting cPla2 activation may be responsible for residual neutrophil recruitment, independent of hypotonic shock42. Transient cPla2 translocation to the INM, by contrast, requires osmotic shock. It mobilizes the majority of first-wave leukocytes and—via macrophages—promotes rapid serum exudation from nearby blood vessels, as reported previously42,43.

These radii values were approximated from polygon area measurements from the dataset shown in a. c, An overview cartoon scheme outlining the approximate timing of stress responses to osmotic (ΔΠ), oxidative (ML162) or physical (laser wound) insults in vitro (black) or in vivo (red). Moderate osmotic shock (ΔΠ = 270 mOsm) causes rapid nuclear swelling, partial ER fragmentation and TINM, which is recovered by RVD. Under prolonged osmotic stress, cells enter the prelytic stage, with strong ER vesiculation and TINM, before they eventually lose plasma membrane integrity. Strong osmotic shock (ΔΠ = 303 mOsm), oxidative stress, and physical injury cause irreparable cell damage (dashed line), which directly initiates the prelytic stage. Left-column engagement of NMMT during each stage. As a death-transcendent ‘danger-signalling' mechanism, NMMT via cPla2 is initiated before lysis and persists beyond. d, A hypothetical scheme of NMMT buffering by the ER. Middle: osmotic shock (ΔΠ) must unfold nuclear membrane invaginations before tension (T) can develop. Top: when the ER is contiguous with the nuclear membrane during homeostasis or mild stress, a compensatory lipid flow (dashed red line) partially relieves T. This amounts to less LPDs (shaded red regions/gauge) on the INM and less, or more reversible, hydrophobic cPla2–INM interactions, as observed in cultured cells exposed to moderate osmotic stress, in distal wound cells (a, position 2), or in perivascular macrophages (see ref. 43) in vivo. Bottom: when the ER is vesiculated by high and persistent Ca2+ after critical stress, there is no compensatory lipid flow to attenuate T and LPDs. This amounts to high (and more stable) cPla2–INM interactions. The respective cell is turned into a constitutive, inflammatory lipid signalling hub. This is observed, for example, in wound margin cells (a, position 1), prelytic osmotically stressed, ferroptotic cells, and post-lytic (that is, permeabilized) cell corpses.

Depending on the amplitude or duration, different kind of cell stresses (osmotic, oxidative or laser) cause (1) reversible ER fragmentation with reversible TINM/NMMT or (2) persistent ER fragmentation with persistent TINM/NMMT, with the latter being indicative of prelytic cell damage (Fig. 4c). Importantly, cPla2 signals from stressed, severely damaged or dead cells alike, as long as Ca2+ and TINM are maintained5. The removal of nuclear membrane slack by ER vesiculation thus enhances TINM and contingent inflammatory NMMT, irrespective of a cell's vital state (Figs. 2g and 4d).

By harnessing the Ca2+-independent TINM sensor ALPIN, this study reveals that the ER serves as a stress/Ca²⁺-gated nuclear membrane buffer, quenching NMMT under homeostatic conditions. This NMMT break is released upon critical stress. Persistent ER vesiculation in damaged cells locks the nucleus in a high-tension state that stabilizes cPla2 on the INM—this occurs while the cell is technically still alive and it persists beyond cell death: placing swollen HeLa cell nuclei next to an isotonically balanced zebrafish wound mediates cPla2-dependent neutrophil recruitment just like hypotonic shock at wound sites5. Thus, the cPla2–NMMT pathway is a cell death-transcendent mechanism, not exclusively tied to a particular type of stress (for example, ΔΠ), nor to cell viability or cell death—it is a simple, physical process that just relies on Ca2+ and concomitant nuclear pressurization. It can trigger restitutive mechanisms (repair, inflammation and so on) hours before the irreversible loss of plasma membrane integrity releases immunogenic molecules into the extracellular space that promote canonical damage-associated molecular pattern signalling.

TINM is never fully abrogated by the ER, suggesting that compensatory lipid flow from this organelle into the INM is throttled by obstacles that remain to be described. Anchored transmembrane proteins inhibit lipid flow, as previously proposed for Lem2 in yeast51. It is also conceivable that the nuclear pores act as topological bottlenecks for nuclear membrane/ER area redistribution36. The incompleteness of TINM buffering by an intact ER permits reversible cPla2–NMMT in cells distal to the wound margin, such as perivascular macrophages43.

To probe ER–NM interorganelle mechanics, we vesiculated the ER with Ca2+, mainly because the perturbation of known ER shape genes52,53 does not yield a comparable disruption. The molecular mechanisms underlying ER vesiculation deserve further investigation. Identifying the putative Ca2+-regulated vesiculation factor(s), could inform therapeutic strategies that attenuate sterile inflammatory signalling by preserving the ER–NM contiguity in damaged cells.

U2OS (HTB-96, ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) was used to transfect U2OS cell lines according to the manufacturer's instructions. To establish stable transgenic cell lines, cells were co-transfected with SB100X Sleeping Beauty transposase and a pSB/MCS/Puro transposon vector encoding the genes of interest under the control of the EF1α or CMV promoter in 2:1 ratio. At 48 h after transfection, cells were grown in complete growth medium with 1 µg ml−1 puromycin for 1–2 weeks. mKate2 and eGFP double-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry. For imaging experiments, cells were incubated with L-15 LEIBOVITZ (Thermo Scientific, 21083027), which is buffered by phosphate salts, free‑base amino acids, and 0.9 g l−1 galactose (in place of glucose), with 0.55 g l−1 sodium pyruvate and 2 mM l‑glutamine.

The 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (18:1 Liss Rhod PE) were purchased from Avanti Research.

For bacterial expression, human ARFGAP1 ALPS1–2-eGFP (human ARFGAP1, amino acids AA192–304) were cloned into a modified pGEX 6P-1 backbone via EcoRI and NotI, leading to N-terminal GST fusion with Human Rhinovirus-3C (HRV-3C) protease cleavage sites.

For mammalian expression, rat ARFGAP1 ALPS1-mKate2 with 3XNLS (rat ARFGAP1, amino acids AA196-234) and human ARFGAP1 ALPS1–2-mKate2 with or without 3XNLS (human ARFGAP1, amino acids AA192–304) were fused to eGFP-Lmnb1 or eGFP-SEC61B through P2A peptides on the C-terminus and subsequently cloned into the pSB/CMV/MCS/Puro transposon plasmid. Within this plasmid, an expression cassette containing genes of interests is driven by a constitutive CMV promoter, along with another expression cassette that encodes a puromycin selection marker under the control of a synthetic SV40 promoter. Both expression cassettes are flanked by inverted terminal repeats that contain transposase recognition sites and allow transposition into host genome when co-expressed with the hyperactive Sleeping Beauty transposase (SB100X). For ALPS fusing with zebrafish eGFP-Lmnb1, ALPS sequences were inserted into the backbone harbouring eGFP-Lmnb1 via NheI and BshTI. For ALPS fusing with human eGFP–SEC61B, the plasmids harbouring both ALPS motifs and eGFP-LMNB1 were digested with BglII and XbaI, and SEC61B was ligated in to replace Lmnb1. mCherry-SEC61B and eGFP-Lmnb1 were also fused and subsequently cloned into the same transposon plasmid to investigate lamina shrivelling during hypo-osmotic stress and the prelytic phase of ferroptotic cell death. Briefly, mCherry-SEC61B was inserted into the vector backbone harbouring eGFP-Lmnb1 via NheI and EcoRI.

Zebrafish cPla2-mKate2 was fused to eGFP-KDEL through a P2A peptide and subsequently cloned into a similar pSB/EF1 α/MCS/Puro transposon plasmid, in which the genes of interests were under the control of a constitutive and mammalian-endogenous EF1α promoter.

To generate GUV membranes composed of 99.5% DPPC and 0.5% 18:1 Liss Rhod PE (mol/mol), we used a standard electroformation protocol11,54. Briefly, 0.11 μM of lipid mixture dissolved in chloroform was spread on 30–60 Ω indium tin oxide coverslips (Structure Probe Inc. supplies) and dried under a N2 stream. To completely remove chloroform, the cover slips were exposed to vacuum overnight. Indium tin oxide coverslips were assembled into an electroformation chamber with 500 mM sucrose solution inside and incubated at 60 °C. The chambers were connected to a function generator (RIGOL DG1022). A sine wave with a frequency of 10.0 Hz and peak-to-peak voltage at 1.41 V was applied for 4–6 h followed by a square wave with a frequency of 4.5 Hz and peak-to-peak voltage at 2.12 V for 30 min. After electroformation, GUVs were extracted from the chamber using a gel-loading tip. The chamber was washed two times with 500 mM glucose solutions to collect residual GUVs. GUVs were used for experiments within 5 days after preparation.

The pGEX 6P-1 expression vector harbouring tagged ARFGAP1-ALPS1–2-eGFP was transformed into Rosetta 2 pLySs cells (Novagen). This vector is used to express GST fusion proteins with a PreScission protease site. Expression of ARFGAP1-ALPS1–2-eGFP was induced by 0.2 mM IPTG at 37 °C under vigorous shaking (250 rpm) for 3 h in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg m−1) at OD600 = 0.8. After expression, bacteria were first centrifuged at 2,600 rcf for 30 min, pelleted and frozen at −80 °C overnight. Afterwards, bacteria were resuspended in 25 mM HEPES and 0.1% Triton X-100 with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche) at pH 7.4. Sonication was conducted on an ice/water mixture for 7–10 min with the following settings: 50% amplitude, 1 s on/2 s off pulses (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sonic Dismembrator Model 500). After sonication and centrifugation at 24,000 rcf for 30 min at 4 °C (Sorvall RC 6 PLUS, Rotor SS-34), the supernatants were collected and incubated with glutathione sepharose 4B gel beads (Cytiva) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES and 200 mM KCl (pH 7.4). Beads with GST-tagged ARFGAP1-ALPS1–2-eGFP were incubated with HRV-3C protease (PreScission protease, Cytiva) in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES and 200 mM KCl (pH 7.4) overnight at 4 °C to elute ARFGAP1-ALPS1–2-eGFP. Eluates were concentrated with Amicon Ultra-2 10 K centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Sigma). The total protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein purity was determined by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Bands were quantified in Fiji. Aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

The binding experiments were performed according to a standard protocol11. In summary, concentrated GUVs were transferred to a hypo-osmotic binding buffer containing 0 or 20 µM Ca²⁺ (Supplementary Table 3) and ALPS1–2–eGFP domains at varying concentrations (ranging from 0 to 500 nM) in BSA-coated glass-bottom dishes (20 mg ml−1 BSA solution was added 1–2 h before the experiment to reduce GUV membrane ruptures during prolonged incubation). Specifically, GUVs were loaded into hypotonic solution by gently dispensing them with the pipette tip directed onto the glass surface to ensure the vesicles settled at the bottom. GUVs were left in the binding solution for 2 h until protein recruitment approached an equilibrium. Then GUV membrane and protein fluorescence images were simultaneously acquired using a 40× objective and the protein adsorption fluorescence was quantified, normalized and adsorption isotherms were fitted as described in ‘Image acquisition and computational analysis for cell culture and GUV experiments' section. All steps, including incubation, were carried out at room temperature to minimize the effects of thermal drifts during image acquisition. For binding quantification, the ALPS1–2–eGFP was titrated on GUVs and binding isotherms extracted (0 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 47 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 41 for 20 μM Ca2+; 25 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 14 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 28 for 20 μM Ca2+; 50 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 28 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 39 for 20 μM Ca2+; 100 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 57 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 54 for 20 μM Ca2+; 200 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 61 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 73 for 20 μM Ca2+; 300 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 87 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 86 for 20 μM Ca2+; 400 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 89 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 73 for 20 μM Ca2+; 500 nM ALPS1–2–eGFP: n = 74 for 0 μM Ca2+ and n = 64 for 20 μM Ca2+).

Ninety-six-well glass-bottom dishes (Cellvis) were coated with 0.1% gelatin in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for at least 15 min at 37 °C before washing 3× with PBS. U2OS cells stably expressing fluorescent markers were then seeded in 96-well dishes (~3 × 104 cells per well) 24 h before the start of the imaging experiments in the specified cell culture solutions (see above). Before the experiment, the cell culture medium was exchanged to Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Thermo Fisher). Under isosmotic conditions, U2OS cells were incubated in L-15 stock culture medium to obtain a final osmotic pressure of 341 mOsm. To induce different levels of hypo-osmotic shock, the cell imaging medium was diluted by the addition of double-distilled water supplemented with 1.26 mM CaCl2 (Supplementary Table 4). The wells were buffered by a combination of phosphates, free base amino acids (2 mM l-glutamine) and galactose, and did not rely on sodium bicarbonate and CO2 pH buffering. For standard time-lapse imaging, cells were first recorded under isosmotic conditions for 4–5 min before hypo-osmotic shock was applied by dilution. They were then imaged continuously for a maximum of 20 min (t = 1 min). In extended time-lapse experiments, cells were imaged for three frames (6 min total, t = 2 min) under isosmotic conditions before applying the hypo-osmotic treatment and imaged for 6 h. The humidity and temperature of the imaging chamber was supported by a TOKAI-HIT substage heater, calibrated and set to 37 °C at least 30 min before the start of the experiment. During imaging, cells that were in the central region of the well were chosen for image acquisition. To evaluate plasma membrane integrity during osmotic swelling, 50 nM Sytox Blue (Molecular Probes) was included in the culture medium and the dilutant. For single time point experiments, U2OS cells expressing ALPIN1/cPla2–mKate2 and ER markers were exposed to hypo-osmotic solutions for 5 min before being imaged for nuclear membrane binding and ER morphology.

U2OS cells were seeded in 96-well glass-bottom plate (1 × 105 cells per well) the night before the experiment, at least 16 h before the start of the imaging experiment. To visualize the nucleolus, the adherent U2OS cells expressing either of ALPIN1 (ALPS1–mKate2 3XNLS) or cPla2–mKate2 were stained live with NUCLEOLAR-ID (Enzo, ENZ-51009-500) by incubating the cells with green detection reagent dissolved in L-15 media for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were transferred to a confocal microscope and left untreated or shocked with hypo-osmotic dilution for 15–20 min (ΔΠ = 270 mOsm) and imaged.

The permeabilization protocol was adapted from an established method5. A base medium (BM) was prepared under Ca2+-free conditions for all permeabilization experiments, consisting of 123 mM KCl, 12 mM NaCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1.94 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MOPS and 10 mM EGTA/Na+, adjusted to pH 7.3–7.4. To perform permeabilization in the presence of Ca2+, a modified version of BM was used in which all components remained unchanged except for the EGTA/Na⁺ concentration, which was reduced from 10 mM to 1 mM. CaCl2 was added to the modified BM to raise the free Ca2+ concentration to 50 µM according to the CHELATOR algorithm55. Unless otherwise specified, cells were permeabilized in either BM or modified BM supplemented with 12.5 µg ml−1 Digitonin (Cayman Chemical) and 2.5% PVP360 (Millipore Sigma) for over 60 min before imaging, ensuring that the NE was fully relaxed at the start of acquisition. To induce and control TINM (tension-induced nuclear membrane deformation), the concentration of PVP360 was systematically reduced.

To assess the behaviour of the ALPS1–mKate2-3xNLS (ALPIN1) sensor and its binding dynamics to the NE during increasing colloid osmotic pressure (Fig. 2f), permeabilized U2OS cells expressing ALPIN1 and eGFP–Lmnb1 were first incubated and imaged in BM supplemented with 2.5% PVP360 for 5 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and subsequently incubated and imaged in BM containing decreasing concentrations of PVP360 (ranging from 0% to 2.5%) for an additional 10 min.

To systematically test the effects of Ca2+ concentration and colloid osmotic stress on ER structures (Extended Data Fig. 2g), U2OS cells expressing ER markers (eGFP–KDEL) were imaged after incubating for 1 h under four experimental conditions: (1) BM with 2.5% PVP360 (Ca2+ free, no colloid osmotic stress), (2) BM alone (Ca2+ free, while inducing colloid osmotic stress), (3) modified BM with 2.5% PVP360 and 50 µM CaCl2 (presence of Ca2+, but no colloid osmotic stress) and (4) modified BM with 50 µM CaCl2 alone (presence of Ca2+ and colloid osmotic stress).

To evaluate TINM responses during increasing colloid osmotic pressures in cells with either intact or disrupted ER networks (Fig. 2g), permeabilized cells expressing ALPIN1 and eGFP–Lmnb1 were imaged for 5 min in BM containing 2.5% PVP360 (intact ER) or in modified BM with 2.5% PVP360 and 50 µM free Ca2+ (fragmented ER network). Subsequently, the PVP360 concentration was diluted to either 1.25% or 0%, while maintaining constant Ca2+ levels. Imaging was continued for an additional 15 min. For diluting the PVP360 concentration from 2.5% to 1.25% or 0%, permeabilized cells were washed two to three times before incubation. Without washes, residual high molecular weight and viscous PVP360 would differentially delay colloid osmotic shock, confounding the interpretation. Imaging was paused during the wash steps and resumed after permeabilized cells were incubated in the diluting medium. Note that cells remained only loosely adherent after permeabilization; therefore, all wash steps were performed gently. Medium was added and removed by dispensing against the well wall rather than directly onto the cells to minimize detachment.

To evaluate whether ER vesiculation alone can induce a TINM response under osmotically balanced conditions (Extended Data Fig. 2h), single time point images of U2OS cells expressing ALPIN1 and eGFP–Lmnb1 were taken after permeabilizing in BM containing 2.5% PVP360 (intact ER) or in modified BM with 2.5% PVP360 and 50 µM free Ca2+ (fragmented ER network) for 30 min.

For testing the contribution of the ER network to NMMT, membrane (eGFP–SEC61B) or lumen (eGFP–KDEL) localization was used as a proxy for ER dynamics in the U2OS cells. The cells were seeded in DMEM media at a density of 5 × 105 cell ml−1 in 96-well plates that were precoated with gelatin. The media were exchanged to L-15 and cells were imaged with the FLIP approach. FLIP imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 Confocal Laser Scanning system equipped with a Leica white light laser (1.5 mW: 470–670 nm, 78 Mhz, output power of 70.00%), argon lasers (65 mW: 458, 476, 488, 496 and 514 nm continuous) that were used for excitation and photobleaching and a Plan Apochromatic objective (Leica HC PL APO CS2, 63×/NA 1.40 oil). The emission was detected on internal spectral HyD SMD2 sensors for mKate2 (618–660 nm, gain 100/offset −0.22) and eGFP 2× liquid-cooled PMT (498–540 nm eGFP gain 835.8/offset −0.22), respectively. The light path was mounted with a ×2 lens changer (CS2 UV Optics 1) and emission notch filter set and polarization FW mirror (NF 488/561/633). The fluorescent images were acquired at 1,024 × 1,024 pixel resolution in xyt scan mode at 600 Hz scan speed (pixel dwell time of 0.4 μs) at the midplane of the cells of interest in the field of view (FOV) or 184.52 × 184.52 μm at pixel size (voxel 0.18 μm) in x and y direction. The imaging set up was optimized for minimal fluctuations in baseline fluorescence for the duration of imaging, therefore power for lasers were adjusted to 1.5% for 488 nm excitation (eGFP–ER) and 2.5% for 561 nm (mKate2), where the xy scan was bidirectional and pinhole was adjusted to 191 μm (PinholeAiry of 2 AU) with line averaging of 3–4, and data were collected at 12-bit resolution. The photobleaching was achieved by ablating a 2.5-μm radius circle in the FOV with an argon bleach laser line (488 nm, output power of 19.84%) and a simple beam expander for FRAP booster mode. Each FRAP was set up in the Leica Microsystems software (Leica LAS X 3.5.7.23225) using the LAS X FRAP AB module where images were acquired once as a single frame for pre-bleach followed by a series of continuous photobleaching iterations in the same region for three cycles (loops), followed by full FOV acquisition. This sequence was set to repeat until the complete depletion of target cells with the fluorophore of interest (10–25 repeats). The pre-bleach took 5–7 s, while acquisition of FRAP sequence, including three loops per subsequent frame, took approximately 20 s for all imaging experiments. The settings that were determined for the ER network at baseline were applied to the hypo-osmotically shocked cells, with CaCl2 dilutant as described above as the depletion control for critically stressed cells in luminally (KDEL–eGFP) or membrane (eGFP–SEC61B) expressed eGFP variants. For ER vesiculation, the cells were hypotonically shocked (ΔΠ = 270 mOsm) and imaged 5–10 min after treatment. The obtained .lif files were then loaded into Fiji (ImageJ) and stitched, and an invariant circle region of interest (ROI) (width, 5 μm; length, 5 μm) was overlaid on the eGFP (ER) channel and analysed for ROI 1, ROI 2 and ROI 3, where ROI 1 corresponds to photobleached area, the median axis in plane with regard to the target position and the opposite location to the photobleached area with respect to the nucleus. The nucleus was segmented using binary (otsu) thresholding and the segmentation mask was overlaid to the eGFP (ER) channel for quantification of nuclear ER intensity over time. The baseline fluorescence intensity fluctuation in non-targeted cells is recorded as Ctr ROI, referring to non-targeted neighbouring cell control region within the field of view. The data were extracted and analysed in a custom Python script (v3.9).

For delineating the states of ER network or its vesiculation, we distinguished these two morphologies with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) systems, which achieve a nominal resolution of 60 nm in xy were used in this study. One such example is the Zeiss Elyra 7 microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil DIC M27 objective and 2× pco.edge sCMOS (version 4.2 CL HS, Innovatek LCS-BU) cameras. The 60-nm super-resolution cell images were acquired at baseline (ΔΠ = 0 mOsm) and 10 min after hypo-osmotic shock (ΔΠ = 270 mOsm) and imaged using the Zeiss Elyra 7 microscope with the following build. The system contained 488 nm and 561 nm OPSL lasers. The light path was equipped with a reflector turret mounted with FW1:LBF (405/488/561/642 laser-blocking filter) beam splitters and filters for red (TV1:LP570) or green (TV2:BP 495–550) emission. The data were recorded in apotome SIM2 in non-delay (five phases for each of the z sections) with 3D leap mode and a FOV of 80.14 μm × 80.14 μm (or 1,280 ×1,280 pixels), 0.063 μm pixel size, 0.329 μm z step, stack 5–12 μm and 50–80 ms exposure time for both colours (camera sensor temperature, air 7 °C) and collected at 16-bit resolution. The acquisition of individual z stacks takes about 12–20 s. The mKate2 and eGFP fluorophores are excited with the 561 nm (1.6% power) and 488 nm (4.1% power) laser lines, respectively. We also generated single time point images in Lattice SIM2 (13 phases) with 3D leap mode with a FOV of 80.14 μm × 80.14 μm (or 1,280 × 1,280 pixels), 0.063 μm pixel size, 0.110–0.150 μm z step and 80 ms exposure time for both colours (camera temperature set to 7 °C). Overall, for each focal plane, 5 or 13 phase images were acquired. Exposure time and laser power were balanced for each fluorescence channel individually to minimize bleaching and exposure time. SIM and Lattice SIM reconstruction was performed with the SIM processing tool of ZEN 3.0 SR FP2 (64-bit, 16.0.20.306 black) software for applying SIM2 image reconstruction on the ER channel as follows: the advanced filter was set with best fit and Gauss (sectioning = 100), we did not use any detrending for either channel or scale to raw image, the set regularization weight was 0.015, with proc.Sampling and Out.Sampling set to (×2 or ×4) and the algorithm was run for 20 iterations. After image reconstruction, the voxel size decreased to 0.031 × 0.031 × 0.329 µm (Out.Sampling ×2) or 0.016 × 0.016 × 0.110 µm (Out.Sampling ×4). The images (.czi format) were then converted to .ims files and 3D rendered in Imaris with the filament and surface GUI function, where surface grain size (0.093 µm) and the diameter of the largest sphere (0.93 µm) were segmented automatically. The segmentation masks were exported from imaris (Imaris v10.2, Bitplane) as .IV. The 3D segmentation mask was then triangulated and unpacked as a mesh of vertices and faces with a custom Python pipeline. The interactive data and the method of extraction from SIM2 are available at https://github.com/zazadovv/ER_Nucleus (representative interactive ER rendering data files are available in Demo_file_3D folder and extracted.html and can be viewed from any internet web browser). The mesh array was decimated to maintain only 70% of vertices (30% discarded) and transformed into an interactive 3D STL in a plotly.js (v3.0.1) model for the qualitative evaluation of nuclear ER connections or the absence of a fragmented state.

To study ER fragmentation during ferroptosis, cells were imaged after incubating in L-15 medium supplemented with DMSO or 4 μM glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor ML162 (Selleckchem) for 2 h. For the temporal correlation of nuclear membrane binding, ER fragmentation and cell death, the time-lapse movies of ML162 were acquired on U2OS cells expressing eGFP–KDEL, cPla2–mKate2 or eGFP–SEC61B, ALPIN1 and Sytox blue. For ML162 the cells were seeded in a gelatin precoated (0.1% gelatin in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+) 96-well imaging plate (Cellvis, P96-1.5H-N) at a density of 1 × 104 cells ml−1 and allowed to adhere overnight. Before imaging, the DMEM culture medium was exchanged to L-15 supplemented with 50 nM Sytox blue and transferred to a 37 °C pre-heated microscope chamber. During imaging, after the first time point, the wells were either incubated with 4 μM ML162 or DMSO and 50 nM Sytox blue (Thermo Scientific, S11348) for 2 h, where each z stack (z = 17 steps) was collected every 10 min (t = 10 min, 13 frames) on a spinning-disc confocal microscope.

Adult transgenic Casper Zebrafish (Danio rerio) strains were maintained by adhering to the guidelines of the care and use of laboratory animals of the National Institutes of Health and Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare recommendations. The animal procedures were in compliance with an animal protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (protocol no. 11-01-002). The adult Tg(hsp70i:cPla2-mKate2-P2A-eGFP-KDEL) fish were reared in 2.8 l polycarbonate tanks at animal density 10 fish per litre. The anaesthesia for the offspring was all conducted with 0.2 mg ml−1 3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma, MS-222, E10521), (pH 7.0), buffered in 0.5 mg ml−1 anhydrous sodium phosphate dibasic (Fisher, BP332-500). The animals were staged by days post-fertilisation (d.p.f.). Sex was indeterminate at 2.5–4 d.p.f. and all in vivo experiments were conducted at these larval stages. The embryos were collected from natural spawning and raised in standard hypo-osmotic E3 containing 0.1% (w/v) methylene blue (Sigma-Aldrich, M9140) for first 24 h followed by E3 medium (5 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S7653), 0.17 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, P9333), 0.33 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, C5670) and 0.33 mM MgSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, M7506)) in 100 mm Petri dishes (Fisher Scientific, FB0875713) in complete darkness.

Fertilized Casper zebrafish embryos were collected and injected at the one-cell stage into the cytoplasm with a Nanoject II microinjector (Drummond Scientific). Plasmids were assembled with the Gateway multisite cloning kit using LR Clonase (Invitrogen, C12537-023) and multicloning sites between the gateway att sites flanking the cassette of p5E (hsp70i), pME (cPla2-mKate2) and p3E (P2A-eGFP-KDEL) plasmids that were recombined into Tol2kit Destination pDESTcrybb1 for generating Tg(hsp70i:cPla2-mKate2-P2A-eGFP-KDEL). The middle entry pME vector was assembled from the cPla2 (Ensembl: ENSDARG00000024546) open reading frame amplified by PCR and ligated into pDONOR221 containing the pME gateway compatible att sites and subsequently fused in frame to mKate2 (Evrogen) as a C-terminus fluorescent tag with a 15 amino acid GS-enriched linker. The p3E entry vector bears a self-cleaving peptide in the NTD of eGFP that is followed by the ER localization signal KDEL and SV40 pA. For transgenesis, Tol2kit transposase mRNA was transcribed from the NotI linearized pCS2FA-transposase plasmid with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 reverse transcription kit (Thermo Scientific, AM1340). To generate the in vivo construct, the pDestTol2pA2 was used as the backbone bearing a (attR4/attR3) cassette for multisite LR recombination. The entry clones were flanked with the multisite-compatible attL4-attB cassette in p5E-HSP70i (attL4/attR1), pDonor-cPla2_MK2_Nonstop (attL1/attL2) and p3E-p2A-KDEL-eGFP (attB2/attB3) to yield the destination construct (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

The final transgenesis construct was injected into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos (~2.7 nl per embryo) at a concentration of 25 ng μl−1 along with 25 ng μl−1 Tol2kit transposase mRNA. Among the injected animals, fluorescence-positive siblings in the eye were selected and raised in husbandry and backcrossed at sexual maturity to Casper fish and their progeny were used for larvae experiments. A detailed map of the Tg(hsp70i:cPla2-mKate2-P2A-eGFP-KDEL) plasmid and restriction digests results are provided in Extended Data Fig. 5b.

For laser-wounding experiments, at 2 d.p.f., Tg(hsp70i:cPla2-mKate2-P2A-eGFP-KDEL) were heat shocked at 37 °C for 2 h to induce transgene expression. The fluorescent larvae were sorted for experiments at 12–18 h after heat treatment using a coaxial dissection stereomicroscope (MVX10, Olympus) equipped with a mercury lamp (LM200B1-A, Prior Scientific) and set dichroic mirrors (MVX-RFA; 540/35 U-MGFPHQ/XL, 625/55 U-MRFPHQ/XL). The selected larvae were anaesthetized in hypo-osmotic E3 medium56 containing 0.2 mg ml−1 3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma, MS-222, E10521) (pH 7.0), buffered in 0.5 mg ml−1 anhydrous sodium phosphate dibasic (Fisher, BP332-500). Using ~200 μl 1% low-melting (LM) agarose dissolved in E3, the anaesthetized 3 d.p.f. embryos were embedded on their right side in a 60 mm plastic Petri dish (Corning, 351007). The solidified LM agarose was covered with ~2–3 ml of standard E3 medium, or pre-incubated for 30 min in E3 supplemented with ethanol as vehicle (1% EtOH in E3) or latrunculin A (2.5 μM, Sigma-Aldrich, L5163) to create a submerging environment for the 25× objective lens (NA 1.1 ∞/0–0.17 WD 2 μm Water Dipping, Nikon) on an upright microscope. The samples were excited with 488 and 561 nm diode lasers (Andor Revolution XD). Excitation intensity/exposure was set to 35%/80 ms (488 nm) and 30%/80 ms (561 nm). ER and cPla2–mKate2 fluorescence were acquired using a Andor iXon3 897 EMCCD camera mounted on a Nikon Eclipse FN1 microscope (25× objective lens; NA 1.1, ∞/0–0.17 WD 2 μm, Nikon) equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning-disc unit (pinhole of 50 μm) and NIS imaging software (NIS Elements, 3.22.14). Emission was acquired through band-pass filters for green (525/40, Semrock, FF02-525/40-25) or red (617/73, Semrock, FF02-617/73-25) fluorescence emission spectra of confocal stacks, collected at 1.5 µm z step size and repeated in no-delay intervals per position for up to 5 min. The wounds were induced at t ~ 1 min with several successive laser pulses targeted at the periphery of the epithelium using a microscope-mounted 435 nm micropoint laser (Andor). The experimental scheme for heat shock-induced expression is shown in Extended Data Fig. 5c.

For multiphoton imaging experiments, 2 d.p.f. Tg(hsp70i:cPla2-mKate2-P2A-eGFP-KDEL) were heat shocked at 37 °C for 2 h approximately 24 h before the start of the imaging experiment. The heat-shocked larvae were anaesthetized in hypo-osmotic E3 medium containing tricaine analgesic. The larvae were prepared using the same protocol as for UV-laser wounding experiments except for latrunculin A pre-treatment. The anaesthetized live samples were embedded in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation, P35G-1.5-14-C) before being transferred to a pre-heated Leica Stellaris 8 Dive two-photon microscope. The microscope is equipped with two tunable infrared lasers: Mai Tai HP (690–1,040 nm, continuous) and Insight X3 (680–1,300 nm, continuous), both capable of delivering up to 2.4 W average maximum power. Tissues were wounded using the FRAP ab1 XYZT module in galvanometric scanning mode with bidirectional scan direction, a scan speed of 1,000 Hz, and a pixel dwell time of 0.3508 μs. A HC FLUOTAR L VISIR 25×/0.95 WATER objective was used with 2.25× zoom and acquired at 15-s intervals. Images were collected at Nyquist resolution with a pixel size of 0.25 μm, yielding a FOV of 206.7 × 206.7 μm (840 × 840 pixels), and a z-stack depth of 10 μm with a step size of 2 μm per slice. For dual-colour excitation, the Mai Tai HP laser was tuned to 924 nm (MP1, 5.5% power) for eGFP excitation, and the Insight X3 laser was tuned to 1,118 nm (MP2, 2.6% power) for mKate2. Wounding was performed using the FRAP module with a sequence of four pre-bleach iterations, followed by six bleach iterations and 20 post-bleach iterations. For laser ablation, bleaching intensity was set to 100% on MP2 (1,118 nm) and 20% on MP1 (924 nm), with a total dwell time of 2 s at the mid plane of the tissue, targeting a circular ROI (radius 25 μm) for localized wounding. Emitted fluorescence was filtered using the Galvo Resonant Pan module (multifunction port RSP 1005) with SP815 and SP800 short-pass filters, in combination with a Notch FW 2 (OPO SP800) filter and a variable beam expander (expansion factor of 1.03, z-colour correction offset of 0). Detection was performed using external spectral non-descanned hybrid detectors (HyD NDD1 and NDD2) operating in photon-counting mode, with NDD1 configured for eGFP detection (480–527 nm) and NDD2 for mKate2 (620–732 nm). All imaging data were saved and processed using Leica LAS X software (Leica LAS X, 4.8.1.29271).

The 4D image stacks of Tg(hsp70i: cPla2-mKate2-P2A-eGFP-KDEL) were corrected by 3D deconvolution, where sample PSF was derived and computed automatically with depth calibration and without image intensity subtraction or pre-processing in Nikon NIS elements (5.21.03, Build 1489). The deconvolution process was carried by the default method using the landweber algorithm for spinning-disc modality with a 50 µm pinhole size with an immersion refractive index 1.33 (water) for both 488 and 561 nm fluorescent light emission. The deconvolved or MP image stacks were denoised using the denoise.ai tool for improving the signal-to-noise in Nikon NIS elements (5.21.03). The obtained files were loaded in Fiji (ImageJ, 1.53p) and the last frame was used for extraction of wound core and ER vesiculation area. Specifically, the polygon tool was used to trace parameter and set-scaled images for the dark area after 435 nm–UV harmonic laser wounding in tissue, and was designated as wound core in all biologically independent replicates. The ER vesiculation was traced by the polygon tool outside of the wound core until no visual vesiculation patterns were observed deep within the tissue. The obtained values were recorded per pixel of segmented polygon in Fiji (ImageJ, 1.53p) and converted to micrometres squared. The radius and correlation quantification were subsequently extracted, and box plots and Pearson tests with 95% linear regression were plotted in Python3 vector graphics.

The dynamics of cPla2 and ALPIN binding and lamin B1 (Lmnb1) and ER structures were measured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted spinning-disc confocal microscope with a Plan Apo 100×/1.45 oil objective, a Plan Apo 60×/1.4 oil objective or a Plan Apo 40×/0.95 air objective (cells were imaged with a 60× or 100× objective, while GUVs were imaged with a 40× objective) and equipped with either (1) a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning-disc unit, an ANDOR iXon ULTRA 897BV EMCCD camera, 405 nm, 488 nm and 561 nm solid-state laser lines (Andor Revolution XD, LCS-501A) and NIS Elements Software (4.13.04) or (2) a Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning-disc unit, a Teledyne Photometrics Prime-BSI sCMOS camera and 405, 488 and 561 nm multidiode AOTF-controlled laser modules (Nikon Instruments, model LUN-F; F6A 250 V) with NIS-Elements software (version 5.21.03). mKate2 and 18:1 Liss Rhod PE emission was excited at 561 nm and collected through a 620 band-pass emission filter (590–650 nm, Chroma Technology., 49005, ET-DsRed; 88000v2 Quad Set). eGFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and collected through a 525 band-pass emission filter (515–555 nm, Chroma Technology, 49002, ET-GFP;88000v2 Quad Set). The Sytox blue fluorescence was excited at 405 nm and collected through a 425 band-pass emission filter (435–478 nm, Chroma Technology, 49000, ET-DAPI;88000v2 Quad Set). Identical microscope settings were used throughout imaging. Experiments involving GUVs and permeabilized cells took place at room temperature. Live imaging of cultured cells was performed at 37 °C. Nikon's Perfect Focus System was enabled throughout the imaging session. For short-term time lapse and permeabilized cell imaging experiments, z-stacks (1–1.7 μm steps over 30 μm) were acquired each minute for a maximum of 20 min. For extended time-lapse experiments, z-stacks (2 μm over 40 μm) were acquired every 2 min for total of 6 h (frames 181, step t interval 2 min) in Nikon NIS elements (5.21.03). For the ML162 treatment, the z-stacks (1 μm step over 40 μm) were acquired every 10 min. For single time point acquisition, single z-stacks (1–1.4 μm steps over 30 μm) were acquired immediately after the end of the incubation. For high-resolution imaging of the ER network, we used a structured-illumination microscope (27.5 µm G5). Images were acquired using Elyra 7 Zeiss Microscope with a 63× objective (Plan-Apochromat 63× NA 1.4 ꚙ/0.17 WD 0.19 mm oil, 420782-9900-000 Zeiss) oil immersion lens. Emission was excited at 488 and 561 nm with beam splitters (SBS LP 560) and a laser-blocking filter (LFB 405/488/561/642) and sampled through 495–550 nm (BP 495–550) and 570–620 nm (LP 570) band-pass filters. Each emission for red and green were collected on two separate sCMOS camera (Excelitas technology, pco.edge 4.2 M) and aligned during pre-processing in Zeiss software (Zen Black 3.0 SR FP2, v16.0.20.306). A single z-stack (0.8 μm steps over 30 μm) was acquired at the end of the experiment. All images were taken in the identical microscope settings. The SIM reconstruction was conducted using the Zeiss Software (Zen Black 3.0 SR FP2). All 3D segmentation and analysis were performed with the Anaconda distribution of Python (Python ≥3.11). Specifically, customized Python scripts were developed using the Numpy (v1.23.5)57, Scipy (v1.15.2)58, Scikit image (v0.20.0)59, Allen Cell Structure Segmenter (v0.5.0)60, trackpy (v0.6.4)61,62 and Napari (v0.5.5) libraries63.

To quantify binding of ALPS1–2–eGFP to GUV membranes, a custom, semi-automatic Python script was developed. First, a line was manually drawn by the user from the centre of GUV to the edge to crop a selected GUV from the whole image stack. Next, intensity normalization and a 3D Gaussian blur (3-pixel radius) were applied to the cropped GUV stack to remove background noise. A marker-controlled watershed algorithm was used on each slice of the cropped stack to segment the GUV. The slice with largest segmented GUV area was defined as the middle section. Based on the watershed segmentation result, a three-pixel-wide contour of the GUV was drawn onto the GUV middle section. Last, the rim-binding intensity was calculated as the median of all intensities along the contour (Extended Data Fig. 6a).

To quantitatively measure the affinity of ALPS1–2–eGFP to GUV, the apparent dissociation constant \({K}_{{\rm{d}}}^{{\prime} }\), maximum binding intensity Bmax and the apparent Hill coefficient H were determined by nonlinear least-square analysis of bound-protein fluorescence (Bbound) versus the total domain concentration ([Domain]) using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with Hill expansion (MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox v25.1 R2025a)

A similar, fully autonomous Python pipeline was developed to segment the nucleus in 3D and quantify both the volume of nucleus and bindings of cPla2–mKate2 and ALPIN sensor. If cells expressed eGFP–Lmnb1, this marker was used for nuclear segmentation. Otherwise, cPla2–mKate2 or the ALPIN sensor was used for segmentation. First, intensity normalization, 3D Gaussian blur (1-pixel radius) and rolling-ball algorithms were applied to the images to remove uneven background noise. Second, a masked-object thresholding (this algorithm was employed to separate foreground objects from the background of the 3D image stack through an automatically determined threshold and to generate a marker image that distinguishes individual nucleus) followed by marker-controlled watershed algorithms were used to segment the NE within the 3D image stack. Since the movement of cell nuclei was limited (less than 50 µm) during the duration of the experiment, a standard particle-tracking algorithm was utilized to track individual nucleus over time. Nuclear volume was calculated by the summation of all voxels contained within the segmented binary mask. Ratiometric analysis was used to quantify cPla2–mKate2 and ALPIN nuclear membrane-binding dynamics. For each nucleus, the slice with largest segmented nuclear area was selected as the representative, middle section for each nucleus. Based on the watershed segmentation result of the middle section, a 3-pixel-wide contour (‘membrane contour') was drawn onto the NE and another 3-pixel-wide contour (‘background contour') was drawn to mark the centre of the nucleus (nucleoplasm). The binding was calculated by dividing the medians of all intensities along the ‘membrane contour' by the median of all intensities along the ‘background contour' in the channel where protein fluorescence was measured. One caveat for this type of imaging analysis is that an increase of binding ratio could be due to a decrease of intensity in nucleoplasm instead of an increase in protein binding to the NE. To account for this issue, an alternative ratiometric binding was calculated between the median intensity along the ‘membrane contour' of the 561 channel (protein of interests tagged with mKate2) and the median fluorescence intensity across the segmented nuclear middle section in the 488 nm channel (the eGFP-tagged Lmnb1 nuclear marker, whose intensity remained constant throughout the imaging session). A detailed scheme of nuclear membrane binding and volume analysis is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6b.

To quantify individual NE shrivelling/invaginations, a filament-based filter algorithm was performed on the previously selected middle section from the eGFP–Lmnb1 image stack to create a binary mask that preserved the detailed structures of nuclear membranes. Note, to preserve nuclear membrane details and minimize processing-induced artefacts, only Gaussian blurring was applied to the eGFP–Lmnb1 stack before applying the filament-based filter algorithm. The thickness parameter for the filament-based algorithm was set to 1.6 (~3–4 pixels). This was followed by a skeletonization algorithm to produce a precise 1-pixel outline of NE. Shrivelling often created branch points in the skeleton images. Therefore, the degree of nuclear invagination was approximated as the number of branch points in the skeleton outlines, which can be detected if a particular skeleton pixel contained more than three neighbours. Finally, a condensation algorithm was utilized to merge multiple nearby branch points that appeared owing to noise affecting accuracy of skeleton outlines. A scheme of the NE invagination analysis is shown in Extended Data Fig. 7a.

To quantify ER structure, a Python-based automatic image analysis pipeline was developed. ER images or movies were first pre-processed with intensity normalization and 3D Gaussian blur (1-pixel radius). The segmentation algorithm of choice was slightly different depending on the specific tag used to label the ER. With luminal labelling (for example, eGFP–KDEL), ER was segmented from the 3D stack by a marker-controlled watershed algorithm the same way as NE segmentation. If ER membranes were labelled (for example, SEC61B), the image was processed by a filament filter algorithm that segments dense filamentous and network-like structures in the cell. The algorithm's thickness parameter was set to 1.6, corresponding to ER networks or vesicles approximately 3–4 pixels thick. For 3D ER metrics, calculations were technically and optically challenging. The slice with largest segmented area along the z axis was selected as the representative mid-section for downstream quantifications to compute surface area and circularity. The surface area of each segmented ER membrane in the mid-section was extracted from the corresponding segmentation mask and the circularity was calculated as \(\mathrm{Circularity}=4\uppi \,\times \frac{\mathrm{Surface}\,\mathrm{area}}{{\mathrm{Perimeter}}^{2}}\) (0 for a highly non-circular object and 1 for a perfect circle). For each time point, ER surface area and circularity were measured for all individually segmented ER membranes within a single FOV. To enable the quantitative comparison across samples and time, these measurements were summarized by recording the largest individual ER surface area and the mean circularity of all ER membranes in that FOV. This approach produced one surface area value and one circularity value per FOV at each time point, which were then used for normalization, plotting and statistical analysis. As ER membranes from neighbouring cells were often in close proximity and plasma membrane labelling was absent, segmentation at the single-cell level was not feasible; therefore, ER metrics were quantified per FOV. A detailed scheme of quantifying ER circularity and area are provided in Extended Data Fig. 7b.

To ensure the comparability of results obtained across different experimental batches and days, multiple normalization methods were applied. For GUV experiments, raw rim binding of each domain was normalized by the fluorescence signal of a 1 μM protein solution from the same purification batch to reduce variabilities in fluorescence from different purification batches. For time-lapse experiments, numerical values for the fluorescent marker nuclear rim-to-centre ratio or rim-to-nuclear Lmnb1 (for example, cPla2, ALPIN and ALPIC), ER surface area, circularity, nuclear volume and nuclear folds at each subsequent time point were normalized to the corresponding value at t = 0 min. For FLIP experiments, the intensity of fluorescent ER markers at each subsequent time point was similarly normalized to the t = 0 min value. Notably, although ER circularity values inherently range from 0 to 1, normalization to the mean circularity at t = 0 min shifted the range to 1–2, such that a value of 1 represents the baseline circularity and values greater than 1 indicate an increase relative to baseline. For single time point osmotic shock experiments (Figs. 1a right, and 2c and Extended Data Fig. 1a), cPla2 and ALPIN1 nuclear rim-to-centre ratio, ER area and ER circularity under hypo-osmotic condition values were normalized to the corresponding measurements obtained under isosmotic condition. For single time point permeabilization experiments (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h), values for ER circularity, ER area and ALPIN1 nuclear rim-to-centre ratios were normalized to measurements obtained under 0 μM Ca2+ and osmotic-balanced (2.5% PVP) conditions. As different normalization schemes were applied to time-lapse and single time point datasets, the resulting value ranges differed and they were not directly comparable.

The results presented in this study were performed as multiple, biologically independent experiments, as indicated in figure legends, and no inconsistent results were observed. For experiments involving cell cultures, biological replicates were obtained using cells derived from distinct frozen vials and/or cultured at different times. For experiments involving GUVs, biological replicates were obtained using GUVs synthesized from independently prepared lipid mixtures. In animal experiments, each larva was considered to be an independent biological replicate, and at least six animals were used per imaging modality (spinning-disc confocal and two-photon microscopy).

For the fitted coefficients of ARFGAP1 ALPS1–2–eGFP GUV equilibrium binding, the minimum and maximum values denote the 95% confidence interval (CI), while the error bars for individual GUV binding measurements indicate s.d. For FLIP experimental results, the shaded area represents the 95% CI. For time-lapse comparisons of ER circularity and area, nuclear volume and folds, and cPla2 and ALPIN binding, the error bars denote the s.e.m. For single time point comparisons, error bars represent the s.d. The statistical analysis was performed in Python (v3.11) using Scipy (v1.15.2) and Pingouin (v0.5.5) packages58. The Shapiro–Wilk test and the Levene test were used to test for normality and equal variance between groups, respectively. For comparing statistical significance between two groups, a parametric method (an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test if two groups have equal variance, otherwise an unpaired two-tailed Welch's t-test) was used if the data passed the normality test. A non-parametric method (two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test) was used for non-normally distributed data. For the comparison of more than two groups, a one-way Welch's ANOVA (data did not pass Levene's test for equal variance) followed by a post hoc Games–Howell test were used if the data followed normal distribution. Otherwise, statistical significance was calculated with the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by a post hoc Dunn's test for multiple comparison. P values ≤0.05 were accepted (*P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001 and ****P ≤ 0.0001). ALPIN binding rates in permeabilized nuclei were estimated via ordinary least squares (OLS) on the linear part of the binding curves from Python's Statsmodel package64. Specifically, OLS regression models were fitted in Python 3.11 (statsmodels v0.14.4). Since there are only two time points (t = 4 min and t = 5 min), assumptions for linearity and multicollinearity were not applicable. The Breusch–Pagan test was used to assess heteroscedasticity; the Shapiro–Wilk test and Q–Qplots of standardized residuals were used to evaluate normality of residuals. If either test returned a P < 0.05, the model was re-estimated with heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC3) robust standard errors; otherwise, classical OLS standard errors were retained. The Durbin–Watson statistic was used to evaluate autocorrelations between variables. Estimated coefficients, s.e.m., 95% CIs, coefficient of determination (R² and adjusted R²) and P value are reported in Source data. Graphical plots were generated using Python 3.11 Matplotlib (v3.10.3)65 and seaborn (v0.13.2) libraries66. The helical-wheel representation of ALPS1 motif structure was created using the Python 3.11 Matplotlib library. The equilibrium GUV fluorescence-binding graph was generated using Curve Fitting Box (v25.1) from MATLAB R2025a. Since the ER circularity/area was quantified per FOV while the binding ratio of cPla2–mKate2 and the ALPIN sensor was calculated per nucleus, different cells within the same FOV were given the same ER circularity/area value in plotting the scatter plot in Figs. 1a and 2c. All plots and statistical analyses were generated using the standard packages listed above (version listed), with no additional custom plotting code.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size or effect size. Statistical analyses were performed across biological replicates. Replication included both variation in biological source material and/or independent imaging sessions conducted on separate experimental days. Analysis was performed objectively without blinding.

Time-lapse U2OS cell experiments were performed with 2–5 biological replicates, with key experiments repeated ≥3 independent replicates to ensure reproducibility. Single time point U2OS cell assays were conducted in one independent experiment using cells from two independent frozen vials. Equilibrium GUV experiments were conducted from two independently prepared lipid mixtures. For zebrafish imaging, each experiment represents a biologically independent replicate using animals derived from a distinct clutch of eggs. Experiments were repeated across multiple days, with one larva imaged per experiment for each UV- or infrared-induced tissue-wounding condition and repeated on more than six different live larvae to ensure reproducibility.

Data exclusion criteria were predefined. Imaging datasets were excluded if they were affected by artificial fluorescence fluctuations (for example, immersion oil bubbles) or incompletely acquired z-stacks, and broken tracks were either cropped or completely discarded. All raw imaging files of cell experiments were loaded into custom written automatic programs for analysis, unless otherwise stated. For the nuclear membrane analysis program, segmented objects with a size less than 8,000 pixel2 (~140 µm2) and/or touching the borders of the image boundary were excluded from the analysis. Nuclei were removed from the analysis when segmented objects moved more than 130 pixels (~20 µm) between successive frames or broken tracks appeared due to leakage of nucleoplasmic fluorescent markers (cPla2–mKate2 and ALPIN) when these markers were used for nuclear segmentation. Multiple tracks that were detected as single were deleted from the analysis. For the ER analysis program, segmented ER vesicles size less than 30–50 pixel2 (~1 µm2) were precluded from the analysis. Since the ER was analysed per FOV, no tracks were involved, and all time points were included in the analysis unless ER segmentation was precluded by the leakage of eGFP–KDEL. In long-term cell imaging experiments, datasets were excluded only when imaging artefacts prevented reliable analysis and data extraction. Specifically, exclusions were made if (1) fluorescent markers leaked from their designated organelle localization into the surrounding cytoplasmic space during acquisition, (2) cells became clumped or (3) automated tracking produced broken or fragmented tracks. For GUV experiments, the raw imaging files were loaded into a semi-automatic custom written analysis program where the individual GUV was randomly selected by the user for analysis. For zebrafish intravital imaging, datasets were excluded if tailfin tissue drift exceeded 100 pixels (~50 µm) in the xy plane or 20 pixels (~10 µm) in the z direction following UV-laser damage.

No data were excluded based on distribution (no outlier exclusion). Typically, experiments were repeated at least on two separate days (using cells thawed from different vials). Only the experiments shown in Figs. 1a, right, and 2c,e and Extended Data Figs. 1a and 2a,g,h were not replicated on different days; nevertheless they were conducted using cells or GUVs prepared from at least two independent stock sources, that is, storage vials or lipid mixtures, respectively. The details of statistical analyses used, exact P values, number of biological independent experiments and sample sizes for all graphs are listed in the figures or figure legends. The investigators were not blinded during the experiments and analysis. Specimens (U2OS cells, GUVs and zebrafish larvae) were randomly chosen for imaging without bias or pre-selection.

Yellow, hydrophobic; purple, serine and threonine; grey, glycine and alanine; blue, basic residues; red, acidic residues. (b) Circular plasmid maps of PSB/CMV/MCS constructs used to express ALPIN 1 or ALPIN 2 in U2OS cells together with nuclear (Lmnb1, left) or ER (SEC61B, right) markers (both protein sequences are linked via P2A sequence). To generate the constructs containing both ALPIN and nuclear marker, ARFGAP1 ALPS1 and ALPS 1-2 were inserted into the vector containing both eGFP-Lmnb1 and NLS tagged mKate2 sequences via NheI and BshT1 restriction sites. To generate the constructs containing both ALPIN and ER markers, the Lmnb1 sequence from the previously generated ALPIN-P2A-eGFP-Lmnb1 (left) was replaced by SEC61B via BgIII and XbaI restriction cut sites. The expression of the Puromycin resistant genes was under control of a SV40 promoter. Two inverted internal repeats sequences (IR-DR) flank the expression cassettes and allow the integration into host genomes when co-transfected with Sleeping Beauty transposase.

(a) Overview of GUV membrane and ALPS1-2-eGFP adsorption analysis. Image stacks of GUV membrane (561 nm) and ALPS 1-2-eGFP (488 nm) were acquired, followed by manual selection of a radial line from the GUV centre to the membrane edge for automatic cropping (Step 2). Afterwards, a watershed segmentation algorithm was applied to the 3D cropped stack (Step 3), and the slice with the largest segmented area along z-axis (Midplane slice, Step 3 middle image with red edge) was selected to generate a membrane contour (white outline in Step 4) for quantifying GUV radius and ALPS 1-2-eGFP binding intensity. Quantified outputs were plotted and exported for downstream analysis (Step 5). Scale bar, 20 µm. R, radius. S, adsorption signals. (b) Overview of nuclear membrane volume and ALPIN/cPla2 binding analysis. Here, a eGFP-Lmnb1 and ALPIN2 labelled U2OS cell undergoing 270 mOsm hypoosmotic shock was chosen as an example. Raw 3D image stack was processed by gaussian smoothing and intensity thresholding (Step 2), followed by masked-object thresholding and segmentation of individual nuclei using a marker-controlled watershed algorithm (Step 3). The mid slice with largest segmented nuclear area was chosen to generate membrane contour for downstream analysis. Two strategies were used to quantify protein binding to the nuclear membrane (Step 4): (1). a rim:centre ratio comparing binding intensity at the membrane contour with that at the inner outline marking the nucleoplasm (Step 4 left panel); and (2) a rim: Lmnb1 ratio comparing binding intensity at the contour (561 nm channel, Step 4 right panel top image) with Lmnb1 intensity across segmented nuclear area at 488 nm channel (Step 4 right panel bottom image). Nuclear volume was calculated by summing all voxels within the segmented stack (Step 5). Binding ratio and nuclear volume were plotted and exported for downstream analysis (Step 6). Scale bar, 20 µm. V, volume. S, ratiometric signals. Statistical source data are provided in Statistical Source Data Extended Data Fig 6.

(a) Overview of the Lamin branchpoint analysis to quantitatively measure nuclear envelope invaginations across hypoosmotic shock and pre-lytic phase of ferroptotic cell death. 270 mOsm hypoosmotic stress on eGFP-Lmnb1 and ALPIN2 labelled U2OS cells was used here as a demonstration example. Specifically, gaussian smooth followed by a custom-built filament-based filter algorithm (Step 2) was applied to the previously selected nuclear middle slice (Extended Data Fig. 6b). The resulting segmentation mask was skeletonized to a 1-pixel thick outline (Step 3). Branch points (pixels with >3 neighbors) were calculated to estimate nuclear envelope invagination (Step 4, branchpoints are indicated by white arrows and red circles). Scale bar, 20 µm. (b) Overview of the ER morphology analysis to quantify the change of ER area and circularity across osmotic and ferroptotic stress. 270 mOsm hypoosmotic stress on eGFP-KDEL and cPla2-mKate2 labelled U2OS cells was presented here as a demonstration example. ER image stack (488 nm channel) first underwent intensity normalization and 3D-gaussian blur (Step 2), followed by thresholded segmentation (Step 3 and 4) via a marker-controlled watershed algorithm (If the ER is tagged with SEC61B, a custom-built filament thresholding algorithm was used in place of marker-controlled watershed algorithm). The slice with the largest total ER area was taken as the middle plane. Since ER network was morphologically complex and overlapped across neighboring cells, it was technologically infeasible to quantify ER morphology for individual cell. Instead(step5), the maximum ER object area and the mean circularity were computed to summarize the ER morphology across the entire FOV and exported for downstream analysis. A, area. Cir, circularity. Scale bar, 20 µm.

The contribution of genetic interactions (epistasis) to human complex trait variation remains poorly understood due, in part, to the statistical and computational challenges involved in testing for interaction effects. Here we introduce FAME (FAst Marginal Epistasis test), a method that can test for marginal epistasis of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on a quantitative trait (whether the effect of an SNP on the trait is modulated by genetic background). FAME is computationally efficient, enabling tests of marginal epistasis on biobank-scale data. Applying FAME to genome-wide association study (GWAS)-significant trait-SNP associations across 53 quantitative traits and ≈300 000 unrelated White British individuals in the UK Biobank (UKBB), we identified 16 significant marginal epistasis signals across 12 traits (\(P < \frac{5\times {10}^{-8}}{53}\)). Leveraging the scalability of FAME, we further localized marginal epistasis signals across chromosomes and estimated the proportion of variance explained by marginal epistasis effects. Our study provides evidence for interactions between individual genetic variants and polygenic background influencing complex traits.

Understanding the role of epistasis is important for elucidating the genetic architecture of complex traits1. Epistasis could potentially explain the missing heritability underlying complex traits2 (although some studies suggest a limited contribution from genetic interactions3,4), why genetic effects differ across ancestral populations5 and the lack of transferability of genetic predictors both within6 and across ancestries7,8. Epistasis has also been hypothesized to play a role in variable expressivity of complex traits9. Nevertheless, our understanding of the role of epistasis in human traits remains limited10.

One class of methods to detect epistasis explicitly searches for pairs of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have a non-linear effect on a trait. Although allowing for an unbiased search for epistasis, exhaustively testing all pairs is computationally difficult and requires a stringent significance threshold to control the false positive rate. Efforts to overcome these difficulties have involved the use of statistical11,12,13 and algorithmic techniques14,15, hardware infrastructure16,17,18 or a biologically informed reduction in the space of SNP pairs tested19,20,21,22,23. An alternate approach to detect epistasis aims to test for the aggregate epistatic effect across SNPs, often using a variance component framework24,25,26. In this framework, models of marginal epistasis25,27 aim to test if the effect of an SNP on a trait is modulated by an individual's polygenic background. Such tests can improve power on account of the reduced multiple testing burden and the aggregation of weak epistatic signals. Even with the potential improvements in power, detecting robust signals of marginal epistasis likely requires application to large sample datasets1,4 that are now becoming available28,29. However, estimating marginal epistasis from biobank-scale data sets is computationally challenging.

To address this challenge, we propose FAst Marginal Epistasis test (FAME), an algorithm that can jointly estimate additive and marginal epistasis variance components that is efficient. The efficiency of FAME enables its application to estimate marginal epistasis at a target SNP paired with genome-wide SNPs across a large number of individuals. We performed extensive simulations to show that FAME provides calibrated tests of marginal epistasis, is robust to model misspecifications and has adequate power to detect true marginal epistasis signals. We applied FAME to test for marginal epistasis at trait-associated genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs for 53 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank (UKBB) (N ≈ 300 000 unrelated White British individuals and M ≈ 500 000 SNPs on the UKBB genotyping array) and attempted to replicate the discovered signals in the All of Us (AoU) dataset. To better characterize our findings, we attempted to partition marginal epistasis signals across chromosomes, estimate the proportion of variance explained by the marginal epistasis effects and interpret these signals using functional genomic data.

We aim to test whether the effect of a target SNP on a phenotype is modulated by the genetic background of the individual by assessing whether the pairwise interactions of the target SNP with each of the remaining SNPs contribute, in aggregate, to variance in the phenotype. In contrast to testing for interactions at a chosen pair of SNPs, testing for marginal epistasis could potentially be more powerful when interaction effects are polygenic; that is, we have a large number of interactions each with a weak effect while also benefiting from the reduced multiple testing burden. To ensure that additive genetic effects are not incorrectly attributed to interactions, we jointly model the additive effects from all genome-wide SNPs (including the target SNP) in addition to the marginal epistasis effects.

FAME uses a variance components model in which phenotypic variance is partitioned into genome-wide additive genetic variance (\({\sigma }_{g}^{2}\)), marginal epistasis variance at a target SNP t (\({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\)) and residual variance (see Fig. 1 for an example and Methods for details). The marginal epistasis variance component \({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) captures the aggregate contribution of all pairwise interactions between the target SNP t and the remaining SNPs in the genome. We would like to test whether the marginal epistasis variance component is significantly different from zero and to be able to estimate its value.

In this example, we have genotypes at four SNPs denoted by x1,x2,x3,x4. We would like to test for marginal epistasis between SNP 3 (the target SNP) and the remaining SNPs. We model the relationship of the phenotype y to the genotypes as arising due to the additive effect of genotypes at each of the four SNPs, the pairwise interaction effects between genotypes at the target SNP (x3) and the remaining SNPs, and environmental noise ε. The additive effect sizes β are drawn from a distribution with variance parameter proportional to \({\sigma }_{g}^{2}\), whereas the marginal epistasis effect sizes α are drawn from a distribution with variance parameter proportional to \({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) where t = 3 and M = 4.

Fitting such a model to biobank-scale data, containing hundreds of thousands of individuals and millions of SNPs, is computationally challenging. Approaches that aim to efficiently compute genome-wide epistatic genomic relationship matrices4 do not scale well with sample size while not directly estimating marginal epistasis. The CORE GREML approach30 explicitly estimates covariance between random effects but does not directly model epistasis. MAPIT25, a previous test for marginal epistasis, does not scale to large samples.

FAME expands on our recent work31,32 to test and estimate marginal epistasis on biobank-scale data. Specifically, FAME utilizes a randomized Method-of-Moments (MoM) estimator that reduces the size of the input genotype and interaction matrices by multiplying each of these matrices with a prespecified number (B) of random vectors (each entry of the random vector being drawn independently from a standard normal distribution). This approach is used to approximate key computations in the MoM estimator (Methods). The accuracy of this estimator depends on B. We show that modest values of B ≈ 100 lead to a method that yields accurate estimates while being highly scalable.

We assessed the false positive rate of FAME on simulated phenotypes with additive genetic effects but no genetic interactions. We simulated phenotypes based on genotypes from unrelated White British individuals in UKBB (N = 291,273 individuals, M = 459,792 SNPs). We set the proportion of trait variation explained by additive genetic effects (additive heritability) \({\sigma }_{g}^{2}\) = 0.25 and varied the proportion of variants that have non-zero additive effects (causal variants) p ∈ {0.01,0.10}.

The key parameter in FAME is the number of random vectors B, which determines its scalability and stability (‘Efficient computation of variance components' in Methods). We use B = 100 in all analyses while exploring the impact of this choice in ‘Robustness of marginal epistasis signals'. We assessed the calibration of FAME when applied to two sets of target SNPs: target SNPs chosen randomly from the UKBB array and SNPs identified based on a GWAS to mirror our analyses of traits in UKBB (‘Application to UK Biobank phenotypes').

Although FAME is calibrated when the target SNPs were selected at random (Supplementary Fig. 1), its P values tend to be inflated when target SNPs were selected from a GWAS (Supplementary Fig. 2). To address this issue, we regressed out additive effects at SNPs that lie within the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block (identified in the 1000 Genomes European population33) around the target SNP and excluded these SNPs when constructing the set of genetic interactions (the Et matrix in Methods). This approach led to calibrated results (Fig. 2a).

a, Calibration of FAME. We applied FAME to simulated phenotypes with additive but no marginal epistasis effects. Phenotypes were simulated using genotypes measured on N = 291,273 unrelated White British individuals in the UK Biobank, with varying ratios of causal SNPs (causal ratio) and additive genetic variance component \({\sigma }_{g}^{2}=0.25\). We first ran GWAS to identify significant SNPs, which were then used as target SNPs in a marginal epistasis test. We find no significant marginal epistasis signals (P < 5 × 10−8) across any of the settings and that the P values are calibrated with genomic inflation factor λgc = 0.958 (0.801,1.06) and 1.053 (0.754,1.427) for causal ratio = 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. Shaded region shows the pointwise 95% confidence interval under the null, with bounds at the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the Beta distribution. b, Power analysis of FAME. We simulated phenotypes by fixing the additive genetic variance component to 0.3 (approximately the median value estimated on real traits) across N = 291,273 unrelated White British individuals in the UKBB-small dataset. We varied the magnitude of the marginal epistasis variance component (\({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\)). We generated 1,000 replicates for each setting. We plot power for detecting marginal epistasis at a P value threshold of 0.05 as well as the genome-wide threshold of 5 × 10−8, with error bars representing the 95% bootstrap CIs from 10 K replicates. c, Accuracy of estimates of the marginal epistasis variance component (\({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\)) in simulations. We used the same simulation as in b. We plot the error in the parameter estimates for each parameter setting. Box plots indicate the median (center line), the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentiles; box), and whiskers extend to the most extreme values within 1.5× the IQR from the quartiles across the 1,000 replicates. d, Runtime analysis of FAME. We computed the runtime of FAME applied to common SNPs on the UKBB whole-genome array data and varying sample size. We report the average across three runs at each setting.

To explore the impact of model misspecification on FAME, we considered scenarios in which (1) the relationship between covariates and phenotype is nonlinear, (2) the genetic architecture includes gene-environment interactions with a hidden environmental variable, and (3) the environmental noise is heavy tailed and (4) heteroskedastic (Supplementary Note 1). Prior work has shown that tests of epistasis can suffer from inflated false positive rates due to imperfect tagging of causal variants34,35,36. This led us to consider scenarios in which genetic variants have large additive effects and, additionally, not all such variants are observed. We simulated this scenario by drawing causal variants from imputed SNPs while we applied FAME to analyze SNPs on the UKBB array (section ‘Datasets' in Methods and Supplementary Note 1). Finally, we considered a scenario where the dependence of additive effect sizes on minor allele frequency (MAF) and LD has a different architecture37 than the one assumed by FAME (Supplementary Note 1). We found that FAME remains calibrated across each of these settings (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6, and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

Because it is of interest to compare the strength of marginal epistasis to marginal GWAS, we also evaluated the calibration of tests of the ratio \(\frac{{\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}}{{\sigma }_{{gwas},t}^{2}}\) both when the additive model is correctly specified (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3) and under each type of model misspecification considered above (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3) to find that FAME produces calibrated P values.

To assess power, we simulated phenotypes with non-zero marginal epistasis variance components with N = 291,273 (section ‘Simulations' of Methods). We observed that FAME has power ≥90% at P < 5 × 10−8 even when the variance explained by marginal epistasis is fairly low (\({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) = 0.005) (Fig. 2b). Further, FAME produced marginal epistasis estimates that were relatively unbiased (Fig. 2c).

FAME can test marginal epistasis on 500 K individuals on a genome-wide dataset containing ≈500 000 SNPs in about 6 h with 32 GB RAM (Fig. 2d). We attempted to benchmark a previously proposed method, MAPIT25 (section ‘Runtime comparisons' of Methods) to find that its runtime grows rapidly even for modest numbers of individuals and SNPs: requiring more than 3 days to run on N = 20 K individuals with M = 10 000 SNPs (Supplementary Fig. 8).

We applied FAME to 53 quantitative traits across N = 291,273 unrelated White British individuals (chosen to have adequate power and minimize population stratification) genotyped at common SNPs on the UKBB array. Our target SNPs were a set of 15,601 LD-pruned SNPs that were found to be associated with each trait in a GWAS (section ‘UKBB GWAS' in Methods). We tested for marginal epistasis at the GWAS significant SNPs in which we also accounted for the additive effect of genome-wide SNPs and included age, sex and the top 20 genetic principal components (PCs) as fixed effect covariates. Our tests yielded 21 significant trait-SNP pairs across 13 traits (\(P < \frac{5\times {10}^{-8}}{53}\) to account for the multiple traits tested; Fig. 3a). To additionally ensure that the additive genetic effects surrounding the target SNP do not impact estimates of marginal epistasis, we applied FAME to each of these 21 trait-SNP pairs after regressing out the additive effects of all of the SNPs in the LD block of the target SNP to observe 16 trait-SNP pairs across 12 traits that retain significant P values for marginal epistasis (\(P < \frac{5\times {10}^{-8}}{53}\); Table 1, additional information, including the marginal effect size of the target SNP, its nearest gene and the corresponding variant type in Table 2).

a, Manhattan plot of marginal epistasis loci across 53 complex traits in UKBB. Colored shapes denote trait-SNP pairs that are significant at \(P < \frac{5\times {10}^{-8}}{53}\); shapes with colored triangles denote loci that are statistically significant in our initial analysis and remained significant after we regressed out all SNPs within the LD block as fixed effects. b, Localization of marginal epistasis signals. For each of 16 trait-SNP pairs, we tested whether the marginal epistasis signals remained significant when testing against all SNPs on the same chromosome as the target SNP (after removing SNPs in the same LD block as the target SNP), which we term local, and against all SNPs on chromosomes different from the chromosome containing the target SNP, which we term distal. We then compared the overlap between the local and distal significant signals (\(P < \frac{5\times {10}^{-8}}{53}\)). c, The fraction of phenotypic variance explained by marginal epistatic effects (\({h}_{{gxg},t}^{2}\)) vs that explained by additive effects tagged by the genome-wide significant SNP t (\({h}_{{\text{gwas}},t}^{2}\)) for each of the 16 marginal epistasis significant trait-SNP pairs. Each dot represents the point estimates. Vertical (horizontal) bars denote the standard error of \({h}_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) (\({h}_{{\text{gwas}},t}^{2}\)). We describe the estimation of \({h}_{{\text{gwas}},t}^{2}\) and its standard error in Supplementary Note 6.

To explore the impact of the randomization underlying FAME, we selected two traits: body mass index (BMI) and serum urate levels (urate) as exemplary traits where FAME did not and did detect an epistatic signal. We experimented with the number of random vectors (B) and found that B = 100 yields consistent results (Pearson correlation of the negative log P values across seeds ρ = 0.99 and = 0.98 for urate and BMI, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 9). We also found that the estimates of significant marginal epistasis signals were concordant across the number of PCs included (varying the number of PCs included from 20 to 40; Supplementary Fig. 10) and across the analysis of imputed SNPs compared to array SNPs (Supplementary Fig. 10; see Supplementary Note 3 for details). Additionally, we applied FAME to a permuted version of the epistatic matrix relative to the target variant to find that none of the SNP-trait pairs are significant (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Table 4). Although phenotype scale can affect our results, traits are inverse rank normalized in all our analyses so that the results of FAME are invariant to monotone transformations (such as the scaling transformation considered here) and the P values remain calibrated, as we confirm in simulations (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 11).

We performed a series of analyses to validate our discoveries and attempted to interpret these signals.

We assessed the robustness of the marginal epistasis signals detected by FAME using an internal and an external replication study. First, we split the UKBB unrelated White British individuals into a discovery and replication cohort of equal size. A GWAS followed by application of FAME to GWAS significant SNPs in the discovery cohort yielded three significant marginal epistasis trait-SNP pairs, all of which replicated (\(P < \frac{0.05}{3}\); Fig. 4a). To validate our marginal epistasis signals in the AoU dataset29, we identified five traits (of the 12 with at least one significant marginal epistasis SNP in UKBB) for which we had sufficiently large sample size of European ancestry (N > 50 000) individuals in AoU. Applying a similar analysis as in UKBB (section ‘Datasets' of Methods), we found that all five of our marginal epistasis signals replicated in AoU (\(P < \frac{0.05}{5}\); Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5).

We report point estimates (and 95% CIs) of \({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) for genome-wide significant marginal epistasis loci (\(P < \frac{5\times {10}^{-8}}{53}\)) discovered in a discovery cohort and their estimates in a replication cohort. a, Our discovery cohort is about one-half of the unrelated White British individuals in UKBB, whereas the replication cohort consists of unrelated White British individuals in UKBB not used in the discovery cohort. b, We use the discovery cohort comprising all unrelated White British individuals in UKBB and the replication cohort comprising individuals of European ancestry in the AoU dataset. The detailed sample size of each trait in AoU is reported in Supplementary Table 5.

Having demonstrated evidence for genome-wide marginal epistasis, we sought to understand where these interactions localize. We extended FAME to test for marginal epistasis of a target SNP with only a subset of SNPs while accounting for the additive effects of genome-wide SNPs. For each target SNP, we tested, in turn, for marginal epistasis paired with other SNPs that fall on the same chromosome (local marginal epistasis; gxglocal) and with SNPs on chromosomes distinct from the chromosome containing the target SNP (distal marginal epistasis; gxgdist). We confirmed that tests of \({\sigma }_{{gxg},{\text{dist}}}^{2}\) and \({\sigma }_{{gxg},{\text{local}}}^{2}\) are well-calibrated in simulations (section ‘Regional simulation and estimation' of Methods; Supplementary Fig. 12). Applying this test to each of the 16 previously identified marginal epistasis loci, we found 5 and 12 loci with significant local and distal marginal epistasis effects, respectively (\(P < \frac{5\times {10}^{-8}}{53}\); Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table 6).

For each of the 16 SNPs, we then ran genome-wide pairwise interaction analysis (GxGWAS) where we tested for the interaction effect of the target SNP on the corresponding trait when paired with remaining SNPs on the UKBB array (after regressing out the same set of covariates as in the marginal epistasis analysis). We found that significant pairwise effects were almost always located on the same chromosome and close to the target SNP (Supplementary Table 7). Of the four trait-SNP pairs demonstrating significant pairwise interaction on the same chromosome, we quantified the distributions of physical distance (Supplementary Fig. 13 (left); mean: 699.3 kb; median: 755.4 kb; min: 5.7 kb; max: 1359.9 kb) and LD (r2) (Supplementary Fig. 13 (right), mean: 0.0019; median: 0.0005; min: 0; max: 0.0176) between the target and interactive SNPs. Overall, these SNP pairs are not highly correlated (r2 < 0.10) suggesting that the marginal epistatic effect is unlikely to be driven by LD. The only significant interaction involving SNPs on distinct chromosomes is found in the case of rs72654473 on lipoA. rs72654473, downstream of the APOE gene on chromosome 19, shows a significant interaction effect with rs6935921, near the LPA gene on chromosome 6, where rs6935921-T allele attenuates the effect of rs72654473 on lipoA (Fig. 5a).

We analyze the relationship between (a) rs6935921 and rs72654473 on lipoprotein A; (b) rs72613567 and rs738409 and (c) rs58542926 and rs738409 on alanine aminotransferase. The error bar represents the 95% confidence interval from 1,000 bootstrap replicates. ivrt, rank-based inverse normal transformation.

We estimated the proportion of trait variance explained by marginal epistasis at a target SNP t (marginal epistasis heritability, \({h}_{{gxg},t}^{2}\)) from the variance components estimated by FAME (Supplementary Note 4). Across the 16 trait-SNP pairs with significant marginal epistasis signal, estimates of \({h}_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) tend to be modest: 10−3 − 10−2. We compared these estimates to the heritability of the SNP based on its GWAS effect size (\({h}_{{\text{gwas}},t}^{2}\) estimated as the square of the GWAS effect size for a standardized genotype). We found that \({h}_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) estimates are larger than the corresponding \({h}_{{\text{gwas}},t}^{2}\) estimates: about 12x larger on average with a range of 0.59 to 43.89 (Fig. 3c and Table 1). Estimates of \({h}_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) are not strongly correlated with the \({h}_{{\text{gwas}},t}^{2}\) estimates (Pearson's correlation coefficient ρ = 0.022).

We performed a series of analyses to better understand the biological relevance of trait-SNP pairs showing significant marginal epistasis. Overlapping the 14 unique SNPs significant for marginal epistasis with sets of eQTLs and pQTLs (section ‘Datasets' of Methods), we found eleven to regulate gene expression or protein levels with ten identified as cis-eQTLs, whereas rs146534110, which harbors a marginal epistasis signal for lipoprotein A, was previously identified as a cis-pQTL (Supplementary Table 8).

Next, we analyzed the GxGWAS results across all 16 trait-SNP pairs (excluding SNPs in the LD block of the target SNP and the MHC region). For each significant trait-SNP pair, we selected the 1,000 SNP pairs with the most significant interaction P values. To assess whether these interacting SNPs have functional relevance, we combined sets of SNPs across all traits and used RegulomeDB38 to test if the interacting SNPs were enriched for functional annotations at the SNP sites (measured as the fraction of sites with rank score ≥ 1 f) relative to a background of GWAS variants pooled across all outcomes (repeated 10,000 times). For each background set, we randomly selected the same number of GWAS SNPs as the former set and computed their RegulomeDB functional importance scores. We observed that the analysis revealed significant functional enrichment for the interactive SNPs (P = 0.033). These results indicate that the SNPs that interact with the marginal epistasis SNPs are significantly enriched for high-ranking regulatory elements.

To test whether the interactive SNPs are enriched for binding of specific transcription factors (TFs), we applied HOMER39 and analyzed a ± 100 bp window around the top 1,000 interactive SNPs for TF motif enrichments. We observed significant enrichment for multiple known (FDR < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 1) and de novo (P < 1 × 10−12) TF binding sites (Supplementary Data 2). Overall, these analyses revealed enrichments especially for TFs with helix-loop-helix domains as well as for GATA and nuclear hormone receptor TFs with zinc finger domains, which are known to be involved in the regulation of metabolic traits40,41,42.

We then attempted to investigate individual marginal epistatic loci for alanine aminotransferase and testosterone (see Supplementary Note 5 for interpretation of loci underlying lipoprotein A and lipids).

We investigated rs3827385, which shows significant marginal epistasis for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lies in the intron of the SAMM50 (Table 2), a gene whose protein product plays an important role in mitochondrial structure and function43 and in fatty acid oxidation44. This variant is located approximately 60 kb from and in moderate linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.36, Lewontin's D′ = 0.67) with a well-studied missense variant (rs738409, p.I148M) in the functionally relevant PNPLA3 gene. Previous studies have established the association of rs738409 with chronic liver disease45,46. Our analysis revealed significant marginal epistasis effects of rs738409 on ALT, with a proportion of variance explained comparable to that of rs3827385 (P = 4.90 × 10−24, \({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) = 14.8 × 10−3). Notably, prior work47 has identified an interaction between rs738409 and a splice variant rs72613567 in HSD17B13 on chromosome 4, affecting liver function as measured by ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Specifically, it has been found that the HSD17B13 rs72613567:TA allele, associated with reduced aminotransferase levels, attenuates the effect of rs738409 on aminotransferase levels and is linked to reduced PNPLA3 mRNA expression. A pairwise epistasis test between rs72613567 and rs738409 for ALT in UKBB data confirmed this interaction is nominally significant (\({\hat{\beta }}_{\text{pairwise}}\) = −2.52×10−2, P = 1.94 × 10−7; Supplementary Table 9 and Fig. 5b). Given the established role of rs738409 in liver function, we next sought to investigate additional potential interactors. We selected rs58542926, a missense variant in the gene TM6SF2, that has been shown to be associated with ALT and liver disease48. We find that the interaction between rs58542926 and rs738409 on ALT is nominally significant with the rs58542926:T allele increasing the effect of rs734809 on ALT levels (\({\hat{\beta }}_{\text{pairwise}}\) = 2.91 × 10−2, P = 3.48 × 10−4; Supplementary Table 9 and Fig. 5c). The proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the two interactive pairs is less than 1% of the variance explained by marginal epistasis at rs738409 (Supplementary Table 9). Taken together, the increased significance of the marginal epistasis analysis using FAME and the finding that the interactive pairs account for a modest fraction of the marginal epistasis signal indicates the effectiveness of testing the aggregated epistasis effect.

Given that testosterone is a highly sex-specific trait, we investigated sex-specificity of marginal epistasis effects of the two testosterone-associated marginal epistasis variants, rs11555142 and rs28990703. We observed differences in marginal epistasis estimates across sexes at both SNPs, with rs11555142 being significant only in females and rs28990703 being significant only in males (Supplementary Fig. 14). Using HaploReg 4.2 (ref. 49), we observed that the SNP rs58964157, which is in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD; R2 = 1.0 in Europeans) with rs11555142, alters the binding of estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) and estrogen receptor α (ESR1), the two critical transcription factors (TFs) for estrogen regulation50,51, consistent with rs11555142 having a significant female-specific marginal epistasis effect. We also identified rs28990703 as a binding site for LEF1, a TF known to regulate androgen signaling and implicated in prostate cancer52. No tight LD proxies were found for rs28990703, with the closest LD proxy of R2 = 0.4 in HaploReg 4.2. Intriguingly, this site also binds ZNF652, a TF linked to prostate cancer and androgen metabolism53, which are both sex specific. These findings suggest that rs28990703 itself may directly contribute to the observed sex differences by interacting with other variants and influencing androgen-related pathways.

We have presented a new method, FAME, that can detect marginal epistasis in biobank-scale data. A significant challenge to robust identification of marginal epistasis (and epistasis more generally) arises due to model violations. In extensive simulations that include non-linear covariates, gene-environment interactions, heavy-tailed environmental noise, and imperfect tagging of causal variants, we show that FAME yields calibrated results. Applying FAME to 53 quantitative phenotypes in the UK Biobank, we found 16 trait SNP pairs with genome-wide significant signals of marginal epistasis. Although the number of signals detected is modest (in part due to the stringent P value threshold employed and the strategy employed to select target SNPs), we observe that the proportion of variance explained by marginal epistasis is comparable to, and sometimes substantially larger than, the proportion of variance explained by GWAS. This observation suggests that polygenic background can substantially modulate the effect of a genetic variant on a trait and has implications for efforts to interpret variant effects, improve phenotype prediction and understand how genetic effects vary across populations5.

We further partitioned the marginal epistasis signal within and across chromosomes to detect both within and cross-chromosomal signals. Although our current application has focused on testing for interactions of a single target SNP paired with SNPs across the genome, the model underlying FAME is flexible. For example, FAME can be extended to test for interactions of a target SNP or covariate (such as polygenic scores) with SNPs defined based on functional annotations such as genes or pathways.

The scalability of FAME arises from its use of the randomized MoM estimator. Likelihood-based methods that maximize the likelihood or restricted likelihood (REML) (using the EM, NR, Fisher or AI algorithms for optimization) could be alternatively employed. When effect sizes and the environmental noise are all normally distributed (leading to a tractable likelihood), REML is more statistically efficient than MoM. Most important to our application, the computational efficiency of randomized MoM enables its application to biobank-scale datasets where, as far as we know, likelihood-based approaches are infeasible. The question of which estimator to use depends on considerations of model assumptions and dataset size. Efficient likelihood-based estimators in epistasis models remain an interesting topic for future research.

Our study has several limitations. First, our approach of regressing out additive effects in the LD block surrounding the target SNP and only testing for interactions outside is important for calibration but likely misses local epistatic signals or signals in regions of long-range linkage disequilibrium54. Additionally, the model underlying FAME assumes that interaction effects are independent of main effects. It would be of interest to extend our method to settings where epistasis is coordinated26,55. Second, the scale on which phenotypes are measured can affect our results. In all our simulations and analyses, traits are inverse rank normalized so that they are invariant to monotone transformations. Although analyzing phenotypes on other scales might lead to more interpretable estimates, the robustness of such analyses needs to be assessed (Supplementary Note 3). Third, we have only applied FAME to quantitative traits. Analyses of binary (disease) traits would require exploring the impact of trait prevalence and ascertainment. Fourth, although we have focused on testing for marginal epistasis at common SNPs, it would be of great interest to apply FAME to rare variants. Fifth, our estimates of marginal epistasis effects are likely to be biased upwards due to winner's curse56 although our replication experiment suggests that the bias is modest. Sixth, we have limited our analysis to GWAS significant SNPs in this study. The ability to estimate marginal epistasis across the genome would allow us to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of epistasis underlying complex traits. Finally, integration of FAME with data from biological pathways and functional genomics will be essential to move towards an understanding of biological epistasis10. Extending the scope, efficiency and generality of FAME present important directions for future work.

Given an N×M standardized genotype matrix X, an N-vector of centered phenotypes y and a target SNP t∈{1, …, M} we aim to jointly test the additive effect of the M SNPs and marginal epistasis of the target SNP using the following model that was originally introduced in25:

Here \({\mathscr{N}}{({\mathbf{\upmu}},{\varSigma})}\) is a multivariate normal distribution with mean μ and covariance matrix Σ, \({E}_{t}\) denotes an N × (M − 1) genetic interaction matrix formed by pairing the target SNP with all other SNPs in the genome, defined formally as \({E}_{t}={X}_{-t}\odot {X}_{:t}\) where \({X}_{:t}\) is the t-th column (corresponding to the target SNP) of X and \({X}_{-t}\) is the matrix consisting of all SNPs except the target SNP formed by excluding the t-th column from X.

In this model, \({\sigma }_{e}^{2},{\sigma }_{g}^{2}\) and \({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) are the residual, additive genetic and marginal epistasis variance components, respectively. β denotes the vector of additive SNP effects and \({{\mathbf{\upalpha }}}_{t}\) denotes the vector of interaction effects between target SNP t and each of the other SNPs in the genome. This model assumes that the interaction effects are independent of the main effects so that epistasis is uncoordinated26.

To estimate the variance components of our LMM, we use a Method-of-Moments (MoM) estimator. As E[y] = 0, we derived the MoM estimates by equating the population covariance to the empirical covariance where the population covariance is given by:\({\varSigma }=\mathrm{Cov}\left({\mathbf{y}}\right)=E\left[{\mathbf{y}}{{\mathbf{y}}}^{T}\right]-E\left[{\mathbf{y}}\right]E\left[{{\mathbf{y}}}^{T}\right]={\sigma }_{g}^{2}\frac{1}{M}{X}{{X}}^{T}+{\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\frac{1}{M-1}{{E}}_{t}{{E}}_{t}^{T}+{\sigma }_{e}^{2}{I}\). Using \({\mathbf{y}}{{\mathbf{y}}}^{T}\) as our estimate of the empirical covariance, we need to solve the following least squares problem to estimate the variance parameters:

where \({{{K}}}_{{1}} =\frac{1}{M}{{X}}{{{X}}}^{T},{{{K}}}_{2,t}=\frac{1}{M-1}{{{E}}}_{t}{{{E}}}_{t}^{T}\mathrm{and}\;{{{K}}}_{{3}}={{{I}}}_{{N}}\).

We show that the MoM estimator satisfies the following normal equations (Lemma 1 in Supplementary Notes):

where T is a 3 × 3 matrix with entries \({T}_{{kl}}={tr}\left({K}_{k}{K}_{l}\right),k,l\in \{\mathrm{1,2,3}\}\), tr() denotes the trace of the matrix, and q is a 3-vector with entries \({\mathbf{q}}_{k}={{\mathbf{y}}}^{T}{K}_{k}{\mathbf{y}}\).

Thus, the MoM estimate of the variance components \({\widetilde{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}^{2}\) =(\({\widetilde{\sigma }}_{g}^{2},{\widetilde{\sigma }}_{{gxg},t}^{2},{\widetilde{\sigma }}_{e}^{2})\) is given by:

To compute standard errors which, in turn, allow us to test the hypothesis of no marginal epistasis (\({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}=0\)), we compute the covariance matrix of \({\widetilde{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}^{2}\) as (Lemma 2 in Supplementary Notes):

where

Computing the MoM estimates and their standard errors requires O(N2 M) runtime and O(N2) memory that render it impractical for biobank-scale data.

To efficiently compute \({\widetilde{{\boldsymbol{\sigma }}}}^{2}\), we note that each of the coefficients of the matrix T involves computing the trace of a matrix which we approximate by a stochastic trace estimator57. Specifically, we estimate \({T}_{{kl}}\) as:

where each \({{\boldsymbol{v}}}_{b}\) is an independent random vector with mean zero and covariance \({I}_{N}\), B is the total number of random vectors used for the approximation, and Zk = X or \({E}_{t}\). Each term \({Z}_{k}{Z}_{k}^{T}{{\mathbf{v}}}_{b}\) can be computed in \(O(\frac{{NM}}{\max ({\log }_{3}N,{\log }_{3}M)}\)) by using the Mailman algorithm58 so that \({\hat{T}}_{{kl}}\) can be computed in \(O(\frac{{NMB}}{\max ({\log }_{3}N,{\log }_{3}M)}\)) time.

We note that \({\hat{T}}_{{kl}}\) is an unbiased estimator of \({T}_{{kl}}\) provided \({{\mathbf{v}}}_{b}\) has zero mean and identity covariance matrix. The distribution of \({{\mathbf{v}}}_{b}\) can impact the variance of the estimator. In practice, we draw each entry of \({{\mathbf{v}}}_{b}\) independently from a standard normal distribution. The variance of \({\hat{T}}_{{kl}}\) decreases with the increasing number of random vectors (\(B\)). Empirically, we observed that utilizing 100 random vectors yields a sufficiently accurate estimator (Supplementary Fig. 9).

To estimate \({\rm{Cov}}\left[{\mathbf{q}}\right]\) efficiently, we use a plug-in estimate of \({\boldsymbol{\Sigma }}\) to obtain:

where \({{\mathbf{w}}}_{k}={{K}}_{k}{\mathbf{y}},k\in \{1,\mathrm{2,3}\}\).

\(\widehat{\mathrm{Cov}[{\mathbf{q}}{]}_{kl}}\) can be efficiently computed by writing \({{\mathbf{w}}}_{k}={{K}}_{k}{\mathbf{y}}\) as \({Z}_{k}{Z}_{k}^{T}{\mathbf{y}}\) which can be efficiently computed. Further, FAME uses a streaming implementation that does not require all the genotypes to be stored in memory leading to scalable memory requirements. FAME can also account for fixed-effects covariates such as age, sex and genetic PCs (Supplementary Note 7).

We allow for negative variance component estimates that we exclude from the analysis, unless specified otherwise. The corresponding P value is computed using a two-sided test.

We designed simulations to assess the power of FAME and the accuracy of its marginal epistasis variance components estimates using the following generative model:

Here \({\beta }_{j}\) and \({\alpha }_{t,\,j}\) denotes the j-th element in the respective vectors of effect sizes. We set \({\sigma }_{g}^{2}\) to 0.3, which is approximately the median value of the additive heritability across all the traits that we analyzed in this study. We varied the value of \({\sigma }_{{gxg},t}^{2}\) from 0.001 to 0.1. We randomly selected 10% of the SNPs to be causal for the additive effects (assigned to the indicator set \({M}_{a}\)) and 10% of the SNPs to be causal for the marginal epistasis effect (assigned to the indicator set Me, which do not overlap with Ma and fall outside the LD block of the target SNP). As target SNP, we selected three representative SNPs with a range of MAF (∈{1%,14%, 49%}, respectively). For computational convenience, we used genotypes in the UKBB-small dataset (section ‘Datasets' of Methods). We simulated 1,000 replicates for each setting.

To assess the accuracy of the marginal epistasis variance component estimates obtained by FAME, we used the same simulations as above. We then assumed that the target SNPs are known and then estimated the marginal epistasis effect by partitioning the SNPs in X into two bins; the first contains all the SNPs within the same LD block as the target SNP, whereas the second contains all SNPs outside of the block. We used FAME to jointly fit the additive effect for both regions while only fitting the marginal epistasis effect on the second region.

To localize the marginal epistasis signal, we partitioned the whole genome into the region with all the SNPs lying in the same chromosome as the target SNP but outside of the LD block (termed local) and all the SNPs lying on chromosomes different from the one with the target SNP (termed distal). To validate the calibration of FAME when applied to test the marginal epistasis effect on a specified region, we used the simulation with a total heritability of 0.25 and ratio of causal SNPs of 1%. We applied FAME to estimate the calibration of \({\sigma }_{{gxg},{\text{local}}}^{2}\) and \({\sigma }_{{gxg},{\text{distal}}}^{2}\), respectively.

All experiments used a machine equipped with AMD EPYC 7501 32-Core Processor, and a runtime budget of 3 days was provided to all tested methods.

We obtained a set of N = 291,273 unrelated White British individuals measured at M = 459,792 common SNPs genotyped on the UK Biobank Axiom array to use in simulations by extracting individuals that are more distantly related than third-degree relatives and excluding individuals with putative sex chromosome aneuploidy. Unless otherwise specified, all simulations were conducted using this dataset.

We used a subset of the UKBB array genotypes obtained by restricting to SNPs on chromosomes 12 and 20 across 291,273 unrelated White British individuals. We excluded SNPs with MAF less than 1% resulting in a final set of 32,708 SNPs. We term this dataset ‘UKBB-small'. For simulations that involve missing SNPs, we constructed imputed genotypes by restricting to SNPs on chromosomes 12 and 20 named ‘UKBB-small-imputed'.

For analysis of real traits, we restricted our analysis to SNPs that were present in the UK Biobank Axiom array used to genotype the UK Biobank. SNPs with greater than 1% missingness and minor allele frequency smaller than 1% were removed. Moreover, SNPs that fail the Hardy–Weinberg test at significance threshold 10−7 were removed. We restricted our study to self-reported British White ancestry individuals who are more than third-degree relatives, defined as pairs of individuals with kinship coefficient <1/2(9/2) (ref. 28). Furthermore, we removed individuals who are outliers for genotype heterozygosity and/or missingness and excluded SNPs that fall within the MHC region. Finally, we obtained a set of N = 291,273 individuals and M = 454,207 SNPs for real data analyses. We used this dataset in our analyses unless specified otherwise.

We also analyzed imputed genotypes across N = 291,273 unrelated White British individuals. We removed SNPs with greater than 1% missingness, minor allele frequency smaller than 1%, SNPs that fail the Hardy–Weinberg test at significance threshold 10−7 as well as SNPs that lie within the MHC region (Chr6:25–35 Mb) to obtain 4,824,392 SNPs.

We selected 53 quantitative traits in UKBB (Supplementary Table 10). These traits were chosen because they have been analyzed in prior work, by us and others, to estimate aspects of genetic architecture59,60 and span a diverse set of phenotypic categories: Anthropometry, Blood Biochemistry, Bone, Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Eye, Liver, and Renal. We included sex, age and the top 20 genetic PCs as covariates in our analysis for all phenotypes. Extra covariates were added for diastolic/systolic blood pressure (adjusted for cholesterol-lowering medication, blood pressure medication, insulin, hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives). We used the PCs computed in the UKBB from a superset of 488,295 individuals. Following prior studies, all traits were inverse rank normalized60.

We ran GWAS on each of the 53 traits, including covariates as described above. For each trait, we selected SNPs with P < 5 × 10−8 followed by LD pruning (using a window size of 500 SNPs, we computed r2 between each pair and removed one of them if r2 > 0.1, shifting the window by 1 SNP, and repeating the process).

We curated the AoU genotype dataset starting from the AoU srWGS dataset and identifying the subset of SNPs that matched the UKBB SNP set resulting in 457,218/459,792 (99.4%) SNPs. We restricted our analyses to individuals whose European ancestry component of genetically inferred ancestry (GIA) > 95%. We then applied a genotype QC procedure with the same parameters used for the UKBB yielding 392,756 SNPs. For each trait, when multiple measurements were available, we selected the earliest measurement and adjusted the age covariate accordingly for that individual. Individuals whose adjusted age was <18 years were excluded from the analysis. For the 12 traits that showed evidence for genome-wide marginal epistasis signals, we found five with >50 000 individuals with European ancestry. We used the top five PCs, age and sex as covariates following the recommendations of the AoU investigators29.

We analyzed associations that were discovered in the following three datasets:

Võsa et al. identified cis-eQTLs (SNP-gene distance<1 Mb, FDR < 0.05) for 16,987 genes and trans-eQTLs (SNP-gene distance>5 Mb, FDR < 0.05) for 6,298 genes in 31,684 blood samples61. For trans-eQTL analyses, this study focused on 10,317 trait-associated SNPs from GWAS.

Yao et al. measured the levels of 71 plasma proteins that are known to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 6,861 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants. We analyzed the 16,602 protein QTL (pQTL) variants associated with 57 proteins identified in this study62. This set included 11,806 cis-pQTL variants (P < 1.25 ×10−7) for 40 proteins and 4,796 trans-pQTL variants (P < 7.04 ×10−10) for 44 proteins.

Ferkingstad et al. measured the levels of 4,907 plasma proteins in 35,559 Icelandic individuals. We analyzed the 18,084 sentinel pQTL associations (defined as the most significant association detected within a 1 Mb region surrounding the gene encoding the protein) associated with 4,631 proteins identified in this study (P < 1.8×10−9 corresponding to an FDR of 1.3%; ref. 63). Of the sentinel pQTL associations, 1,881 were cis whereas 16,203 were trans.

OpenAI has allegedly become more guarded about publishing research that highlights the potentially negative impact that AI could have on the economy, four people familiar with the matter tell WIRED.

The perceived pullback has contributed to the departure of at least two employees on OpenAI's economic research team in recent months, according to the same four people, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity.

One of these employees, Tom Cunningham, left the company entirely in September after concluding it had become difficult to publish high-quality research, WIRED has learned. In a parting message shared internally, Cunningham wrote that the team faced a growing tension between conducting rigorous analysis and functioning as a de facto advocacy arm for OpenAI, according to sources familiar with the situation.

Cunningham declined WIRED's request for comment.

OpenAI chief strategy officer Jason Kwon addressed these concerns in an internal memo following Cunningham's departure. In a copy of the message obtained by WIRED, Kwon argued that OpenAI must act as a responsible leader in the AI sector and should not only raise problems with the technology, but also “build the solutions.”

“My POV on hard subjects is not that we shouldn't talk about them,” Kwon said on Slack. “Rather, because we are not just a research institution, but also an actor in the world (the leading actor in fact) that puts the subject of inquiry (AI) into the world, we are expected to take agency for the outcomes.”

In a statement to WIRED, OpenAI spokesperson Rob Friedlander said the company hired its first chief economist, Aaron Chatterji, last year and has since expanded the scope of its economic research.

“The economic research team conducts rigorous analysis that helps OpenAI, policymakers, and the public understand how people are using AI and how it is shaping the broader economy, including where benefits are emerging and where societal impacts or disruptions may arise as the technology evolves,” Friedlander said.

The alleged shift comes as OpenAI deepens its multibillion-dollar partnerships with corporations and governments, cementing itself as a central player in the global economy. Experts believe the technology OpenAI is developing could transform how people work, although there are still large questions about when this change will happen and to what extent it will impact people and global markets.

Since 2016, OpenAI has regularly released research on how its own systems could reshape labor and shared data with outside economists. In 2023 it copublished “GPTs Are GPTs,” a widely cited paper investigating which sectors were likely going to be most vulnerable to automation. Over the past year, however, two sources say the company has become more reluctant to release work that highlights the economic downsides of AI—such as job displacement—and has favored publishing positive findings.

An outside economist who previously worked with the company alleges that OpenAI is increasingly publishing work that casts its technology in a favorable light. The economist spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Earlier this week, OpenAI published a report in which it surveyed enterprise users who claim that the company's AI products have saved them an average of 40 to 60 minutes of time a day, and that companies throughout the economy have “significant headroom” to increase their AI adoption.

This isn't the first time OpenAI researchers have raised concerns questioning what the company does and doesn't publish. When former head of policy research Miles Brundage left OpenAI in October of 2024, he said the company had become so high-profile that it was “hard for me to publish on all the topics that are important to me.” He added that while some constraints are expected, he felt that OpenAI had become too restrictive.

Sharing gloomy statistics about AI's potential impact on the economy could complicate OpenAI's fragile public image. While the Trump administration has championed AI's potential, White House advisers have pushed back on claims that the technology will eliminate jobs, which has become an increasingly urgent issue for many Americans. Roughly 44 percent of young people in the US fear that AI will reduce job opportunities, according to a November survey from the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.

While companies often highlight research that benefits them, today's leading AI labs are given an unusual level of authority to self-report the risks and capabilities of the technology they're racing to deploy. Silicon Valley leaders have mounted $100 million lobbying campaigns to keep it this way, fighting against proposed state-level AI regulations that could constrain the industry.

OpenAI's allegedly cautious posture stands in contrast to its rival Anthropic. The startup's CEO, Dario Amodei, has repeatedly warned that AI could automate up to half of entry-level white-collar jobs by 2030, framing the predictions as necessary to spur public debate about changes to the workforce. The Trump administration has sharply criticized those warnings. David Sacks, the White House special adviser for AI and crypto, accused Anthropic of running a “sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.”

OpenAI's economic research efforts are currently managed by Chatterji, who led a significant September report on how people around the world are using ChatGPT. Cunningham is listed as an author on this report. It was released months after Anthropic published a similar paper on how people use its chatbot, Claude.

Sources tell WIRED that Chatterji reports to OpenAI's chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, reflecting how the team is tightly integrated with the company's political and policy strategy. Lehane previously worked at Airbnb, where he helped the company defeat Prop F, a ballot measure in San Francisco that would have severely restricted the company's ability to operate. He also served as the special assistant counsel to former President Bill Clinton, where he earned a reputation as the “master of disaster.”

As AI moves beyond chatbots and toward systems that can take actions, the Linux Foundation is launching a new group dedicated to keeping AI agents from splintering into a mess of incompatible, locked-down products. 

The group, dubbed the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), will act as a neutral home for open source projects related to AI agents. Anchoring the AAIF at launch are donations from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI. 

Anthropic is donating its MCP (Model Context Protocol), a standard way to connect models and agents to tools and data; Block is contributing Goose, its open source agent framework; and OpenAI is bringing AGENTS.md to the table, its simple instruction file developers can add to a repository to tell AI coding tools how to behave. You can think of these tools as the basic plumbing of the agent era. 

Other members in the AAIF include AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, and Google, signaling an industry-level push for shared guardrails so that AI agents can be trustworthy at scale.

In OpenAI engineer Nick Cooper's view, protocols are essentially a shared language that lets different agents and systems work together without every developer reinventing integrations from scratch. 

“We need multiple [protocols] to negotiate, communicate, and work together to deliver value for people, and that sort of openness and communication is why it's not ever going to be one provider, one host, one company,” Cooper told TechCrunch. 

Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, put it more bluntly in conversations around the launch: The goal is to avoid a future of “closed wall” proprietary stacks, where tool connections, agent behavior, and orchestration are locked behind a handful of platforms.

“By bringing these projects together under the AAIF, we are now able to coordinate interoperability, safety patterns, and best practices specifically for AI agents,” Zemlin said. 

Block — the fintech company behind Square and Cash App — isn't known for AI infrastructure, but it's making an openness play with Goose. AI tech lead Brad Axen frames it as proof that open alternatives can match proprietary agents at scale, with thousands of engineers using it weekly for coding, data analysis, and documentation.

Open sourcing Goose serves a dual purpose for Block. 

“Getting it out into the world gives us a place for other people to come help us make it better,” Axen told TechCrunch. “We have a lot of contributors from open source, and everything they do to improve it comes back to our company.” 

Meanwhile, donating Goose to the Linux Foundation gives Block access to community stress tests while positioning it as a working example of AAIF's vision — an agent framework designed to plug into shared building blocks like MCP and AGENTS.md.

Anthropic is making a similar move at the protocol layer, handing MCP to the Linux Foundation. The goal: make MCP the neutral infrastructure connecting AI models to tools, data, and applications without endless one-off adapters.

“The main goal is to have enough adoption in the world that it's the de facto standard,” MCP co-creator David Soria Parra told TechCrunch. “We're all better off if we have an open integration center where you can build something once as a developer and use it across any client.”

Donating MCP to AAIF signals that the protocol won't be controlled by a single vendor.

That governance point is central to why the Linux Foundation created a new umbrella at all. The organization already hosts major AI and developer infrastructure projects — everything from PyTorch and Ray to Kubernetes — but says AAIF is specifically aimed at agent standards and orchestration, including shared safety patterns and interoperability.

AAIF's structure is funded through a “directed fund,” meaning companies can contribute money through membership dues. But Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues that funding doesn't equal control: Project roadmaps are set by technical steering committees, and no single member gets unilateral say over direction.

Still, the big question is whether AAIF becomes real infrastructure or just another industry logo alliance. 

“An early indicator of success, in addition to adoption of these standards, would be the development and implementation of shared standards being used by vendor agents around the world,” Zemlin said. 

For OpenAI's Cooper, success would look like an evolution of standards: “I don't want it to be a stagnant thing. I don't want these protocols to be part of this foundation, and that's where they sat for two years. They should evolve and continually accept further input.”

There's also a more subtle consequence: Even with open governance, one company's implementation could become the default simply because it ships fastest or gains the most usage. Zemlin says that's not necessarily a bad thing, though. He points to open source history — like Kubernetes “winning” the container race — as evidence that “dominance emerges from merit and not vendor control.”

For developers and enterprises, the short-term appeal is clear: less time building custom connectors, more predictable agent behavior across codebases, and simpler deployment in security-conscious environments. The larger vision is more ambitious: If tools like MCP, AGENTS.md, and Goose become standard infrastructure, the agent landscape could shift from closed platforms to an open, mix-and-match software world reminiscent of the interoperable systems that built the modern web.

OpenAI, Anthropic, and Block have cofounded a new open source organization—the Agentic AI Foundation—to promote standards for artificial intelligence agents.

The three companies are also transferring ownership of some widely used agentic technologies over to the foundation. This includes Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows agents to connect and interact; OpenAI's Agents.md, which lets programs and websites specify rules for coding agents; and Goose, a framework for building agents developed by Block. These technologies were already free to use, but through the new foundation it will be possible for others to contribute to their development.

“MCP is used by many companies, but there are others [who don't use it],” says Nick Cooper, who leads work on the protocol at OpenAI. Cooper says that making MCP an open standard should encourage developers and companies to embrace it and build systems that integrate agentic AI. “That open interoperability—that open standard—really means that companies can talk across providers, and across agentic systems.”

The Agentic AI Foundation is being created under the Linux Foundation, which oversees development of the widely used open source Linux operating system as well as other projects. The foundation provides legal and technological support for the creation of open source foundations. Other companies who have signed on to the AAIF, beyond the three founding members, include Google, Microsoft, AWS, Bloomberg, and Cloudflare.

The new foundation reflects a nascent shift from chat-based AI systems to greater use of programs that take actions on behalf of users. This kind of agentic AI promises a potentially lucrative new paradigm in which AI agents use the web and negotiate with one another to power all sorts of applications. Consumers may, for example, use AI assistants to buy and book things, while businesses use AI agents to manage transactions and customer interactions.

Srinivas Narayanan, chief technology officer of B2B applications at OpenAI, envisions a time when large numbers of AI agents routinely communicate with one another in the course of business. The AI industry working across the same open standards should help ensure that those interactions happen seamlessly. “Open source is going to play a very big role in how AI is shaped and adopted in the real world,” Narayanan says.

The question of openness seems crucial to AI right now. US companies mostly make money by offering access to powerful closed models through application programming interfaces, or APIs. Meta previously released the weights for its best model, Llama, so that anyone could download and run it, although the company has recently signaled a shift to a more closed approach. A number of Chinese AI companies, including DeepSeek, Alibaba, Moonshot AI, and Z.ai, provide strong open source models that have become popular with developers, startups, and AI researchers. Some worry that this picture could give Chinese firms a big strategic advantage over time.

OpenAI also has a number of open source efforts, including a model called gpt-oss and Codex CLI, software for the command line interface for its models.

Just as open standards helped the web flourish, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Block believe that openness will remove barriers to the deployment of agentic AI across the economy. Although there is nothing in the standards requiring people to use foundation models from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Block, they believe that openness should ultimately benefit their businesses.

Manik Surtani, head of open source at Block, says the company's Goose agent, which taps into a wide range of LLMs to perform actions on a computer, has soared in popularity over the past year. Donating Goose to the new AAIF makes it easier for anyone to contribute back to the code base and build on top of it, he says.

“MCP, Agents.md, and Goose have become essential tools for developers building this new class of agentic technologies," said Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, in a statement. "Bringing these projects together under the AAIF ensures they can grow with the transparency and stability that only open governance provides. The Linux Foundation is proud to serve as the neutral home where they will continue to build AI.”

Open standards may be technologically neutral, but if these agentic tools become globally dominant they could confer the US companies behind them considerable influence. Just as the standards managed by ICANN and WC3 have shaped the evolution of the web, the new foundation could perhaps help the US determine how AI gets used on a daily basis worldwide.

Microsoft is pouring $17.5 billion into India — its largest investment in Asia — to boost the country's AI infrastructure and diffusion, the company announced Tuesday.

The funding, planned over four years between 2026 and 2029, comes after an earlier $3 billion commitment announced earlier this year.

Microsoft's aim is to help advance India's cloud and AI infrastructure, skilling and ongoing operations. The tech giant said the partnership will help India make the leap from “digital public infrastructure to AI public infrastructure in the coming decade,” toward “a future that is more equitable and uniquely Indian in its scale and impact.”

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is in the country this month as part of a multi-city “India AI” tour. He met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Tuesday and will deliver a keynote address on Wednesday: “Leading in the New Age of AI.”

The investment will target three primary areas:

Microsoft also announced that 310 million informal workers India will benefit from advanced AI capabilities being integrated into two key digital public platforms of the Ministry of Labour and Employment — e-Shram and the National Career Service.

Microsoft employs 22,000 people across Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, Noida and other cities, representing numerous company business lines.

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Microsoft President Brad Smith announced new commitments to Canada, adding $5.4 billion over the next two years to its continued investment in building out digital and AI infrastructure in the country.

Smith highlighted many of the same goals the company outlined for India, including boosting skills training and digital sovereignty in Canada.

iFixit, the internet's go-to for repair guides and spare parts, just launched a new mobile app with what sounds like a genuinely useful AI chatbot.

Starting today, iOS and Android users can download the iFixit app and chat directly with the new FixBot to get curated expert advice on how to fix everything from a cracked phone screen to a faulty dishwasher.

The team at iFixit says it spent two years building the chatbot, which utilizes a combination of AI models for its language, voice, and vision capabilities. What makes FixBot stand out from a general chatbot like ChatGPT or Gemini is its laser focus on repairs. FixBot won't answer questions that are not about fixing things, and it's trained on iFixit's 125,000 repair guides, community forums, and a huge repository of PDF manuals.

To use the bot, users can type or vocally explain their issue to the bot, or they can even just snap a photo of whatever needs fixing. FixBot will try to identify the device and model, then ask follow-up questions until it figures out the problem. The bot will then walk users through a step-by-step repair, pulling answers from the iFixIt library, even if that means surfacing something buried on page 500 of a PDF manual. It will also provide links to buy the spare parts you need. Along the way, users can ask FixBot questions. Its voice command features are also designed to help anyone who's elbow-deep in a repair and can't reach their phone.

iFixit acknowledges there are limitations. Sometimes, like any AI chatbot, FixBot can get things wrong. And iFixit doesn't have a guide for every device, appliance, or car on Earth. In those cases, FixBot will do what it can with manufacturer docs, targeted web searches, and guides from similar models. 

It's probably best to think of the app as a guy you know who is particularly handy around the house, rather than a full-blown expert.

The app also comes loaded with other new tools, including iFixIt's entire library of guides optimized for mobile, a workbench to track your repair projects, and a toolkit to help users maintain their smartphones. This smartphone toolkit is equipped with a battery lifespan predictor that alerts users when they should change their phone's battery. 

This isn't iFixIt's first mobile app. It originally launched an app in 2011, but Apple pulled it in 2015 after iFixit disassembled an Apple TV and Siri Remote, apparently violating Apple's developer rules.

The new app and all its features are currently available for free for a limited time, but a paid tier is in the works.

From the iconic Colosseum in Rome to Hadrian's Wall all the way in England, there's one question most people must ask themselves when gazing upon the enduring traces of one of the most beloved ancient civilizations: How the heck has it lasted so long?

In Pompeii, researchers have investigated building materials in partially constructed rooms that shed light on this very question by providing insight into ancient Roman cement. A study published today in Nature Communications provides further evidence that they used “hot mixing”—mixing quicklime (dry, heated limestone) with volcanic rocks, volcanic ash, and water, triggering a chemical reaction that produces heat.

In 2023 Admir Masic, a physical chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and colleagues published a paper describing how ancient Romans created such long-lasting cement, deducing the process of hot mixing from the cement's chemical composition. As the hot mixture solidifies, it locks highly reactive lime into small gravel-like components. When the concrete cracks, these components, called lime clasts, dissolve again and fill in the cracks, essentially healing the damage.

However, their study used samples from a wall that might not be representative of other concrete structures throughout the Roman Empire. What's more, it challenged the process described by the famous ancient Roman architect Vitruvius, who in the first century BCE authored “De architectura,” the first known book on architectural theory. Vitruvius wrote that Romans mixed water into lime to produce a paste-like material before adding other ingredients.

The recently discovered Pompeiian site consists of rooms under active construction, abandoned because of Mount Vesuvius' activity in 79 CE—presumably when the volcano caused the most infamous tragedy in antiquity. The site preserved features including containers of concrete construction materials, raw material piles, and tools still sitting where they'd been left behind by workers almost 2,000 years ago.

“I expected to see Roman workers walking between the piles with their tools,” Masic admitted. “It was so vivid, you felt like you were transported in time. So yes, I got emotional looking at a pile of dirt. The archaeologists made some jokes.”

Masic and his colleagues studied samples from the pre-mixed dry material piles, a partially built wall, finished buttress and structural walls, and mortar fixes in a pre-existing wall. The concrete samples had the lime casts previously mentioned in Masic's 2023 study, and a premixed dry raw material pile included intact quicklime fragments, an important early step in the creation process of hot-mixed concrete. They also identified volcanic ash and aggregates—in construction, they are mixed with cement or other materials to create concrete or mortar—further bolstering the hot mixing theory.

“We were blessed to be able to open this time capsule of a construction site and find piles of material ready to be used for the wall,” Masic said. “With this paper, we wanted to clearly define a technology and associate it with the Roman period in the year 79 C.E.”

The team's analysis allowed them to differentiate hot-mixed lime from the slaked lime (heated limestone combined with water) Vitruvius had reported, he added. “These results revealed that the Romans prepared their binding material by taking calcined limestone (quicklime), grinding them to a certain size, mixing it dry with volcanic ash, and then eventually adding water to create a cementing matrix.” Romans in Pompeii in 79 CE, anyway.

The team also discovered weights and measurement tools, which they propose may have been used to maintain concrete pouring ratios and build straight, even walls. Furthermore, they found that the volcanic ash material mixed with the lime had a notably diverse range of reactive minerals that further contributed to the mixture's long-term self-healing property. In short, the site revealed the clearest evidence yet of the ancient Roman use of hot-mixing in concrete, though direct archaeological evidence for its use is still missing.

According to the team, the study could inform the creation of more durable and sustainable concrete. “This is relevant because Roman cement is durable, it heals itself, and it's a dynamic system,” Masic says. “The way these pores in volcanic ingredients can be filled through recrystallization is a dream process we want to translate into our modern materials. We want materials that regenerate themselves.” In fact, Masic started a company that uses the wisdom from ancient Roman concrete to create durable modern concretes.

It seems like Vitruvius won't have reason to turn in his grave. Plus, Masic thinks the ancient architect might have been misunderstood, highlighting that he also references latent heat during the mixing process. So maybe Vitruvius was writing about hot-mixing the entire time.

Casera, a new healthcare technology startup in Seattle, is spinning out of Pioneer Square Labs with a unique approach to hospital operations: using “agentic AI” to automate the work of case managers and speed up patient flow.

The company is tackling a thorny problem in healthcare: unnecessary length of stay driven by operational friction. Delays in communication, payer authorization and discharge planning can add time to a patient's stay — and thousands of dollars in expenses for hospitals each day, according to Casera.

The company's software is built for case managers, who coordinate the operational steps required to move patients safely through the system.

Casera describes its product as a “Case Manager Digital Agent” that operates inside communication channels, watching for context and then triggering next steps — for example, following up on a pending prior authorization or making sure all tasks for a complex discharge have owners and due dates.

Casera's system plugs into existing collaboration and communication tools, and helps identify “what needs to happen, who needs to be involved, and helps ensure it gets done,” according to CEO Neeraj Singh Bhavani, who previously started patient-flow startup Tagnos (acquired by Sonitor).

Bhavani sees the company's main competition in vendors that have traditionally focused on patient flow and hospital capacity management, including Qventus, LeanTaaS and TeleTracking. But he said Casera is attacking a different layer of the problem by focusing on “getting things done versus telling what to do.”

“Not trying to be another legacy dashboard and analytics player,” he told GeekWire. 

Casera is working with a design partners across major health systems in three states. It has not generated revenue.

Casera's other co-founder is CTO Alex Levin, who previously started revenue intelligence company MD Clarity (acquired by private equity). A third early leader, Jhayne Pana, was previously an assistant nurse manager with MultiCare Health.

The company has raised $1 million from PSL and has less than ten employees. PSL previously spun out Kevala, a healthcare staffing software company that was acquired earlier this year.

“Tackling patient flow with automation is a massive opportunity, and a very good use case for multiple agentic applications,” T.A. McCann, managing director at Pioneer Square Labs, said in a statement. “It's an area we know well and in addition to the clear market need, the opportunity to work with two, recently-exited founders was a huge bonus.”

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

I wish they did but they don't. They have been for decade so stingy on RAM for iPhone and iPad. There are at current point that only small percent of their userbase have iPhone or iPad with 8GB RAM that somehow can run any AI models even open source and be of any use. Not mentioning they don't compare to big Models.They don't even provide option to sell iPhone with bigger RAM. iPad can have max 16GB RAM. Those mainstream macbook air also can have max 32 GB RAM.And for the current price of cheap online AI where e.g. perplexity provides so many promo for PRO version for like less $10 per year and all ai providers give good free models with enough rate limit for many users I don't see apple hardware like particularly bought because of AI compute-chips - at least not non-pro users.If the loose AI though and because of that won't have good AI integrations they will loose also eventually in hardware. e.g. Polish language in Siri still not supported so my mum cannot use it. OSS Whisper v3 turbo was available ages ago but apple still support only few languages. 3rd party keyboard cannot integrate so well with audio input and all sux in this case because platform limitation.

They roll out hardware to consumers they can use for AI once their service is ready, with users paying for that rollout until then.Meanwhile they have started to deploy a marketplace ecosystem for AI tasks on iOS, where Apple has the first right-to-refuse, allowing the user to select a (revenue-share-vetted) 3rd party provider to complete the task.So until Apple is ready, the user can select OpenAI (or soon other providers) to fulfill an AI-task, and Apple will collect metrics on the demand of each type of task.This will help them prioritize for development of own models, to finally make use of their own marketplace rules to direct the business away from third parties to themselves.My guess is that they will offer a mixed on-device/cloud AI-service that will use the end-users hardware where possible, offloading compute from their clouds to the end-users hardware and energy-bill, with a "cheap" subscription price undercutting others on that AI-marketplace.

But for this to make economic sense, the "AI-bubble" may need to burst first, forcing the competitors to actually provide their services for-profit.Until then it might be more profitable to just forward AI-tasks to OpenAI and others and let them burn more money.

Historically the strength of Apple was that they didn't ship things until they actually worked. Meaning that the technology was there and ready to make an experience that was truly excellent.People have been complaining for years that Apple isn't shipping fast enough in this area. But if anything I think that they have been shipping (or trying to ship) too fast. There are a lot of scenarios that AI is actually great at but the ones that move the needle for Apple just aren't there yet in terms of quality.The stuff that is at a scale that it matters to them are integrations that just magically do what you want with iMessage/calendars/photos/etc. There are potentially interesting scenarios there but the fact is that any time you touch my intimate personal (and work) data and do something meaningful I want it to work pretty much all the time. And current models aren't really there yet in my view. There are lots of scenarios that do work incredibly well right now (coding most obviously). But I don't think the Apple mainline ones do yet.

Tell that to almost anything they've shipped in the last 5-10 years. It's gotten so bad that I wait halfway through entire major OS version before upgrading. Every new thing they ship is almost guaranteed to be broken in some way, ranging from minor annoyance to fully unusable.I buy Apple-everything, but I sure wish there were better options.

A few months ago, MCP-style tool calling seemed like the clear standard. Now even Anthropic is shifting toward "code-mode" and reusable skills.For Apple, reliable tool calling is critical because their AI needs to control apps and the whole device. My bet: Apple's AI will be able to create its own Shortcuts on the fly and call them as needed, with OSA Script support on Mac.

But admittedly, most of those people are established adults who've figured out an effective rhythm to their home and work life and aren't longing for some magic remedy or disruption. They're not necessarily weary, and they were curious at first, but it seems like they're mostly just waiting for either the buzz to burn off or for some "it just works" product to finally emerge.I imagine there are younger people wowed by the apparent magic of what we have now and excited that they might use it punch up the homework assignments or emails or texts that make them anxious, or that might enjoy toying with it as a novel tool for entertainment and creative idling.

Microsoft has been criticized for investing in AI heavily. But it actually makes sense for Microsoft if you consider the nature of their business. The problem is not with the investment per se but with what they got out of it. Unfortunately, Microsoft sucks at product management, so instead of creating useful stuff that users want and are ready to pay for, they created stuff that no one understands, no one can use, and no one wants to pay for. Github copilot is an exception of course. I'm talking more about their Office 365 AI.

Let everyone else pay for the research and make the mistakes, find out what works and what doesn't. Apple already has the consumers, they might as well save a few (hundred?) bn in the process and later deploy something which doesn't tell you to glue your cheese to your pizza.

When in reality, they _wanted_ to but have become so dysfunctional organization wise, they weren't able to. Kind of funny how that worked out.I still think they're really dropping the ball. They could have local models running on devices, interfacing with a big cloud partner (Google, OpenAI, etc.) Make Siri awesome. But no.

See Gemini Nano. It is available in custom apps, but the results are so bad; factual errors and hallucinations make it useless. I can see why Google did not roll it out to users.Even if it was significantly better, inference is still slow. Adding a few milliseconds of network latency for contacting a server and getting a vastly superior result is going to be preferable in nearly all scenarios.Arguments can be made for privacy or lack of connectivity, but it probably does not matter to most people.

I hope they adopt the same model with AI - leverage whatever frontier model is best and provide their own privacy infrastructure in front.At some point Apple will figure out a way to provide the right info from your calendar, messages, email etc as context and couple this with a bunch of secure tools for creating calendar entries, etc. Agentic AI will then be something I personally benefit from.

It's not the same, but PMs and VPs at my company think we can vibe code our way out of migrating a 1.6 million line codebase to a newer language / technology. Or that our problems can be solved by acquiring an AI startup, whose front end looks exactly the same as every other AI startup's front page, and slapping a new CSS file that looks like that startup on top of our existing SPA because their product doesn't actually do anything. It's an absurd world out there.

The reason there was such a narrative is because Wall Street and Silicon Valley are both narrative machines with little regard for veracity, and they are also not that smart (at least according to people who successfully beat their system, such as Buffett)."Warren, if people weren't so often wrong, we wouldn't be so rich." – the late great Charlie Munger.

I think the decision is first a self-serving one that's in line with how they want their devices and services to operate, but it also happens to be (in my opinion) the future-proof way of integrating consumer AI.

The revenue from AI is growing at a much slower rate than recurring capex and depreciation is accumulating. This will create distress opportunities that cash-rich companies like APPL may seize. Might be a private equity deal, might be in the public markets as some of the players dip hard after IPO.As this plays out, APPL's silicon has unified memory, power consumption and native acceleration that gives it an edge running SLMs and possibly LLMs at scale. Wouldn't shock me to see APPL introduce a data-center solution.

Pebble's next act is a smart ring with a built-in microphone for recording your thoughts. Pebble smartwatch maker Eric Migicovsky, who recently reacquired the Pebble brand (now under his new company Core Devices) and revived the e-paper-based wearable, calls the $99 Index 01 smart ring an “external memory” for your brain.

Unlike the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic, Samsung Galaxy Ring, and countless other multifunctional smart rings designed to track your health and fitness, Pebble's Index 01 is a single-purpose wearable.

In a blog post detailing the Index 01, Migicovsky says it's as “small as a wedding band,” made of stainless steel, is water-resistant, and comes in three colors.

The smart ring has a single button that you can press and hold to activate the microphone. It doesn't require an internet connection or a subscription fee. After activation, you “whisper your thought,” which is then sent to your phone and “added to your notes, set as a reminder, or saved for later review.”

As you may have guessed, the name “Index 01” is named after the finger—your index—you wear it on. This lets you use your adjacent thumb to press and hold the microphone button, which Migicovsky says has a “satisfying click-feel”—perfect for one-handed use. He says that he had initially made it an app for the Pebble smartwatch, but it couldn't be used with one hand and he also found “lift-to-wake gestures and wake-works” to be “too unreliable.”

Here's how the Index 01 works, according to Migicovsky. Audio recordings are first saved to the internal memory, streamed to the Pebble app on your phone (iPhone or Android), converted to text, and then an on-device large language model (LLM) turns that into an action such as adding it to your note and reminders.”

What the Index 01 is not is an “AI friend thingy or always-recording device,” notes Migicvosky. Clearly, he's not a fan of AI devices like the controversial (and sucky) Friend pendant.

It's a simple gadget built with privacy at its core. Migicovsky says the “connection between ring and phone is encrypted,” and because all audio is processed on-device and sent to your phone, no recordings are ever stored in the cloud. He says, “an optional cloud storage system for backing up recordings is available,” but it hasn't been built yet.

As I scrolled down Migicovsky's detailed FAQ on the Index 01, a few things stood out to me. I love that the smart ring's battery can last “for years”—about 12 to 15 hours of battery life, if you use it 10 to 20 times a day for 3 to 6-second thoughts. But it's bizarre that the Index 01 is a single-use device, meaning it doesn't have a rechargeable battery. Migicovsky says that adding charging circuitry would have made the Index 01 bulkier and also more expensive. Instead, users are expected to send the smart ring back to Pebble for recycling; they'll be notified via the Pebble app to order another ring. Migicovsky estimates, based on the aforementioned usage frequency, the Index 01 should last around 2 years before it needs recycling. If you use it less often, the battery may last longer.

Pre-orders for the Index 01 start today at a discounted $75, but that will increase to $99 after shipping starts in March 2026.

As I said earlier, the smart ring will come in three colors (polished silver, polished gold, and matte black). You'll get eight sizes to choose from (6 through 13).

This being a Pebble device—built on the principles of open source and DIY—users will be able to hack and customize the Index 01. Migicovsky says you'll be able to program the button for single and double presses, add your own voice actions, and even send audio recordings to your own app or server. It's all very much in the Pebble spirit.

After rebooting the Pebble smartwatch brand, founder Eric Migicovsky is expanding his company's device lineup with a new smart wearable: an AI-powered smart ring known as Index 01. Named for the finger where the ring is meant to be worn, the new $75 ring is not meant to be a competitor to always-on, always-listening AI devices, like the AI pendant Friend, but instead offers a way to record quick notes and reminders with a press of a button on the ring's side.

AI only comes into play via the open source, speech-to-text, and AI models that run locally on your smartphone through the Pebble mobile app. That is, if the ring's button is not being pressed, it's not recording. (And this is a press-and-hold gesture, too, which means you can't start the ring's recording and then let go to surreptitiously record a conversation.)

You can wear the stainless steel ring while in the shower, washing hands, doing dishes, or in the rain, but you have to take it off for other water-related activities, like swimming. At launch, it's water-resistant to 1 meter.

The ring is also not a fitness tracker or sleep monitor. It doesn't record details about your heart rate or health. And it's not there to be your AI friend. 

“I'm not trying to build some AI assistant thing,” Migicovsky told TechCrunch in an interview. “I build things that solve one main problem, and they solve it really well,” he explains. “I think of [the ring] as external memory for my brain … That's what this is. It's always with you.”

Plus, the ring has been designed to be highly reliable and privacy-preserving, he says, as all your thoughts are stored on your phone, not in the cloud. There is no subscription. 

Migicovsky's ring enters a growing market for voice-note wearables. Last month, Sandbar, a New York-based startup founded by former Meta employees, unveiled its Stream Ring, which also lets users record thoughts via a touch-activated microphone. However, unlike Index 01's no-subscription model, Sandbar's $249 ring offers both a free tier with limited AI interactions and a $10-per-month Stream Pro subscription for unlimited chats and early access to features. The Stream Ring is expected to ship next summer.

Migicovsky has been wearing his own ring for three months now and says he cannot imagine going back to a world where he doesn't always have a memory device with him.

“The problem is that, during the day, I get ideas or I remember something, and if I don't write it down that second, I forget it,” he says. The ring solves this problem, he adds, without becoming another device you need to charge. 

“The battery lasts for years,” Migicovsky claims. 

The ring is said to support roughly 12 to 14 hours of recording. On average, the founder says he uses it 10 to 20 times per day to record 3- to 6-second thoughts. At that rate, he'll get about two years of usage. When the ring's battery dies, you can ship it back to the company for recycling.

When using the Index, you can record up to five minutes of audio, which can be saved to the ring and synced to your phone later. This makes sense for recording briefer, personal thoughts and notes, even when you don't have your phone handy, but it wouldn't work for recording a longer chat, like a presentation, meeting, or in-person interview of some kind.

The ring also supports more than 100 languages and has a bit of on-device memory for times when you're not in Bluetooth range of your device, where the recording is ultimately saved and transcribed. (The raw audio is retained, too, in case the speech-to-text is garbled due to loud background noise.)

If you own a Pebble smartwatch or one from another brand, your recorded thought can even appear on the watch's screen so you can verify it's correct. 

The ring works with Pebble's mobile app, which offers notes and reminders but can optionally integrate with your phone's calendaring system, too, or other apps, like Notion. And the ring's software is open source, which makes it hackable by the community, the founder points out.

Because of its open nature, the ring's button is already programmable. In addition to the press-and-hold gesture, you can program the ring to do other things with a single or double press, like play or pause your music or control the shutter on your phone's camera. You could use it to send a message through the universal chat app Beeper, which Migicovsky also created, or you could add your own voice actions via MCP.

Migicovsky acknowledges that hardware can be difficult to get right, as Pebble's exit to Fitbit showed. (Fitbit was later acquired by Google in 2021.)

“I didn't earn any money during Pebble — we exited, but it was not a great exit,” Migicovsky admits.  

This year, however, he decided to reboot the Pebble project after Google open sourced PebbleOS, which opened the door to new hardware.

With his new company, Core Devices, Migicovsky plans to do things differently. 

Still, the founder doesn't regret his previous choices, he clarifies.

“I wouldn't have gone back and changed anything. I loved what we built. I loved what we did. I love the company that we built, but it's not the only way to build a company,” he told TechCrunch. “And speaking as an ex-YC partner, there's a time and a place for building a venture-backed startup. Some companies are phenomenal when they raise money and build a big team, and I tried that … What I'm doing now is trying an alternative path, which is [to] start from profitability,” he says.

The new company is a small team of five, self-funded, and focused on sustainability.

So far, Core Devices has shipped the Pebble 2 Duo smartwatch with a black-and-white display. Its first run sold out, and the company is now preparing to ship the upgraded version, the Pebble Time 2. The newer device, which has seen 25,000 preorders, is a stainless steel watch with a larger, color e-ink screen.

As for the Index 01, the ring's preorder offer ends in March 2026. After that, the price increases to $99. It currently comes in silver, polished gold, and matte black and works with iOS and Android devices. Customers can select from eight ring sizes, ranging from 6 to 13.

And you can disable what's left manually.

Windows is becoming more AI-focused with every passing update, and the latest major revision — 25H2 — added so many AI features that some might genuinely be opposed to upgrading. Most of the additions are opt-in, while others work automatically in the background, and Microsoft has already said how it wants Windows to become an agentic OS one day. But what if you don't?

That's where this new script comes in, claiming it can rid your operating system of all the AI shenanigans Microsoft has piled on.

 




"RemoveWindowsAI" is a script created by zoicware, available on GitHub, that does exactly what it says: remove every AI feature in Windows 11, while guiding users to disable others that require manual intervention. It runs from a PowerShell console where you have to type out a simple command. There's a list of all the options, like Copilot and Recall, that can be disabled with the Registry Keys command, or by hiding AI components in the Settings app.

All the details for getting the script up and running are on the GitHub page, along with a YouTube tutorial you can follow. The creator says any new AI features added in preview builds won't be targeted with this script until they become a part of the stable release channel that sends out updates to everyone. This makes sense because, otherwise, there'd be simply too much to deal with since Insider builds are Microsoft's testing playground for AI.

There's also a separate guide for manually disabling AI features that the script can't handle, including Gaming Copilot, OneDrive AI, and Windows Studio Effects — all pretty simple toggles. As mentioned before, any new features that do become part of mainline Windows will be added to the script or at least the GitHub page if they require conscious action.

 




We tested it ourselves, and it works just as intended; the GUI command is easier to use if you're not comfortable playing around with admin settings. There's a "?" icon next to every toggle that explains what that feature does, too. There's even a "Revert Mode" toggle to restore all the AI functionality you've disabled, so you're not losing these features forever. The goal is to put the choice in the user's hands, as always.

Intel has signed a strategic partnership with the Tata Group, one of India's biggest global enterprises, in a bid to boost the country's indigenous semiconductor and compute ecosystem. According to the announcement, the deal focuses on consumer and enterprise hardware enablement via an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding), which will include manufacturing and packaging of Intel products for local markets as well as advanced packaging in India.

As per a report by the Indian Express, the Tata Group is working on building two semiconductor facilities in India, valued at around $14 billion, including a fabrication plant in the state of Gujarat and an OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) in the north-eastern state of Assam. Additionally, the two companies are exploring an opportunity to scale tailored AI PC solutions for both consumer and enterprise markets in India, with an aim to become the global top five market by 2030.

“Intel's technology has driven decades of advancement in computing, and as we continue to innovate, our ambition is to broaden our reach, accelerate growth, and deliver even greater value to our customers. We see this as a tremendous opportunity to collaborate with Tata to rapidly scale in one of the world's fastest-growing compute markets, fuelled by rising PC demand and rapid AI adoption across India,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.

Prior to the aforementioned deal, the biggest chip project in India was announced earlier this year by Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., valued at $11 billion. However, the latest deal between Intel and Tata is now the biggest investment for the semiconductor sector in India.

The partnership should also be a strong push for the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), a flagship programme to develop a full-stack semiconductor ecosystem, from design to manufacturing and testing. Launched back in 2021 under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the ISM came with an initial financial outlay of around $10 billion and an aim to implement key incentive schemes and policy initiatives. Apart from the Tata Group, this initiative includes key global players such as Micron Technologies, Clas-SiC Wafer Fab, and Foxconn.

Veteran tech operators with ties to Seattle are launching a new investment firm aimed at what they see as two of the biggest opportunities in today's economy: AI and cyber intelligence.

VQ Capital is a “thesis-driven, AI-native investment platform” that partners with multibillion-dollar family offices. The firm is headquartered in New York but co-founder Brian Lent plans to build a hub in the Seattle region, where he was an early Amazon leader and later started Medio, a predictive analytics startup acquired by Nokia in 2014.

Lent is teaming up on VQ Capital with longtime colleague John Kim. They first worked together when Lent recruited Kim to join Medio. Kim later went on to become a product exec at Expedia, Vrbo, and PayPal.

Other managing partners include Yotam Avrahami, a former partner at New Vista Capital and Deloitte, and Praveen Hirsave, a former Expedia and Babylon exec who also spent nearly 15 years at IBM.

VQ Capital says it will concentrate on two main themes:

“We believe the biggest winners of this era will be built by small, extraordinary teams capable of out-maneuvering incumbent giants,” Kim said in a statement.

The firm argues that the old pattern of gradual, Moore's Law-style progress has given way to what it calls an “era of compounding change,” driven by hardware advances, new AI models and large-scale data.

VQ Capital also departs from the standard venture fund structure. Instead of raising a large, long-lived fund up front, the firm works with family office partners on a deal-by-deal basis. The firm describes its approach as a hybrid of private equity discipline and venture-style investing.

Avrahami, a veteran of the Israeli Special Forces, initially started the firm as YA6. He later partnered with Kim and Lent to re-launch as an AI-focused investment platform — what is now known as VQ Capital.

After Nokia acquired Medio, Lent worked at HERE Technologies for two years before launching real estate tech startup Plunk, which closed in 2024. His most recent gig was with Auger, a well-funded logistics startup in Bellevue led by former Amazon exec Dave Clark. Lent was chief analytics and data officer, and departed after seven months to help launch YA6, which evolved into VQ Capital.

U.S. authorises shipments of Hopper-class AI accelerators to “approved” customers.

The U.S. will allow Nvidia to export its H200 chips to "approved customers" in China, President Donald Trump announced on Monday, setting off a fresh round of political and regulatory manoeuvring on both sides of the Pacific.

The decision authorises shipments of Nvidia's second-tier Hopper-generation chip in exchange for a 25% fee collected when parts arrive in the United States for security review before re-export. The Commerce Department is finalising the terms of the arrangement, which Trump said would also apply to AMD and Intel.

H200 sits below Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture yet remains far ahead of any processor China can legally import today. It is roughly six times more powerful than the H20, the downgraded model Nvidia specifically created to comply with earlier export controls. China restricted tech companies from buying the H20, arguing its performance gains over domestic alternatives were too modest to justify continued reliance on U.S. parts.

Trump's announcement briefly lifted Nvidia's share price, but the company's prospects in China now potentially rest on decisions in Beijing as much as in Washington. The Financial Times reports that Chinese regulators have been discussing ways to allow only limited access to H200 — including an approval process where buyers must explain why domestic chips cannot meet their needs — and could bar the public sector from purchasing Nvidia hardware altogether. At the time of writing, no official confirmation of this has been released by the Chinese government.

The provisional opening nonetheless matters to China's largest cloud providers. Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance have adopted domestic accelerators for some inference workloads but continue to prefer Nvidia products for training and maintaining large models, often sending jobs overseas where access to H100-class compute remains unrestricted. If allowed, H200 purchases would ease those workarounds, though companies would still have to navigate both governments' approval systems.

Following the announcement, a group of senators described the move as a "colossal economic and national security failure", arguing that H200's performance would give Chinese AI firms a meaningful lift. The bipartisan "SAFE CHIPS Act" introduced last week seeks to prevent the administration from approving exports of advanced chips, including H200, for 30 months.

The announcement also coincided with the Justice Department's announcement of "Operation Gatekeeper", which alleges a smuggling network routed Nvidia parts into China and Hong Kong despite existing controls, piling yet more pressure on Washington to create a regulated channel for hardware that continues to leak across borders.

Whether H200 reaches China at scale now depends on two competing gatekeepers. Washington is attempting to shape the market through controlled exports and taxes, while Beijing reportedly weighs measures that would keep foreign accelerators available only where domestic suppliers cannot yet compete.

It claims the technology was old and "cannot be used to make the most advanced chips."

ASML, a Dutch company renowned as the only one that can produce the latest photolithography machines for fabricating cutting-edge chip designs, is under fire for selling chip fabrication hardware to a Chinese defence firm with ties to the ruling party, as reported by Nos. Although ASML claims that the technology it sold to Chinese chip manufacturers was old and not able to "produce state-of-the-art chips," analysts have still raised concerns over its dealings with a firm developing quantum technologies, which could have implications for military technology development and deployment.

The Dutch government has long been aware of the risks posed by China's access to chip design software and manufacturing hardware. That's partly why there's been such fallout recently around Chinese involvement with Dutch chip firm, Nexperia. But Dutch firm ASML may have had far greater dealings with Chinese businesses, and it's raising more than a few red flags.

Nos claims that the business that purchased the ASML chip manufacturing component was a division of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), a Chinese state-owned company that is a key component in the country's military industrial complex, producing key equipment for rocket systems and drones. It has also reportedly worked on the Chinese space program and fabricates chips for military use.

Nos has also accused ASML of supplying a deep lithography system (DUV) in its entirety to the Shenzhen International Quantum Academy. This is arguably more notable, as the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service has explicitly warned against China's development of quantum technologies.

Although ASML's DUV machines are older designs that produce chips in resolutions of around 38nm (the latest dual-stage extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems can manage 8nm), analysts are still concerned about the direct provision of such systems, considering the concerns over Chinese technological development.

ASML has said it won't comment directly on sales to customers, but has suggested that what it has transferred to China is not cutting-edge, describing it as "old technology that can't be used to produce state-of-the-art chips." It added: "It is impossible for suppliers, such as ASML, to assess if a chip manufacturer in China should, or should not, be subject to export controls. National security is the responsibility of governments."

Indeed, it highlights that the designs it has sold to Chinese companies are not subject to export controls. This was confirmed when Nos spoke to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

"Not all high-tech goods are, by definition, sensitive and subject to authorization under the export controls policy," it said in a statement. "This is also the case for parts of lithography machines. Lithography machines contain a great deal of parts, technology, and software. All those parts are needed for a machine to work, but not all parts play a crucial/strategic role."

That said, Nos claims to have spoken to industry experts who suggest the parts sold to Chinese companies were, in fact, essential for the operation of certain fabrication machinery and should be considered for export controls.

"The problem is that the Dutch government does not have any control over this export of parts", says Judith Huismans, China expert for RAND Europa and former head researcher for Datenna. She suggested governments should consider export controls for parts, too: "That way, you are not saying that ASML can no longer export anything to China, but it will give the government more control and tools."

Having starred in it, clearly Rhea Seehorn knows how season one of Pluribus ends. The finale is still a few weeks away (it'll release on December 26), but in a new interview, she explains how the climax of the season made her feel, and her first thought after reading it.

“It's bananas,” the actress, who just got a Golden Globe nomination for her role on the show, told Deadline. “The same as the first episode. I have virtually the same reaction to all of them. I'm like, ‘What!?' Then I'm like, ‘Holy crap. All right, let's go.' I mean, they read so beautifully. I knew when I was reading the scripts [that] this would be the kind of show that I would love. I would be obsessed with this show even if I didn't get to be in it. So it's just been a huge reward to get to play it, and to get to be kind of the audience's access point in going down this rabbit hole. As far as the finale, I loved it. I was immediately, desperately needing Season 2. They are in the writers' room now, and I have not asked any questions yet. I might just be surprised, right along with the audience. I'll play it before they'll see it, but I might, I might wait. I don't know.”

So, yes, Seehorn is as big a fan of Vince Gilligan's show as we are, even as the star of it. That's incredibly exciting. As is the fact that season two is already in the works.

As for what could possibly happen on the season finale, we're still a few weeks away, so it's impossible to predict. Could Carol finally meet up with the one other skeptic and figure out a way to reverse the hive mind process? Will someone switch their alliances? Could we see one of the others learn to lie? The possibilities are endless. And, if you watched Breaking Bad especially, you know that Gilligan is a master at a killer cliffhanger. We think we have another one coming in a few weeks.

Pluribus is currently streaming on Apple TV+, and we can't recommend it enough.

If you work somewhere that sometimes involves broken code, followed by someone pinging a coworker in Slack with a harried message like “hey @[human's name] can you push a quick fix for this?😬” Anthropic just released a beta feature meant to take that human out of the loop.

According to SiliconANGLE, Anthropic is testing a Slack-based version of Claude Code, its coding agent. The intention is for it to be able to catch up on a given discussion, parse the content of the exchange into an engineering task, and then hop into your codebase and make the change. In other words, Claude Code can now, in theory, take out the part of vibecoding where someone has to break a sweat by changing over to the Claude Code tab in their browser and putting in a prompt.

SiliconANGLE (whose word I'm taking at face value because I do not pretend to know how to code) says that after a Slack message, Claude Code can now create new files, mess with existing code, test its own work, and iterate—all after a detailed slack conversation between humans, followed by something like “@Claude fix this.”

The implications are unsettling, even if you don't sweat the potential replacement of human workers. An AI agent may be lying in wait on Slack waiting for instructions, sort of like an overly sensitive Amazon Alexa waiting for its wake word. Stray remarks can potentially become tasks handed over to a piece of software with the capability to do damage.

Worse, Slack functionality would make it easier for the least technically sophisticated person on a given team to take it upon themself to assign sweeping, complex tasks to the bot. I, for instance, am a blogger, and reading about this made me think, oh wow, if we had this I could fix my own bugs whenever I find them. If you're an actual software engineer, that should be a very frightening thought.

According to the business data site Demandsage, Slack has 47.2 million daily users working at over 750,000 organizations, including 77% of Fortune 100 companies. That's a lot of people who should be kept away from this Claude beta feature at all costs.

Asgard launches RAM that only Loki could love because he would steal it and sell it.

Chinese memory and SSD manufacturer Asgard has announced via the company's Weixin account the introduction of two high-capacity memory kits. While these kits may not rank among the best RAM, they are notably among the most costly available. The 256GB (4 x 64GB) version sells for up to 20% more than a GeForce RTX 5090, one of the best graphics cards on the market.

Staying true to its Norse mythology-themed products, Asgard has launched the Valkyrie II Racing Car Limited Edition 256GB memory kit. The four 64GB DDR5 memory modules, which feature a 10-layer PCB with 4GB SK hynix M-die integrated circuits, operate at DDR5-6000 with C32-45-45-90 timings. Asgard has optimized the memory kit for AMD platforms, so it comes with AMD EXPO support, but Intel XMP 3.0 remains uncertain.

Asgard has also released the Thor Black Gold Limited Edition 192GB (4 x 48GB) memory kit for individuals who don't want to spend an enormous fortune on memory. The kit comprises four 48GB DDR5 modules with a 10-layer PCB, incorporating 3GB SK hynix M-die integrated circuits. These modules operate at DDR5-6000 with notable timings of 28-36-36-72. Additionally, Asgard has tailored the Thor Black Gold Limited Edition toward AMD platforms, so AMD EXPO support is a given; however, support for Intel XMP 3.0 remains unconfirmed.

Few vendors are willing to invest in releasing high-capacity memory kits due to the associated costs. With the current shortage driven by the AI boom, manufacturers are less inclined to do so, despite the substantial financial benefits that could be gained from soaring prices. Currently, only limited 192GB or 256GB memory kits are available on the retail market, and the few that are available already impose significant markups.

Despite the exorbitant price tags, Asgard's latest memory kits emerge as some of the most affordable options currently available on the retail market. The Valkyrie II Racing Car Limited Edition 256GB memory retails for $2,403.81, 14% lower than the Flare X5 256GB memory kit, which features nearly identical specifications.

Meanwhile, the Thor Black Gold Limited Edition 192GB memory kit is also more affordable and faster than the Corsair Vengeance 192GB memory kit. The former boasts a 15% higher data rate at a 45% lower price point.

The primary downside with Asgard is that it is predominantly a Chinese brand; consequently, it is nearly impossible to locate its products outside the Chinese market. Procuring and shipping memory modules from China entails paying tariffs, even if you manage to find Asgard products on eBay, Newegg, or Amazon through a third-party seller. Nevertheless, the latest memory kits from Asgard remain highly competitive on price, even in the current market landscape. It's a shame Asgard isn't a more global brand.

While us mere mortals are stuck facing the aftermath of the AI boom with soaring DDR5 prices and dwindling inventories, a chance hunter on Reddit has bagged possibly the best deal we've seen in a while. A fully-fledged, high-end custom gaming PC with all the bells and whistles — including, most importantly, 64 GB of DDR5 RAM — that would cost at least $2,500 to build right now. Our lucky buyer? They got it for just $600 at a pawn shop in Portugal, and that's negotiated down from $750!

This win was posted by u/uneektnt on the r/pcmasterrace subreddit, where they unwittingly hoped it's "decent enough for some games," not knowing the beast they'd just acquired. Specs-wise, we're looking at a Core i9-14900KS processor, the best consumer chip Intel has made to date (yes, it beats Arrow Lake). That's paired with Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti Super, a proper 4K-capable GPU that churns through 1440p-Ultra gaming like butter.

If that weren't already crazy enough, the PC also came with 64 GB (32GB x 2) of T-Force Delta RGB 6000 MT/s memory that's sitting at a casual $689.99 on Newegg right now — so, the entire PC was cheaper than just the cost of the RAM. To put that into perspective, this exact same kit cost less than $200 a few months ago. Aside from RAM, storage has also seen massive surges but, unfortunately, u/uneektnt didn't disclose that info, though we can at least see an M.2 SSD mounted in the pictures.

Taking to PC Part Picker, kitting out a similar system turned up a value of about $1,800 without a GPU, which we left out since most RTX 4070 Ti Super variants are overpriced right now. Generally, street pricing for this card floats around the $800 mark, and the cheapest we could find was a $979 PNY model. Regardless, you're looking at over $2,500 of parts that this lucky buyer was able to snag for almost one-fifth of its worth.

With that, the duology is complete: both a PS5 and, somehow, a high-end PC are cheaper than 64 GB of DDR5 RAM. Even if memory prices weren't in a doozy, this is an incredible deal that would've cost at least twice as much in routine times. It also serves as a nice contrast to a previous story where someone traded 192 GB of memory for an RTX 5070 Ti, which is a worse deal than it sounds.

Washington State University researchers have discovered how a neural circuit – or a connection between two brain regions – drives relapse after opioid use, a finding that could lead to more effective treatments for opioid use disorders.

In a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, researchers in the Department of Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience at WSU's College of Veterinary Medicine used a preclinical model to model opioid use in humans and found that reducing the activity within a specific neuronal circuit linking the prelimbic cortex and the paraventricular thalamus significantly reduced drug-seeking behavior. The project was led by graduate researcher Allison Jensen, the study's first author, working under assistant professor Giuseppe Giannotti.

While this study was done in rats, the same brain pathway exists in humans. We know people are going to use drugs, but for someone who decides, 'I'm done,' the challenge is stopping cravings. If we can target the brain regions driving those episodes, we can help prevent relapse and save lives."

Giuseppe Giannotti, assistant professor, Washington State University

Opioids are the leading cause of drug overdose deaths in the United States, accounting for more than 79,000 deaths in 2023. One of the major challenges for those trying to break opioid addiction is relapse. Studies show nearly 60% of people relapse within one week of completing an inpatient detoxification and as many as 77% relapse within six months after short-term inpatient care without medication-assisted treatment.

The paraventricular thalamus is known to play a central role in processing drug-associated cues and motivational states, but, importantly, the WSU researchers discovered that signals from the prelimbic cortex play a major role in activating the paraventricular thalamus. When the team reduced the activity of this brain pathway, heroin-seeking behavior dropped significantly.

"We wanted to know what makes the paraventricular thalamus respond so strongly to drug-associated cues," Jensen said. "By identifying the upstream driver of that response, we can begin to understand how cravings form and how to intervene."

To reduce activity in the brain pathway, the team used two approaches.

They first used chemogenetics, which involved introducing a designer receptor – a genetically engineered protein – into neurons of the prelimbic cortex sending projections to the paraventricular thalamus. Researchers could then activate the receptor with a specific drug that doesn't affect other cells, allowing them to reduce activity in the pathway, which was followed by a significant reduction in heroin-seeking behavior.

Even more promising was an optogenetic approach that used light to manipulate activity in the pathway. Researchers implanted a fiber-optic into the paraventricular thalamus to deliver a low-frequency light pattern that gradually desensitized the connection between the two brain regions and reduced the drive to seek heroin. This method was nearly twice as effective as the chemogenetic approach.

A similar approach called deep brain stimulation, in which electrodes deliver controlled electrical impulses to specific brain regions, could potentially achieve the same results in humans. Not only could it be effective for opioid addiction, Giannotti said, but it could also be adapted for other abused substances, including cocaine, alcohol and nicotine.

"These kinds of therapies could one day help reduce cravings in humans," Giannotti said. "If someone comes to a treatment facility, we could potentially use an approach like this to target this pathway and help them get through the periods when cravings are the highest."

The next step for Giannotti's lab is to examine how environmental cues – such as light and sounds associated with drug use – are dynamically activated in this brain circuit to drive relapse.

"Environmental cues can be incredibly powerful triggers of relapse in humans," Giannotti said. "Understanding the neuronal dynamics by which neurons respond to those cues will help us design even more precise and effective treatments."

The negative health impacts from contamination by so called "forever chemicals" in drinking water costs the contiguous U.S. at least $8 billion a year in social costs, a University of Arizona-led study has found.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, builds on previous research into how PFAS – per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances – can negatively impact health when the chemicals contaminate drinking water. The research team studied all births in New Hampshire from 2010-2019, focusing on mothers living near PFAS-contaminated sites.

The research shows that mothers receiving water from wells that are "downstream" (in groundwater terms) of PFAS-contaminated sites, as opposed to comparable mothers receiving water from "upstream" wells, had higher first-year infant mortality, more preterm births (including more births before even 28 weeks), and more births with infants weighing less than 5.5 pounds (including more births with weights less than even 2.2 pounds). These findings build on earlier laboratory and public health research but offer new evidence from real-world exposure across a large population.

Extrapolating to the contiguous U.S., PFAS contamination imposes costs of at least $8 billion on the babies born each year, which encompasses medical care, long-term health impacts and reduced lifetime earnings. The results indicate that the potential health benefits of PFAS cleanup and regulation may be substantial.

If we compare costs we're finding versus the cost of cleaning up PFAS, the answers are obvious. Removing PFAS from drinking water not only results in drastically improved health outcomes. It also produces a significant long-term economic benefit."

Derek Lemoine, study coauthor, professor of economics and director of graduate studies in the U of A Eller College of Management

Lemoine and fellow Eller economics professor Ashley Langer collaborated on the research with Bo Guo, an associate professor of hydrology and atmospheric sciences, in the College of Science, after meeting at an event hosted by the Arizona Institute for Resilience to foster collaborative research across disparate fields of study. Lemoine and Langer took an immediate interest in Guo's years-long research into PFAS, while Guo was fascinated by the economists' research into long-term health and economic impacts.

Eller economics alumnus Robert Baluja and former AIR-funded postdoctoral researcher Wesley Howden also contributed to the study.

PFAS were originally developed to make protective coatings for goods to resist heat, oil and water, and are used in a range of products and in firefighting activities. They earned the label "forever chemicals" because they take much longer to break down naturally in the environment. Researchers have long suspected that exposure to PFAS poses health risks, especially to infants, who can suffer from low birth weight or even die from PFAS exposure via their pregnant mothers. But prior work had not found a way to make PFAS exposure effectively random.

"We found really substantial impacts on infant health, which expanded on what others before us had found," Langer said. "What we then do is calculate how these negative birth outcomes follow these children throughout their lives. The numbers we found represent the lowest end of the economic impact – we suspect it is even more."

The U of A study focuses on two "long-chain" PFAS – PFOA and PFOS – that are no longer manufactured in the U.S. but remain in soils and therefore are still percolating into groundwater.

"Whatever PFAS we see in groundwater is only a tiny fraction of the PFAS that has been dumped in the environment," Guo said. "The majority of PFAS is still in the soil and migrating downward."

The authors highlight opportunities for future research, including understanding the effects of newer PFAS and the role of long-term exposure. They also note that activated carbon filters, whether used by water utilities or installed in homes, can remove these long-chain PFAS from drinking water.

"These chemicals may be everywhere, but we still find that drinking water matters for pregnant women. Installing and maintaining home water filters could be prudent for them," Lemoine said.

Preliminary results of a nationwide study suggest that the disinfectant used to treat water before it is distributed through pipes may impact the incidence of Legionnaire's disease in certain parts of the country. The findings will be presented Dec. 9 at the annual meeting of the Society for Risk Analysis in Washington, D.C. 

Waterborne diseases – caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites – affect more than 7 million people in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). One of them is Legionnaires' disease, a potentially severe pneumonia. It is caused by the bacterium Legionella, which grows in the pipes of water systems, where it can be spread through aerosolized droplets from sources such as showerheads, decorative fountains, or building cooling towers. 

Researchers conducted an epidemiological study comparing historical data on Legionnaire's disease in the United States with 25 water utilities' treatment attributes (representing all 10 EPA regions). The rates of Legionnaires' disease among residents served by the utilities in the study ranged from no reported cases to an average of 8.36 cases per 100,000 people. 

Preliminary findings show that: 

There are higher rates of Legionnaires' Disease in zip codes served by water treatment plants that use chlorine as the primary disinfectant, rather than monochloramine. 

There are also higher rates of disease when plants use chlorine as the secondary disinfectant, rather than using chlorine as the primary disinfectant and monochloramine as the secondary disinfectant. 

There was a seasonality result in the data, with Legionnaires' disease occurring less frequently in the winter months and most frequently in the summer months. 

These preliminary results back up data from previous studies of individual buildings. (For example, previous research has found that in healthcare facilities where the water is treated with monochloramine, there is a lower prevalence of Legionnaires''s disease.) The risk for Legionnaires' disease is higher for people with weakened immune systems, older adults, smokers, and those with chronic lung or kidney diseases. 

Legionella is extremely challenging to treat and manage in a building's plumbing system once it establishes a niche. It is important to think about the whole life of the water, from treatment to tap, when we consider how to best manage this pathogen and lower the incidence of Legionnaires'disease."

In a major step towards a precision therapy for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, researchers at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) have uncovered how the body's bile acids bind to block C. diff's most dangerous toxin. 

C. diff is a toxin-producing bacterium and the leading cause of health care-associated infections, causing serious infections in the gut and persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and inflammation of the colon. Current treatments for C. diff infection rely on antibiotics, which can disrupt healthy gut bacteria and leave patients vulnerable to repeated infections. 

The discovery, published in Nature Microbiology, reveals the first detailed view of how C. diff's main toxin, Toxin B (TcdB), binds to bile acids in the gut. 

Working with partners at the University of Minnesota, North Carolina State University, and Scripps Research Institute, the SickKids research has informed the development of a new compound that can protect against C. diff in preclinical models, offering hope for safer, more effective treatments that could finally stop the cycle of recurrent infections. 

Recognizing the limitations of antibiotics as a front-line treatment for C. diff, SickKids investigators focused on TcdB, the toxin responsible for most of the cellular damage and gut inflammation associated with infection. 

Earlier research led by Dr. Roman Melnyk, study lead, Senior Scientist and Program Head in Molecular Medicine and Co-Director of the SPARC Drug Discovery Facility, demonstrated that some naturally occurring bile acids, best known for their role in digestion, can also inhibit TcdB. Building on this work, postdoctoral fellow Dr. Sean Miletic set out to investigate how these bile acids interact with the toxin in the gut; in collaboration with Dr. John Rubenstein, a cryo-electron microscopy expert in the Molecular Medicine program, the team captured the first detailed view of TcdB bound to bile acids. 

Their findings revealed that the toxin's structure must be in an "open" formation to cause damage – and certain bile acids can latch on and hold it shut. "It's like jamming a door at the hinge," explains Miletic, first author on the study. "If the toxin can't open into its active form, then it can't harm cells." 

This structural insight guided the development of bile acids that could act as targeted therapies for C. diff infection. Leveraging the structural data generated at SickKids, the team collaborated with Dr. Peter Dosa from the University of Minnesota to design new versions of bile acids that were engineered to stay in the intestine, where they are needed most. Dr. Casey Theriot at North Carolina State University led testing of these compounds in preclinical models. 

Together, the team created and tested sBA-2, a synthetic bile acid that was capable of neutralizing TcdB directly in the gut. In preclinical models of C. diff infection, sBA-2 significantly reduced disease symptoms such as weight loss and intestinal damage. Importantly, it did this without affecting bacteria as whole, preserving gut health and targeting the toxin with precision. 

By focusing on the toxin rather than the bacterium itself, sBA-2 represents a promising new strategy to prevent recurrent infections while protecting the gut's delicate microbiome. 

We are very excited about the potential of sBA-2 as a first-in-class oral therapy for this devastating disease. For patients, this approach could mean safer treatment and a real chance to break the cycle of repeated illness."

Reducing calorie intake helps cancer-fighting immune cells do their jobs more effectively, reports a study by Van Andel Institute scientists and collaborators.

The findings lay the groundwork for developing dietary strategies to boost the effects of a powerful class of cancer immunotherapies.

Growing evidence suggests dietary restriction has anti-cancer effects but the 'why and how' are not well understood. Our new study reveals one way this relationship may work: by providing T cells, the soldiers of the immune system, with the right mix of nutrients to more effectively fight cancer. Additional research is needed but we are hopeful these insights can inform evidence-based dietary guidelines to improve the effectiveness of immune-based cancer treatments."

Russell Jones, Ph.D., chair of VAI's Department of Metabolism and Nutritional Programming and corresponding author of the study

Dietary restriction is an approach that reduces overall calorie intake while maintaining good nutrition. Lab studies by other researchers suggest that modest calorie restriction may improve immune and metabolic function and delay the onset of certain age-related diseases. Conversely, diets that are too restrictive can have significant negative effects, such as nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss and depression.

The study, conducted in mouse models and published today in Nature Metabolism, explored a low-fat, high-protein diet given once a day with 30%–50% fewer calories than usual. The results showed this lower calorie intake promoted the formation of ketones, which act as a cellular fuel T cells use to become more effective tumor fighters. Ketones also help T cells combat cancer longer by preventing cellular exhaustion.

Ketones are metabolic by-products that are regularly produced by the liver. Ketone levels rise when glucose, a sugar that serves as the primary power source for cells, is in short supply, such as during exercise or fasting.

Earlier research by Jones's lab found that T cells often prefer ketones to glucose because ketones can "reprogram" T cells to better address threats. T cells' ability to rely on different nutrients may be a biological failsafe that boosts the immune system when resources are limited, such as when a person's appetite is suppressed during illness.

But T cells aren't the only type of cell that can harness ketones. Earlier this year, a study by VAI's Evan Lien, Ph.D., revealed that cancer cells also can use ketones to fuel their growth. This raises an important question - if both T cells and cancer cells can use ketones, then how can we ensure only T cells benefit? Ongoing research in Jones's and Lien's labs aims to answer this question. For now, the findings add to an increasingly complex understanding of how different nutrients help or hinder cellular activity. They also underscore the immensely intricate relationship between diet and every system in the body. Lien is a co-author of today's study.

Although their new findings are exciting, Jones said, there are several important caveats. While the study demonstrates that reducing calorie intake supports T cell function, it does not suggest dietary restriction prevents or treats cancer. Additionally, people with cancer already face significant challenges in meeting nutritional needs, in part due to loss of appetite or nausea associated with treatment. More research is needed to clearly understand all the factors at play.

"Nutrition is never one-approach-fits-all," he said. "Our work is an important starting point for developing scientifically sound and adaptable diets that physicians can tailor to an individual's needs."

The team's next steps include exploring different diet and fasting combinations to see how they impact immune function. In the long-term, Jones envisions robust clinical trials to evaluate potential dietary strategies designed to boost the success of immunotherapies against cancer.

In a new preclinical study, researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center developed an antibody therapy called 77A that showed an ability to overcome treatment resistance in blood cancers, such as myeloma and lymphoma, as well as solid tumors.  

The study was led by Jun Wei, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Lymphoma & Myeloma, and principal investigator Robert Z. Orlowski, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Lymphoma & Myeloma. Wei presented the results today at the 67th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition (Abstract 388). All ASH content from MD Anderson can be found at MDAnderson.org/ASH. 

There is tremendous promise in the way 77A is capable of rewiring the immune system, enabling it to respond effectively against multiple cancers. Our findings offer a new pathway to immunotherapy and patient treatment." 

Jun Wei, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Lymphoma & Myeloma

The 77A antibody targets HSP70, a heat shock protein that helps tumors evade the immune system. HSP70 often is overproduced in certain blood cancers and solid tumors, contributing to a hostile tumor environment by suppressing immune responses and promoting cancer cell survival.  

In laboratory models, 77A demonstrated strong antitumor effects by enhancing the activity of both innate and adaptive immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. The antibody improved the ability of immune cells to detect and destroy cancer cells, and it worked well in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immune checkpoint blockade. It also showed potential to pair with adoptive T cell therapy, a cutting-edge approach where patients receive lab-grown immune cells to target cancer cells. 

Importantly, 77A was effective in laboratory models of multiple cancer types, and early tests with human immune cells showed it could enhance immune responses in healthy donors. These findings pave the way for clinical trials and suggest 77A could become a versatile new therapeutic option that warrants further investigation. 

"These results give us confidence that 77A could become a versatile immunotherapy," Orlowski said. "Our next step is to advance a humanized version of this antibody into clinical trials to evaluate its potential in patients across multiple cancer types."  

The 77A humanized antibody is under development and expected to move into clinical trials.

Researchers at Bielefeld University have analyzed how reliably AI methods can detect pulse rates from simple video recordings. The technique, known as rPPG—remote photoplethysmography, an optical form of contactless pulse measurement—is considered a future tool of telemedicine. But a new study in the journal npj Digital Medicine reveals clear weaknesses as soon as heart rates rise.

For telemedicine to function in everyday life, digital diagnostic tools must operate reliably, even under challenging conditions. A research team at Bielefeld University has now examined how accurately modern AI methods can estimate pulse rates from facial video recordings. The rPPG (remote photoplethysmography) technique measures subtle color changes in the skin caused by blood flow. It is intended, for example, to ease the workload of medical practices or automatically detect stress in everyday situations.

We wanted to know whether these methods truly deliver on their promises, especially when heart rates go up. Because it is precisely in such moments that they would be most important."

Dr. Hanna Drimalla, Study Author,  Professor, Bielefeld University

Most previous rPPG studies rely on ideal conditions: seated participants, good lighting, stable cameras. The team led by Bhargav Acharya, William Saakyan, Professor Dr Barbara Hammer, and Hanna Drimalla intentionally focused on real-life scenarios. They developed their own dataset that includes both low and high heart rates as well as poor lighting situations.

The results are surprising: while low lighting has little effect on automated measurement, accuracy drops sharply at elevated heart rates. Some modern methods then produce values that are simply unusable for telemedical applications.

Because digital health services are expanding rapidly, the researchers caution against uncritical deployment of these technologies. If AI methods misjudge stress or heart problems, this can create real risks, both for clinicians and for their patients.

The study therefore stresses: rPPG holds great potential, but the methods must become more robust. “That's why we are currently working on new and more resilient approaches,” says Bhargav Acharya, “ones that can detect high heart rates and function even in poor lighting or for people with darker skin tones.” Only then can contactless pulse measurement find its place in digital healthcare, beyond the lab and in the midst of everyday life.

A new meta-analysis finds that “laughing gas” can lift depressive symptoms within hours, highlighting a fast-acting antidepressant approach that may work best when carefully repeated rather than given just once.



Study: Nitrous oxide for the treatment of depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: mazur serhiy UA  / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal eBioMedicine, researchers synthesized data from protocol papers, clinical trials, and exploratory studies to assess evidence regarding the effectiveness of nitrous oxide for treating depression.

They concluded that within hours of administration, nitrous oxide can produce a rapid antidepressant effect with generally transient, dose-dependent side effects. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings.

Depression affects more than 300 million people worldwide. Its causes include complex interactions among environmental, biological, and psychological systems that disrupt stress-regulation pathways and neural circuits.

Standard antidepressants remain inadequate for many patients. This has intensified research focus on faster-acting therapies that can support people with depression, particularly for those who experience treatment-resistant depression.

Growing research has shifted toward the glutamatergic system, motivated in part by ketamine's fast-acting antidepressant effects. Nitrous oxide, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist widely used as an anesthetic, has shown similar fast-acting benefits, accompanied by short-lived, dose-dependent adverse effects.

Its actions include modulating glutamate signaling, altering activity within the default mode network, and influencing dopamine and opioid systems. These mechanisms have positioned nitrous oxide as a promising candidate for further investigation as a novel antidepressant.



Mechanism of action of nitrous oxide (N2O) in modulating NMDA receptor activity. In the normal state (A), glutamate (glu) binds to NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+) ion influx, triggering excitatory signalling. In B) N2O partially blocks NMDA receptors, inhibiting glutamate binding and preventing Na+ and Ca2+ influx, thereby reducing excitatory signalling. This modulation of ions affects the excitatory and inhibitory balance in the central nervous system and is implicated in depression. Figure created with BioRender. Gill, K. (2025) https://BioRender.com/a87q343. 

The review identified eleven eligible studies, including seven completed clinical trials, most of which were randomized controlled trials, and four published protocol papers. These studies represented early-phase research conducted in Australia, Brazil, China, and the United States.

Across the completed trials, a total of 247 participants were enrolled, comprising individuals with major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, or bipolar depression. Nitrous oxide was typically administered at concentrations of either 25% or 50%. It was delivered through controlled inhalation for periods ranging from 20 to 60 minutes, either as a single treatment session or as repeated sessions scheduled weekly or twice weekly, with most pooled efficacy estimates driven primarily by single-session 50% protocols.

Overall, the studies showed that one session of nitrous oxide could quickly reduce symptoms of depression, with detectable improvements within two hours after its administration.

In one of the earliest trials, scientists found that a 60-minute session of 50% nitrous oxide led to noticeably lower depression scores compared with a placebo at both two and 24 hours. People receiving the treatment were also more likely to show a meaningful improvement (20% vs 5%), and some even reached remission within a day.

Another study reported similar results in people with treatment-resistant depression: symptoms improved within hours. However, the effect faded by one week. A third study found that nearly half of participants still showed improvement a week after a single treatment, especially those who responded strongly at the start.

Results for bipolar depression were less consistent. In one study, both nitrous oxide and the comparison drug midazolam reduced symptoms; however, nitrous oxide helped more people improve within the first two hours. The study also suggested that people with certain patterns of brain blood flow might be more likely to benefit, hinting at a possible biological marker for predicting treatment response.

Studies involving multiple treatment sessions demonstrated more substantial and more sustained improvements in depressive symptoms. Across all repeated-dose studies, the greatest improvements usually appeared within 24 to 48 hours after each treatment and accumulated over time.

For example, eight sessions over four weeks led to very high improvement and remission rates compared to a placebo.

Another study found that both low-dose (25%) and high-dose (50%) nitrous oxide reduced symptoms over two weeks, though the higher dose was more effective. The lower dose, however, caused fewer adverse events such as nausea and dizziness, suggesting it might be a good compromise between effectiveness and tolerability.

The most extensive study to date found that weekly sessions over four weeks led to steady, cumulative improvement. People receiving nitrous oxide were more likely to reach remission in the first week than those on placebo, and the 50% dose again produced the strongest results.

When data from several trials were combined, nitrous oxide showed clear antidepressant effects at both two hours and 24 hours after treatment. These early improvements were consistent across studies, with very low statistical heterogeneity.

However, the combined data did not show lasting benefits at one week, suggesting the main effects are short-term unless treatments are repeated. Because only a small number of trials contributed to the pooled estimates, some asymmetry in the funnel plots suggests that publication bias cannot be excluded, and blinding may have been imperfect in some trials, raising the possibility of expectancy effects.

Researchers found that across a small number of early-phase trials, nitrous oxide produces rapid, short-term antidepressant effects, with repeated dosing extending both the magnitude and duration of benefits.

However, most studies were small, early-phase trials with heterogeneous designs, limited long-term follow-up, and insufficient power to compare doses or identify predictors fully. Differences in delivery systems, comparators, and outcome measures also constrain comparability. Safety data, though generally reassuring, remain incomplete for long-term or repeated use.

Overall, the evidence suggests that nitrous oxide is a fast-acting antidepressant candidate that is generally well tolerated, with higher rates of mild, transient side effects than placebo, but that larger, longer, and mechanistically informed trials are needed.

A new clinical trial suggests that pairing bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates with CAR T-cell therapy may sharply boost one-year progression-free survival for people with aggressive lymphoma.

In just a few years, treatment options for aggressive lymphoma have rapidly advanced. However, many patients show a consistent pattern: powerful new therapies act quickly but often fail to keep the lymphoma at bay permanently, says Jay Spiegel, M.D., a transplant and cellular therapy physician at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

Spiegel will present the early findings Dec. 8 at the 2025 American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in Orlando.

We have made huge improvements in lymphoma care. But there are still many patients where the current approaches are not curative."

Jay Spiegel, M.D., a transplant and cellular therapy physician, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center

That challenge inspired a new clinical trial - the researchers, led by senior author Lazaros Lekakis, M.D., professor of clinical medicine at the Miller School, combined three of the most promising lymphoma treatments, aiming to improve outcomes.

The clinical trial data indicate that combining these treatments may significantly enhance progression-free survival at one year.

Large B-cell lymphoma is the most common aggressive lymphoma in adults. Its most frequent subtype, diffuse LBCL, affects about 25,000 people in the U.S. each year. First-round treatments work for approximately 70% of patients. 

For the 30% whose lymphoma comes back or never fully disappears, the next step is often CAR T-cell therapy, such as axicabtagene ciloleucel, approved in 2017. It trains a patient's immune cells to target lymphoma.

"CAR T works incredibly well upfront," Spiegel said, "but we've learned that it often falls short in the long-term - only about 40% of patients remain in remission after five years."

So, researchers have designed other new therapies. Mosunetuzumab is a two-headed bispecific antibody that links a T-cell to a lymphoma cell, activating the immune system to attack. Polatuzumab is an antibody–drug conjugate, meaning it delivers a small dose of chemotherapy directly into lymphoma cells. Both are effective initially but don't reliably keep the disease away when used alone.

To boost the durability of these new treatments, the Sylvester team integrated all three approaches. "Attacking three different antigens at once could help overcome several of the reasons CAR T fails," Spiegel said. "The hope was that combining them could really jump the efficacy, and so far, it has been quite something."

The phase 2 study enrolled 25 adults with relapsed or refractory LBCL. They received mosunetuzumab and polatuzumab before and after the CAR T treatment. Of the 24 patients who reached day 90, 90% were in complete remission. At one year, about 80% were still in remission, a significant increase from an estimated 50% at one year with CAR T alone.

"I did not think it would work this well," Spiegel said. "To take patients with this type of aggressive disease and have so many still in remission at one year, that really surprised me."

The Sylvester trial might provide a way to achieve longer remissions. "We have an exciting result," Spiegel said, "but now we need to show it can be done on a larger scale. That is the goal of the next study, to prove the juice is worth the squeeze."

As encouraging as the findings are, they arrive in a field moving at an extraordinary pace as researchers are continually testing new immunotherapies, improving CAR T treatments, and exploring fresh drug targets. "Everything in lymphoma is happening all at once," Spiegel said. "It makes the field exciting but also complicated."

That pace presents both opportunity and complexity as clinicians work to understand how each advancement fits into the broader treatment landscape - and how they can work together. The current challenge is figuring out the best sequences and combinations for these new treatments - and how to use each without exhausting the immune system, Spiegel said.

In this surge of treatment options, the message for patients is increasingly hopeful. "If you have relapsed disease, even aggressive disease, there are multiple approaches now that can still cure your lymphoma," Spiegel said. "That was not true seven years ago."

U.S. Men's National Team star Christian Pulisic channeled his inner Michael Jordan against Torino in Serie A, battling through a fever to score twice off the bench, securing a comeback win which keeps the Rossoneri at the top of the table.

Having missed Milan's recent 1-0 win at home to Lazio after suffering another minor muscular issue, Pulisic was named to the bench by head coach Massimiliano Allegri for their trip to relegation-battling Torino on Monday. With Milan having gone 2-0 down within 20 minutes, midfielder Adrien Rabiot was able to stem the bleeding after 24 minutes, long before Pulisic was introduced in the 66th minute for Davide Bartesaghi.

The 27-year-old USMNT star, who entered the game as Milan's top scorer, wasted no time in adding to his tally for the season, netting two close-range efforts in the 67th and 77th minutes to secure three crucial points for the title challengers. The win keeps Milan above Napoli on goal difference, with both sides on 31 points after 14 games.

Pulisic is now tied with Inter Milan's Lautaro Martínez as the league's top scorer with seven goals, while his nine goals across 12 games in all competitions are also a team high. This also means the American now has 12 league goals this calendar year for the first time in his trophy-laden career, via Bleacher Report - perfect timing with the 2026 FIFA World Cup just six months away.

However, it seems Pulisic wasn't just working his way back from a muscular issue on Monday, telling reporters post-game that two days prior he had been managing a 39 degrees Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) fever. The American told Sky, via Milan News, “Two days ago I was truly dead, today I felt much better. I'm happy to have come here to help the team…

“Yesterday we didn't know if I could play, but this morning I felt much better. I'm happy with the goals, but the important thing was to win the match.”

Pulisic added, of what has already been an injury and illness-interrupted season, “It was a little strange. I want to find more rhythm. The team is doing very well this year. We're taking it game by game.”

With Allegri suspended for the game, it was down to his assistant, Marco Landucci, to speak with reporters post-game, saying, via Milan News, “When you win with difficulty, it's even more beautiful. Tomorrow we'll rest, then we'll focus on Sassuolo: we can't afford to underestimate anyone, but this team has humility to spare. Pulisic had a fever of 39 the other day, and he was crucial to today's victory.”

Allegri will return to the sideline for Milan's next league game at home against eighth-placed Sassuolo on Sunday, before their attention turns to the Supercoppa Italiana the following Thursday, when they'll face Napoli in the semi-final. Milan is looking to defend its crown from last season, when it beat Inter 3-2 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Mandatory water breaks for everyone!

With the 2026 World Cup coming to North America and the majority of the games being hosted in the United States, it's only right that the event gets Americanized. 

Given that the tournament will run from June 11–July 19, temperatures in most host cities will be scorching. Therefore, FIFA announced earlier this week that every match during the World Cup will feature three-minute hydration breaks in each half.

Regardless of weather conditions, each match will pause 22 minutes into each half for players to take drinks. These breaks will essentially turn matches into four quarters, which is something we Americans are more used to in other sports.

The game clock will not be stopped for the mandatory hydration breaks, but instead added on in stoppage time of each half. The three-minute breaks will also allow the broadcast to add more commercials into the fold, when otherwise full commercials would only typically run during halftime.

FIFA say it is "a streamlined and simplified version of the breaks used at some previous tournaments, including the FIFA Club World Cup 2025."

Mexico City Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, and Hard Rock Stadium in Miami are presumed to be the warmest stops during the 2026 World Cup. Covered stadiums such as AT&T Stadium in Texas and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will, of course, be temperature-controlled, but to make all things fair, matches played inside those buildings will also include mandatory water breaks.

While one might argue that the best, most fit soccer players from nations around the world should be able to compete for two 45-minute halves without stoppages for water, temperatures could reach over 100 degrees in certain cities.

Lionel Messi has been named Landon Donovan MLS MVP for the second straight season. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner produced 48 goal contributions - the second-highest total in league history - and carried Inter Miami to third place in the Eastern Conference. He is the first player to win the award in back-to-back years.

Messi capped his season by winning MLS Cup last weekend, delivering two assists and earning MLS Cup MVP as Inter Miami lifted the first league title in club history. That performance was the final chapter of a dominant year in which Messi also collected his second straight Landon Donovan MLS MVP award, becoming the first player in league history to win it in back-to-back seasons.

Across the 2025 regular season, Messi produced 48 goal contributions (29 goals and 19 assists) in 28 matches, the second-highest total ever recorded, and averaged 1.78 goal involvements per 90 minutes, a mark only surpassed by his own 2.18 from 2024. He also became just the second player in league history to lead MLS in both goals and assists in the same season, matching Sebastian Giovinco's 2015 feat.

Messi set multiple league records during the campaign. He became the first MLS player to record 10 multi-goal games in one season and generated at least three goal contributions in nine different matches. He also scored multiple goals in five consecutive games from late May through mid-July, the longest multi-goal streak in MLS history.

His dominance translated directly into awards. Along with MLS Cup MVP and MLS MVP, Messi won the MLS Golden Boot with 29 goals, earned three MLS Player of the Month honors, and was recognized six times as MLS Player of the Matchday. Over his MLS career, he now has two MVP awards, two Best XI selections, two All-Star selections, a Golden Boot, 12 Player of the Matchday honors, and five Player of the Month awards.

Messi's season resulted in a landslide MVP vote. He secured 70.43 percent of the total ballot, finishing comfortably ahead of Anders Dreyer, with Denis Bouanga, Evander, and Sam Surridge rounding out the top five.

Messi is only the second player in league history to win the award twice and the first to do so in back-to-back seasons. The only other two-time winner is former Kansas City Wizards midfielder Preki, who collected MVP honors in 1997 and 2003. Preki now serves as an assistant coach for the Seattle Sounders, the team that defeated Miami in the Leagues Cup final in August.

Despite Messi's brilliance, Miami's season was anything but smooth. They were eliminated from the CONCACAF Champions Cup by Vancouver, lost to Seattle in the Leagues Cup final, and failed to defend their Supporters' Shield title. But after navigating those setbacks, the Herons found form at the right time, surged through the postseason and ultimately won the first MLS Cup in club history.

Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland have had similarly sensational starts to the 2025-26 season.

Based on goal contributions alone, Mbappe has the edge — with his 25 goals and four assists in 21 matches for Real Madrid ahead of Haaland's 20 and three in 20 games with Manchester City.

Mbappe has scored 57 per cent of Madrid's 44 goals in La Liga and the Champions League, while Haaland, after a fast start, has received more help but has still contributed 44 per cent of City's 45 goals so far in Europe and the Premier League.



Not all strikes carry equal value, though. Goals that lift teams up from losing or drawing game-states have greater weight.

Across domestic and Champions League action, Mbappe and Haaland each have scored nine times when their teams have trailed or been level in matches, more than any other player across Europe's top five domestic leagues.

Penalties are another factor. Haaland has yet to score from the spot for City, missing his only attempt in November's 3-0 win against Liverpool. Mbappe has taken eight penalties and scored seven, only failing in the 2-1 win over Barcelona in October.

When you take national-team stats into the equation, Haaland's total of 13 goals and three assists for Norway in five matches over this season's three international breaks comfortably clears Mbappe's still impressive five and three in four games for France. Haaland also helped his country secure World Cup qualification for the first time since 1998, adding to the narrative value.

In terms of efficiency in front of goal, both are scoring roughly once every two attempts. Haaland's goals have come from 43 efforts on target and 77 in total (56 per cent accuracy). Mbappe's shot accuracy is slightly lower at 48 per cent, but his goals have come from 51 shots on target.

Mbappe's versatility is in positioning, Haaland has the edge in variety as a No 9.

One of the major criticisms levelled at Haaland has been his heading ability, with some glaring misses over the years. But 35 per cent of his goal attempts in the Premier League this season have been headers, with only Bournemouth's Evanilson (41 per cent), Nick Woltemade of Newcastle United (40) and Tottenham Hotspur's Richarlison (39) boasting a higher share.

The leap he has taken is down to his positioning. Watch his 2025-26 highlights and many of his goals are a result of starting at the far post and sprinting to the penalty spot or near post, generating momentum before shooting. His fifth and final goal in Norway's 11-1 demolition of Moldova in September is a standout example.



That has helped improve his heading game, too, and City are feeding him more than ever while embracing a more direct and vertical approach. Their 2.1 crosses to Haaland per 90 minutes in league play is the highest rate in his four seasons at the club.

Haaland's acceleration is not only impressive in short spurts but over longer distances, and manager Pep Guardiola has found ways to tap into this as well. City are completing 2.3 through balls per 90 in the league, more than double their 1.0 in 2024-25 and also higher than the 1.4 of 2022-23, Haaland's debut season in England, when running in behind to meet passes was his bread and butter.

His finish against Monaco in the Champions League at the start of October shows his intelligence in these situations. As Josko Gvardiol pauses in possession, Haaland notices Phil Foden attracting Eric Dier's attention and is alert to the growing space between the Monaco centre-backs.



As Dier steps up towards Foden, Haaland sprints in behind to meet Gvardiol's pass over the top.



The City striker then shows incredible dexterity to lob goalkeeper Philipp Kohn.



City's willingness to move the ball quickly, rather than have long spells of slow possession, has meant Haaland already has more shots (seven) and goals (three) from fast breaks in 15 league outings in 2025-26 than he managed in any of his three full seasons in Manchester.

Mbappe's achievements are admirable given the tactical shift Madrid have taken under new head coach Xabi Alonso this season.

In 2024-25, Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid were an expansive side built around maximising the strengths of their stars, rather than on savvy tactical foundations. Mbappe and Vinicius Junior posed a massive threat when Madrid played at pace, but that pair's lack of work out of possession was punished by elite teams in a trophyless campaign for the Spanish giants.

Alonso has reduced the randomness of Madrid's game, preferring structured possession in central areas instead. Their tempo has been much more measured under him, with long spells of possession.

Mbappe is playing the No 9 role better than ever. He is working harder out of possession and in attack. His turn of pace to spin a defender to run in behind is his biggest strength. Goals against Barcelona and Atletico Madrid came from such runs.





Madrid's wide play has stuttered at times but when it's worked, Mbappe has been excellent at taking advantage.

In the series of images below, against Valencia last month, he changes direction well on the fly to hook Arda Guler's cross home with his weaker foot.



Madrid and Mbappe have looked at their best when they have been able to raise the pace, due to the profiles in their squad. Mbappe scored 10 league goals from fast breaks across his final two seasons at Paris Saint-Germain while adding five under Ancelotti in his debut campaign with Madrid in his 2024-25 debut year. In 16 La Liga matches under Alonso, he has scored just once from such situations.

When opportunities to play quickly have been limited by their opponents playing in low blocks, Madrid have struggled.

Mbappe's long-range shooting has helped in these scenarios. Thirty-one per cent of his shots in La Liga have been from outside the box, the fourth-highest among centre-forwards with 900 or minutes in Europe's top five leagues. He has four league goals from range, too.



By contrast, 97 per cent of Haaland's shots have come from inside the opposition box, the second highest across Europe's top five leagues, behind Joaquin Panichelli of French side Strasbourg.



Those numbers speak to their roles at their clubs.

Haaland is averaging 24.2 touches per 90, of which 9.6 are in the attacking third. More importantly, his 7.1 touches per 90 in the opposition penalty area suggests that in City's current setup, he is very much the old-fashioned No 9, jostling with defenders, winning aerial duels and dominating the box, with limited activity outside it.



Mbappe is averaging 54.6 touches per 90 in La Liga, marginally higher than the 53.9 from 2024-25. A sizeable portion (38.4 per 90) is in the attacking third, but he is averaging only 8.5 touches in the opposition box per 90, his lowest in the past five league seasons. As his activity map from Madrid's past six league matches shows, he often spends time out wide and away from the penalty area.



Madrid's reliance on Mbappe extends to creativity, too.

He averages 3.3 chances created per 90 across La Liga and the Champions League, with Haaland some distance behind on 0.5. However, he has three assists so far to the Frenchman's four.

The Lionel Messi-Cristiano Ronaldo rivalry over the previous decade often saw one player's case bettered based on how he performed in games where the two of them were head-to-head in meetings between their respective clubs, even if that lacked nuance.

When at Borussia Dortmund in early 2020, Haaland took round one of the individual contest against Mbappe (though the latter's Paris Saint-Germain progressed as 3-2 aggregate winners in a Champions League last 16 tie), scoring both the Germans' goals while the Frenchman contributed only one assist.

Round two went to Mbappe in last season's Champions League play-offs in February, when he led Madrid with their opening goal in a 3-2 win at the Etihad, despite Haaland twice giving City the lead on the night. An injured Haaland missed the return a week later, in which Mbappe got a hat-trick as the defending European champions went through 6-3 on aggregate.

Round three comes on Wednesday (tomorrow), back at the Bernabeu, in the league phase of the same competition.

Both players can stake a claim to be the best in the world right now.

In 1969, at the age of 23, George Best wanted to focus solely on the essentials. Just football, just his job. So he turned his back on his two other great passions, alcohol and women. His sobering conclusion: "It was the worst 20 minutes of my life." A Manchester United legend, that quote sums up Bet's rebellious attitude towards football, and life in general.

Best was at the height of his career in '69. A year earlier, he had led United to their first European Cup, was the top scorer in England and won the Ballon d'Or.

But as prolific as Best was a producing spectacular dribbles, countless goals and important titles on the pitch, he was just as prominent when it came to partying, drinking and undertaking in affairs off it. At the time, his dazzling double-life as a football star and bon vivant was going well – but it would soon come to an end.

Best was born in Belfast in 1946 and grew up in a working-class neighbourhood. When he was 15 years old, he was discovered by Manchester United scout Bob Bishop, who wrote to the club's manager, Matt Busby: "I think I've found a genius."

Busby was in the process of building his second great team in Manchester. The first had been torn apart far too early by the tragic Munich air disaster of 1958, but the second achieved greatness. Best made his debut for United in 1963 at the age of 17 and quickly formed the most dangerous attack in the country alongside Denis Law and Bobby Charlton. Dubbed 'The Holy Trinity', Best, Law and Charlton have since been immortalised as statues outside Old Trafford.

United won the league in 1965 and 1967 before, in 1968 – exactly 10 years after Munich – they won their long-awaited first European Cup. Best put United ahead in extra-time in the final against Benfica, which ended in a 4-1 win for Busby's side.

Best had long been more than just a footballer. His sporting achievements, coupled with his rebellious lifestyle, infamous escapades, long hair and catchphrases, exuded a very special magic. He was one of the world's first football celebrities, 'the fifth Beatle', a true sensation. Emerging from the somewhat socially rigid early-1960s, he, like many rockstars, stood for the dawn of a new era.

"If you gave me the choice between scoring a goal from 40 yards at Anfield or going to bed with Miss World, it would be a tough decision," Best once said. "Luckily, I've done both!" 

Another of his memorable one-liners went: "I spent most of my money on alcohol, women and fast cars. The rest I just squandered!"

Best's rise was rapid, but so was his decline. The European Cup victory proved to be his last major title, as his priorities shifted further and further away from sport and into nightlife. Far too early in his career, football became a secondary concern for Best despite his ridiculous levels of talent.

"The best I've ever seen," said Pele of the Northern Ireland international; Best replied that this praise was the "highest honour of his life".

Best would repeatedly turn up drunk for training, and in 1972, United coach Tommy Docherty suspended him. Two years later, at the age of just 27, Best played his final game for United. He then spent 10 years playing for various lower-league teams in England and the United States, with the spotlight now focused on his life off the pitch.

Best's gambling addiction drove him into financial ruin, while his alcohol addiction ruined his health. His marriage failed, as did his ventures as the owner of nightclubs and fashion boutiques. He even spent the Christmas of 1984 in prison after driving while intoxicated before getting into an altercation with a police officer.

In 2002, he received a liver transplant, but continued to drink, and in November 2005, Best died of multiple organ failure at the age of just 57. Around 100,000 people made the pilgrimage to his funeral in Belfast, where the eulogy was given by the then-British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. In Manchester and in his hometown, people still say today: "[Diego] Maradona good, Pele better, George Best."

Iran's football chief has labelled the World Cup game chosen by organisers as an LGBTQ ‘Pride Match' as an ‘irrational move'.

Iran's football chief has objected to the “irrational” branding of its World Cup 2026 match against Egypt, which local organisers in the United States have suggested will be held in support of the LGBTQ community.

The organising committee in Seattle, Washington state, where the match is scheduled to take place next year, had previously announced their intention to hold a “Pride Match” coinciding with the northwestern city's Pride Weekend in late June.

Following last week's FIFA tournament draw, Egypt and Iran are now slated to face off in Seattle on June 26, the Friday before.

The head of Iran's Football Federation, Mehdi Taj, was quoted by local news agency ISNA as saying Tehran and Cairo had both raised “objections against the issue”, which he labelled an “irrational move that supports a certain group”.

Taj did not mention the specific branding of the fixture.

On Monday, Iranian state television said Tehran would “appeal” against FIFA over the matter.

Homosexuality is illegal in Iran and can be punishable by death.

The Egyptian Football Association has voiced similar objections, according to local media reports citing unnamed sources.

In Egypt, homosexuality is not expressly outlawed, but is often punished under loosely worded laws prohibiting “debauchery”.

The 2026 World Cup will mark Iran's seventh participation in the tournament, which will be jointly hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.

Iran and the US have had no diplomatic relations since 1980, following a hostage crisis in the wake of the 1979 Islamic revolution.

Iran had initially opted out of Friday's draw to protest against the US refusal to grant visas to several members of its delegation, but eventually reversed its decision.

On Tuesday, Taj said some Iranian players might face visa problems over their service in the Iranian military, which includes the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – designated a “terrorist organisation” by the US in 2019.

“For the World Cup, we must work on having replacement options, and we have already started that,” he said.

Iran is drawn in Group G with Belgium, Egypt and New Zealand in the 39-day tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19.

Kylian Mbappe is in danger of missing Real Madrid's massive Champions League clash with Manchester City due to an injury to his left leg. The French striker was absent from Los Blancos' open training session the day before the game against Pep Guardiola's side at the Santiago Bernabeu, handing yet another headache to under-pressure Real coach Xabi Alonso.

Alonso made no mention of any injury to Mbappe in his press conference ahead of the City game, but in the training session that followed it, reporters noted that the striker was absent along with midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.

Spanish radio station Cadena Cope reported that Mbappe had suffered an injury in his left leg, making him a serious doubt for the game with City.

Mbappe has been Madrid's standout player this season, with 25 goals across La Liga and the Champions League, plus four assists. He is also on course to break Cristiano Ronaldo's record for the most goals for Real in a calendar year. The Frenchman has been responsible for half of the team's goals in the Spanish top flight and a remarkable 75% of their goals in Europe's top competition, netting a stunning four strikes in his last continental outing against Olympiacos.

Alonso is under huge pressure following Madrid's dismal 2-0 defeat at home to Celta Vigo on Sunday, which also saw Alvaro Carreras and Fran Garcia sent off and key defender Eder Militao hobble off with a muscle injury that is set to keep him out for up to four months. The result left Real trailing Barcelona by four points in the title race, while they have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions.

With Mbappe having scored 25 goals for Madrid and Erling Haaland on 20 strikes in 20 games for City, the game was expected to be a showdown between the two most ferocious strikers in Europe, who are also set to face off in the World Cup next year when France take on Norway.

Mbappe ran riot when Madrid met City in last season's competition, scoring a hat-trick in a 3-1 win at the Bernabeu in the second leg of the knockout play-off and also netting in the 3-2 victory in the first leg at the Etihad Stadium. Haaland struck twice in the first leg but missed the second leg due to injury and has failed to score in his previous two visits to the Spanish capital.

"At the end of the day, we must defend as a unit and show serious defensive commitment," said Madrid midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni. "We're up against a top side with Haaland, and his current form is unbelievable. If we play at our best level, we can win this game. We will talk about the game plan with the coach now. 

"We have a lot of injured players in defence, but we have a lot of players who can perform at a high level in that position. They're an excellent team, especially on the ball. They like to have the ball, and we'll have to be very compact both when we defend and when we have the ball to create chances."

Alonso faced several questions about his uncertain future at Madrid in the press conference and there is speculation that defeat to City and his former coach Guardiola - with whom he spent two years at Bayern Munich - could see him sacked just seven months into succeeding Carlo Ancelotti in the Bernabeu hotseat.

Alonso put on a brave face amid the questioning and insisted he maintains a good relationship with the squad and with the club's hierarchy. "We are all in the same boat," Alonso said. "We have to go through positive and negative times. We need to believe the next game is an opportunity and tomorrow we have a very exciting game for all of us, and we need to keep our eyes open to have that energy so the Bernabeu enjoys what it sees. Communication [with the board] is constant. We are united, we are all together in this and I have a good relationship with them."

Tchouameni also declared that the players backed the coach and said it was up to them to improve their recent run of poor results. He said: "If we don't win games, it's because we have to do things better with and without the ball, with commitment from everyone and play better in defence and attack. We hope to improve and win more games because what's happening now cannot go on."

"We're all together. If we want to win games, we all have to fight, coach and team in the same direction. It's us who are on the pitch, and we have to do things better out there. We have a good opportunity to change the dynamic and pick up more points in the Champions League."

World Cup

Christian Pulisic is targeting World Cup success with the USMNT John McGloughlin / Icon Sportswire / Getty Images

After the Village People had shuffled off stage, Donald Trump had put his FIFA Peace Prize on the shelf in the Oval Office, and Gianni Infantino had starting scrolling his Instagram notifications, I imagine that Christian Pulisic, sat in his apartment in Italy, took another glance at the outcome of the draw for the 2026 World Cup and let out a little sigh of relief.

Group D: the United States, Paraguay, Australia and a European playoff winner, most likely Turkey. Not bad. Not bad at all.

Pulisic certainly would have known it could have been much, much worse.

And as he reflected a little on what awaits him in June (and hopefully July) next year, the Milan winger would have surely felt that tingling in his stomach.

Because that draw, with no major obstacle likely until a possible meeting with Belgium in the round of 16, sets the stage perfectly for Pulisic for what could be the summer of his life. It creates the ideal stage for him to make the defining run of his career and transition from being merely a U.S. soccer star to a true, mainstream American sports superstar.

The stakes are absolutely colossal for him in 2026. If Milan manages to win Serie A and he maintains his current form – two more goals Monday have him atop the league's scoring chart – it's near-certain he would be named Serie A Player of the Year. Carrying that momentum into a World Cup on home soil, the expectations would be that he would take his team on a thrilling adventure.

This is the tournament that could absolutely change his life and his legacy in the United States. If he can be the hero for the USMNT on home soil, in a World Cup, the opportunities that will open up for him in terms of his reputation, commercial appeal and marketability will be enormous.

American sports fans, the kind who only tune in to soccer once every four years, will judge Pulisic in the same way they judge NFL and NBA stars — on whether he can deliver on the biggest stage when the stakes are highest. In this sport, that means the World Cup. Soccer fans know winning Serie A would earn Pulisic respect throughout the game and adoration in Italy, but it still wouldn't make him a household name in America.

Bringing people to their feet in stadiums, fan zones and bars across America next summer? That would catapult Pulisic to true Captain America status.

We know that World Cups are unpredictable, however, and the first random element is the draw. Traps can be set and challenges get tougher just from those plastic balls pulled out on stage.

Group D isn't easy – almost no group that could be imagined for a team like the USMNT in the modern game can truly be considered that way. Yet when you compare it with, say, 2014, when the USA was dealt a group stage with Germany, Portugal and Ghana (and no progression for third place in that edition) and was written off by many international commentators, you realize that it is a setting that offers Mauricio Pochettino's team every chance of advancing.

What makes me excited for Pulisic and the team as a whole is the way that Pochettino is setting up the USMNT, with his tactical restructuring and overall approach, with the focus taken off Pulisic and put squarely on the team. In the past, he felt pressure, having to do too much and dropping into parts of the field he didn't need to, which took away from his game.

Pochettino has changed the dynamic. He has made it clear that this is not a squad with a Messi-like player and he is setting up the system so that there are several attacking players with responsibility to be creative forces. There is Malik Tillman, Sergiño Dest, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and, in the right circumstances, Gio Reyna. Folarin Balogun is expected to deliver goals and Ricardo Pepi and Haji Wright will be waiting for the chance if he doesn't deliver. It's not all on Pulisic.

But make no mistake, the USMNT still needs Pulisic to be the ‘Messi' figurehead in some ways, providing that high-level creativity, without the crushing weight of having to solve all the questions himself. He can now play his game exactly as he would at Milan, saving his energy for those one-v-one moments and open spaces where he can produce the magic.

On paper, this is the best World Cup group draw the program has had in a long time. Crucially, the U.S. got the absolute weakest team in Pot 2 with Australia — that's a dream outcome. But let's be clear: there's a big difference between paper and performance. People confuse “best outcome” with “easiest,” a concept that doesn't exist at a World Cup.

There isn't an absolute minnow in the group, the kind of opponent that teams look to boost their goal difference. Every game will be competitive, featuring teams that are cut from the same cloth as Wales and Iran from four years ago — tough, resilient, and hard to break down. But none of these three opponents possesses the game-breaking individual brilliance of a Kylian Mbappé, a Lamine Yamal, or an Erling Haaland, who can ruin your perfect game plan by beating three guys and scoring out of nowhere. In terms of individual star power, even if Turkey and exciting Real Madrid rising force Arda Güler make it through the playoff, Pulisic is top of the tree in this group.

Still, the team's tactical planning must be spot on for each opponent.

Paraguay is a side that is defensively stout, resilient and comfortable sitting deep in a mid-block and playing on the counter. What is needed are players who can break down that deep block. This is where a number of players, such as a healthy Reyna or Tillman, are vital, as they are creative, can force defenses out, and open up space for runners like Balogun or Pulisic in behind.

Australia, who will perhaps be feeling disrespected, are capable on the counter and will be playing with immense self-belief. What hurts Australia is pace, exploiting the space they leave when they throw their outside players forward. Players such as Balogun, Weah, and hopefully a healthy Antonee Robinson, who thrive in transition, will be absolutely necessary in that game. Australia relies on work rate, physicality and set pieces to make up for any difference in quality, which reminds me a little bit of how the U.S. team used to play.

If Turkey makes it out of the UEFA Path C playoff and into the tournament, they will be a tough team to beat, but their defense can be vulnerable to pace and there are ways to get past them. The U.S. has pace in the roster and options available to Pochettino to exploit identified weaknesses.

One factor not to be discounted is home-field advantage. If the U.S. is playing its best, and with full stadiums of American supporters pushing them on, they will feel that they can run through walls. After Friday's draw, I fully expect that the U.S. tops the group.

If that task is navigated, the pathway opens up beautifully. Next would be a third-place team in the round of 32. Then, the likely round-of-16 opponent, if paper form is followed, is Belgium.

They are a good team, but you would still take Belgium 10 times out of 10 over facing alternatives such as France, England, Spain, or Portugal. While they are not the “golden generation” anymore, they still have quality players such as Youri Tielemans, Jeremy Doku, and Amadou Onana, but I still feel the USMNT has the tools to get the job done.

If you'll indulge the dream and look ahead, beating Belgium would push the U.S. into the quarterfinals – and I believe that is realistic if the team executes Pochettino's plans and plays to its very best. Morocco showed in 2022 that a team can go deep by being cohesive, and the U.S. now has the quality and a world-class coach to deliver something special.

Pochettino has taken a massive step by setting the team's mentality and unity, reminding the players that there are no guarantees for anyone. But now, the focus has to shift to tactical management.

The Argentine must now start to deal with ideas for different opponents and game situations, focusing on whether the plan is high-pressing, playing on the front foot, or dropping deep to protect a lead. He needs to finalize the blueprint of how the team operates, which, frankly, took until mid-October to figure out.

The U.S. will be in possession more often in the group stage than in previous World Cups. Pochettino has to deliver top game plans that expose opponents, similar to how Bob Bradley was able to neutralize the midfield source of Xavi and Xabi Alonso against Spain in the 2009 Confederations Cup. He needs soldiers who can play short-impact roles effectively, and he needs to ensure the team utilizes the scoring options he's found.

There are four friendlies scheduled before the opening game against Paraguay on June 12 in Los Angeles. The March 28 game against Belgium in Atlanta takes on a new tone given the draw, and it will be interesting to see if the two coaches are wary of showing their hand against potential World Cup opponents.

Portugal and Germany are also on the docket, and these games will offer real tests of just how close the squad is to the level needed for the latter stages of the tournament.

The USMNT has been dealt a good hand by the draw, but as any poker player knows, it's how you play 'em that counts.

You need something special to go far at a World Cup, and watching Pulisic add to his tremendous season with two more goals on Monday gave me that feeling that we have an ace in hand.

Fifteen years ago, Manchester City were so enamoured with the all-conquering Barcelona that they sought to replicate the same structure. They began by hiring chief executive Ferran Soriano and sporting director Txiki Begiristain, before eventually landing Pep Guardiola to manage the team. All that was missing was Lionel Messi - though they nearly signed the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner at the very start of the Abu Dhabi-led project by mistake!

Ever since Guardiola moved to City in 2016, speculation was rife that the coach wanted to prise Messi from Barcelona and bring him to the Etihad Stadium. Throughout his first season with City, the coach had to deny reports that he had tried to sign Messi, as well as Neymar and Sergio Busquets. 

The closest Messi came to being reunited with Guardiola at City was in the summer of 2020 when he informed Barcelona in a Burofax message that he wanted to leave and held a meeting with his former coach at his house, before eventually opting to stay in Catalunya.

Messi was subsequently offered to City in 2021 when he was forced to leave Barcelona due to the club's financial problems, although Paris Saint-Germain showed a greater interest in signing him. On none of these occasions, however, did the Manchester club actually lodge a bid for the Argentine. 

City only reached out to Barca about signing Messi on one occasion, all the way back in 2008, days after the club had been taken over by the Abu Dhabi United group and before the Argentine had won his first Ballon d'Or. The bid, however, caused great confusion both at Barcelona and back at City. That's because it was made in error, all stemming from a misunderstanding amid the excitement of City becoming billionaires overnight...

City had begun the 2008-09 season in gloomy fashion, losing 4-2 at Aston Villa. It was not entirely unexpected, given they had lost the final game of the previous season 8-1 at Middlesbrough. Their transfer business had been unremarkable, signing Brazilian forward Jo from CSKA Moscow and Tal Ben Haim from Chelsea, plus a little-known defensive midfielder from Hamburg by the name of Vincent Kompany for £6 million. But later in the month, it became clear that change was coming and that the club, and indeed English football, would never be the same.

With City owner Thaksin Shinawatra facing legal trouble back in Thailand and running out of cash due to his assets being frozen, the club were on the brink of financial collapse, leading to them having to ask for a loan from a former owner just to pay their players. Meanwhile, new coach Mark Hughes was shocked at the state of the club he had just landed at. 

He recalled to The Guardian: "The training ground was not fit for purpose. I was quite shocked by how run down it was. I assumed that people and facilities would be top quality and it was patently obvious they weren't. I made the switch from Blackburn because I thought City was a club with potential, in a good financial position, and there would be money available. The reality wasn't exactly what was described and sold to me." 

But everything changed on September 1. Hughes was playing golf when he got a call from CEO Garry Cook informing him the club had been bought by the Abu Dhabi United group. He continued hitting balls, but soon he was being followed by a crew from Sky News. Suddenly City were a lot more than a club with potential. And oh boy would money be available now, and Cook informed Hughes that the new owners "wanted a marquee signing" as soon as possible. 

Hughes had the pick of the best players in the world; the problem was that it was also transfer deadline day. There was another issue, too: City were still seen as a bit of a joke of a club.

"They just asked me ‘Who do you want?'. They had a load of bids out for pretty much every top player in the world," Hughes told the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast. "They had just put all of these bids out to see if anyone would actually come back, but people forget that at that time, Man City were a mid-table Premier League club – mid-table to bottom if we're honest. There weren't that many takers because players were thinking, 'Man City, who?'.

"They had all these bids out and nothing was happening, then all of a sudden they had a little nibble from Robinho and Real Madrid," Hughes added. "It was a crazy day, there were bids going out for Lionel Messi and all sorts! We finally managed to get Robinho over the line which was a hell of a statement, and the rest is history."

Robinho left Madrid on the assumption he was going to join Chelsea, and when he headed for Manchester, he assumed it was United, and not their nouveau-riche rivals who he was going to play for. He wasn't the only one who was confused. Although Shinawatra had just sold the club, his right-hand man Pairoj Piempongsant was still involved in City's transfer negotiations. 

He and Cook jumped on a conference call with the club's then-COO Paul Aldridge to discuss who to sign, as Cook explained toThe Athletic in 2019: "So picture the scene. There's Paul with his London accent: 'Pairoj, you got to tell me what we're doing, it's getting out of control'. Pairoj was lying on a chaise lounge, getting a massage, and shouting: 'Yes, yes, yes! Very messy, messy, it's getting messy.' Something got lost in translation and - on my daughter's eyesight, this is the truth - that was misheard as "We've got to get Messi'.".

"Paul came to me afterwards: 'Garry, this is getting confusing, I don't know what we are doing here.' I said: 'Put the offer in, let's see what we come up with'." According to Cook, City put in a £70m bid for Messi which would have smashed the previous world transfer record of £50m, the fee Madrid had paid for Zinedine Zidane in 2001. 

Messi was 21 at the time but was well on the way to stardom, having scored a hat-trick against Real Madrid two seasons previously and finished third in the latest Ballon d'Or voting, behind Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo. He had scored 10 goals and provided 14 assists during previous season, but given City's sudden change in fortunes, signing Messi was not as outlandish as it seems now. Indeed, Robinho had scored one goal more than the Argentine for Madrid in 2007-08.

Such was City's low standing in the global game, Barcelona did a double take when they learned of the bid. Cook added: "Then Dave Richards called me the next day from the Premier League: "Garry, have you put in an offer for Lionel Messi? Seventy million pounds? Are you mad?"'

Mark Bowen, Hughes' assistant manager at the time, has also spoken about the bid in the ensuing years. His version differs from Cook's story, claiming that the bid for Messi was the same as the one for Robinho, in the region of £30-£35m. In fact, Cook had also cited the £30m figure when he first told the story to author Gary James. 

That might explain why Barcelona's then-president Joan Laporta was not best pleased when he saw the bid, which was derisory for a player everyone knew was going to be the best player in the world.

Bowen told the Business of Sport podcast last year: "The president has come back and gone, 'Who the f*ck do you think you are? You think you can buy Messi off us? No chance, please back away'."

Laporta evidently didn't take City seriously and the accidental bid just goes to show how amateur the club's operation was at the time, one day after hitting the jackpot. The club continued to show enormous, if a little misplaced, ambition in the transfer market, and in the subsequent January window, they tried to sign Kaka, offering AC Milan £91m and the Brazilian a salary of £500,000 per week. 

Kaka turned down the offer and instead City fans - one of whom ill-advisedly got a tattoo of Kaka's name on his chest - had to settle for new signings such as Craig Bellamy and Nigel de Jong. Cook left the club in disgrace two years later, resigning after sending an email mocking the mother and agent of City player Nedum Onuoha, who was suffering from cancer.

Cook was eventually replaced by Soriano, whose former Barcelona colleague Begiristain soon followed. Four years later, so did Guardiola and thus ended City's reputation as a club no one would take seriously. When Messi did leave Barca, ironically after Laporta's false claims that the cash-strapped Catalans could afford to extend his contract, City was the only club along with PSG who could realistically afford him. 

City showed no great desire to get Messi that time though, having already signed Jack Grealish for £100m while they were turning their attention to football's next superstar, Erling Haaland. Deadline-day deals such as Gianluigi Donnarumma's arrival in September are now rare occurrences for a club that plans major signings well in advance. Sending a mistaken bid, ordered while a transfer negotiator enjoys a massage, is truly unthinkable now.

England international Ivan Toney was led away in handcuffs after allegedly headbutting another reveller in a London nightclub. The 29-year-old striker, who now plays his club football in the Saudi Pro League for Al-Ahli, was looking to enjoy an evening out with friends during a visit to his homeland. He found himself caught up in an unfortunate incident that saw said festivities cut short.

The Sun has obtained footage of Toney being escorted out of a trendy London nightspot by local police forces. Trouble is said to have been sparked when a fan grabbed at the former Brentford frontman in a bid to take a selfie.

A witness told The Sun: “He walked past a table of a group of lads. One of them recognised him and said, ‘Oh, it's Ivan Toney' and tried to put his hands around his neck to get a photo with him. And then Toney has said, ‘Get off me, get off me' and ended up headbutting one of the guys.”

The alleged victim is said to have been left with “blood leaking from the bridge of his nose”. It is suggested that Toney may have felt “threatened by the group” that approached him for pictures, with the Three Lions forward sporting some expensive accessories.

The onlooker added: “He's a superstar - he gets half a million a week in Saudi Arabia. He had his jewellery on and he had a real nice watch. He might have thought they were trying to attack him to take his chain or watch off him.”

The Sun's insider went on to say of police arriving within 30 minutes of the headbutt incident taking place: “We noticed about five officers in uniform walking down the stairs. And then they've gone over to Ivan Toney's table and asked his name. He's given his name and they said, ‘You're under arrest for assault' and then they put his hands behind his back in cuffs and off he went.”

There are said to have been “a ton of police cars rushing up Wardour Street” as they responded to reports of an attack. A local bartender says that police returned to the area the following day to continue their investigation into what went on.

London Ambulance Service confirmed that a vehicle was sent to Soho at 1:57am following reports of an injury being sustained. A spokesperson said: “We assessed three people. We took one patient to a local hospital and discharged the other patients at the scene.”

The alleged victim is said to have been treated for facial injuries, including a broken nose, and damage to his ring finger. The Sun claims to have seen photos that show the bloodied person in question being tended to by paramedics.

In a statement of their own, the Met Police stated: “We were called to Wardour Street at 00:47hrs on Saturday following reports of an assault. The victim was taken to hospital and his injuries are not believed to be life-changing or life-threatening. A 29-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of two counts of assault and one count of affray. He has since been released on bail while inquiries continue.”

Toney was back in London during a break in Al-Ahli's schedule. He met up with England international team-mate Declan Rice after seeing Arsenal beat his former club Brentford in Premier League action at Emirates Stadium.

A return to English football for Toney has been speculated on ahead of the January transfer window. He has been overlooked by Thomas Tuchel in recent Three Lions squads, with it being claimed that a switch may be required in order to earn selection for the 2026 World Cup.

Toney moved to the Middle East in the summer of 2024 and helped Al-Ahli to win the AFC Champions League Elite title during his debut campaign. He has been competing with Portuguese GOAT Cristiano Ronaldo - who is now with Al-Nassr - for Golden Boot honours in Saudi Arabia.

The 2026 World Cup began to feel a little bit more real for the U.S. men's national team this week, and the weekend's matches brought the first following the World Cup draw. 

Now that the USMNT knows it will face Australia, Paraguay and one of Slovakia, Kosovo, Türkiye or Romania, the planning can well and truly start for the tournament. At the same time, manager Mauricio Pochettino can start eyeing players to best fit those opponents.

This weekend saw the 2025 MLS season wrap up with Inter Miami capturing their first MLS Cup title and ensuring no USMNT players got their hands on the trophy—Sebastian Berhalter, Tristan Blackmon and Brian White all playing for the runners-up Vancouver Whitecaps. 

Over in Europe though, the success continued for American players who are looking to impress in order to crack the 26-player roster.

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top five performances from around the globe.

Noahkai Banks is still a fringe option for the USMNT at center back, but the 19-year-old had an impressive performance for Augsburg over the weekend. Caught in a relegation battle at the bottom of the Bundesliga, Augsburg upset fourth-place Bayer Leverkusen 2–0 and fellow American Malik Tillman, with Banks helping to secure the clean sheet as part of a back three.Likely a name to follow for the 2030 World Cup instead of 2026, he led the match by winning eight duels, while also completing five passes into the final third. 

Ricardo Pepi got back-to-back starts for PSV Eindhoven for the first time in months and continued his recent run of form with a goal in the 2–0 win over Heerenveen. He now has five goals across 511 minutes in the Dutch top flight this season, and seems to have reestablished himself as a reliable option for the squad alongside Guus Til. With some good form, Pepi will hope to stay in the role for the remainder of the season and head into his likely World Cup inclusion in good form. Fellow American Sergiño Dest also played and helped keep the clean sheet.

Josh Sargent's stock in the USMNT striker race has fallen since the 2022 World Cup, and if he wants to make his way into the squad for 2026, he'll need to score a few more goals. The American striker snapped a 14-game goalless drought with a goal in a 3–2 loss to Watford in the Championship, bringing him to six goals and three assists in 19 matches this season.Sargent wasn't in the USMNT's October or November rosters, but could find his way into the March friendlies, which serve as the final tests before the pre-World Cup window in June.

The second-best moment for USMNT players this weekend came from Gio Reyna, even though he did not have a groundbreaking performance. Instead, the fact that he was included in Borussia Mönchengladbach's starting lineup twice was encouraging. Reyna, who scored in his November return to the USMNT, played 68 minutes against St. Pauli and three days later, started again in a 1–0 win over last-place Mainz on Friday, where he played 69 minutes and won five of eight duels. One of the most skilled players in the USMNT picture, Reyna will hope to establish himself as a regular starter through December and into the new year, with the aim to not only crack Pochettino's squad but also start.

Christian Pulisic continued his outstanding season with AC Milan on Monday, coming off the bench to score a match-winning brace in a 3–2 win over TorinoPulisic now has 13 league goals for the Rossoneri in 2025, the most he has managed in a single calendar year in his club career, and a number he can extend with three weeks left in 2025. The tallies also brought him level with Inter Milan's Lautaro Martinez for the Serie A Golden Boot lead on seven goals, with the USMNT star holding the advantage, having done it in five fewer games. Averaging a goal every 64 minutes in Serie A, it has been an exceptional run for Pulisic in the first half of the 2025-26 campaign and he will look to carry that form into the summer and the World Cup. “Two days ago I was dead in bed, but I felt much better today and I am very happy I came here and was able to help the team,” Pulisic told Sky Sport Italia after the game, having suffered several setbacks this season. ”I didn't know yesterday if I could play, but this morning I felt much better. I'm happier with the win than the goals, honestly.“It has been a rather strange season. I do want to get more match fitness. We have to take it one game at a time and then we'll see where we are at the end of the season.”

FIFA WORLD CUP THROHPY

The upcoming World Cup will feature new elements to past iterations, and that includes the introduction of two set hydration breaks per match, reports dailymail.co.uk.
Announced on Sunday by FIFA, the two hydration breaks will be mandatory and last for three minutes at the midway point in each half.
The clock will not stop for the breaks, but three minutes will be added at the end of each half as stoppage time.
The decision was discussed over the weekend, where national team coaches and many broadcasters had congregated for the World Cup draw in Washington, DC, on Friday. It received support from all parties, including FIFA's medical team, with the welfare of players the main focus.
However, the breaks will also allow coaches to use the time to discuss tactics with players. The decision comes on the back of the Club World Cup this summer, which drew criticism from managers and players, who struggled with the soaring temperatures in the United States when they kicked off at midday local time.      
However, FIFA have decided that even if the temperatures are cool at the World Cup, there will still be a drinks break.
“There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,” FIFA said in a released statement on Sunday night.
FIFA's 2026 World Cup chief tournament officer, Manolo Zubiria, told stakeholders at a World Broadcaster Meeting that the breaks would “be three minutes from whistle to whistle in both halves.” Related News  FIFA rule shifts Nigeria vs Egypt friendly to December 16  Ghana draw England, Morocco, Brazil clash as FIFA reveals group opponents  2026 WC Draw Preview: Pots, how it works, “Group of Death” scenarios   
“Obviously, if there's an injury (stoppage) at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” Zubiria added, according to FIFA.
During the Club World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Enrique complained about the heat after beating Atletico Madrid 4-0 in a midday kick-off in Los Angeles with temperatures reaching nearly 40 degrees Celsius under the sun and 60 per cent humidity.




“The match was clearly influenced by the temperature,” he said. “The time slot is great for European audiences, but the teams are suffering.
“In terms of play, it's impossible to perform at a very high level for 90 minutes.”
His sentiments matched those of Chelsea midfielder Enzo Maresca, who complained of dizziness due to the heat throughout the tournament.
“Honestly, the heat is incredible. The other day I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy,” the Argentine said.
“Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous. Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home.      
“The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow.”

A scoreboard announcement tells fans the game is suspended due to heat during the Club World Cup group A soccer match between Palmeiras and Al Ahly in East Rutherford, N.J., Thursday, June 19, 2025.Seth Wenig/The Associated Press

World Cup matches at the 2026 tournament will have three-minute hydration breaks midway through each half regardless of the weather conditions, FIFA has said.

Referees will stop games 22 minutes into each half so players can rehydrate, soccer's global governing body added in a statement.

FIFA said the new rule will streamline and simplify the previous rules, which required cooling breaks 30 minutes into each half when the temperature at kickoff exceeded 31 C.

“For every game, no matter where the games are played, no matter if there's a roof, (or) temperature-wise, there will be a three-minute hydration break,” said Manolo Zubiria, the World Cup's chief tournament officer in the United States.

“Obviously, if there's an injury at the moment of the 20th or 21st minute and it's ongoing, this will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” he added in a meeting with broadcasters in Washington.

Excessive heat raised concerns during this year's Club World Cup held in the U.S., with several matches kicking off in the afternoon amid high temperatures.

A report published in September by Football for the Future, Common Goal and Jupiter Intelligence found 10 of the 16 venues for the World Cup, taking place in the U.S., Mexico and Canada are at very high risk of extreme heat stress conditions.

“The use of hydration breaks is part of a focused attempt to ensure the best possible conditions for players, drawing upon the experiences of previous tournaments, including the recent FIFA Club World Cup,” FIFA added in Sunday's statement.

 Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will attempt to extend their dominance at the majors in January at the Australian Open, with the duo headlining the entry list for the 2026 edition of the hard-court major in Melbourne. 

 The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alcaraz and No. 2 Sinner have between them lifted the men's singles at the past eight Grand Slam events. That streak dates back to Sinner's maiden major triumph at the 2024 Australian Open, and the Italian will arrive in Melbourne in January chasing his third consecutive crown having also triumphed at the season's opening major in 2025. 



 A six-time major champion, Alcaraz will be bidding to complete the Career Grand Slam in Melbourne, having already won at least once at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open. The Spaniard's best Australian Open results across four appearances were his quarter-final finishes in 2024 and 2025.

 The 2025 Melbourne finalist Alexander Zverev is third on the entry list, followed by record-10-time Australian Open titlist Novak Djokovic. The Serbian reached the semi-finals at all four majors in 2025 in pursuit of a record-extending 25th Grand Slam men's singles crown. 

 Felix Auger-Aliassime, Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti and Ben Shelton are among the other Top 10 stars on the entry list, with World No. 15 Holger Rune, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon, the only player missing from the Top 100. World No. 7 Alex de Minaur will spearhead the Australian charge on home soil. De Minaur reached the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park for the first time in 2025.

On Monday evening, Carlos Alcaraz, Amanda Anisimova, Joao Fonseca and Jessica Pegula had the opportunity to add an MLB venue to their lists during the off-season at the inaugural Miami Invitational.

Before the four players took the court at the transformed LoanDepot Park, Alcaraz popped out for a brief hitting session with a legendary one-namer from Brazil: Ronaldo.It was among the highlights we captured on a field traditionally occupied by members of the Miami Marlins and their visiting opponents. As was an instance where the world No. 1 struck himself in the face after framing a volley, one of several moments involving our 2025 ATP Player of the Year selection.

EXCLUSIVE: With her time on Pandora coming to end with Avatar: Fire and Ash bowing this month, Sigourney Weaver may already have another high-profile property in her sights. While a deal has not closed, sources tell Deadline that she is in talks to join the upcoming Tomb Raider series for Prime Video. Sophie Turner is set to star as Lara Croft, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge on as writer and executive producer.


	Prime Video had no comment on the Weaver news. It is unknown who Weaver would play.


Chad Hodge is set as executive producer and co-showrunner alongside Waller-Bridge and Jonathan Van Tulleken (Shōgun, Dope Thief), who is director and executive producer. The series, from Amazon MGM Studios, has set January 19 as the start of production.

	The series, from Story Kitchen, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM, is also executive produced by Crystal Dynamics; Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robins through Wells Street Productions; Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson through Story Kitchen; Michael Scheel; Hodge; and Legendary Television.


	If a deal closes, it will mark another high-profile project Weaver can add to her career that started with Alien and continued on with box office smash hits that include Avatar. 


	She can be seen next in Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in the record-setting James Cameron franchise that bows December 19. Next year she will appear in Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu. She also has the Bryan Fuller pic Dust Bunny, which opens this weekend.

	











	Weaver is repped by UTA.

The singer also described how sweet and supportive her musical hero Whitney Houston was during a Tuesday (Dec. 9) chat on the "Jennifer Hudson Show."

	Christmas came early on Tuesday (Dec. 9) when Christina Aguilera dropped by the Jennifer Hudson Show, where the host wasted no time spreading good cheer to the “What a Girl Wants” singer. “Whitney Houston said she loved your voice, one of the greatest voices that she knows,” Hudson told Aguilera of the high praise she received from the late R&B/pop superstar who died in 2012 at age 48.

	Hudson said she had to second that emotion, and the holiday cheer kept a-rollin' as Xtina bounced the compliment right back to the Oscar- and Grammy-winning host, who wondered what Aguilera remembered about meeting Houston.


	“She was always just always so kind and just down to earth and it's so wonderful when you get to meet an icon of yours,” Aguilera said of Houston, who she studied and was fascinated with growing up.  Aguilera recalled bumping into Houston once backstage at a European MTV awards show where the “I Will Always Love You” singer came right up to her and said, “‘how you doin' girl?' She was always just chill and just real and good energy.” 


	When Aguilera casually mentioned that time she sang Whitney's “Run to You” at a 2001 BET Awards tribute to Houston — a moment Hudson said she remembered with crystal clarity — she praised her mentor's generosity and kindness. “She made my life with her complimentary moment of her receiving her award… just positive energy [and] extending her hand to younger generations of singers who she knows we all idolized [her],” Aguilera said.

	











	Hudson wasn't there to just talk old times, though. She also pressed Aguilera — who hasn't released  an album of new material since her second Spanish language LP, 2022's Aguilera — on whether she has any unreleased music in the vault. “Yes, there's some… there are things along the way, but probably will always remain in a vault,” Aguilera said. 


	The good news is that Aguilera said there “is new music” in the works, though admittedly she does “take a minute” to make sure she's being thoughtful about what she releases. “I'm not like someone that's just like, ‘Oh let me just keep pumping it out,'” said the singer who dropped 2018's Liberation LP after an six-year gap following 2012's Lotus.


	“Integrity matters to me. I'm a message girl and I really like to absorb what's happening in the world, things that are really moving me and affecting people to really put thought into it,” Aguilera said, promising that her untitled next album will be a “really personal project” that will tie-in with an equally personal documentary she's been filming for the past few years.


	In the meantime, fans can check out her new Christina Aguilera: Christmas in Paris holiday special, which will screen in theaters in the U.S. on Dec. 14 and 21.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: The Dark Knight and Ant-Man star David Dastmalchian has signed on to star opposite Charlie's Angels and Resident Evil series actress Ella Balinska in Concourse Media's upcoming horror-thriller Kill Screen (previously known as The Horror Game).


	Currently in pre-production, the film heralds from Wolf Creek and Jungle director Greg McLean. Screenplay comes from Gus Krieger (Old Henry).


	In Kill Screen, desperate to find her missing sister, a young woman (Balinska) and her three friends are drawn into a mysterious virtual reality horror game. Each level forces them to survive an entirely different horror subgenre—from slashers to supernatural, zombie horror to psychological. When they learn that dying in the game means dying in real life, the friends must outthink and outfight the game's sadistic creator (Dastmalchian) before their luck runs out.

	Recently seen in Mike Flanagan's Stephen King adaptation The Life of Chuck and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, Dastmalchian recently starred alongside Alexander Skarsgård in Apple series Murderbot, and in Magnolia's Late Night with the Devil. Known for his villain turns, he also recently appeared in Dexter: Resurrection, and will next appear in season two of Netflix's One Piece as Mr. 3. and as the villain, M. Bison, in the upcoming Street Fighter franchise reboot from Legendary/Paramount. 

	











	“Kill Screen is built for a generation raised on horror and interactive storytelling,” said producer Tyler Condon. “It's terrifying, smart, and wildly entertaining – a movie that celebrates the genre while reinventing it. Greg's potent vision and Gus's script deliver a cinematic world that fans will want to explore again and again.”


	“Genre-savvy, high-concept horror is proving to be dynamic in the current marketplace,” added Concourse's Shreder. “Kill Screen taps directly into that demand with a concept that pays homage to every horror sub-genre ever imagined – while offering something completely new.”


	Dastmalchian is represented by Atlas Artists and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.

Raul Malo, the frontman and co-founder of the Mavericks, died Monday at 60 following a battle with cancer. The golden-voiced singer was revered by fans and fellow artists for both his songwriting and extraordinary pipes, and he was honored, in absentia, with the American Eagle Award from the National Music Council of the United States during a tribute show on Friday in Nashville.


	At the midpoint of the concert, which featured Malo's band the Mavericks and guest vocalists like Jim Lauderdale, Rodney Crowell, and Maggie Rose, Malo was presented with the American Eagle Award, which recognized his “lifelong commitment to the preservation of the multilingual American music repertoire.” (Past recipients include Stephen Sondheim, Quincy Jones, and Kris Kristofferson.)


	Malo was unable to attend but sent the following letter to be read to the audience at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium:


Music has been the guiding force of my entire life. It carried me from my Cuban American childhood in Miami to stages across the world. It introduced me to my brothers, the Mavericks. It gave me a home in Nashville, Tennessee. It allowed me to raise my three incredible sons, Dino, Vincent, and Max, who are my greatest pride and joy. And it connected me to you fans whose love has sustained me through every chapter of this journey. This award is not just about accomplishments, it is about commitment. The commitment to creativity, to education, to keeping music alive in the hearts of people everywhere.












I've always believed that music is one of the most powerful bridges we have. It crosses cultures, politics, (and God, don't we need that right now?) languages, and sometimes pain. In these past months, I've had to fight battles I've never imagined. But on the hardest of days, music remained my companion. Your letters, your stories of how a song helped you through loss, heartbreak, joy, those became our songs. You all carried me more than you know. To my family band, the National Music Council, my musical collaborators, and every fan around the world: Thank you for giving my voice a place to live, even when my body cannot be the one delivering it. I accept this award with profound gratitude and with the hope that the music we create continues to inspire, to heal and bring people together.

	Gifted with one of music's most robust and dynamic voices, Malo was known as “El Maestro” among his bandmates and fans. His singing style, powerful and emotive, had the ability to both stun an audience into silence and spur them to their feet. And with world-class musicians behind him, including Malo's co-founders in the group, bassist Robert Reynolds and drummer Paul Deakin, the Mavericks earned a reputation as the most eclectic and entertaining of performers.


	“If you ask 10 different people what the Mavericks mean to them, you're going to get 10 different answers,” Malo told Rolling Stone in 2015. “And then you're going to hear our records and hear one song, and you're going to think this band is like this. Then you're going to hear the next song, and go, ‘Holy shit, this band is nothing like that song that I just heard.'”

Madonna is setting out to prove that she's the OG diva.

With a series of photos posted to her Instagram on Sunday, the singer wrote, “A Good Week for Divas…….💕💘🌸 👛🎀,” while wearing an all-pink look.

The outfit consisted of a pale pink satin corset, bra top, lingerie-inspired skirted bottom, and a pink fur jacket thrown over her shoulder.

On each arm was a long opera-length fingerless lace glove. She wore nude fishnet fights and shaded sunglasses to complete the throwback ensemble.

The look immediately recalls Madonna's style during her “Blond Ambition” tour era in 1990.

The habitual cone bra wearer pulled out her pale pink Jean Paul Gaultier corset top, which she originally wore with black tights and her short, curly, blond bob.

The designer introduced the '50s-inspired style on the runway in 1987. But once Madonna got her hands on it, the icon adopted the style as her own.

What followed was decades of reintroductions of the look, including during the latest “Celebration” tour just two years ago, when she brought back a black version of the corset, also designed by Jean Paul Gaultier.

This weekend, the 67-year-old posed in pink looks with a variety of vignettes, including a racy all-fours pose, with everything from a pink guitar to a bright red notebook — even two of her daughters got in on the action, wearing pink fur and corset looks.

Madonna is currently preparing for her latest album, set for release in 2026, as she returns to Warner Records nearly 20 years after departing the label.

It will be produced by DJ Stuart Price, who worked on “Confessions on a Dance Floor,” suggesting that her homecoming project will be another high-energy record.

Here's hoping that she continues to pay tribute to her legacy with more cone bras and corseted looks during her next musical era.

Bleecker Street has locked down U.S. rights to Buzzkill, a new horror-comedy starring Billy Magnussen (Lilo & Stitch) and Lulu Wilson (The Wrath of Becky) that shoots in Texas early next year. They've slated the film for release in theaters nationwide in 2027.


	Directed by Joe Lynch (Suitable Flesh), Buzzkill is billed as a monster movie with a boozy twist. Magnussen plays Sheriff Red, who while recently widowed and struggling with drinking too much, launches an investigation as townspeople begin turning up murdered and dismembered. He soon discovers that a horrifying creature is stalking the town — and can only be seen by the inebriated. With the annual brewery festival approaching and the entire town preparing for a weekend of heavy drinking, Red must confront his demons to save his town.

	Written by Colin McLaughlin, the film has Wilson playing Red's vengeful younger sister, Lydia. Dane and Cole Eckerle are producing under their Bad Grey banner, alongside Jonathan Schwartz and Nick Shumaker for Anonymous Content, and Magnussen for HappyBad Bungalow. David Levine is executive producing alongside Bleecker Street's Kent Sanderson, Tyler DiNapoli, and Miranda King, with Anne Hollister and Shane Andries acting as co-executive producers. The Veterans is handling international sales for the film. We were first to report on the castings of Magnussen and Wilson.

	In a statement on the Buzzkill acquisition, Bleecker Street CEO Kent Sanderson said, “Bleecker's mandate is, above all else, to bring genres of all kinds to theatergoers, and Buzzkill aims to make the theater into the ultimate, thrilling and blood-soaked party. Joe brings such a distinct voice to his work, and we're excited to be partnering with him and the whole cast.”

	











	Bleecker Street's King and Avy Eschenasy negotiated the deal for the company, with Anonymous Content's Shumaker and UTA Independent Film Group negotiating on behalf of the filmmakers.

Margo may have money problems, but she's lousy with movie stars, at least according to our first look at the new Apple TV series from David E. Kelly, Margo's Got Money Troubles. Returning to television following the cancellation of The Great, Elle Fanning (Predator: Badlands and Sentimental Value) stars as Margo, the titular fiscally troubled young woman, as she tries to make ends meet, alongside a cast that includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Nicole Kidman, Nick Offerman, Marcia Gay Harden, and Greg Kinnear. Produced by A24 for Apple TV, Margo's Got Money Troubles is Kelley's follow-up to last summer's hit mystery, Presumed Innocent, currently in production for season two. Margo takes on a slightly more comedic tone, following a young woman who has an affair with a professor, gets pregnant, and uses her estranged father's (Offerman) pro-wrestling skills to make a killing on OnlyFans.



Here's the synopsis:

Margo's Got Money Troubles is a bold, heartwarming, and comedic family drama following recent college dropout and aspiring writer, Margo (Fanning), the daughter of an ex-Hooter's waitress (Pfeiffer) and ex-pro wrestler, as she's forced to make her way with a new baby, a mounting pile of bills and a dwindling amount of ways to pay them.

Based on Rufi Thorpe's bestseller, the eight-episode first season of Margo's Got Money Troubles premieres on April 15, 2026, with three episodes, with two new episodes streaming every Wednesday through May 20.

Welcome to Rendering, a Deadline column reporting at the intersection of AI and showbiz. Rendering examines how artificial intelligence is disrupting the entertainment industry, taking you inside key battlegrounds and spotlighting change makers wielding the technology for good and ill. Got a story about AI? Rendering wants to hear from you: jkanter@deadline.com.


This week: As Oscar voting gets underway, we speak to filmmakers who have proudly used generative AI in their pursuit of a gold statuette.


	Look under the hood of the 2025 Oscar contenders, and you will find that AI greased the engines of certain movies. Whether it was voice-tweaking on The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez, or the blue eyes of Fremen in Dune: Part II, the technology was deployed and then (somewhat sheepishly) acknowledged during campaigning.

	The big difference in 2026 is qualifying films proudly using generative AI, possibly for the first time in Oscars history. The technology is not just under the hood – in some cases, it is the car itself. This was no accident. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tweaked its rules in April to make clear that the Oscar doors were open to artificial intelligence. “The tools neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination,” the organization said.


	Its proclamation came at a delicate moment in Hollywood's dance with AI. The technology is unavoidably growing in influence, but AI's adoption still repulses many auteurs who have triumphed at the Oscars (Guillermo del Toro has literally been telling AI to go f**k itself in recent weeks). 


	One person who took note of the Academy rule change was Craig Lew. A former Dreamworks animator, he saw an opportunity to “make some history” by being among the first wave of AI-and-proud entries to the awards. 


	His short film, Ahimsa, qualified in the Animated Short Film category after Lew completed an Academy entry form, in which he explained that he used the likes of Runway and Google Veo to create his visuals, even though this transparency was not required. He chatted to Deadline's Rendering column to raise further awareness with voters.

	











Ahimsa tells an earnest story of how AI trained on meditating children heals a world ripped apart by the technology. At first glance, it could be dismissed by detractors as AI slop, but Lew says detailed human work has gone into the final cut. The director used motion capture to bring characters to life, animated AI backgrounds using his VFX skills, and turned to composer Dino Herrmann (Troy) to score the short.


	“It looks like AI because I'm not trying to fool anyone,” he says. “We're ushering in a new look. Does it belong in the Academy race? Yeah, it does. AI is a paintbrush. It's not the painter.”


	Michael Govier and Will McCormack, the Oscar-winning filmmakers behind 2026 Animated Short Film entry All Heart, echo Lew's sentiment, but with one key difference: they used a closed AI model, trained only on their artwork. The duo partnered with Asteria, the AI studio co-founded by Poker Face star Natasha Lyonne, on All Heart, which follows a father who meets a man with a connection to his late daughter.


	“We created original artwork and hand-animated sequences the traditional way, and then we used AI in certain stages to explore visual possibilities, enhance textures, iterate on style, and accelerate look-development,” they explain. “AI didn't replace the artists, it amplifies them.”


	Another Animated Short Film qualifier also features bespoke AI. Mati Granica's Flower_Gan, which won a bronze medal at the Academy's student awards, used a custom-built generative adversarial network to create images of flowers, which he animated to create an anxiety-inducing polemic about the AI arms race.


	Lucas Ansel, director of Oscar-qualified animation The 12 Inch Pianist, a joyful little comedy (in all senses) that uses traditional stop-motion, sees value in tailored AI being a step in a creative workflow. He is uncomfortable, however, with his film sitting alongside competitors using off-the-shelf generative AI platforms that opaquely scrape the internet. “I don't think there's any room for that,” he says. “You're not creating singular, unique art.”


	While a new crop of Oscar contenders are proudly using AI, there is nuance in how they use AI. This distinction is likely to become increasingly important as the industry conversation matures around the technology. Transparency will allow Academy members to vote with their eyes open. That feels like a step in the right direction, even if some may be appalled at the qualification of generative AI movies.

The Academy needs to ban GenAI for Oscars and increase the minimum theatrical window.

Purists projecting or dinosaurs in denial of A. I. are in for a rude awakening. A. I. is the future. There is no going back. Embrace it and learn it or you will be left behind.

This isn't about AI being the future so we should just get used to it.  This is about whether exalting the creative human endeavor includes measuring on- par with machine- generated iterations.  IMO there should be a separate race… a separate classification… a separate category where the measurements are appropriate for the way the film is made.  Don't put Generative AI works up against non- Generative AI works.  That way there's no “yeah, but…” in the comparison.  No asterisk.  Let the use of AI be highlighted separately.

Maybe the STORY can compete with projects that didn't use GenAI, but the crafts and filmmaking process should be compared separately.

Let it be transparent and celebrated openly, but not at the cost of the respect of the overall art form.

A sad day in this hell they call the movie business

Derek Hough and Hayley Erbert are expecting their first child any day now, and the couple could not be more excited. Ahead of the birth of Baby Hough, these are five things we know.

The “Dancing with the Stars” judge and his lovely wife Erbert opened up about something deeply personal in an Instagram post on October 15. They revealed that they had lost a previous pregnancy. Their decision to open up about the loss of a prior pregnancy was to help raise awareness for miscarriage around Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month. 

“We share this part of our story to honor our baby that never made it earthside,” they wrote in the caption of a moving video. 

Hough and Erbert have shared some aspects of their journey into parenthood with fans, but they have chosen to keep other personal details private. They have chosen not to publicly reveal their baby's gender, name, or date of birth. However, they have dropped subtle clues about when Erbert is due to give birth. 

In a video Hough posted on Instagram on December 3, he said their child was due really soon. “I'm going to Chicago, and it's very exciting because it's for Ovation, but also very nervous because this baby could literally come any day,” he said in the video, before showing Erbert and her baby bump. 

Two years ago, Erbert had life-saving brain surgery. She has been on an incredible journey to recovery since, and Hough has been with her every step of the way. In an Instagram post on December 6, she reflected on her strength and how proud she is of herself for overcoming so much. 

She posted a black-and-white photo of herself with her baby bump. In the caption, she wrote a lengthy message, part of which reads, “I'm truly grateful for it all, and so incredibly proud of myself and my body for everything it has endured. What a miracle it is that two years ago I was fighting for my life… and now, here I am creating life.”

Erbert is a strong and beautiful woman, and she has the support and love of the people around her during her pregnancy. This includes Hough, who is incredibly proud of his wife and has publicly praised her. On Instagram on November 23, the professional dancer shared a photo of Erbert cradling her bump. She looks so gorgeous. 

In the caption, Hough penned an emotional message. “Sometimes I look at my beautiful wife, and I'm just in awe. Watching her navigate this pregnancy with such grace, calm, and strength is one of the most beautiful experiences of my life,” he wrote. “In the middle of all the craziness and the whirlwind of life, she's been this serene, almost Buddha-like presence, just so peaceful and strong.”

He continued, “I get emotional thinking about how grateful I am for her resilience and love. After everything she's been through these past few years, the challenges, the losses, and the triumphs, seeing her now carrying new life with such beauty and strength just fills my heart.”

Hough and Erbert speak about their unborn child with so much love and excitement. When they post about their baby, fans, celebrities, and loved ones flood the comment section with messages of support. 

Hough's sister, Julianne Hough, has also praised the couple for their compatibility. “Hayley and Derek are such a beautiful match. They are the perfect combination of creativity and strength, and they give so much love to each other and the people in their lives,” she told People on November 14, around the time of their baby shower. “Britt (Stewart), Jess (Gee) and I knew we needed to throw them the most beautiful shower to honor them and their greatest creation yet.”

	The self-proclaimed “stage invader” who rushed Ariana Grande on the red carpet at the Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore in November was removed from a Lady Gaga concert in Brisbane, Australia.


	Fan-captured videos shared on social media show Johnson Wen, 26, being escorted out of SunCorp Stadium Tuesday, Dec. 9. He attempted to wear a disguise to the event, donning dark sunglasses and a mustache, but was caught before Gaga took the stage for the Mayhem Ball.


	In the circulating videos, security on the floor level of the venue can be seen stripping Wen of his glasses, a lanyard, and multiple wristbands. Meanwhile, nearby fans cheered for his removal and booed his presence. Wen turned to face them all with a smile.


	Representatives for Lady Gaga and SunCorp Stadium did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.

YALL THEY GOT HIM!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/meZ2fwOzp3 pic.twitter.com/TQykBfaVyf


	Wen, who calls himself “Pyjama Man,” posted on Instagram after, “Got kicked out of Lady Gaga concert. The show doesn't start till 8pm. The early fans were booing me.” 

	











	A fan who witnessed the encounter wrote on X, “Many finger snaps to the girl in EE [early entry] who got security and gave them a description of that fuckin weirdo so they could legit just wait for his stupid disguise to try to get in. Actual mental help is needed for that man.”

	Wen previously rushed onto the stage during performances from Katy Perry, the Weeknd, and the Chainsmokers. After grabbing Grande in Singapore, he was charged with being a public nuisance, detained in prison for nine days, and subsequently deported from Singapore back to Australia, where he lives.

	











	Wen's social media posts often attempt to reframe these incidents as normal fan encounters. “I feel like I'm in a dream, that's my best friend Ariana Grande,” Wen said in an Instagram Story uploaded prior to the red carpet attack. “I'm going to meet her, yes, I've been dreaming about that.”

In the spirit of the magic of the season (and in hopes of providing some warm respite from the usual end-of-the-year best-of deluge of stories and their attendant doldrums), IndieWire is proud to present our first-ever Holiday Week.

Writer/director Steven R. Monroe is well known to horror fans for his extremely brutal — and extremely effective — 2010 remake of the exploitation classic “I Spit on Your Grave,” but he never set out to be associated with any particular genre. “I grew up worshiping the directors of the '60s and '70s who didn't get labeled,” Monroe said. “They could direct a drama, then do a horror film or a comedy.”

Although Monroe spent the first several years of his career directing mostly horror and sci-fi, he eventually got the chance to show off his own versatility by wading into a category that's about as far from “I Spit on Your Grave” as you can get: a Hallmark Channel rom-com. In the 10 years since “Pumpkin Pie Wars,” Monroe has directed 20 movies for the network, including holiday films with titles like “A Bramble House Christmas,” “Christmas Connection,” and “Christmas Tree Lane.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Monroe is not alone: There are at least a half-dozen established horror filmmakers who moonlight as TV Christmas movie writers and directors. In some cases “moonlight” isn't even the word, with directors like Ron Oliver, who helmed the cult classic “Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II,” moving almost exclusively into the world of Hallmark rom-coms. Others, like David DeCoteau, bounce back and forth between low-budget horror flicks, woman-in-jeopardy thrillers for Lifetime, and holiday movies like “Christmas Matchmakers” and “The Christmas Intern.”

According to writer and director Michael Varrati, who splits his time between horror films (“A Halloween Trick,” “What's Left Inside”) and TV movies (“A Christmas in Vermont,” “Christmas with a Crown”), scary movies and cozy Christmas fare made for Hallmark and Lifetime have a lot in common. “They're each different kinds of cult films,” Varrati said. “Specific audiences come to each of them looking for a certain kind of heightened reality. Ultimately, once you check into a horror movie or a holiday film, you're leaving the world behind and submitting to a different kind of space.”

As with horror fans, connoisseurs of Christmas rom-coms largely come to the genre to see variations on formulas they've grown to love, Varrati points out. “You have to introduce certain elements. You have to abide by certain rules. In both cases, the audience suspends their disbelief in a multitude of ways so they can get on board,” he explained. 

 










“Most holiday rom-coms, for example, center around some kind of business closing or whatever. No business is going to shut its doors on Christmas Eve; that doesn't happen. But for the mechanics of a story, we believe it. We believe the bakery is gonna close on Christmas unless they get so many cookies sold,” Varrati said, drawing a parallel to horror films and how characters tend to behave less according to logic than the demands of the genre. “There are rules to the slasher genre that we've all culturally agreed to, even though, if there was really a killer running about, none of these things would necessarily apply.”

Satisfying audiences by serving up what they craze about horror or light romance dovetails perfectly with Monroe's ambition to be an old-school Hollywood craftsman. “When you do TV rom-coms, if you're smart, you accept that you are delivering a look and a vibe and a certain product for that network,” he said. “It's not about you, but you use your skill and experience to give the producers and the network what they want and need for their audience.” 

Keeping in mind that Hallmark's Christmas rom-coms have gotten slightly edgier in recent years, Varrati agrees that it's beneficial to know when you can bend the rules and when you have to adhere to them in order to satisfy expectations. “So often people who are new to the world of holiday films will send me a message saying, ‘I'm gonna do one that's different.' And then, their script doesn't get picked up and they don't understand why,” Varrati said. “I get why they think they need to reinvent the wheel, but the wheel exists for a reason. You can make alterations and you can stretch, and the movies do change over the years, but that's because the people who write these movies have made incremental changes and updates. The audience wants familiarity, so you can't pull the rug out from under them immediately.”

 










Like horror movies, Christmas rom-coms also have their own star system that exists somewhat outside of that of more mainstream theatrical movies. “Horror fans tend to love seeing the same faces and the same creators pop up,” Varrati said. “Jamie Lee Curtis being in a horror movie means a lot to horror fans; John Carpenter making a horror movie means a lot. In the same way, Lacey Chabert being in a Christmas movie means a lot to Christmas movie fans.” 

These shared tastes mean that it's not uncommon for people who are dedicated to one genre to have an affinity for another. To that point, Varrati has been surprised to find that many of the horror fans he interacts with at conventions are also fans of Hallmark Christmas movies. “There's more overlap than people realize,” he said. “Ultimately, horror fans are looking for things that strike a specific chord that evokes an emotion, and I think the discerning horror spectator can appreciate the heightened reality of how holiday rom-coms present.” 

Where fans of either genre may deviate is how much leniency they give to filmmakers, specifically. In Monroe's opinion, the internet has made everyone a critic, but holiday movie fans tend to be more forgiving of directors than horror fans, who he said are “hands down the hardest fans on the planet to make happy.” 

 










“You are either a hack to them, or they love you and it changes from film to film,” he said, explaining that, while TV Christmas movie fans are more willing to blame the script or the acting, horror lovers “blame the director for literally every single thing they do not like. I have been slammed for things in horror films that I had no say in whatsoever, but what producer is going to step in and say, ‘No, that was me, not the director?'”

Having the skill sets to able to go back and forth between indie horror and TV Christmas movies, which both tend to be shot on tight schedules and with low budgets, has meant that both Monroe and Varrati have stayed busy over the years. That's thanks in no small part to audiences' seemingly endless appetite for heartwarming holiday movies. (Hallmark cranks out around 40 new Christmas movies every year.) But it's also because scoring a hit means exposure to an enormous global audience, between initial network airings, re-runs, and streaming.

“On the first Christmas movie that I ever co-wrote, the producer told me, ‘If this hits, it will be seen by more people than anything else you ever do, even if you write a big blockbuster,'” Varrati said. “ Because they're part of a holiday, when people love these movies, they fold them into their annual viewing. This piece of art that you made is now as much a part of someone's Christmas as drinking eggnog or baking cookies.”

 










That's another parallel between Christmas rom-coms and horror movies, which tend to get rewatched by fans every year. “Horror fans love watching ‘Friday the 13th' in the summertime. They love watching ‘Halloween' at Halloween. We have holiday horror films like ‘Black Christmas' and ‘Silent Night, Deadly Night,'” Varrati added. “These films are part of the traditions that get us through the year, whether it's for joy or for scares. There's something really special about that.”

	Before we delve into the Grammy nominations for Best Rock Album, a mea culpa is in order: Our predictions were really, really off this year. We looked at wins for Ozzy Osbourne and the Rolling Stones in recent years, and concluded that the Recording Academy was going to stick with the old timers and give the prize to David Gilmour for Luck and Strange. Well, Gilmour wasn't even nominated. They also put up the Cure's Songs of a Lost World and Wet Leg's Moisturizer for Best Alternative Music Album as opposed to Best Rock Album. But, hey, at least we were right about Yunglud's Idols getting the nod. To very roughly paraphrase the words of 1994 Best Rock Vocal Performance, Solo winner Meatloaf, one out of five ain't bad.


Deftones – Private MusicHaim – I QuitLinkin Park – From ZeroTurnstile – Never EnoughYungblud – Idols


	The first big surprise this year was the nomination for Linkin Park's comeback LP, From Zero. It's their first record in seven years, the first since the death of of Chester Bennington, and the formal introduction of new vocalist Emily Armstrong. Linkin Park's sole Best Rock Album nomination came all the way back in 2002 when Hybrid Theory lost out to U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind. And even though From Zero revived the group and got them back on the road, it wasn't universally loved. 

	











	“This was surprising since the reaction has been mixed from a radio perspective,” says Jason Squires, program director of KFRR in Fresno, California. “But they're selling tickets and everything else. I also think they [replaced Bennington] in a good way since they didn't try to get a dude from a tribute or anything like that. They brought in someone completely different. They should be commended for that.”

	











	The Deftones emerged from roughly the same nu-metal scene that birthed Linkin Park back in the Nineties, but they abandoned that sound quite a while ago and have built up a large and loyal following despite flying just below the mainstream cultural radar. Their new LP Private Music is excellent. “It arrived with no gimmick or plea for relevancy,” wrote Rolling Stone‘s Hank Shteamer. “It's simply another great record from an outfit that already sounded fully confident in its core aesthetic — a juxtaposition of grinding alt-metal riffage, and deep, sensuous yearning.”

	Haim's nomination for I Quit isn't surprising because they were put up for Best Rock Performance and Album of the Year in 2021, and 2022's Evermore got the nod for Album of the Year. I Quit was a critical favorite that brought them to venues like New York's Madison Square Garden for the first time. “I really like these ladies,” says SiriusXM DJ Justin Kade. “But they're another act that, much like Machine Gun Kelly, can't find their lane. They're too pop for indie, and too indie for pop. If it were the Nineties, they'd fit in with the Sheryl Crows and Alanis Morissettes, but that sound doesn't really exist in 2025. All that said, music is in their blood, and I really like this album. ‘Down to Be Wrong' and ‘Everybody's Tying to Figure Me Out' are both amazing.”


	Turnstile has yet to win a Grammy despite nominations for Best Metal Performance, Best Rock Song, and Best Best Rock Song and Best Metal Performance Back in 2023. Odds are pretty decent they'll pick up at least one this year because they're up in five categories: Best Alternative Music Performance, Best Metal Performance, Best Rock Performance, and Best Rock Album. The latter nomination is for their new album Never Enough. 


	“Turnstile's much-anticipated follow-up to 2021's massive Glow On is like a mysterious gallery,” wrote Rolling Stone‘s Brenna Ehrlich. “It's not so much a collection of tracks, but impressions, aural vignettes that are more about a feeling than a message — a vibe that listeners can pursue at their leisure, like wandering through an echoing portrait hall.”

	And finally we come to Yungblud's Idols, the sole album we successfulyl predicted would get a Best Rock Album nomination. “He's been embraced by a rock audience more than guys like Machine Gun Kelly or Grandson,” says Kade. “The guys sells tickets. There's already a passion for him. Keep an eye on him as we head into 2026.”

Deftones — Private MusicIt's been nearly a quarter century since the Deftones last scooped up a Grammy, and Private Music is one of their single best albums. “More and more people are coming around to the Deftones and realizing they're not like, say, Kid Rock,” says Squires. “They're a really good band with a heavy vibe. They've finally gotten over the hump of how they've been perceived in this industry. And they're just everything I like about rock music.”


Turnstile – Never Enough This is clearly a breakthrough year for Turnstile since they have five nominations. If they pick up one, expect it to be for Best Rock Album. “They do this post-hardcore thing that's palatable for everyone,” says Squires. “And they're not a nostalgic band. They represent a new generation of rock.”

Katie Couric is opening up about a meaningful moment from her past and reminding followers to hold their loved ones close. On Dec. 5, the journalist shared a throwback photo on Instagram from her 1989 wedding to her late husband, Jay Monahan. In her caption, Couric wrote that the picture resurfaced on her phone unexpectedly and immediately transported her back to their wedding day. She reflected on how neither she nor Monahan could have imagined he would be diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer eight years later.

“It made me think that we never really know what lies ahead and it was a reminder to appreciate every day and cherish those you love,” Couric wrote. She also shared that her husband, John Molner, responded warmly to the photo, adding, “He never feels threatened by Jay's memory and understands a heart has space for two people.” Couric closed her message with a simple reminder: “Tell the people who matter to you that you love them… I approve this message.”

Support quickly poured in from followers and friends. According to comments on her post, Amanda Kloots wrote, “Always need that reminder and I also approve this message,” while Sheryl Crow added, “Beautiful pic and beautiful message, Katie ❤️.”

Couric has remained open about the impact Monahan's passing had on her life. According to People, Monahan passed away in 1998 at age 42, leaving Couric to raise their daughters, Ellie and Caroline. She previously shared that the loss reshaped her understanding of life's fragility and motivated her long-standing commitment to cancer awareness.

Couric often honors Monahan on significant anniversaries. In June, she posted another tribute on what would have been their 36th wedding anniversary, writing that although their time together was cut short, “our love endures, especially in our remarkable daughters.” She added that she misses him “every day, but especially on the important milestones where his absence feels so acute.”

The journalist has spoken candidly about their final months together, sharing in past interviews that she struggled with acknowledging the severity of his illness because she wanted to preserve hope. Despite the heartbreak, she has continued to honor Monahan's memory through advocacy, awareness and storytelling.

Years after losing Monahan, Couric found love again with Molner, whom she married in 2014. The pair celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary earlier this year. Per People, Couric praised Molner for being her “port in the storm” and for always respecting the space Monahan still holds in her heart.

Couric has also remained one of the most visible advocates for cancer screening and early detection. She became a national voice for colon cancer awareness after losing Monahan, later experiencing additional loss when her sister passed away from pancreatic cancer. Couric publicly revealed her own breast cancer diagnosis in 2022 and continues to use her platform to encourage regular screenings.

Couric ended her recent Instagram message with a reminder that resonated deeply with her followers: “Be grateful today… appreciate every day and cherish those you love.”

Take that, haters!

Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet finally put split rumors to rest as they stepped out for a rare red carpet appearance for Monday's Los Angeles premiere of “Marty Supreme.”

The couple — who have been dating for over two years — stunned in matching neon-orange outfits as they posed hand in hand.

The two weren't afraid to pack on the PDA as the “Call Me By Your Name” star's hand never left Jenner's waist.

The 28-year-old even pressed against him lovingly during the step-and-repeat.

For the evening, the “Kardashians” star stunned in a cleavage-bearing, floor-length gown with rib cut-outs. 

She styled her dark tresses straight and wore an attention-grabbing necklace.

Chalamet complemented her look with a neon-orange leather pant and jacket set, matching Timberland boots and a cross-body bag shaped like a table-tennis paddle.

Since debuting their relationship in September 2023 at the Beyoncé “Renaissance” Tour stop, the two have been plagued by breakup rumors due to keeping their love out of the limelight.

Jenner has barely stepped out with Chalamet, 29, at his red carpets — though she is always present to support him.

A source previously told Page Six that Jenner skipped the red carpet for the 2025 Golden Globes — despite attending — because she “didn't want to make it about them.”

“She wanted this night to be all about Timothée, how it was intended to be,” the insider said as Chalamet was nominated for best actor for his role in “A Complete Unknown.”

The source also insisted that “Kylie really is [Chalamet's] best friend and his biggest supporter. 

“They have such a strong connection and he was so thankful she could be there with him.”

For most of the spring, the couple attended multiple basketball and tennis games together. However, they went weeks without seeing each other while Chalamet filmed multiple films, including “Dune.”

The two resurfaced in the south of France in July, where they were seen holding hands, and then again in October at the New York Film Festival.

And though Chalamet skipped Kris Jenner's 70th birthday in November, a source told Us Weekly that he was away filming two huge projects.

Nonetheless, the two have been going strong and spent Thanksgiving together.

"Audiences haven't abandoned theaters; they need a more compelling reason to go," the consultancy highlights, sharing suggestions for how to bring fans back to the cinema in the post-COVID era.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Cinema attendance and box office have remained below pre-COVID pandemic levels, so what can studios and exhibitors do to put people back in recliners and other movie theater seats? Management consulting firm Bain & Co., in a new research report, shares some suggestions and insights.


	The big-picture takeaway from Bain partners Chris Xanthakis, Nicole Magoon, and Daniel Hong: “Successful companies will invest in premiumization, personalization, and partnerships to draw people back to theaters.” After all: “Audiences haven't abandoned theaters; they need a more compelling reason to go.”

	Their new report, which was completed before the Netflix deal for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has raised more concerns about the future of cinemagoing, starts off in an ominous way. “For two decades, movie theaters have consistently wrestled with how to get people into seats. Today, that challenge has become an existential threat,” it highlights. “While consumer spending on video streaming subscriptions surged from 2010 through 2024, North American box-office revenue in real terms fell during the same time frame. Ticket prices in real terms are close to flat since 2010, but the cost of a visit has risen as the increase in concessions revenue per patron has outpaced inflation. As a result, consumers now see cinema as expensive.”

	The pandemic exacerbated these trends, putting them into “overdrive,” as the Bain experts emphasize. “In 2020 and 2021, release schedules collapsed, consumer habits changed, and digital platforms gained ground. Although a 2025 Bain media consumption survey of more than 5,000 US consumers found that about half of them wish they attended more in-person events, this hasn't translated into a recovery for theatrical exhibition, with domestic cinema attendance still just 64 percent of prepandemic levels, according to data as of November from The Numbers.”


	Major studios, meanwhile, have seen the number of their wide releases remain about a fifth below pre-pandemic levels, filling the resulting gap with films from smaller affiliated studios.


	All this comes to a head in what Bain dubs the “Flooded Era,” where media is everywhere, with new technologies enabling “a deluge of ‘good enough' content.” In this environment, “anyone can compete, but not everyone can compete profitably,” the consultancy warns. 


	So, how does the cinema experience fit into this time? Its key benefits are “immersion, spectacle, and shared experiences,” the Bain report highlights. “But this is at odds with people's evolving consumption of media, which is increasingly short-form, interactive, and digital.” Its recommendations focus on premium experiences, community, personalization, and partnerships. 


	The premium offering is a key starting point. “Industry leaders recognize that, more than ever, cinema must reframe itself as a premium experience, not mere content,” the Bain consultants write. “Seeing a movie in theaters is an event, a destination, an experience that is far more affordable than a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert. Theaters can deliver on this promise via premium auditoriums, service, and personalization that can't be replicated at home.”

	











	Part of the experience is a sense of community, Bain argues. “Cinemas can harness community to draw people in,” the company believes. “One path is to provide social spaces and host community events, taking a cue from independent cinemas, which sometimes offer film clubs, themed watch events, and director Q&As.” This social component also translates into social media, such as Instagram and TikTok, memes, video essays, podcasts, reaction videos, and cosplay, according to the consultancy. “Our 2025 media consumption survey found that 64 percent of U.S. location-based entertainment attendees share their experiences on social media,” its report concludes. “This is earned media that cinemas and studios can lean into and actively support.” Data partnerships can further enhance the hunt for opportunities.


	But what content draws in the “Flooded Era”? Bain suggests players should “remain fresh with new content and new formats” in addition to big, established franchises. “Owning popular IP remains key. In 2024, the top-grossing U.S. films were overwhelmingly franchise extensions of original IP,” the Bain report emphasizes. “But great IP and large marketing budgets alone don't guarantee movie success, and they're insufficient” in a world where many a theater seat remains empty. “Audiences crave novelty. Note the perennial breakout successes of innovative original movies, live streams, and concert films. … In response, we expect more theaters will forge new kinds of partnerships to deliver creative content and innovative formats for customers.” In this context, concert movies and live sports “have shown that there are other ways to draw audiences to movie theaters,” the consultancy highlights.

	











	“Cinema executives recognize that they have no choice but to reimagine the movie theater experience,” the Bain team concludes. The winning companies will invest in premium, personalized offerings that can't be replicated at home.”

Jim Caviezel, who famously starred as Jesus in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, is playing ex-Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro in a biopic written by his former Culture Secretary.


	The movie, Dark Horse, appears to be painting a positive portrait of one of Brazil's most controversial political figures of all time. Bolsonaro's son Carlos posted a photo on X of himself with Caviezel in costume as his father. “I know your legacy will continue to be admired by good people and envied by those who seek destruction – yet the message you imprint with every step leaves its mark on the world,” he wrote.

	According to World of Reel, the film started shooting three months ago, was shot in English and is described as being a “heroic” portrait of Bolsonaro. It appears to be based on Bolonaro's 2018 campaign for the presidency. It is directed by Cyrus Nowraste and written by Mário Frias, who was Bolsonaro's Culture Secretary.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The news comes a fortnight after Brazil's supreme court ordered that Bolsonaro begin serving a prison sentence of 27 years and three months for plotting a coup after he lost the last election. The controversial figure was close with Donald Trump and Trump has criticized his arrest and incarceration.


	Caviezel's past credits include The Thin Red Line and The Count of Monte Cristo. The devout Christian is probably best known for playing Jesus in Gibson's Passion of the Christ, after which he did less mainstream Hollywood work. In 2023, he appeared in the controversial Sound of Freedom and was seen at a number of QAnon-affiliated events.

	











	Deadline has reached out to Caviezel's reps.

Something tells me this right-wing revisionist film nobody will see will omit the man's murder plot against his VP and a judge. Oh, and they'll show the ‘heroic' Trump standing by his fellow election-denier.

The 2020 U.S. election wasn't rigged and stolen. Trump was solely responsible for the attack on our nation's capitol by his own supporters. The Right's attempt to rewrite history won't work. 

Donald Trump lost that election, then lost his court challenges due tonlack of evidence for his conspiracy claims. And notice he didn't appeal. Rather, he took to the media to spread his lies and gin up the redhats, already pissed about Covid restrictions and BLM protests. We  watched him tell the crowd to “fight like hell” to “stop the steal.” When all hell broke loose, he did nothing for three hours except tweed his own vice president's life in danger because he wouldn't go along with his plot to subvert the election. 

Parallel propaganda like this crap ain't gonna change the narrative. And if you're a Christian like Caviezel, you are a hypocrite for supporting Trump and his inhumane brutality towards the poor, the homeless, people of color, migrants, and refugees.

Bolsonaro didn't just plot a coup. He planned to murder a shit-ton of newly elected officials. And it would've happened had a couple of military leaders not backed out.  Let him rot. 

And Caviezel continues to be a disgraceful Qanon wack-job. Good riddance to his career.

They've got soccer goals.

The Moms of the Upper East Side Facebook group has sparked another controversy: An anonymous member allegedly posted a tone-deaf message asking advice on flying private to her son's travel soccer games.  

“My son is joining a travel soccer team. He has never flown commercial and I haven't flown commercial in a while,” wrote the anguished mum in a post to the private group seen by Page Six.

“Would it be wrong of me to fly private while my son flies with the team in coach? I know that parents often serve as chaperones so I am thinking about hiring his former nanny to serve as a chaperone,” posted the parent.

“Am I a bad parent,” they then wondered to the group. “I want to support him but I want to be comfortable and not travel coach and stay at Holiday Inns. I feel like it's OK and actually better that he get exposed to flying commercial.”

The message to the group with over 35,000 members sparked polarizing replies, parodies and some saying it can't be real. (Page Six has anecdotally heard enough about private jets and travel sports to know that it is a thing among the upper crust.)

Either way, replies included remarks such as, “Can you adopt me,” “What did ChatGPT recommend” and “You're the worst,” as well as, “My friend's kid was on a team a few years ago where some of the parents had planes. Turns out flying the coaching staff private helped with playing time.”

Others accused the post as being pure “rage bait.”

Another commenter chimed in by saying, “Girl fly private if that's what you normally do… Trust me I get it. You can never turn right again when you get on a plane and I've flown private a handful of times.”

Someone else joked in a parody post, “My son is joining a travel baking team and competing for the Great British Bakeoff. The rest of the team is riding by boat in steerage,” before getting more ridiculous from there.

TikToker Bryce Gruber then picked up on the controversy and posted about it in her popular feed. 

The group's rival chain, UES Mommas, was previously featured in The Post when it was mysteriously temporarily shut down to the delight of the Moms of the Upper East Side group.

The UES moms groups have previously been mired in various controversies involving topics from Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to BLM to giving out-of-touch advice about keeping kiddies warm with “cashmere socks.”

	Over the weekend, Donald Trump dubbed Jimmy Kimmel a “horrible” host, proclaiming that he would do a better job helming the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday night. Kimmel was quick to fire back on the latest episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, noting that there's a reason the president doesn't typically host the annual honors.


	“He's been boasting about hosting, saying, ‘We've never had a president host the Kennedy Center Honors before,' which, yeah, why do you think that is?” Kimmel said. “We've also never had Neil Patrick Harris order a military strike on a fishing boat before.


	“Trump was obviously very excited to headline this once-prestigious event,” Kimmel continued. “He even waddled the red carpet, where he was all fired up.” Kimmel then played a clip of Trump telling reporters that Kimmel is one of the “not so great” hosts.


	“That is very hurtful. I thought we were friends,” Kimmel responded. “I don't know what's going on. He is really fixated. I'm starting to think he might have a crush on me.”

	Kimmel played a second clip in which Trump declared, “I've watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible, and some of these people, if I can't beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don't think I should be president.”


	“Agreed,” Kimmel replied. “I'm with you. I don't think I've ever agreed with anything more than that. Do you think he even knows I've never hosted the Kennedy Center Honors? Maybe he's confusing me with Queen Latifah. As far as this ‘Who has more talent?' thing goes, it seems like he's challenging me to a contest. Which, if so, I'm open to it. Let's do it. Let's have a talent competition. I'll come out, I'll tell a few jokes, I'll draw something, I'll play my clarinet. He can play golf, spank a porn star, and ruin a country.”

	











	Later, Kimmel told the audience he renewed his deal to host Jimmy Kimmel Live! until May 2027, as announced Monday.


	“I was giving a lot of thought and decided I would like to spend less time with my family, and so to our audience here and at home, I'm honored and humbled to be a part of your routine,” Kimmel said. “Whether it's in bed at night, or during your morning toilet time. It means a lot to me to have your attention and to work with this great group of people for another year.”

	Kimmel's ABC deal was reportedly finalized over the summer — before the network's September suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, following a monologue in the wake of Charlie Kirk‘s murder. That suspension, which came after heavy pressure from the Trump administration, conservative activists, and network affiliates, was billed as “indefinite.” It ended up lasting just a few days, after it prompted a ferocious backlash of its own, with consumers apparently canceling their Disney+ subscriptions en masse and actors and other showbiz figures condemning ABC and its parent company, Disney.

	Kimmel returned to the show with a studio audience chanting his name. His 17-minute monologue, in which he said it was “never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” drew 6.26 million viewers, making it the most-watched regular episode in the show's history.

"I'd met him before, and he's always very personable and very pleasant."

	She wasn't afraid, or petrified. No, Gloria Gaynor actually had a “wonderful” meeting with Donald Trump ahead of the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday, Dec. 7, when she was honored alongside Sylvester Stallone, KISS, George Strait, and Broadway legend Michael Crawford.

	On the red carpet ahead of the show, Gaynor was full of praise for the controversial president, who had welcomed this year's class to the White House the previous day.

	“It was wonderful,” she told People. “It was, I mean, like the third or fourth time meeting him,” the veteran singer said. “I'd met him before, and he's always very personable and very pleasant.”


	Gaynor also admitted that Trump didn't reveal exactly why she got the nod, making her the only woman celebrated during its 48th incarnation, “just that he, you know, believed that my song had done so much for so many people.”


	As previously reported, Trump — who also now serves as chairman of the vaunted performing arts house — broke with tradition and became the first President to host the annual gala.


	And through prerecorded videos, he introduced every honoree, ensuring a constant presence throughout the show, whether he was on stage or not. 


	The latest edition will be broadcast on CBS (select Paramount+ customers will also be able to stream the show) on Dec. 23 at 8 p.m. ET/PT

	











	Gaynor, now 82, was thrilled with getting her dues. “I was in shock,” she told People on hearing the news that she was tapped by the Kennedy Center board, which was installed by Trump earlier this year. “I was literally in shock. Are you serious with me?”


	She added, “I mean, really, it's so wonderful to be counted among all these other great artists, and with all of their accomplishments. I'm blessed.”


	After Gaynor was announced as an honoree for this year's honors, many fans spoke up asking the artist — who is widely considered a gay icon thanks to her perennial anthem — not to accept the honor or attend the ceremony out of protest for Trump's mistreatment of the LGBTQ+ community. 


	Gaynor has repeatedly declined to define her political affiliations in the past. However, a report from MediasTouch revealed that, according to FEC records, Gaynor donated almost $22,000 to right-wing politicians starting in 2023, including candidates like Mike Johnson, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz and Marsha Blackburn.

	On the latest episode of The Daily Show, Jon Stewart remarked on President Donald Trump receiving the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize on Friday, which took place amid his administration's threats to take military action against Venezuela.


	FIFA President Gianni Infantino — a vocal supporter of Trump's campaign to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which was ultimately awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado — presented the accolade to Trump, praising him on Friday for his “exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace and unity around the world.”


	“Oh, my God! He won the prize specifically created to appease him,” said Stewart during his monologue, feigning surprise before suggesting a new title for the honor: “The FIFA Appease Prize.”


	The host then rolled footage of Trump receiving the award during the ceremony held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where Trump previously took over as the board chair. In the clip, Trump plucks the award's accompanying medal from its box and places it over his head. “He's so thirsty he's not even gonna bag it,” commented Stewart. “He's like, ‘No, I'll just wear it out of the store. No worries.'”

	Stewart continued, “The craziest part wasn't necessarily Donald Trump being awarded an entirely fictitious golden butt plug. It was the cognitive dissonance of flipping over to the news channels, post-peace ceremony.” The host cut to news clips claiming that the Trump administration is “ramping up the pressure” on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and that the United States is “on the brink of war with Venezuela.”

	“The brink of war? President Trump, did this meaningless award mean nothing to you?” the host said. “By the way, if you think they're not serious about Venezuela, they seem to be setting a pretty nice table.”


	“America's new foreign policy is basically this: Don't kill people there [the Middle East]; kill them over here [South America], in your own time zone. It's classic advice: Shit where you eat,” Stewart pressed. “That's the new Trump doctrine. It's not in any way about stable democracies. It's about spheres of influence. Russia can have their sphere of influence, including Ukraine. China can have theirs, and probably Taiwan, and we get South America. America is no longer the shining city on the hill. It is merely just one of the five crime families, splitting up the territories.”

At the beginning of the year, Kara-Lis Coverdale hadn't released any recorded music since 2017. Then it all came pouring out. The Canadian composer's first full-length of 2025, From Where You Came, was a summation of how she spent the intervening years: staging sound-bath installations in saunas, playing in the ensembles for Floating Points and Tim Hecker, and composing for chamber orchestras, choirs, and her childhood love, the pipe organ. While that record's dreamy, digi-orchestral atmospherics sometimes gave way under the weight of re-establishing Coverdale as an album artist, two subsequent projects have scoped out the periphery of her practice and been more compelling for it. A Series of Actions in a Sphere of Forever takes the acoustic piano as its near-single-minded focus, while Changes in Air loosens that restriction only slightly to incorporate organ and modular synthesizer into a drone piece. Together, they form a treatise on the lingering note.

As a percussive instrument, once struck, the piano cannot crescendo. A note's expiration, however, can be prolonged. On A Series of Actions, Coverdale draws out the vapor trails from each key. The record is atmospheric in the most literal sense, like a collection of weather phenomena all taking place well above the Arctic Circle. Coverdale also foregrounds the material components of her chosen instrument—wood, steel, ivory—and its physical limitations. You can hear her audibly press the sustain pedal into gear on the Ruins-esque “In Charge of the Hour,” while “Lowlands” creates, through what must be a trick of microphone placement, the effect of being positioned below her foot, capturing those distinctive (and familiar, to anyone who took childhood piano lessons) whooshes and creaks. At the climax of “Turning Multitudes,” which by this point has woven a weir out of Ravel, Sakamoto, and Satie, Coverdale seems to reach for a note higher than the highest she can play.

A Series of Actions' final chord mirrors the first notes of Changes in Air, but the tone, both timbral and emotional, is warmer, rounder, homier. Each of the album's five movements is arranged to mimic a different elemental substrate, though in what way these building blocks guided Coverdale remains ambiguous without further annotation. A better way to describe opener “Strait of Phrase” would be like sonar suspended in honey, each of its waveform oscillations wide enough to skip rope with. Then again, “Labyrinth 1” possesses a certain sculptural quality, seeming to rotate as if suspended from an invisible string. “Boundlessness” is even more tactile, grounded by a persistent clacking not unlike the sound of nail extensions tapping absentmindedly on a desk. Changes in Air neatly inverts the structure of its predecessor: where A Series of Actions strewed a sparing few twinkles across a vast empty space, here Coverdale throws open the blinds and floods every nook with light.

When different frequencies collide in midair, they form overtones, pitches that can be heard without ever being played. Coverdale has described A Series of Actions as “an exploration of harmony in space” and the same could be said of her 2025 oeuvre as a whole. The body of work—which has also included site-specific performances at Berlin's Kraftwerk and Portugal's Braga 25 festival—hums with unexpected resonances. Part the new age haze of From Where You Came to reveal the icicle-sharp A Series of Actions and oaken-tough Changes in Air as individual mechanisms within its intricate machinery. Each arguably surpasses the more “definitive” work because there's no resting on pretty and nowhere to hide. To sit at a piano is to confront head-on the constraints of the body, of only having 10 fingers, two feet, and a finite wingspan.

Disney is staying in the Jimmy Kimmel business. After falling for a bad-faith conservative cancel culture campaign in September, briefly sidelining the late-night host in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Disney has extended Kimmel's contract through May 2027. Per Bloomberg, which first reported on the extension, his contract was initially set to expire in May 2026.

The fracas between Kimmel and Disney began when FCC chair Brendan Carr more or less instructed affiliate groups to preempt Kimmel's show after Carr misunderstood and then played right into Kimmel's criticism of the conservative reaction to Kirk's murder. Politically minded affiliates followed suit. Nexstar Media Group, which is hoping Carr's FCC will approve its $6.2 billion acquisition of its competitor Tenga, and Sinclair Broadcast Group, best known for poisoning public television with hyper-conservative “must run” segments, pulled the show. Both held out longer than ABC, which reinstated Kimmel about a week after suspending him. Eventually, Kimmel returned to Nexstar and Sinclair affiliates as well.

To those who canceled their Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions in protest of Disney's knee-jerk decision-making, Mr. Kimmel owes you his gratitude. It turns out that mocking President Trump publicly and not caving to every empty threat is good for ratings—a message we hope NBC hears as the President pressures the FCC to go after Seth Meyers.

Romeo Santos and Prince Royce make a splash across Billboard charts with their collaborative album, Better Late Than Never, as set opens at Nos. 1 and 2 on the Top Tropical Albums and Top Latin Albums charts (dated Dec. 13).


Better Late Than Never was announced as a surprise launch on social media just days prior to its Nov. 28 release via I Love Amiguita/Sony Music Latin. It debuts at No. 1 on Top Tropical Albums with 23,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the tracking week ending Dec. 4, according to Luminate.

	











	Of the 13-track set's opening total, streaming accounts for 17,000 units, equal to 24.1 million official on-demand audio and video streams of the album's songs. This secures a debut at No. 41 on the Top Streaming Albums chart, marking the first appearance for both Santos and Royce. Meanwhile, 7,000 units stem from album sales, enough for a No. 38 debut on Top Album Sales.




Better Late Than Never marks the seventh No. 1 for both artists, tying them with Juan Luis Guerra for the fifth-most chart-topping albums among all acts on Top Tropical Albums. They trail Gilberto Santa Rosa and Victor Manuelle who both lead with 12 No. 1s, El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico with 10 hits, and Marc Anthony with nine.


	Santos' previous effort, Formula. Vol. 3, dominated for 16 weeks between 2022-23. As for Royce, the new release arrives just six months after his album Eterno secured a No. 3 high in May.


	In addition to its No. 1 arrival on Top Tropical Albums, Better Late Than Never also starts at No. 2 on the overall Top Latin Abums chart and at No. 32 on the all-genre Billboard 200, their seventh career entry each on the latter.


A Weekly Record on Hot Latin Songs: Better Late Than Never ushers in nine total appearances for the album's tracks on the multimetric Hot Latin Songs chart — the most debuts in a single week among acts that primarily record tropical music. Additionally, Royce lands another entry with his cover of Backstreet Boys' “I Want It That Way” at No. 30. Among the new debuts, “Dardos” leads with a No. 8 start with 3.3 million official on-demand streams earned during the tracking period. This new top 10 becomes Royce's highest entry since his collaboration on “Sensualidad,” with DJ Luian & Mambo Kingz, Bad Bunny and J Balvin (2017). Santos achieves his 23rd top 10, tying with Gloria Estefan for the third-most among tropical acts, trailing only Marc Anthony's 27 top 10s.


	Here is the full rundown of Better Late Than Never songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart:


	No. 8, “Dardos”No. 12, “Lokita Por Mí”No. 13, “Estocolmo”No. 14, “Better Late Than Never”No. 28, “Jezabel”No. 29, “Ay! San Miguel”No. 36, “Celeste”No. 40, “La Última Bachata”No. 41, “Encerrados”

Chuck E. Cheese restaurants may be a relic of the past, but Five Nights At Freddy's might turn out to be show business' future. Five Nights At Freddy's 2, the sequel to Freddy Fazbear's first adventure in child endangerment, scored a $63 million opening weekend. That might buy a lot of rounds of skeeball, but it is $20 million less than the original's $83 million opening. Nevertheless, sandwiched between two massive offers to buy Warner Bros. and further consolidate the entertainment industry, the efforts of Freddy, Bonnie, and, yes, even Chica, will not go unnoticed. Gen Z loves their Chuck E. Cheese-set Easter egg hunt, and as long as they're willing to pay to see it in theaters, we're not going to complain—at least, not outside of our review we're not.

Still, while Five Nights might be suffering from diminishing returns, it's worth noting that competition was more cutthroat this year. In 2023, Fazbear only had Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert film to contend with. Why Five Nights 2 didn't open in October is beyond us. Without another horror film in the mix, the underwhelming Black Phone 2 ran the table and made Mason Thames a box office juggernaut. Instead of being counterprogramming for Regretting You and Tron: Ares over Halloween weekend, Freddy competed with the second week of Zootopia 2, which eeked out $43 million, and the third weekend of Wicked: For Good, grossing $17 million.

There were other new releases in the mix, too. GKIDS released ‌Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution, a recap of the anime ‌ ‌Jujutsu Kaisen‘s second season, to $10 million from 1,800 screens. (We look forward to seeing a recap of The Bear season four on the big screen someday.) And even with the bad press generated by his Paul Dano opinions, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair earned $3.42 million. That's not bad for a four-and-a-half-hour version of a 20-year-old movie re-released on fewer than 2,000 screens. It was only slightly below the fourth week of Now You See Me: Now You Don't, which added $3.48 million to its $55 million take. There's also the slowly expanding Hamnet, earning another $2.3 million this weekend. Variety is the spice of life, though, and those without the stomach for Shakespearean grief porn had Broadway on their side. Near the bottom of the top 10 was another new release, the filmed version of Broadway's Merrily We Roll Along, grossing $1.3 million.

Here's the full top 10:

Writer/director Craig Brewer and cinematographer Amy Vincent first worked together 20 years ago on “Hustle and Flow,” the movie that launched Brewer's career and won two awards at Sundance, including one for Vincent's cinematography. For Vincent, it was a key formative moment in her evolution as a director of photography.

“We started together very early in our careers, and we learned together,” Vincent told IndieWire. “We were both learning about life, and collaboration, and filmmaking. And I think foundationally, when you grow up with somebody, you end up having shared tastes in many things. Then, when you go away and work outside the partnership, you come back with more gold.”

This Christmas, Vincent comes back to work with Brewer for the first time since 2011's “Footloose” on “Song Sung Blue,” an exuberant musical about two musicians in love (played by Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson) who attempt to fulfill their dreams by forming a Neil Diamond cover band together. The movie is vintage Brewer, an intelligent audience-pleaser filled with heart and style and unabashed but fully earned sentiment and humor.

 










It's also the most visually dazzling film Vincent and Brewer have made to date, a thoughtfully designed balance between naturalism and theatricality in which the lighting and lensing serve as the perfect cinematic corollary to the characters' optimism and striving in the face of brutal reality. “We started out with this incredible source material,” Vincent said, referring to Greg Kohs' 2009 documentary about the real-life couple on whom “Song Sung Blue” is based. “It was an extraordinary reference.”

The documentary gave Vincent a baseline of reality on which to build, but it quickly became clear that a gritty vérité style was not going to be appropriate for the film. “You cast movie stars like Hugh and Kate and there becomes an essential need to embellish just because of those movie star faces,” she said. “There was a danger of those movie star faces and a more raw documentary reference being in conflict with each other.” 

Working in close collaboration with production designer Clay Griffith, Vincent kept a tight control over the color palette and set decoration to give the movie a precise design that wouldn't compromise the truth of the characters and their circumstances. “There's a lot of work that goes into the creation of chaos and cluttered living spaces,” Vincent said. Shooting in real environments — the movie favored actual locations over sets — added to the sense of authenticity, as did certain choices Vincent and Brewer made about the camera that went against the cinematographer's ingrained sense of classicism.

 










“We had a lot of tiny, manual, human zooms in the movie,” Vincent said. “In the wedding scene, for example, there are these little push-ins on Hugh and Kate. They're manually operated, and it just makes you feel like there's a human being in the room as opposed to a more clinical, mechanical approach.” Whereas earlier in her career Vincent stuck to a more rigorously disciplined approach, she credits the trust that has built between her and Brewer with allowing her to “incorporate tools that I might have avoided before.”

Where Vincent was able to go back to her classical roots was in the lighting, which has a luminous shimmer reminiscent of the kinds of Hollywood musicals that represent the kinds of lives to which the heroes of “Song Sung Blue” aspire. The film's early 1990s setting gave Vincent what she called “an extraordinary excuse” to work with the kind of tungsten and incandescent lighting that has fallen out of fashion in the age of LED fixtures.

 ”My gaffer would say I use more hot lights than anybody he's worked with in a long time,” Vincent said, adding that using fixtures that were from the period was not only aesthetically appropriate but a practical necessity, since for many of the concert sequences the lights were actually visible in the shots. “It allowed me to embrace the Kelvin scale of colors, which I find so pleasing. There's nothing more beautiful to me than the natural colors from 2200 degrees Kelvin all the way up to the deep blues in the 10,000s.”

 










Vincent incorporated those colors into a grand finale concert sequence that serves as one of the movie's most rousing set pieces, thanks largely to the slightly exaggerated, saturated palette, and the cinematographer was able to be particularly precise, thanks to the fact that the lights were also incorporated into the production design. “Being able to photograph the lights is such a privilege, because you can put the light exactly where it needs to be.”

Vincent worked with theatrical lighting designer Christina See, whose experience working with bands like Pearl Jam in the 1990s added to the overall sense of authenticity. “The theatrical part of the movie was treated like a real concert,” Vincent said, noting that she and Brewer looked at footage from Neil Diamond concerts as well as the 1984 Prince vehicle “Purple Rain” — another movie that, like “Song Sung Blue,” utilized gel-covered PAR can stage lights to stunning effect — for inspiration. “Partly because we had to load in and out of the Ritz Theatre in Elizabeth, New Jersey, according to their production schedule.”

Vincent felt that the climactic concert represented the convergence of everyone on the movie's talent, from the actors to the crew. “It was a triumphant collaboration all the way around,” Vincent said. “I remember Hugh and Kate being there in their civilian clothes for the tech rehearsal, and I overheard Hugh say to Kate, ‘Can you believe we get to do this for a living?' I think that was the feeling all the way around, which speaks to the work environment Craig creates.”

 










“Song Sung Blue” will be released in theaters on Christmas Day.

So scary

Celebrity confessions don't usually involve ghosts poking around a hotel room in the middle of the night, but Cazzu, the Argentine trap queen known for turning personal stories into powerful lyrics, shared a tale that felt straight out of a supernatural thriller. 

The moment unfolded during her stop in Mexico for her Latinaje tour. Touring can be exhausting — the lights, the stage, the adrenaline, the endless interviews — but nothing could've prepared her for what happened when she finally lay down to rest. The singer thought she was in for a peaceful night. 

During an appearance on the Colombian show La Mega, Cazzu spilled the full story. She explained that the hotel seemed perfectly normal. Two days in, zero drama. No strange noises, no flickering lights, no vibes that scream run. Just a regular room in a regular hotel. At least until night three.

As she was drifting off to sleep, the curtains decided to go rogue. “And well, night came, and I said ‘How nice, I'm going to sleep.' I was super relaxed. I went to sleep and suddenly… I don't know, I was falling asleep, very peacefully. And suddenly, as I was drifting off, the curtains — which had a button on the wall pretty far away — started opening on their own. They opened completely,” she narrated.

Cazzu, being a responsible human who had no interest in starring in her own haunting, called in backup. Enter Titi, her tour partner. “The curtains opened again right in front of him,” the Argentine artist said. “And I was like: ‘I'm scared.' So I got up, looked around, and I had left a little light on because… obviously. And suddenly everything was dark. So I sent a message to Titi, who was nearby, and I said: ‘Titi, are you asleep yet? I think you're going to have to come sleep with me,'” she said.

But even with fresh company and a second pair of eyes, the eerie scene repeated itself. “Titi arrived, there was another bed over there, he lay down, said a prayer, everything. And we were falling asleep and suddenly, just when we were about to drift off, it happened again,” she added.

To top it off, in the middle of the chaos, Cazzu received a message from a friend. “I get a message. A friend of mine, who has some crazy powers, wrote me: ‘Is everything okay?' And I'm like: ‘Guys, help.' And well, that's my paranormal story,” she concluded.

By the end of her retelling, she admitted they didn't sleep at all.

Conspiracy theories circulate so persistently now that they spring easily to mind. The COVID-19 virus, as the malign fantasy goes, did not arise from animal disease reservoirs or from sloppy and risky laboratory processes. Instead, it is a bioweapon devised by evil Chinese geniuses to undermine American hegemony.

And here are two more. A future (and soon-to-be ex) congresswoman rode to office on the claim that solar-powered energy weapons engineered by a devious, ancient banking family ignited California wildfires to, now get this, clear the way for a rapid-rail project. Then, the truth behind the rapidly intensifying Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Milton of 2024 and the deadly Texas flooding in 2025? Sinister geoengineers have deployed weather-control technology to skew election results.

Can we disprove these silly, malicious claims? Certainly, we cannot. After all, Fu Manchu will stay in the shadows. Even our most penetrating radar arrays cannot detect miniaturized space lasers. Now think, take a leap in faith; controlling the weather is not so hard if you conspire with aliens.

These claims do not leave us helpless because extraordinary declarations demand extraordinary support. We could probe for detail, and of the claimants, call for even a shred of supporting proof.

Who are these evil geniuses? Why did their designer pathogens also infect their own population? Is it possible to shrink a powerful laser? How is it that we failed to notice the plasma bolts and searing beam blasts? Or what technology could possibly steer a cyclone? Wouldn't direct-mail campaigns better tilt an election?

The cleverest conspiratorialists will respond with ever weaker and more elaborate evasions and excuses that mean to turn the tables on a reasonable listener. When pressed, the various claimants will ask, “Can you prove otherwise?”

The question is meant to be confounding. Of course we cannot. We cannot when the absence of evidence is itself construed as evidence.

In a thought-piece written in 1952, the British philosopher and mathematician, Bertrand Russell, roguishly explored the resilience of fanciful and unfounded claims. He playfully turned the tables back on unsupportable assertions by placing the burden of proof where it properly belongs, on the claimant.

For the crux of his argument, he devised a mischievous analogy.

Suppose he were to assert that an ordinary table piece, a china teapot, were circling the sun somewhere between the orbits of Earth and Mars? “Nobody would be able to disprove my assertion,” Russell cautioned, “provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes.”

This provision seems to trap the listener, as arguments against the floating teapot are seemingly no stronger than arguments for. For starters, how could we deny the existence of a space-teapot if we can't even find it?

Russell pointed out that if the proposition of orbiting extraterrestrial household crockery cannot be disproved, it is still “talking nonsense” to say that it is proven. Logically, the lack of evidence cannot add up to evidence. The same goes for claims of mystery particle beams and elusive super villains.

But, sticking with the teapot, the philosopher moved one step further into the territory that psychiatrists claim. What if, he asked, “the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school?” Non-belief would become a “a mark of eccentricity,” he noted wryly. Or in former times, might consign the heretic to the flames.

Russell underlined the obvious, that “it is customary to suppose that, if a belief is widespread, there must be something reasonable in it.” And there lies the danger. Over time, the wisdom of the crowd caused fathomless suffering of the conquered and the colonized, the enslaved, the marginalized, and the persecuted.

So. What if millions fervently believe that dark, conspiratorial religious forces control our world? (Antisemitism lurks in conspiracy theories.) What if the claim that meticulously monitored elections can be stolen is drummed by revered rabble-rousers? (A pilfered election has become an article of faith among true believers.) What if uncredentialed appointees assert that clinical trials suppress evidence that vaccines or painkillers cause neurodevelopmental disorders? (And what of the children left unprotected?) What if a president, himself, insists that climate crisis, plain to see and feel, is a hoax?

Are we not being asked, insistently, to prove that the unprovable isn't true? Are we riding the orbiting teapot?

The questions Russell raised three-quarters of a century ago pose unresolvable tensions for today.

Clinicians still struggle to articulate the difference between delusion and devotion. But practically, drawing a sharp distinction is still a headache.

Delusion, so the DSM holds, comprises fixed preoccupations rooted in extreme, false, overvalued, and harmful belief, individually adhered to and impossible to shake. By contrast, the clinical bible now frames faith generously as shared, sanctioned by tradition, confirmed by culture, bolstering, harmonious with reality, and as the text indicates, also open to doubt.

These last three factors prove hardest to sustain because fanaticism is no stranger to devotion. In some fundamentalist corners, apostasy, once a capital crime, is still punished severely. Women still often bear the brunt of oppressive theocracy. Modern observers, for instance, feel hard pressed to distinguish visions and revealed “locutions” from visual and verbal hallucination.

And this brings us to a real headache, the chronic kind that beset a 12th-century abbess, Hildegarde of Bingen, likely the composer of exquisite, dreamy medieval chant that church choirs still sing. She is less well known for her compelling art. Her illustrations and diary sketches picture the mystical, floating, draining, cloudlike state that she would fall into. Episodes during which she would hear the voices of angels.

For modern explainers, crucially, her compositions feature bursts of intense flashing light, sparking stars, and jagged lines.

Reaching back, it is useful to note that Sigmund Freud regarded religion as “wishful thinking”— at best an “illusion” (though the German original is closer to “deception”), and a “universal obsessional neurosis” at worst. “It was forbidden to raise questions of their authenticity,” he wrote. Freud's aim, by contrast, was to deploy the rational—psychoanalysis—against the irrational. Hopefully, the mystifying would yield to dogged, rational examination.

And so, those of us who experience the “fortification hallucinations” of migraine aura—a neon Las Vegas skyline that sizzles nauseatingly over half a visual field—will recognize a fellow, distant sufferer in Saint Hildegarde.

U.S. President Donald Trump was “fully briefed” on crashed UFOs, non-human bodies, and even alien–human hybrids living secretly among us, according to explosive new claims from whistleblower and retired Air Force Major David Grusch.

U.S. President Donald Trump was 'fully briefed' on crashed UFOs, non-human bodies, and even alien–human hybrids living secretly among us, according to explosive new claims from whistleblower and retired Air Force Major David Grusch



Grusch - now an advisor to Congress's UAP Task Force and the man who helped ignite Washington's UFO obsession - told Fox News that “members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality”, including the President.



He added Trump is “very knowledgeable on this subject”.



Grusch claimed the President received detailed reports on downed craft, extraterrestrial remains, and the intentions of multiple alien species.



To date, no physical evidence has ever been presented to the public, and the U.S. government continues to deny having retrieved alien technology.


But Grusch insisted he personally saw classified materials, such as intelligence memos, photographs and data describing non-human bodies. 


He said Trump was briefed on at least four alien races - including so-called Nordics, who resemble fair-skinned humans and allegedly produced hybrid offspring.


Missouri congressman Eric Burlison backed up parts of the account, saying Grusch told him Nordics are “a few hundred years more advanced than we are” and that “there are aliens that are crossbreeds living in the world”.


Grusch also described another species - the Greys - as thousands of years more advanced and capable of piloting craft with their minds.


As for whether extraterrestrials come in peace, Grusch says the U.S. has observed “a mixed bag of activity”. 


He suggested: “Could it be because we have interesting genetic material on Earth? We're a Jurassic Park tourist attraction for them.”


Despite once promising to declassify UFO files, Trump has also admitted he's “never been convinced” by alien claims. 


Still, Grusch believes Trump could become “the most consequential leader in world history” if he decides to go public.


While the White House has not commented, Grusch, claimed he has faced intimidation and even physical threats for speaking out.


He said: “I was literally in fear both professionally and in my personal life.”

The CW's Supernatural thrilled fans for 15 seasons on the backs of Sam and Dean Winchester, but the monster-hunting siblings owe much of their success to a fan-favorite character. Bobby Singer was a beloved figure throughout Supernatural's run and a crucial figure for Sam and Dean specifically. Bobby was both a father figure and a mentor to the brothers.

From spending countless hours researching lore for a hunt and listening to Sam and Dean's grievances, Bobby was there through it all. Beyond the Winchesters themselves, Bobby operated a central network for hunters from his home. One specific episode in season 6 gave fans a look behind the curtain at Bobby, demonstrating his position as one of the most vital characters in the world of Supernatural.

By the time Season 6's "Weekend at Bobby's" aired, Supernatural fans were very familiar with Bobby Singer. He had already been established as the father figure and lore expert whom Sam and Dean could rely on at any hour. His role and importance were clear, but his daily routine was never fully explored until this episode, and fans finally understood the full scope of his responsibilities.

One aspect of Bobby's character that the episode paints clearly is that he never gets a break from his duties. His job requires him to work and research around the clock with little recognition, and it has worn him down over the years. The episode shifted the focus from Sam and Dean and permanently changed the perception of Bobby's role.

The central conflict revolves around Bobby as he attempts to reclaim his soul from the recently crowned King of Hell, Crowley. While Bobby tries to bargain with and trap Crowley, Sam and Dean are investigating their own case on the B-side of the episode. Bobby is unsuccessful in his first attempt at forcing Crowley's hand and has to sideline his attempts to help Sam and Dean research their hunt.

Characters such as Castiel changed Supernatural's DNA, but Bobby kept the classic hunting thread and monster-of-the-week focus thriving. While aiding Sam and Dean, fans see Bobby simultaneously juggling various cases from other hunters. As he's trying to find more information for the Winchesters, he realizes he doesn't have the necessary book and must break into the local library.

This one bit of research becomes a comedy of errors as viewers see just how much work it takes Bobby to find the necessary information for a single case. Just to find out about one monster, Bobby has to put in sleepless nights. It shows how every small piece of information the Winchesters rely on comes from hours of work, constant interruptions, and a level of effort the brothers rarely see.

Sam and Dean constantly rely on Bobby for help, and the episode shows how they have taken his effort and reliability for granted. Bobby's sacrifices become clear. He's obviously facing the largest crisis at the time, but puts his own issues on the back burner to be there for others. Viewers can see him becoming frustrated by the lack of appreciation, but he still does what needs to be done.

From the pilot episode of Supernatural, it appears that Sam and Dean have all the skills and answers necessary to navigate the hunting lifestyle. Through many investigations, it seems they can handle everything on their own. After Bobby's introduction, it's obvious that's not the case. This episode specifically proves that even the best hunters need a supportive system to stay alive.

What stands out about "Weekend at Bobby's" in retrospect is that this is but a single day in Bobby's life. This amount of stress and devotion is what is required of him daily. It gives more insight into his generally grumpy nature. There's an immense amount of pressure and weight on his shoulders to deliver, as the lives of the Winchesters and a host of other hunters rely on him.

Bobby's relationship, and the lack thereof, take center stage in the episode. Supernatural lasted 15 years due to the strength of the cast as a whole, and two of those characters play a primary part in "Weekend at Bobby's." The episode also shows how Bobby sacrifices a potential relationship, as a romance is hinted at with the appearance of his neighbor, Marcy.

Hunters struggle with maintaining serious relationships due to the nature of the job, and Bobby is no different. Marcy attempts to set up a date with Bobby, but he's either too stubborn to pick up the hints, too busy, or he is avoiding it altogether to keep her at a distance for her own safety. Understandably, he is in the middle of trying to save his soul from hell.

Fans of The X-Files will be familiar with prolific character actor Steven Williams, who portrays Rufus Turner in Supernatural. Rufus is Bobby's old hunting partner and a recurring character in the series. Rufus enters the picture in "Weekend at Bobby's" as he is trying to dispose of the body of an Okami, a monster that has rarely been seen outside of Japan.

Bobby and Rufus share similar character traits, which is why their on-screen chemistry works so well and why they needed a spinoff. While Bobby does help Rufus, Rufus is also the first to understand Bobby's situation with his soul and offer help. Bobby struggles with asking for help. He's usually the one to help, and it's one of his character flaws that's made apparent in the episode.

After explaining his problem with Crowley, Rufus understands the severity of Bobby's issues. He also knows of his reluctance to reach out to others and offers to help on his own. He becomes an important piece of Bobby getting his soul back. Bobby plans to summon the ghost of Crowley's son to gain information, and Rufus hunts down Crowley's son's signet rings, which allow Bobby to use a spell.

Another character who offered Bobby a helping hand was the potential star of Supernatural's canceled spin-off series, Sheriff Jody Mills. Jody is the sheriff of Sioux Falls, and she and Bobby have a complicated history. As a hunter, Bobby is always involved with petty crimes and suspicious activity, leading to many of their early interactions. She viewed Bobby as the town nuisance.

Eventually, she is pulled into the monster-filled realm and becomes a crucial ally. Specifically, in "Weekend at Bobby's," she uses her position in law enforcement to keep the FBI off Bobby's back. Rufus is being followed, and they suspect he came to visit Bobby with a body in the bed of his truck. Of course, they were right, but they weren't aware that the body was actually a monster.

Jody goes above and beyond to help Bobby when he needs it most in this episode. Rufus is arrested for burglary when attempting to obtain the signet ring. Bobby needs Jody to help extradite Rufus to Sioux Falls so that he can complete the summoning spell. Though this could cause her to lose her job, she ultimately frees Rufus, allowing Bobby to set the trap for Crowley.

In addition to showing Bobby's daily struggles, the episode highlights his resourceful and clever approach to regaining his soul. Bobby is more than a networking necessity for the hunting world; he is a strategist and problem solver. His planning and quick thinking are just as impressive and crucial to Sam and Dean's hunts as they are in saving his own soul.

When Rufus offers to get the signet ring for Bobby, he assumes that Bobby is going to use the ghost of Crowley's son as a bargaining chip to trade. Bobby takes another approach. He uses Gavin for information, not as a trading piece. He wants to find out who Crowley was when he was alive. More importantly, he wants to know where Crowley's bones were buried, to use them as leverage.

He tasks Sam and Dean with traveling to Scotland to the site of Crowley's grave. This is after he lets them have it, of course. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Bobby finally opens up to the Winchesters about their treatment and lack of appreciation for him in his time of need. He takes time out of his busy day whenever they call, but they've forgotten that Crowley owns his soul.

After summoning Crowley, Bobby reveals that he's learned the location of Crowley's human remains and that Sam and Dean are standing by to torch them should he refuse to return his soul. Bobby effectively outsmarts the King of Hell. Crowley gives him what he wants, and Bobby also manages to keep the use of his legs, which was a part of his initial deal with Crowley.

The ending is satisfying because it reinforces what the audience has learned about Bobby throughout the series as a whole and the episode specifically. He has a wealth of knowledge of the occult and is a great hunter in his own right. During John Winchester's absence during their childhood, he was their father. It only makes sense that he can teach Sam and Dean how it's done from time to time.

If it wasn't clear beforehand, "Weekend at Bobby's" makes sure to highlight Bobby's importance to the series. He was the backbone of the hunting network and the safety net for Sam and Dean. Even though he appeared in some capacity afterward, Supernatural was never quite the same after Bobby's death because he was simply the most important character in the series.

Modernizing Efforts: Psychological Operations Showcases Cutting-Edge Innovation

By Capt. Rachel Deppen

FORT BRAGG, N.C.—The U.S. Army's Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Regiment demonstrated its rapidly expanding role in the modern information warfare environment during a recent Innovation Day, where Soldiers from across the Regiment showcased solutions designed to fill operational gaps, outpace near-peer adversaries and increase lethality in competition and conflict.

The day highlighted how PSYOP Soldiers are leading bottom-up modernization, creating innovative, low-cost solutions that fill critical capability gaps, increase unit readiness and ensure the force is advancing quickly in the information domain. Col. Clinton Meade, the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School Deputy Commander, delivered opening remarks, focusing on three key objectives during the PSYOP Regimental Week.

Meade stated, “This week we will see ourselves, see our enemies and modernize our Regiment.”

Sgt. 1st Class David Hargett, a Soldier assigned to 7th PSYOP Battalion, presented a Cognitive Battle Damage Assessment Framework focused on improving how the Army evaluates influence effects on the battlefield. The framework provides commanders with a repeatable, data driven way to assess and measure behavioral impacts with the same rigger applied to kinetic effects.

“Teams around the globe are doing phenomenal work,” said Hargett. “This framework will only better align their efforts with [their] commander's intended effects.”

Hargett's framework integrates atmospheric, open- source indicators and field reporting into a forecastable model designed to inform decisions 30-120 days out. This model will provide timely, quantifiable measures that accurately reflect how target audiences are responding. The goal is standardizing behavioral assessments in a way that aligns with how kinetic effects are measured, ultimately improving resource allocation and operational planning.

Staff Sgt. Joseph Compton, an intel analyst assigned to 6th POB, introduced the Operationalized Will-to-Fight Framework, designed to fill a critical doctrinal and analytical gap. A critical factor in both friendly and adversary decision making, Will-to-Fight gives PSYOP Soldiers a standardized methodology to assess and integrate it into planning.

“The matrix is designed for any individual or team to pick up and use,” said Compton. “Teams can pick up a matrix and work their way down block by block, allowing them to analyze the enemies Will-to-Fight.”

Compton's solution recommends creating a portable, auditable, and structured analytical technique, complete with handbooks, overlays, matrix tools and digital integration. The result would provide commanders and planners with actionable insights to evaluate adversary resolve more accurately.

Sgt. 1st Class Brian Potts, an instructor with the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, showcased the Night Haunter: an ultralight, drone deployed deception speaker capable of producing over 100 decibels. Costing under $30 in components and housed in a 3D printed shell, the speakers provide tactical-level deception in both large-scale combat operations and unconventional warfare.

Potts and his team also showcased magnetic mounting solutions for Acoustic Hailing Devices and Next Generation Loudspeakers. The mounting devices offer rapid attachment to both military and civilian vehicles.

“When teams are required to deploy on a short notice, they often have strict equipment and weight limits,” Potts stated. “This mounting system weighs eight pounds, while the current mounting system weighs over sixty pounds.”

This low-cost mounting solution significantly reduces setup time and risk of equipment damage, filling a long-standing need for adaptable loudspeaker integration across mission sets.

Across all presentations, one theme was constant: PSYOP Soldiers are building practical and urgently needed capabilities to fill real-world gaps. Whether through DIY fabrication, analytical tools or non-standard acquisition approaches, innovation is becoming an embedded part of the Regiment's culture. The presenters reaffirmed the Regiment's commitment to developing adaptive, creative and future-ready PSYOP forces prepared to meet the demands of competition and conflict in a rapidly evolving information environment.

A UFO whistleblower claims Donald Trump was briefed on recovered non-human craft and possible alien biologics, sparking global debate and controversy.

US President Donald Trump has been fully briefed about the presence of an alien hybrid life form among us, claims David Grusch, a retired US intelligence officer and retired US Air Force Major. He suggests that the US Government has concealed UFO retrievals, non-human biological remains, and the existence of alien life for decades.

David Grusch is a current advisor to Congress's UAP Task Force. In a recent interview, he claimed that Trump has received reports of all such activities, and he is aware of the origin of extraterritorial being and their intentions. He said that soon, Trump is going to become the 'most consequential leader in world history' by disclosing these details publicly.

'Members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality. Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject,' Grusch told Fox News.

From 2019 to 2021, he represented the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on the UAP Task Force, but later became a whistleblower after reportedly learning about the US government denying congressional oversight of matters related to extraterrestrials. Reportedly, Grusch has stated under oath to Congress in July 2023 that he is aware of the multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program. He alleged that the US government possesses "non-human" spacecraft and "non-human biologics" based on interviews with over 40 witnesses.

Even though no such reports had been corroborated by the White House, the US Army or NASA and no physical evidence exists to verify these claims. But, on the Lex Fridman Podcast in September 2024, Trump claimed that he would declassify files on the aliens. “Sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that,” said Trump. Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison also previously echoed the existence of at least four alien hybrid species that human secretly know about.

While Supernatural is sadly ending its long-running tenure on Netflix later this month, it's already been given a new life on Amazon Prime Video.

The wildly popular fantasy-drama series stars Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as demon hunters Dean and Sam Winchester, as we follow their many adventures and exploits chasing monsters while being frequently helped by the Angel Castiel (Misha Collins).

The show just debuted on Prime Video, and Watch With Us thought we'd put together a breakdown of the show's most unmissable episodes.

Here are our picks for five essential episodes from Supernatural.



The final episode of season 5, “Swan Song” was meant to be the series' finale, before series showrunner Eric Kripke was replaced by executive producer Sera Gamble. Still, “Swan Song” handily manages to be one of the show's very best offerings. Sam and Dean team up with their brother Adam (Jake Abel) and together they battle a demon named Michael, who they've allowed to enter Adam's body. The episode concludes with them trapping both Lucifer and Michael, while Chuck's true identity is hinted at.

Fans love this episode as it provides an immensely satisfying conclusion to several storylines from the prior two seasons, while being filled with entertaining action, humor and tragedy. While you need to watch the previous seasons to enjoy it, it's got truly nail-biting moments as well as scenes that will make you cry.



This makes our list in part for being the first appearance of Castiel, played by Misha Collins, who would go on to be an integral and beloved character on Supernatural. Castiel brings Dean back from Hell after being dead and buried for months, and he, Sam and Bobby (Jim Beaver) spend a good chunk of the episode's runtime trying to figure out how he came back. Assuming it to be the work of a Demon, they instead encounter Castiel, who quickly becomes the show's third lead.

This episode is very emotionally satisfying on top of being an epic introduction for a great character. Plus, it shakes things up by adding angels into a series already heavily focused on demons, which thus changes the trajectory of the story.



This is a classic gimmick episode, but it's incredibly creative. The entirety of “Baby” is shot from the perspective of the brothers' car, named Baby. The 1967 Chevrolet Impala serves as the brothers' only home, and the episode follows the brothers going about their usual entity-hunting activities, with scenes taking place either inside the car or just outside of it — sometimes, the car isn't nearby at all.

This episode is inventive and exciting in the way it captures “natural” moments between Sam and Dean and gives their relationship a whole new depth. The story arc is also tied together beautifully, creating an episode of TV that is both aesthetically interesting and narratively gratifying.



Supernatural is notable for not just being a good drama, but occasionally featuring some genuinely hilarious comedy episodes. In particular, “Changing Channels' sees Sam and Dean face off against an old enemy named the Trickster, who sends the brothers into TV. There, they find themselves immersed in episodes of Grey's Anatomy and Knight Rider, as well as an ad for genital herpes medication.

In addition to being laugh-out-loud funny, “Changing Channels” also brings some massive plot developments as well, with the Trickster's true nature revealed, and Sam and Dean learning what they have to do to fight Lucifer and Michael.

Another entertaining stunt episode, “The French Mistake” finds the brothers pulled into a parallel universe where they are suddenly the actors who play them: Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles on the set of Supernatural. In Supernatural's fictional version of Supernatural, Sam and Dean can't act, they use sets never seen on the show and Jared has a pet alpaca.

An insanely meta episode and delightfully tongue-in-cheek, fans loved how the show poked fun at itself and its actors in a way that was both funny and smart, and yet still somehow managed to fit nicely into the brothers' story.

Growing up, one of the shows that completely shaped my love for mysteries was Unsolved Mysteries. And honestly, nobody could have hosted that show better than Robert Stack. His voice alone was enough to make you glance over your shoulder at least twice.

But there was one episode that never left my mind. Even today, yes, literally today, I can still replay it in my head. The episode was about the U.S. military dabbling in remote viewing, astral projection, and all sorts of psychic experiments. Basically… training people to be psychic spies.

They interviewed some of the so-called participants, but of course, their faces were hidden in deep shadow, and their voices were distorted to sound like every ransom-call villain ever. I remember one guy describing how he supposedly left his body, travelled across the world, moved through time, and even felt whatever environment he landed in.

He talked about crawling through the battlefields of a world war, feeling trenches, mud, and even piles of bodies. And honestly? If I had the ability to teleport my consciousness anywhere, a war zone would not be my top choice. Beach. Ice cream. Warm breeze. But hey, that's just me.

Anyway, that memory sent me down a rabbit hole again today, so here's the fascinating truth behind the real-life psychic spy program: Project Stargate.

The idea sounds like something ripped straight out of an X-Files episode, but Project Stargate was very real. It wasn't one single project, either; it was an umbrella name used by the CIA for a cluster of experiments that ran from the early 1970s all the way until 1995.

Why? Because the U.S. caught wind that the Soviet Union was experimenting with psychic research, and the Cold War was basically a decades-long game of “anything you can do, we can do too.”

The early work started in 1972 at the Stanford Research Institute in California. A few researchers, Russell Targ, Hal Puthoff, and Ingo Swann, set out to study psychic abilities and determine whether they could be used for intelligence gathering. They focused on remote viewing: the supposed ability to mentally “see” distant places or hidden objects using only the mind.

At first, they hand-picked people they considered naturally gifted. But by the 1980s, the program expanded into something bigger and stranger.

By 1983, the team believed remote viewing was something that could be taught. They developed a set of step-by-step instructions meant to help an average person reach reliable accuracy. And surprisingly, many of their participants, both civilians and military personnel, reported impressive results.

The program claimed successes like:

Some remote viewers described vivid scenes, shapes, colours, structures, even sounds and smells. A few reportedly produced blueprint-level accuracy. Their overall reliability was said to reach up to 80% in series-based experiments.

Of course, results varied wildly depending on who you ask. Some insiders said the project proved psychic functioning was real. Others said the successes were exaggerated. Eventually, in 1995, the American Institutes for Research reviewed the program and recommended shutting it down, which the government did.

Today, the entire archive is declassified and stored in the National Archives.

Psychic abilities, remote viewing, ESP, telekinesis, and astral travel have always lived on the outskirts of mainstream science, even though almost every culture throughout history mentions them in some form.

There are old Chinese legends about doctors who could literally “see” inside the human body to diagnose illnesses. Some traditions say humans once had far sharper intuitive abilities that faded over time.

And honestly, with everything the mind can already do, who's to say what its upper limits really are?

If remote viewing were possible, imagine the fun. I'd host a live Q&A, and you could ask me anything:

“Who really built Stonehenge?”

“Give me a sec… yep, definitely baby giants.”

So here's my question for you today:

If you could send your mind to any place,  past, future, or present, where would you go?

A historic moment? A lost civilisation? A future version of Earth?

Let me know. I'm genuinely curious how many of us would choose ancient mysteries… and how many would choose to peek at next week's lottery numbers.

Writing stories that blend fiction and history, exploring the past with a touch of imagination.

How does it work?

We talk a lot about superheroes and superpowers, and let's be honest, they're awesome. But have you ever stopped to notice how many famous heroes have an animal tied to their name and abilities? Think about it: Spider-Man, Batman, Catwoman, Hawkeye. That's because a ton of animals already have abilities we all wish we had. Some are common, like the power of flight or breathing underwater, but then there are animals with skills so unbelievable, it's almost like they truly have a set of superpowers. Here are some real-life animal superheroes that would give the Avengers a run for their money!

Squire "Ski" Reynolds still couldn't believe his eyes. His cellphone news feed just revealed that Scrape Norwood had been gunned down by a SWAT team member and subsequently lost his left leg during a shootout with police yesterday morning while attempting to rob Ganola Bank, the only Black-owned bank in the State of Washington, at gunpoint. Two members of Scrape's crew had also participated in the foiled heist.

The chipped porcelain of the teacup warmed Elisabeth's hands, but did little to thaw the chill that had settled deep in her bones. Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Blackwood Academy, mirroring the tempest brewing within her. It wasn't the storm that frightened her, not anymore. It was the silence. The *wrongness* that had permeated Blackwood since the Autumn Equinox.

Several years ago, my good friend asked me to write an affidavit or a formal letter about our long-term friendship and my knowledge and observation of his relationship with his partner. Why, you would ask? It had nothing to do with the fact that it was a same-sex marriage, which was already legal at the time. It had everything to do with my friend's partner being an immigrant. He had arrived in the US on a fiance visa which was later converted to a conditional green card. A couple of years later, they were petitioning to change the conditional green card to a non-conditional one, which would give my friend's partner a path to citizenship.

The idea sounds like something ripped straight out of an X-Files episode, but Project Stargate was very real. It wasn't one single project, either; it was an umbrella name used by the CIA for a cluster of experiments that ran from the early 1970s all the way until 1995.

Why? Because the U.S. caught wind that the Soviet Union was experimenting with psychic research, and the Cold War was basically a decades-long game of “anything you can do, we can do too.”

The early work started in 1972 at the Stanford Research Institute in California. A few researchers, Russell Targ, Hal Puthoff, and Ingo Swann, set out to study psychic abilities and determine whether they could be used for intelligence gathering. They focused on remote viewing: the supposed ability to mentally “see” distant places or hidden objects using only the mind.

At first, they hand-picked people they considered naturally gifted. But by the 1980s, the program expanded into something bigger and stranger.

By 1983, the team believed remote viewing was something that could be taught. They developed a set of step-by-step instructions meant to help an average person reach reliable accuracy. And surprisingly, many of their participants, both civilians and military personnel, reported impressive results.

The program claimed successes like:

Some remote viewers described vivid scenes, shapes, colours, structures, even sounds and smells. A few reportedly produced blueprint-level accuracy. Their overall reliability was said to reach up to 80% in series-based experiments.

Of course, results varied wildly depending on who you ask. Some insiders said the project proved psychic functioning was real. Others said the successes were exaggerated. Eventually, in 1995, the American Institutes for Research reviewed the program and recommended shutting it down, which the government did.

Today, the entire archive is declassified and stored in the National Archives.

Psychic abilities, remote viewing, ESP, telekinesis, and astral travel have always lived on the outskirts of mainstream science, even though almost every culture throughout history mentions them in some form.

There are old Chinese legends about doctors who could literally “see” inside the human body to diagnose illnesses. Some traditions say humans once had far sharper intuitive abilities that faded over time.

And honestly, with everything the mind can already do, who's to say what its upper limits really are?

If remote viewing were possible, imagine the fun. I'd host a live Q&A, and you could ask me anything:

“Who really built Stonehenge?”

“Give me a sec… yep, definitely baby giants.”

So here's my question for you today:

If you could send your mind to any place,  past, future, or present, where would you go?

A historic moment? A lost civilisation? A future version of Earth?

Let me know. I'm genuinely curious how many of us would choose ancient mysteries… and how many would choose to peek at next week's lottery numbers.

We talk a lot about superheroes and superpowers, and let's be honest, they're awesome. But have you ever stopped to notice how many famous heroes have an animal tied to their name and abilities? Think about it: Spider-Man, Batman, Catwoman, Hawkeye. That's because a ton of animals already have abilities we all wish we had. Some are common, like the power of flight or breathing underwater, but then there are animals with skills so unbelievable, it's almost like they truly have a set of superpowers. Here are some real-life animal superheroes that would give the Avengers a run for their money!

Several years ago, my good friend asked me to write an affidavit or a formal letter about our long-term friendship and my knowledge and observation of his relationship with his partner. Why, you would ask? It had nothing to do with the fact that it was a same-sex marriage, which was already legal at the time. It had everything to do with my friend's partner being an immigrant. He had arrived in the US on a fiance visa which was later converted to a conditional green card. A couple of years later, they were petitioning to change the conditional green card to a non-conditional one, which would give my friend's partner a path to citizenship.

A 2023 astronaut photo shows the moment the Alabama River briefly morphed into an undulating golden serpent, similar in shape to a Chinese dragon. This temporary transformation was the result of a rare mirror-like phenomenon known as a "sunglint."

Where is it? Boykin, Alabama [32.10219570, -87.28911406]

What's in the photo? A "sunglint" making the Alabama River look like a golden Chinese dragon

Who took the photo? An unnamed astronaut on board the International Space Station (ISS)

When was it taken? June 26, 2023

This incredible astronaut photo captured a unique glimpse of Alabama's eponymous river cosplaying as a golden Chinese dragon. The metallic hue of the serpentine waterway is the result of a rare optical phenomenon that is only visible from space.

The Alabama River is a 318-mile-long (512 kilometers) waterway that stretches from the state's capital, Montgomery, past cities like Birmingham and Selma, and into Mobile Bay, where it drains into the Gulf of Mexico.

The section of the river in the photo features a large U-shaped bend, known as Gee's Bend, that surrounds the small town of Boykin, which is renowned for its "vibrant folk art" that is displayed across the country, according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

The river's unusual glow is the result of a rare phenomenon, known as a sunglint, which occurs when sunlight perfectly reflects off a still body of water toward an observer in space, like a massive liquid mirror. This is similar to how the surface of an ocean or lake sparkles when light bounces off it during a sunset — except the only people who can see it are astronauts.

The golden color of the sunglint helps provide greater contrast between water and land, highlighting a series of flooded zones. When combined with the river's larger bends, this makes the waterway look surprisingly like a dragon from Chinese mythology, netizens pointed out at the time.

 




The head of the dragon (located on the left of the image) is represented by the flooded zones of the artificial William "Bill" Dannelly Reservoir, which was created in the 1960s by partially damming the river. This 27-square-mile (70 square kilometers) reservoir generates hydroelectric power via a dam and has also become a popular fishing spot for people looking to catch crappie, bass and catfish.

The river's water levels rose higher than initially expected following the dam's construction, causing the waterway to permanently spill over into surrounding floodplains, such as at Chilatchee Creek (towards the bend in the dragon's tail) and around Gee's Bend, according to Earth Observatory.

Most bodies of water usually take on a silvery, mirror-like appearance when illuminated by sunglints, making the Alabama River's golden glow particularly noteworthy.

—Lake-filled impact crater in Africa transforms into a giant silver 'mirror' via rare phenomenon

—'Lake of clouds' appears between volcanic nesting dolls in Russia via rare mirror-like phenomenon

The unusual golden color is likely the result of atmospheric scattering of the reflected light by aerosols, dust and haze. This scatters blue wavelengths of light, giving the remaining light a more yellow hue.

Astronauts are always on the lookout for sunglints, especially over the ocean, because they can reveal hidden natural phenomena, such as gyres and internal waves, as well as human activities, such as ship wakes and oil slicks, according to the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service.

For years, right-wing media outlets have ruminated on the mysterious pipe bomber who planted explosives outside the Democratic and Republican National Committees ahead of January 6th. Was it a deep-state provocateur working for the FBI? Or perhaps a liberal out to ruin Trump's otherwise legitimate hopes of overturning the election?

Glenn Beck has called the pipe bomber's identity “the biggest scandal of my lifetime, maybe in the last hundred years.” During his talk-radio days before he became deputy FBI director, even Dan Bongino was convinced something nefarious was afoot. In Bongino's telling, the FBI knew the pipe-bomber's identity but were choosing to cover it up because its disclosure would be politically embarrassing. Referring to himself in the third person as “Danny Boobotz,” Bongino declared he had been right about a coverup all along.

“It's a freakin' inside job!” Bongino said in early January.

So right-wing media figures should have been relieved on Thursday when the FBI announced the arrest of 30-year-old Brian Cole Jr. as the pipe bomber suspect. Yet the response from conservative media has overwhelmingly been the opposite. They believe that

People love a good UFO conspiracy theory, and according to Deadline, they love it a lot more than any of the big-budget blockbusters of the year. The Age of Disclosure is a documentary directed by Dan Farah, featuring testimony from members of the U.S. government regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) that have visited our planet and why this information has been kept under wraps. Within 48 hours of release on Prime Video, The Age of Disclosure has already broken the streaming service's record for highest-grossing documentary. In fact, it has outperformed major movies such as One Battle After Another, Jurassic World: Rebirth, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, and more.

Numbers haven't been revealed, but in a press release, The Age of Disclosure producers said, “The documentary debuted at #1 and #2 (purchase and rental respectively) on Prime Video's chart of Best Selling Movies in all genres, where it remained for the first 8 days of its release, outperforming major studio titles such as Warner Bros. One Battle After Another, Weapons, The Conjuring Last Rights, Universal's Jurassic World Rebirth, Disney's Tron, and Paramount's Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning. Two weeks after release, the film remains in the top ten of Prime Videos New Releases Best Sellers chart, and #1 and #2 out of all documentaries.“

The Age of Disclosure “shockingly reveals an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse-engineer advanced technology of non-human origin. Featuring testimony from 34 members of the U.S. Government, military, and intelligence communities, the film exposes the profound stakes for the future of humanity. The timely documentary arrives amid historic bipartisan Congressional hearings on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) and the proposed UAP Disclosure Act, led by Senators Schumer, Rounds, and Gillibrand, calling for transparency about what the government knows about UAP and non-human intelligent life.“

Farah, who produced Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One, said he's spent the last three years making the film in secrecy. “Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of the UAP issue as a result of their work for the U.S. Government, and is breaking their silence in the film with what they can lawfully disclose,” states a release. “The Age of Disclosure is unprecedented in terms of its access, credibility, and the information it reveals.“

He told Deadline that the issue of UAPs and the government cover-up is “the biggest issue of our time. It's the permanent bureaucracy in various intelligence agencies and private defense contractors and inside of the military that are gatekeeping this information and keeping it from us and our elected officials.“

This year's 12th edition of the Scary Movies festival at Film at Lincoln Center premiered Ari Aster's extended version of “Midsommar” this past Saturday. 

I saw Dan Farah's ‘The Age of Disclosure' earlier in the year. Quite honestly, if there's any documentary that can convince you that UFOs do exist, it's probably this one. I'll admit it — I was a total skeptic until I watched it. I'm not 100% convinced, but it makes a strong case.

Regardless, the film is on VOD, and Deadline reports that within its first 48 hours of release on Prime Video, ‘The Age of Disclosure' has already broken the streaming service's record for highest-grossing documentary. In fact, it was #1 for its first eight days, easily outperforming every blockbuster movie available on the platform, including ‘One Battle After Another,' ‘Jurassic World: Rebirth,' ‘Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,' and more.

The doc, Farah's debut feature, dives headlong into what it calls “an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life,” alleging a decades-long arms race among world powers to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial tech. The film isn't shy about its ambitions — or its sources. “The Age of Disclosure” features testimony from 34 members of the U.S. government, military, and intelligence communities, including a few former CIA directors, all asserting that humanity's biggest secret has been hiding in plain sight.

Among the talking heads is Jay Stratton, the former director of the Pentagon's UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) Task Force. Stratton claims:

I have seen, with my own eyes, non-human craft and non-human beings.

The documentary contains even bolder assertions than that. Some claims are so extraordinary that they raise questions about whether the intelligence officers interviewed might have their own agendas. One even alleges, on camera, that the military has been in direct contact with beings found inside the recovered craft.

Farah is said to have spent three years developing the film in strict secrecy, tracking down insiders willing to speak publicly. It's similar ground to the project Joseph Kosinski is tackling for Apple TV — a forthcoming drama inspired by former U.S. Air Force officer David Grusch, who testified before Congress that the government has been studying alien craft and bodies while keeping the information from the public.

Given all this, the digital success of The Age of Disclosure shouldn't come as a shock. Its first teaser went viral almost immediately, amassing over 20 million views across social platforms and fueling speculation that this might be the documentary capable of reshaping the conversation.
