                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As sports organizations expand into blockchain, fan engagement is evolving from collectibles to full digital participation. As these fans begin exploring blockchain and Web3 technologies, significant industry leaders are recognizing the need to meet them halfway. FIFA, the international governing body for football, recently took a step in this direction by partnering with blockchain platform Avalanche to launch its own blockchain network, ushering football into the decentralized era. This custom blockchain aims to deliver digital collectibles and next-generation fan experiences, setting the stage for massive fan engagement leading up to events such as the 2026 World Cup. Projects around the globe are racing to realize this vision, transforming passive spectators into active owners and participants. One of these projects is 0xFútbol, a blockchain-powered ecosystem designed to unite football's global fan base within Web3. 0xFútbol's mission is clear: onboard the next four billion football fans into Web3 by creating engaging, culturally relevant and valuable products that football enthusiasts genuinely want to use. Unlike single-purpose applications, 0xFútbol offers a diverse ecosystem of experiences, including games, prediction markets and fan engagement platforms — unified by the project's native token, FUTBOL, which is set for launch on June 3. The products in the 0xFútbol ecosystem cater to diverse interests among fans: MetaSoccer, with over 50,000 users in its beta phase, is a Web3 football management game where players build, manage and compete with their virtual teams. For casual gamers, Wonderkid offers a quick and competitive football-based mini-game on Telegram, attracting more than 168,000 registered users. Ultras, currently in its minimal viable product (MVP) stage, is a “phygital” platform aimed at helping clubs directly engage and reward their supporters. The team said that they are in talks with top-tier clubs for potential Ultras partnerships. Additionally, 0xFútbol is launching FútbolPM later this year, a prediction market that allows fans to leverage their football knowledge for monetary rewards. 0xFútbol believes fans deserve more than the traditional passive role assigned to them. Despite the immense passion of fans, football lacks a unified global community. In the current landscape, fans rarely have meaningful ownership or decision-making power. Each product developed by 0xFútbol brings new users into this decentralized ecosystem, steadily transforming individual voices into a powerful collective force capable of influencing football culture, governance and economics. 0xFútbol's ambitious goal is backed by prominent partnerships and investors who share the project's vision, including investors such as Protocol Labs, Consensys Mesh and Techstars. The beautiful game is entering a new era where fans are owners shaping football's future. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$104,576.52 is down 2.1% in the last 24 hours, trading just above $104,000 after briefly hitting a session low of $103,900. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — slumped even further, by 4.2%. Crypto stocks also took a hit, especially bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer (BTDR), down 8.3% on the day after a run-up that saw the stock rise 132% from April 16 to May 21. Behind the price action was the flare-up of U.S. trade tensions once again after an agreement was struck earlier this month. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview that talks had "stalled" with the Chinese representatives. China, in response, urged the U.S. to "immediately correct its erroneous actions, cease discriminatory restrictions," BBC reported. The cool-off between U.S. and China helped risk assets rally in May, providing a tailwind for BTC to clinch a new record high. The re-escalation now threatens to unwind some of those gains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a landmark move to promote digital literacy and future-ready skills, Binance Academy has partnered with Pakistan's Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT) to roll out a nationwide blockchain education initiative. The programme is set to train 300 university educators and reach over 80,000 students across 20 institutions by 2026. Under the agreement, university educators will undergo intensive training in blockchain fundamentals, including BNB Chain, Solidity programming, and essential Web3 concepts. Welcoming the initiative, Minister of IT and Telecom, Ms. Shaza Fatima Khawaja, noted its potential impact on Pakistan's long-term economic trajectory. “This partnership contributes to our digital transformation by positioning Pakistan as a global source of skilled blockchain talent,” she said. Its broader target is to impact more than 200 universities across 50 countries, reaching one million students by 2026. The Binance Academy–MoITT partnership represents a significant step in embedding blockchain education into Pakistan's academic framework. By focusing on practical skills and global competitiveness, the initiative is expected to foster a generation of innovators prepared to lead in the digital economy — both locally and internationally.

The other top laggards were altcoins like PancakeSwap (CAKE), Raydium (RAY), Ethena (ENA), and Arbitrum (ARB), which dropped by over 10%. CoinGlass data shows that 24-hour liquidations jumped by 125% to $709 million. Almost 224,000 traders were liquidated, with the largest loss amounting to nearly $13 million. This explains why many altcoins have crashed even harder. Third, there are lingering concerns about trade after a court ruled that Trump's tariffs were illegal. Finally, there are signs that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady at 4.50% for a while. Minutes released this week showed that officials are comfortable with a wait-and-see approach as they assess the impact of tariffs on inflation. Technicals and fundamentals suggest that the crypto bull run has a long way to go. Therefore, this supply and demand dynamic suggests the coin will bounce back.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thailand's financial watchdog “will block access” to five unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bybit and OKX, in the latest effort to curb illicit financial activity and protect domestic investors. The order, which takes effect on June 28, is reportedly in line with updated legal powers granted under new cybercrime legislation. The SEC has reportedly submitted their details to the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, which holds the power to block access under a recently enacted cybercrime law. Read more: SEC Dropped the Lawsuit Against Binance After 2 Years The agency emphasized that assets held on unlicensed platforms are not protected under Thai law, leaving investors exposed to potential fraud and legal risk. It also directed the public to use the official SEC channels to verify licensed operators and report suspicious activities. The crackdown is based on powers granted by the Royal Decree on Measures for the Prevention and Suppression of Technology Crimes, which came into effect on April 13. The legislation enables government agencies to block digital infrastructure associated with technology-related offenses, including unregistered cryptocurrency services. Earlier this year, Thailand's Cabinet approved broader amendments to the country's digital asset rules, reflecting a growing intent to address regulatory gaps surrounding foreign and peer-to-peer crypto providers. Early this year, the SEC announced that it was considering allowing the listing of local Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years after the launch of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the digital rupee in circulation has surged to Rs 1,016.5 crore in 2025, up from Rs 16.4 crore in 2023. Consequently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is exploring the digital rupee's deployment for cross-border payments on a bilateral basis. The apex bank is also mulling participation in multilateral CBDC initiatives under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub as disclosed in the RBI's Annual Report for 2024–2025. The digital rupee now incorporates offline use cases and programmability features, in addition to cross-border pilots. Programmability allows government agencies to permit CBDC use for defined benefits or within a specified time and/or particular location. Non-bank entities, including fintechs like MobiKwik and CRED, have been allowed to launch CBDC wallets. The RBI aims to “enhance adoption and improve distribution” through this approval. As of March 2025, 17 banks and 60 lakh users have engaged with the e₹-Retail pilot. While the wholesale version of e-Rupee is meant for financial institutions like banks, the retail version is accessible to individuals for regular transactions. As of March 2025, the platform houses 44 lenders—including banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). These statistics follow the RBI's push for ULI adoption among ecosystem players earlier this year. For context, ULI allows lenders to access authenticated data, including land records and other details from various sources via standardised APIs. The RBI noted that it has deployed MuleHunter.ai, its AI tool for real-time identification of mule accounts, across select large public sector banks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » News » Forthcoming bill will ‘proactively address' regulatory uncertainty in crypto With more than 1.5 million Pennsylvanians owning cryptocurrencies, the state should develop clear regulatory guidelines for blockchain technology and digital assets, said State Rep. Torren Ecker (R-193), who plans to introduce legislation that would provide such certainty. “Without defined rules, Pennsylvania risks falling behind other states and countries actively supporting blockchain development,” Ecker wrote in a May 28 editorial for the House Republican Caucus. “Ambiguity in current regulations hampers entrepreneurs, developers, and investors from fully embracing blockchain's potential.” Consumers also remain vulnerable as they're uncertain about their rights and protections, he added. To address the challenge, Ecker said he plans to introduce the Blockchain Basics Act, which would establish clear guidelines for blockchain technology — which are databases that maintain a growing list of records, called blocks — and cryptocurrency activities, helping to foster innovation, protect consumers, and maintain the state's competitive edge. “The Blockchain Basics Act ensures practical benefits for both citizens and businesses,” he wrote. Specifically, Ecker said his bill would enable individuals and businesses to accept digital assets as payment for goods and services, securely store digital assets, and participate freely in blockchain activities without needing special licenses. Ecker thinks that establishing clear regulatory standards in the state will attract investment, encourage innovation, and position the commonwealth as a global leader in blockchain technology. At press time, Ecker had not officially introduced the Blockchain Basics Act, according to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives' legislative site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has fallen sharply since hitting an all-time high last week, down 6% despite the U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge bitcoin prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Now, as fears swirl the U.S. dollar could be teetering on the verge of collapse, a serious BlackRock warning that quantum computing could pose an existential risk to bitcoin has been escalated by a Google research paper that found encryption-breaking quantum computers could be a lot closer than previously thought. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “This is a 20-fold decrease in the number of qubits from our previous estimate,” Google Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney wrote, referring to the number of quantum computer qubits needed to break a public-key encryption algorithm similar to that used by bitcoin. “If this is even remotely true, combined with everything else happening right now, the only safe trade are hard assets and, dare I say, gold,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya, a vocal supporter of bitcoin who claims to have first bought some when the bitcoin price was just $100, posted to X in response to the paper. Earlier this month, BlackRock quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street's campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. The quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google making strides in quantum computing research. “At this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,” David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in earlier emailed comments that warned bitcoin is “sleepwalking into a disaster.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued new guidance clarifying that common forms of crypto staking do not fall under securities laws. On May 29, the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance confirmed that those participating in staking activities, including self-staking, delegated staking, custodial, and non-custodial forms, are not required to register these actions with the financial regulator. According to the SEC, providing features such as early withdrawal options, bundled rewards, slashing protection, or asset aggregation to meet minimum staking thresholds does not automatically classify these arrangements as securities offerings. Staking is integral to blockchain networks running a proof-of-stake () consensus mechanism, where participants lock up their tokens to validate network transactions and earn rewards. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, a long-time advocate for clearer crypto regulation, supported the decision. She described staking as an essential part of proof-of-stake systems, where users contribute to network security by voluntarily locking up their tokens. Peirce stressed that regulatory uncertainty has discouraged American users from engaging with these networks, despite their importance to blockchain infrastructure. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw criticized the staff's interpretation, warning that it strays from legal precedent. “This is yet another example of the SEC's ongoing ‘fake it ‘till we make it' approach to crypto – taking action based on anticipation of future changes while ignoring existing law.” The SEC's position could have significant implications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds, which are currently barred from staking their assets. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, noted that this guidance removes a major regulatory obstacle for funds seeking to stake Ethereum or other proof-of-stake assets. However, Geraci pointed out that further clarity is still needed from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), particularly around how staking rewards will be treated within the grantor trust structures typically used by ETFs. If staking integration into these ETFs proceeds smoothly, it could unlock a new revenue stream for investors and enhance the appeal of crypto investment products within regulated markets Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have been gaining momentum regardless, posting nine consecutive days of inflows totaling over $480 million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The entire cryptocurrency community is on edge following the alleged kidnapping and torture of seemingly obscure Italian meme coin millionaire Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan in a Soho apartment. While the horrific crime, for which crypto bros John Woeltz and William Duplessie have been arrested, is obviously very close to home, it's part of a rash of kidnappings in recent months. In Paris at the beginning of May, the 60-year-old father of a cryptocurrency millionaire was held hostage with his finger severed until his son paid a €5 million ransom. Later this month, four armed men in the City of Light attempted to kidnap the daughter of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. Earlier this week, 24 people were taken into custody in connection with the attempted kidnapping. Law enforcement were able to rescue the couple but not before Balland had a finger cut off; ten people have been arrested. They won't share their names online, make purchases through trusts and are attracted to crypto because it provides anonymity. To be sure, notable billionaires like the Winklevoss twins or Michael Taylor are very protected — many of these billionaires also have wallets that [are secured by] bigger companies like Circle or Kraken, which have invested heavily in security for executives. But that isn't necessarily true on an individual level. “Crypto millionaires don't think of themselves as Bill Gates or Steve Jobs,” Segal said. But this latest attack seems to be changing that. Even the lesser known crypto magnets are aware they may be in danger. He also added that he had canceled some recent conference appearances but noted it's not unique to him, “anyone active or high profile in crypto gets threats.” This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC's power players (and those who aspire to be). Targeting someone who has made a lot of money from cryptocurrency is, in many ways, the perfect crime. An obscure wallet is impossible to trace and the transactions are final. One founder in crypto seems resigned to it, “This is the cost of doing business.” But another source explained that it could cause the industry to go underground. For now, it seems like the huge displays of wealth may be diminishing and the days of bragging at parties about a meme coin success and how much money you made may be over.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ICO Reprimands Police Force Over “Serious Shortcomings” With CCTV The Information Commissioner's Office has issued a reprimand to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) following “serious shortcomings” around its storing and handling of CCTV footage. A CCTV system was in operation during this period. The GMP's Professional Standards Directorate (PSD) later submitted an internal request to retain this information beyond the typical 90-day period. When responding to a subsequent related subject access request, the police force noticed that two hours of the footage was missing. GMP states that, despite all attempts, it is “unable to recover” the missing two hours of footage. The ICO said its investigation assessed GMP's compliance with data protection laws related to the storage of CCTV footage. The ICO's investigation on this front found two key failings in GMP's data protection practices. Firstly, a misunderstanding between GMP staff, with regard to the responsibility to conduct a quality check of the retained footage. Secondly, a lack of policies and guidelines within GMP to identify that quality checks were required or who is responsible for this task. “CCTV footage, particularly of a person at their most vulnerable, can contain highly sensitive personal data and must be properly protected,” said Sally Anne Poole, head of investigations at the ICO. “It is vital that authorities like police forces have the strictest measures in place to protect personal data to maintain public trust. “It is clear in this case that Greater Manchester Police failed its obligation to keep the complainant's personal data safe and demonstrated serious shortcomings in how it handles CCTV footage. “Police forces and public bodies across the country can learn from failures like this and ensure they have the right systems and oversight in place to prevent these mistakes from happening again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the past five years, Bitcoin has risen by more than 1,000%, eclipsing some of the world's most valuable companies. Some bulls believe there are far greater gains to come for Bitcoin's long-term investors. After sliding earlier this year, during the past three months, it has rallied by about 30%. With a market cap of more than $2.1 trillion (as of May 29), it is far and away the most valuable digital currency. But while Bitcoin has soared in value, its market cap has also risen beyond those of many of the best blue chip companies. During that time frame, it has risen by more than 1,000%. Even the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which gives investors focused exposure to tech stocks, is only up by 134%. The digital currency now has a market cap that equals or exceeds some of the world's most dominant companies: If your opinion is that in the long view, Bitcoin will change the world and revolutionize how payments are made, then your expectations could be sky high. Cathie Wood's firm Ark Invest projects that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030, which would be a gain of nearly 1,300% from where it is today. MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is also incredibly optimistic about Bitcoin and believes that by 2045, the digital currency's price could top $13 million. Investors, however, should remember that those two are among the most bullish Bitcoin investors, and their price targets will always be incredibly optimistic. When the crypto market is on an upswing, it's easy to be bullish and expect that Bitcoin will only keep rising in value. I believe it has, and that a significant correction could be overdue. In a crypto world where there are thousands of coins to choose from and where Bitcoin really holds no sustainable competitive advantage over other cryptocurrencies in terms of use cases, I believe it has become grossly overvalued. Even if the crypto market as a whole may rise in value over time, that doesn't necessarily mean Bitcoin will. Newer and better coins could gain ground over time. I wouldn't buy Bitcoin now because it's a highly speculative asset to own, but if you're inclined to do so, I'd suggest allocating only a modest amount of your portfolio toward it in order to minimize your overall risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has announced the listing of four altcoins on its spot trading platform. The tokens include FLock.io (FLOCK), Forta (FORT), Pocket Network (POKT), and Livepeer (LPT). Following the announcement, all four tokens experienced significant price surges, with Pocket Network leading the rally with a triple-digit increase. According to Upbit's official notice, the tokens will be available for trading in Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and Korean Won (KRW) pairs. Trading will begin on May 30 at 15:00 KST with FLOCK. This will be followed by FORT, which will trade against the BTC and USDT pair through the Ethereum network starting at 16:00 KST. Later that day, LPT will launch trading on the KRW and USDT markets via Ethereum at 17:00 KST. Lastly, Upbit revealed that POKT will be listed on the KRW market through its native Pocket Network blockchain at 19:00 KST. “Please be sure to verify the network before depositing digital assets. Deposits or withdrawals via networks other than those specified will not be supported,” Upbit stated. Market data highlighted that the listings' impact was immediate. FLOCK token saw the second-largest uptick, climbing 49.3%, followed by Livepeer's LPT, which surged 41.5%. Both saw slight pullbacks, settling at gains of 30.9% and 29.5%, respectively. This development follows a pattern of significant market reactions to exchange listings. BeInCrypto reported that the listing of MANTRA (OM) Access Protocol (ACS), GoChain (GO), Observer (OBSR), Quiztok (QTCON), and Rally (RLY) on Upbit last week led to a similar sharp price surges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Chinese government has announced a sweeping new ban that prohibits not just trading or mining of cryptocurrencies, but now extends to individual ownership of digital assets like Bitcoin, according to a report by Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange. This latest action marks a significant escalation in China's historically hardline approach to crypto, reaffirming its commitment to centralising financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital yuan. Bitcoin saw a sharp dip following the news, while altcoins—especially those sensitive to regulatory shifts—exhibited even greater volatility. The implications of this ban are manifold. By outlawing private crypto holdings, Beijing is tightening its grip on financial flows, potentially accelerating the adoption of its central bank digital currency (CBDC). Meanwhile, the ban could prompt greater decentralisation in crypto usage across Asia, as users seek out alternative jurisdictions with more favorable policies. Despite China's recurring clampdowns, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have shown notable resilience. In fact, many seasoned investors view such regulatory shocks as strategic entry points, the report mentioned. Elsewhere, the broader crypto ecosystem continues to flourish, with progressive regulatory developments in regions like the United States, Europe, and Latin America—underscoring a global divide in digital asset governance.
