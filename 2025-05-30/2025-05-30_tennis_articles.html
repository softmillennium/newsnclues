American tennis star Tommy Paul has been making waves both on and off the court. Known for his powerful forehand and relentless hustle, his journey from junior sensation to ATP mainstay has been nothing short of compelling. But beyond the headlines, there's much more to Tommy Paul. Born on May 17, 1997, in Voorhees Township, New Jersey, Tommy Paul is currently 28 years old. Tommy Paul celebrates following victory against Sebastian Korda in the Men's Singles Semi Final match on Day Six of the cinch Championships on June 22, 2024. 9, following a quarterfinal run at the Australian Open. Tommy Paul stands at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm), a height that complements his agile and aggressive baseline play. His physical attributes contribute to his powerful forehand and swift court coverage, making him a formidable opponent on various surfaces. Tommy Paul is in a relationship with the influencer-entrepreneur Paige Lorenze and since 2022 they have cultivated a partnership that thrives despite the challenges of long-distance and demanding careers. Lorenze, who divides her time between Connecticut and traveling for his tournaments, has become a familiar face at major events, including the Australian Open and US Open, where her stylish courtside appearances have garnered attention. Beyond the public eye, their relationship is marked by mutual support and shared interests. Paul, currently based in Florida, often speaks about the grounding influence Lorenze has on his life, from home-cooked meals to encouraging his use of sunscreen and moisturizer. Tommy Paul's passion for tennis was nurtured by his family. Tommy Paul poses for a photo with the cinch Championships 2024 winners trophy following victory against Lorenzo Musetti in the Men's Singles Final match on Day Seven.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Who said the second round of a slam couldn't be entertaining? Fans across the world were treated to a thrilling spectacle on Day 5 of Roland Garros with five five setter matches played in the men's singles draw. Home favorite Arthur Fils came back from injury to edge past Spain's Jaume Munar in a dramatic showdown on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, while Alexander Bublik rallied from two sets down to defeat Alex de Minaur. It was a treat to watch tennis played at its highest caliber in a grand showcase that highlighted the depth of the men's field this year. In a 4-hour and 25-minute epic, Fils overcame Munar 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 in by far one of the best matches of the tournament. Treatment for a back injury seemed to revive Fils as he came onto the court for the fifth set with a renewed determination. It seemed improbable that he would pull through when he went down 1-3, but Fils fought back, hitting a crucial forehand down the line on his service game and a line-kissing corner forehand to break Munar to tie at 3-3. Following his victory, Fils wasn't shy in letting the crowd know how he felt. He tossed his shirt off before stepping onto the court, pumping both fists in victory, shouting out to a frenzied French crowd. In one of the bigger upsets of the tournament, Alexander Bublik came back from two sets down to defeat Alex de Minaur 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. It seemed like the Demon was in control after grabbing a two-set lead a little over an hour into the match. The often erratic and unpredictable Bublik had other plans. In what was some of his best tennis this season, Bublik kicked into third gear during the third set to break the Australian early and prevent his comeback at 4-4. "I was just keep my serve, maybe he's gonna you a chance." De Minaur admitted feeling "burnt out" following the match, calling out the ATP's long schedule and once again raising the conversation of a shorter schedule, echoed by compatriot Jordan Thompson earlier this week. In another shocking upset, qualifier Henrique Rocha defeated Jakub Menšík 2-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3. Rocha joins compatriot Nuno Borges in the round of 32, marking the first time in Roland Garros history that two Portuguese ATP players have advanced to round 3. Menšík, who beat Novak Djokovic to win the Miami Open earlier this year, played a routine first two sets, taking advantage of key break points to win on Rocha's service games. American qualifier Ethan Quinn played a rollercoaster 4 hour and 14 minute match to beat Alexander Shevchenko 6-4, 4-6, 6-7(5), 7-6(3), 7-5. He hit a total of 92 winners on his way to victory. Quinn played a tough three rounds of qualifying to make it into the main draw, his first at Roland Garros and second grand slam main draw overall. Quinn is one of five American men into the third round. He joins Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe, Sebastian Korda, and Tommy Paul for a chance to fight for a spot in the round of 16. This is Misolic's second time qualifying for Roland Garros and his first reaching the third round. Misolic faces Novak Djokovic in the next round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Holger Rune claimed he 'didn't feel safe' during his third round victory at the French Open. It came as the tenth seed threatened to forfeit his clash with Quentin Halys if an 'aggressive' spectator was not removed. However, the five-set triumph was not without incident after a confrontation with a member of the crowd. The Danish ace accused a spectator of grabbing his towel as he returned to his box between points. Rune then launched into a verbal tirade with umpire Adel Nour, who decided against ejecting the fan. The two-time quarter-finalist could be heard saying, 'He tried to touch the towel,' on a courtside microphone during his protests. Rune was also seen venting his frustrations towards a tournament supervisor during the incident. TNT Sports' Nick Mullins explained on commentary: "Well the conversation between Holger Rune and the umpire Adel Nour continues about the spectator who tried to grab, did grab, Rune's towel as he took it back to his box courtside. "Rune said that he wouldn't play again until the spectator had been ejected. Spectator is still in his seat, and here is Rune serving to stay in this third set. "I assume that is at the umpire's discretion and it would appear that Adel Nour has decided that as much as Rune is upset about it, annoyed about it, it is not enough to kick the spectator out." The fan later left Court Philippe Chatrier by their own volition despite Nour not calling over security. Commenting on the incident after his match, he said: "It happened at, I don't know, 5-4 when I was serving for the third set, and we played three more games and nothing really happened. I asked to get him removed three times. "Yeah, you know, again, I think maybe he got annoyed that I threw the towel in my towel box. “I think a guy like that, it should not be about him. I think obviously when it's like 5-4, tense moment, they were supporting him [Halys] a lot, but it's normal. I don't think it was anything crazy'. A win would see him into the last eight in Paris for the third time in his career. Rune previously reached the quarter-finals in both 2022 and 2023 before a fourth round exit 12 months ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sherr has been the CEO and executive director of the U.S. Tennis Association since 2022 and has worked there since 2010, including previously as chief revenue officer. “But I'm hugely excited about what's happening over there. (Mets owners) Steve and Alex Cohen have made a commitment to that team that is unrivaled in sports. The Mets announced Scott Havens' departure as their president of business operations; he was in that post since December 2023. The USTA said Brian Vahaly and Andrea Hirsch will be interim co-CEOs during a search for Sherr's replacement. Vahaly is chairman of the USTA Board; Hirsch is the USTA's chief operating officer and chief legal officer. In Sherr's time as CEO, the USTA has seen growth in tennis participation around the country, along with increases in U.S. Open attendance, sponsorships, and revenue from ticket sales and broadcasting rights. “We've taken some big swings,” Sherr said, “and thankfully, they're paying off.” He spoke at a news conference in New York to unveil an $800 million project to update Arthur Ashe Stadium and create a player performance center on the tournament grounds. He also made significant changes to this year's U.S. Open mixed doubles event in a bid to attract top singles players, making it a two-day, 16-team competition the week before the singles brackets begin. “It's bittersweet, in that I really have loved being part of this organization for 15 years and the opportunities I've had to do just really interesting things — and not just on the commercial side, but in terms of helping us think about growing the sport,” Sherr said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This isn't a headline. From Ons Jabeur, to the women who've carried the game with strength, grace and far too little recognition: Keep going. A former World No. 2 and three-time Grand Slam finalist, Ons Jabeur owns five WTA titles and stands as one of the most influential and thoughtful players of her era -- unafraid to speak up, lead with empathy and use her platform with purpose. A lot of amazing athletes have been told the same things over and over. That no one watches. That women's sport doesn't 'move people.' Judgment comes quickly, often from those who've never even watched a full match. One empty stadium is held up as proof. The hundreds of brilliant ones? Still, they carry a sport forward on their shoulders. When a woman wins 6–0, 6–0, it's called boring. When a man does it? When women play with power, they're told they 'play like men.' As if strength, speed or aggression don't belong in a woman's game. And yet the game keeps rising. Coco Gauff leads with fearless belief. Aryna Sabalenka strikes with unmatched power. Iga Swiątek dominates with calm and precision. Jessica Pegula brings relentless consistency. Paula Badosa fights through every storm. Mirra Andreeva breaks through, young and fearless. Jasmine Paolini lights up the court with fire and courage. Elena Rybakina is composed and lethal. Naomi Osaka opened up about the battles off the court and kept showing up. Venus and Serena Williams broke barriers and then broke records. The game is full of stories. And still many choose not to look. But belief is not a requirement. Permission is not necessary. Respect may be delayed, but progress isn't waiting. So when the headlines say 'no one watches,' remember: Full stands were just never part of their narrative. When the narrative says 'too easy,' look closer: It took years to win that fast. And when someone says women don't play with power, watch again and be honest this time. The game is not asking to be seen. No one's denying the greatness in men's tennis. But honoring one side of the sport shouldn't mean ignoring the other. The women's game has been writing its own legacy loudly, brilliantly and for far too long without full recognition. A player who chose this racket out of passion and honors every woman fighting for her place on the court You don't have to agree , just read with an open heart❤️ pic.twitter.com/pmJnWhgy6L This isn't a headline. From Ons Jabeur, to the women who've carried the game with strength, grace and far too little recognition: Keep going.</p>

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam winner who has only once reached the semifinals at Roland-Garros, beat Olga Danilovic 6-2, 6-3 on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where the hot weather contrasted with previous days. Swiatek, who has won four of her five major titles at Roland-Garros, defeated Jaqueline Cristian 6-2, 7-5 on Court Suzanne-Lenglen to extend her French Open winning streak to 23 matches. A second set lasting 1 hour, 16 minutes, tested the Pole, who yelled in relief after winning on her second match point. “She used her chances and just went for it,” said Swiatek, who enjoyed temperatures which reached 29 degrees (84 F). Sabalenka and Swiatek have been in contrasting form. Sabalenka has reached six singles finals this year, the most for a woman entering Roland-Garros since Serena Williams in 2013. But Swiatek is looking to reach her first final anywhere since winning her third straight French Open title, and fourth overall, a year ago. No woman has won four straight French Opens in the Open era. Asked who was under the most pressure to win this year — her or Swiatek — Sabalenka said, jokingly: “Let's just leave it on Iga since she won it, what, three times in a row?” Defending men's champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain was in action later Friday. 4-seeded Jasmine Paolini, last year's runner-up, beat Ukrainian Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-4, 6-1, and No. Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen beat 18-year-old qualifier Victoria Mboko 6-3, 6-4, while No. 8 Lorenzo Musetti of Italy beat Mariano Navone, No. 10 Holger Rune of Denmark beat Frenchman Quentin Halys in five sets, and 12th-seeded American Tommy Paul did the same against No. 23 Sebastian Korda 7-6 (6), 6-3, 6-4 in an all-American matchup, joining Paul and No. If qualifier Ethan Quinn wins on Saturday, there would be four American men in Week 2 in Paris for the first time since 1991. Novak Djokovic plays in the night session on Saturday much to his frustration as he hoped to play earlier so he could watch the Champions League final in Germany between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan on TV. The 24-time major winner, who recently won his 100th career title, faces qualifier Filip Misolic. If Djokovic wins quickly, though, he may be able to catch the end of the soccer final, which starts at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. EDT). In remaining third-round men's play, Alexander Zverev — last year's runner-up — takes on Flavio Cobolli on Court Philippe-Chatrier, while No. 1 Jannik Sinner — who beat Zverev in this year's Australian Open final — faces Jiri Lehecka on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. Over on Court Simonne-Mathieu, British hope Jack Draper plays 18-year-old rising Brazilian star Joao Fonseca. They are followed by Cameron Norrie vs. Jacob Fearnley, guaranteeing a British player in the fourth round. In remaining third-round women's play, former U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff faces Marie Bouzkova on Court Philippe-Chatrier, and No. 3 Jessica Pegula, the runner-up at last year's U.S. Open, plays former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova earlier on the same court. There is an all-American contest on Court Suzanne-Lenglen between current Australian Open champion Madison Keys and former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, who won that major in 2020, the year she went on to lose in the French Open final to Swiatek.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After all, there are some traits that transcend conditions, and if it is firing, his forehand is one of them. Should an opponent not get regular depth and pace on their groundstrokes, and instead tee up short balls for the Russian to attack, he will almost always punish them. And yet, when asked who he felt had the best forehand on tour, Rublev opted for one of his opponents. Naturally, when asked to craft his ultimate tennis player based on seven key characteristics, the Big Three had to feature. However, there were also a few surprise additions, with one current ATP star actually featuring twice alongside Novak Djokovic. For serve, Rublev could not decide between Nick Kyrgios and Reilly Opelka, but he was instant in his answer for the best forehand: Carlos Alcaraz. Despite that, Alcaraz wishes he could take something from Juan Carlos Ferrero's game, suggesting he is far from finished improving. And with good reason given the history he has already made at just 22 years old. He is the youngest ever year-end world number one, and the youngest man to have won three Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces. Alcaraz has more Grand Slam titles than legends like Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka and Arthur Ashe, and is quite clearly one of the dominant two players of his generation. In another 15 years, when he is around the age Djokovic is now, there's every chance he could be discussed as equal, or even better than the Big Three.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorenzo Musetti passed his first test at this year's Roland Garros on Friday when he rallied from a set and a break down to move past Mariano Navone 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 and match his best result at the clay-court major. The eighth-seeded Italian trailed Navone 4-6, 0-2 and in previous years may have faltered against the consistent Argentine, who has reached tour-level finals on clay in Rio de Janeiro and Bucharest. However, this season, the 23-year-old is playing with a new-found grit and resilience. The 2024 Olympic bronze medalist Musetti started to find his range off the backhand wing and used his slice and heavy forehand to force Navone out of his comfort zone and turn the tables in hot conditions. After committing 19 unforced errors in the first set, Musetti tightened up, hitting 31 across the next three sets to advance to the fourth round after three hours and 28 minutes on Court Suzanne-Lenglen. "It was completely different conditions than the past two matches. The ball was bouncing not that high and today at the beginning I was a bit surprised and physically I could not find my best shape," Musetti said. Into the Round of 16 🗣️@Lorenzo1Musetti defeats Navone 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-2 to advance in Paris. Musetti, who did not drop a set in his opening two wins against Yannick Hanfmann and Daniel Elahi Galan, has been red-hot on the clay since the Olympics last July, which were held in Paris. "I have put some order in my tennis house," Musetti said on his improvement. "It is not easy for me to make a decision, so I think the key is I have more idea of what I have to do on court. Musetti has suffered Roland Garros heartbreak in the past, notably on debut in 2021 when he led Novak Djokovic by two sets to love before falling. However, this is a new Musetti and the 23-year-old demonstrated his new-found confidence by flexing his muscles in celebration after improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Navone. Rune holds a 7-3 fifth-set record at majors. The first set didn't go how I wanted it to. I tried to adapt, with the conditions being much different today. 10 is a two-time quarter-finalist in the French capital and is just the ninth man in the Open Era to reach the fourth round at Roland Garros in all of his first four appearances, joining champions Rafael Nadal, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Jim Courier, Mats Wilander and Bjorn Borg. Rune, who lifted the title on clay at the ATP 500 in Barcelona in April, will take a 2-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his meeting with Musetti.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a confrontational news conference, Mauresmo insisted that scheduling four women's matches out of 44 on Court Philippe-Chatrier since 2021 was not a judgment about the value and quality of women's tennis. “It has never been that the girls are not worthy to play at night,” Mauresmo said. Mauresmo said that the French territory television contract with Amazon Prime stipulates there being only one match in the night session. A three-set match could be over in two; a five-set match guarantees at least three. Earlier in the week, French Tennis Federation (FFT) president Gilles Moretton said that scheduling decisions are based on “what is better for spectators.” Mauresmo said no female player has raised the issue directly with her, but her comments followed Coco Gauff, the world No. I hope whoever is making the decision, I don't think they have daughters, because I don't think they want to treat their daughters like this.” “I do think that women's matches are worthy of a night spot,” said Gauff, who often plays at night at the U.S. Open in front of some 24,000 people at Arthur Ashe Stadium. She said French Open organizers could solve the problem by starting earlier and having two matches at night rather than one, as both the U.S. and Australian Opens do, as well as other top mixed tournaments. “From my experience playing at US Open, night match at 7 p.m. with Novak (Djokovic) following me, and he's the greatest player of all time, people were almost just as excited to see me play as him,” Gauff said. She noted how Naomi Osaka and Paula Badosa had played an epic three-set match that lasted nearly two and half hours in the first round, a duel between two high-profile players that could have carried a night session. Osaka played a similar match in the second round last year against Iga Świątek. Both matches took place in the day session, but Osaka's encounter with the four-time champion went on so long that it was getting dark when they were done. “A lot of great matches, they should have been there,” Jabeur said. Mauresmo told reporters to “ask her on Sunday” about the topic, and a French reporter suggested putting the all-French encounter between wild cards Lois Boisson and Elsa Jacquemot in the slot Saturday, during the Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter. She suggested that would not be the case if the session started earlier with a women's match, partly because of French work schedules. That is rarely an issue in Melbourne and New York, with spectators who have paid serious money for prime tickets not wanting to miss out. In part, that was to see if high-profile Americans like Gauff might play at night because it is the afternoon in the U.S., even if that meant scheduling two women's matches for the night session. Solomon said that there was no interest in doing that from either the WTA Tour or the tournament. Like every other broadcaster, TNT, the current U.S. broadcaster makes suggestions and expresses preferences but ultimately the French Tennis Federation (FFT) makes the final call. The last time women played at night on Philippe-Chatrier was in 2023, when current world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka played Sloane Stephens in the quarterfinals. Asked whether she personally had an issue with the decision to schedule exclusively men at night since then, Mauresmo declined to answer. “I would like to change the subject,” she said. He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. And for the fourth French Open in a row, Mauresmo dismissed the issue, saying at a news conference Friday, when she also was pressed about placing women's matches in the noon slot at Court Philippe-Chatrier, when attendance tends to be sparse: "The funny thing is that it's the same questions, year after year." At the other Grand Slam tennis tournaments that sell separate tickets for night sessions, the U.S. Open and Australian Open, the main stadiums tend to feature two singles matches for that part of the daily schedule, one involving women and one involving men. Roland-Garros added night sessions starting three years ago and the French federation has a contract with a streaming service for viewers in the home country that calls for one daily match in European primetime for the first 1 1/2 weeks of the event. Only two of the 36 contests at night in that stretch were women's matches. Mauresmo, a former player who was ranked No. She repeatedly has offered similar explanations for why the night match has almost always been a men's match, including that their best-of-five-set format is likely to offer more time on court for ticket-buyers than the best-of-three setup for women. In recent years, some female players have argued that's a mistake and hurts the growth of their sport, although Mauresmo said Friday that no current or former athletes have complained to her about it or offered their thoughts. Ons Jabeur, a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, was asked about the topic this week and called the current setup “a shame.” ... Whoever is making the decision, I don't think they have daughters, because I don't think they want to treat their daughters like this.” Iga Swiatek, the three-time defending champion in Paris, said it doesn't bother her. Mauresmo said that having just one night match hasn't changed, “So for me, the message is not changing, and has never been that the girls are not worthy to play at night.” When a reporter tried to return to matters such as night matches and scheduling women first in Chatrier, asking Mauresmo how big a deal she considers those matters, she replied: “You know what? I would like to change the subject.” Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.</p>

He has a break in the third set to lead 4-3. Medjedovic is serving to stay in the match against Altmaier. Korda's serve looks in beautiful rhythm as he bangs down his third ace. Tiafoe finds a beautiful return on his forehand wing but Korda is unfazed and sees out another hold. Korda eased through his service game and Tiafoe is definitely not getting it so easy. An ace just at the right time nudges Tiafoe ahead 40-30 but then he double faults. It's a shortlived scare as Korda fails to capitalise. Seb's older sister Nelly is currently also competing in a major. The world number one is currently T2 at -4 in golf's US Women's Open at Erin Hills with three holes left of her second round. Korda is making Tiafoe work for it in this service game. We're over five minutes in this game now as the man in all blue as finally gets an error out of Korda to get over the line. I'm back with news of Ben Shelton taking the second set against Matteo Gigante 6-3 on Simonne Mathieu. On Court 14, Hamad Medjedovic trails Germany's Daniel Altmaier by two sets to one and they are on serve in the fourth. Tiafoe is locked in a deuce battle with Korda … no he's not! And with that, my work here is done. Note: Damir Dzumhur v Carlos Alcaraz, the No 2 seed in the men's singles, is due to start at 19.15 BST on Philippe-Chatrier. Tiafoe takes his US compatriot to deuce, but Korda closes out the game and leads in the first. I'm not here much longer, I don't think, so NOW is the time to send me an email. Tiafoe is yet to drop a set at this tournament: He's beaten both Roman Safiullin and Pablo Carreño Busta in three. Shelton 6-3, 5-2 Gigante, Medjedovic 6-4, 3-6, 3-5 Altmaier are a couple of latest scores from the men's singles. Something appetising coming up now on Suzanne Lenglen in the men's singles. “At the beginning I was a bit [laughs] not feeling really well … The conditions were a bit different. Thank you for staying here and watching me.” The crowd applauds warmly. Apparently, only Aryna Sabalenka has won more matches in grand slams than Paolini over the past two seasons. I am feeling good, it's an amazing court. You know, just enjoying being on this stage. I don't know, it's a special place for me.” “Yes, yes … Thank you very much guys … it's special to play in front of you and to have your support … I feel lucky.” She made 24 unforced errors, described as her “B-Game” by the commentator. Paolini is on the verge against Starodubtseva. Starodubtseva shows steel to save the first match point, and force deuce … “I expected a tough match,” says Rybakina. It's quite hot, I played really late the last match. It's a big difference in the conditions. “Ostapenko has raised her game considerably in the final set, but Rybakina has just had too much,” remarks Simon Reed on commentary. It was a false dawn for the Latvian. Rybakina breaks again, with relative ease, and is now one game away from victory. On Philippe-Chatrier, the fourth seed Paolini is a break up in the second set against Starodubtseva at 3-1 and also looking well set. She gees the crowd up as she celebrates, waving both hands above her head, and asking the fans for some energy as she battles against this fearsome opponent. She wins break points and has to wait an age for a bouncing defensive effort from Ostapenko after stretching the Latvian this way and that around the court. Rybakina waits, and waits, and then smacks an unerring smash down the line from the back of the court, giving her opponent no chance, and creating a double-break advantage at 4-1. Paolini has wrapped up the first set v Starodubtseva, 6-4. I was just about to say Rybakina is serving like a dream but here is a break-back point for Ostapenko at 30-40 … Rybakina, however, produces a power-packed serve out wide and then one down the middle, provoking a roar of frustration from her opponent. That was a big, impressive hold from break-point down. Right, I'm off for a break but Luke McLaughlin is here to keep an eye on things. We're still on serve between Paolini and Starodubtseva at 4-3 to the Italian. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Rybakina has wrapped up the first set 6-2, while Ben Shelton is on course to take a one-set lead against Gigante, the American leads 5-2. I wish I could comment on the action but as far as I can tell live action is only available on TNT this year, which is £30.90 per month. Why is no one in the media complaining? I can't answer your question, I'm just a humble blogman, but I'm not sure this is a great media strategy for the French Open in the UK. Roland Garros is not exactly top of the public consciousness here so to only focus on the tennis fans who are willing to pay seems like a quick way to shrink your audience. What a name Gigante is by the way. Still no service holds between Poalini and Starodubtseva… Can Starodubtseva make it count this time? It's not exactly packed on Philippe-Chatrier for the start of Paolini v Starodubtseva but those who are watching have seen the unseeded Ukranian get an early break. Jasmine Paolini, the fourth seed, is up next on Philippe-Chatrier. The recent Italian Open winner is taking on Yulia Starodubtseva of Ukraine. I'll mostly be keeping an eye on that but also providing updates from Elena Rybakina v Jelena Ostapenko and Ben Shelton v Matteo Gigante on Simonne Mathieu. With matches just getting underway, let's head to my inbox as Ed Graham has emailed in: About making women's matches best of five (13:34): I'm sure this has been debated at length and I for one would love to see it. I think the accepted reason for not doing so is to do with scheduling at the major tournaments, as sometimes they barely have enough days as it is with rain delays and so on. To extend the majors beyond two weeks would be a big headache; so maybe it'll happen once the venues have enough time, money and space to build all the extra courts they would need to get through the games in time. They all seem to be expanding their grounds, so why not? We have a bit of a lull in play now as Tommy Paul has beaten Karen Khachanov on Simonne Mathieu. The 12th seeded American eventually coming out on top 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9), 3-6, 6-3. At one stage the Frenchman looked on course for victory but after more than three hours in the searing heat on Philippe-Chatrier Rune rattled through the fifth set to complete a comeback from two sets to one down. It was a great match, super entertaining, we both played nice. I'm happy with the performance,” says Swiatek in her on-court interview. It's tricky when it's like that on just one day like that, the first match I played was 20 degrees, even less, and now its 30. I am used to playing in any conditions, maybe not here as Roland Garros is usually rainy but last year for the Olympics it was super hot so I was ready for it. At 30-15 down Swiatek finds a dart of backhand into the corner and when Cristian sends a forehand long down the line the reigning champions gets a match point. Cristian goes aggressive and gets a reward but there was a hairy moment when she was forced to pluck an overhead out of the sun. Swiatek wants to wrap this up without a tie-break and the two trade blows as the game ticks over five minutes. Swiatek reads a Cristian second serve to earn another match point with a backhand taken on the rise. A graphic has just flashed up showing Swiatek's first-serve percentage is down to just 50% in this set. It's not the only reason she has struggled but it has allowed Cristian to go after the second serve a lot more. Again, it's not fluent but Swiatek finds the hold and guarantees this set will go to a tie-break and gives her a shot on Cristian serve to close the match out. Another big first serve forces a Swiatek mistake and then Cristian bangs down an ace, it's 5-5 in the second! After that wobble Swiatek looks dialled in now. Her body language is more positive as she sails through her service game with a love hold.</p>

Crowds gathered during another filming segment of the BBC daytime series with expert Jon Baddley meeting with a guest and his array of impressive items from a former Wimbledon champion. In his tennis career, he won many, many events but he won Wimbledon in 1907, being the first foreigner to win Wimbledon which was considered a mammoth effort because the British weren't going to let it go easily.” “Other than that, everyone else has only got miniatures.” “I think that was borne out due to the fact they never expected to lose in 1907, so they just made another one, as it were. “Even Tony Wilding, who was a New Zealander, he lived in Britain, right? “But grandfather got, we believe, the only two full sized replicas and even when we inquired at Wimbledon, they didn't even know.” Baddley then began to appraise the fascination collection, elaborating: “Purely in financial terms, I would have thought the doubles jug is going to be worth, to a collector, let's put it that way, well in excess of $20,000 or £8,000.” “But certainly used by him, it's probably $5,000 or £2,000," Baddley said. I mean, only one other replica known, which you also own, and obviously the original is at Wimbledon, but a massively important trophy to tennis enthusiasts. “It's difficult to come up with a price but I think at auction, you're talking about a figure well in excess of $75,000 or £30,000. The guest doesn't react to the astonishing figures, instead stating: “I believe grandfather believed these belong to Australia, not an individual.” Baddley suggests a sporting museum which the guest said he would like to do. He shared: “I also have a personal interest in this, because, I don't know if you have noticed but, if I can pick it up here, on the side there is 1893. With a smile, the guest remarked: “How wonderful.” Baddley then cheekily stated: “So I hope you don't mind if I give it a quick kiss”, as he kissed the trophy with the guest laughing. “That's wonderful Jon”, the guest smiled before Baddley quipped: “I'll take it with me now”, pretending to run off with the iconic trophy, much to everyone's amusement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>9 de Minaur suffered a surprise second-round loss to Alexander Bublik at Roland-Garros and spoke post-match about the men's tennis schedule. He explained that players will "burn out mentally" if the demanding programme remains. MORE: Roland-Garros prize money – How much is on offer in 2025? "No one's got a solution," de Minaur said. "What's not normal is that for the last three, four years I've had two days off after the Davis Cup and I've gone straight into pre-season, straight into the new season again. I'm still dealing with that right now. "The solution is you shorten, because what's going to happen is players' careers are going to get shorter and shorter because they're just going to burn out mentally. Fellow Australian Jordan Thompson slammed the ATP Tour schedule days earlier, describing it as "sh**". "Unfortunately, with the schedule and how sh** it is, we can't afford to take breaks because you let other people just have an opportunity to pass you on the rankings and get more prize money, and you just feel like you're missing out on an opportunity," he said. On Thursday, two-time French Open finalist Casper Ruud likened the ranking system to a "rat race", outlining how players feel compelled to compete in the events, even if they are carrying injuries. "Well, it's kind of like a rat race when it comes to the rankings," he said. "You feel you're obligated to play with certain rules that the ATP have set up with the mandatory events.
