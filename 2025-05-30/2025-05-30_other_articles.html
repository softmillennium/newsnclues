WotC embraced the game's success in its 2024 ruleset with an emphasis on psionics, with aberrant sorcerers, psychic warriors and soulknives all appearing in the Player's Handbook. And Thursday's Unearthed Arcana continued that trend, putting out rules for the psion class for the first time since 4th edition. The amount of psion-focused art shared in a 9-minute video with the designers makes it feel more likely that this class is a keeper, possibly debuting in Forgotten Realms Players Guide releasing later this year. Their spells are enhanced by a well of internal energy that manifests as bonus dice in the same way as the soulknife and psychic warrior subclasses. At first level, a psion can expend the dice to telekinetically propel creatures around the battlefield or extend their natural telepathy. The number and size of their dice expand as they level up along with the ways a psion can use them to attack or defend themselves. They can also subtly infiltrate thoughts to gather information. Psykinetics are good at utilizing forcefields and blasting people with telekinetic energies while psi warpers manipulate the battlefield by repositioning themselves and their allies. Players who just want a taste of psionics without fully committing to a dedicated class or subclass can try one of the 10 new wild talent feats. The empath gains emotional sense they can use to influence others along with the ability to psionically cast charm person and calm emotions, while a pyrokineticist can change the damage of their attacks and spells to fire and cast some fire spells.

Speaking with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, Johnson, R-Oshkosh, said his interest in the attack on New York City, particularly regarding Building 7, a 47-story office building that fell several hours after planes were flown into the nearby Twin Towers, is "because the 9/11 families want to know the answer." “Building number 7 — you see it come down — and we've all watched, because it's cool to watch these buildings being demolished, boom, just freefall," Johnson said. "The only way that happens is if you remove all of their supports at the same time. You blow them all out so a building can really free-fall. The National Institute of Standards and Testing concluded that uncontrolled fires caused by debris from one of the center's Twin Towers caused steel beams and girders to expand, “leading to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail. Speaking with conservative radio host Meg Ellefson a day later, Johnson again cited the 2020 film “Calling out Bravo 7,” a production he's referenced in the past that questions the official story behind the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 in New York. "And as we find out, in so many different instances, you really can't trust the government what they told you," Johnson said. "I mean, the government has just repeatedly lied to the American public for decades on so many different issues. In a statement, Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Phil Shulman criticized Johnson's remarks. "Almost 3,000 Americans died in the 9/11 attacks — and Ron Johnson thinks it's ‘cool' to watch buildings collapse as a result of the worst terrorist attack on American soil," Shulman said. "It seems Ron Johnson could not care less about the devastation these attacks caused on our country." Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has called for more congressional hearings on the attacks while also criticizing as “corrupt” the investigation carried out by the standards and technology institute. Here's the latest for Friday, May 30th: White House says Israel accepted U.S. proposal for temporary Gaza ceasefire; Chaos at Gaza food distri… Democrat-backed state Supreme Court candidate won Wisconsin in April, while President Donald Trump carried the state in November.

Jensen Ackles is setting his sights on another television role post-Supernatural, with Prime Video's upcoming crime drama Countdown on the 2025 TV schedule. It was announced in June 2024 that he landed a new show from Chicago Fire creator Derek Haas, and he's been keeping fans updated throughout filming. Now Supernatural fans are saying it all after the streamer dropped a brand spankin' new look. Earlier this week, Ackles took to Instagram to share the first trailer for Countdown, which also stars Eric Dane and Jessica Camacho. Plenty of Supernatural fans had comments about the trailer, mostly just excited that they get to see Ackles on their television screens again. Some have also pointed out that Ackles and Dane together on the same show is a dream come true, and I can't say I disagree. There are also some sweet comments from some of Ackles' Supernatural co-stars that prove the SPN Family is truly forever: Jensen Ackles is Dean Winchester no more, but it's clear that many fans of the CW series will be watching his new show. Demons may not be involved, but the actor previously explained that fans will find a “familiar taste” with Countdown and his new character, Mark Meachum, an L.A. detective. Of course, it will be hard to see him in a new role, but Ackles has already done a few TV parts since Supernatural, most notably his turn as Soldier Boy on The Boys, which he will be reprising in the show's fifth and final season that will include a Supernatural reunion. Since the trailer has made fans more excited for Countdown, people will be happy to know that the wait won't be too long. The first three episodes of the series will be streaming for those with a Prime Video subscription beginning June 25, with new episodes dropping weekly. There will be a lot to look forward to, and if Supernatural fans are already excited, there is no telling what they will think of the show when it finally premieres. Considering it's from Derek Haas, whose credits include the One Chicago and FBI franchises, it's going to be a good one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To celebrate the release of A24's truly terrifying new film Bring Her Back, we invited real-life exorcist and author Rachel Stavis to sit down with the film's writer-directors, Danny and Michael Philippou (Talk to Me). What unfolds is part interview, part psychic reading, and a fascinating unveiling of the supernatural connections between Bring Her Back and allegedly very real demonic entities. As Stavis dives into the brothers' paranormal pasts and energy fields, the trio unpacks the film's core themes of grief, possession, and demonic spiritual attachment. Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a mother shattered by loss who will stop at nothing, including grotesque supernatural means, to bring her child back from the dead. Together, this conversation blurs the line between fiction and something far stranger. Read it for yourself below or check out the video here: Danny Philippou: (Hushed but silly) I'm scared as well.Rachel Stavis: (Logs on) Hi, how are you? I remove entities from people places and things, and say to, you know, I'm a, so I'm a big fan of yours or talking about that obviously in your movie. Now possession and attachment is really based in trauma. It really is about that energy, and it's a double-edged sword, you know, when you experience trauma and grief, and then else takes hold. And that's what's so great about your movie now, cause it's exactly how it works crazy, so you really tapped in thereDP: Awesome, thank you! We, we had, um, a shaman that was helping bless the set and cleanse it of negative energies and all that. So that was a process that happened before we started shooting, as we were shooting as well. RS: That's so smart that you do that… I don't wanna get too personal because we know this is going out to the wild world without getting into too much of your pastor background. And obviously, we don't know each other. This basically means that you are very sensitive to energy and I am going out on the limb here to say to you that, cause I don't know if you wanna admit it or not. I had some interesting, like, paranormal, kind of, weird things that have happened to you past. And, um, when we were 13. he passed away in our house. There was always a really comforting sound of him coming home at night, uh you know, when we were the most terrified. I was always so terrified of nighttime, and he would come home at night and he would, I could hear him, yeah, doing the dishes, and then he would make us food. And I remember a couple of days after he passed away, it was 1 o'clock in the morning, all the lights off in the house, everybody was asleep and then I could hear the dishes being done. And it was that comforting sound that I always would rely on and love hearing from my grandfather. And so I remember that it was comforting, but also a little bit terrifying. And then I spoke to my sister about it the next day and she's like, oh my god, did you hear that as well? And we had all heard the dishes being done at midnight with all the lights off of everyone asleep.MP: (Cheekily) It was me. MP: Our poor grandfather's stuck in the afterlife doing dishes…RS: What I think it's a sound that he was comforting. DP: And Michael hasn't washed the dishes in his life.MP: Actually I do. Danny doesn't wash the dishesRS: Your grandfather is with you all the time, you know that, right? He was a really good man, let's also put that out there. And you had a lot of fear at night because you had a lot of night terrors. And kids are in particular so empathic because we come in so open that the, you know, the world kind of takes it away as we get older. MP: I always, uh, worry about if we've attracted negative energies. Not because of the films that we made, but we also always seek out the most haunted places in the world and wanna stay at them. I look at the most haunted location and go stay there. I don't necessarily have a strong belief in it, but I'm always fascinated by it. I always love hearing stories and, and, uh, people talking about experiences, that's always fascinating to me. So I love doing it in different countries. I love diving into the occult world and interviewing people, and, and, like, hearing about different rituals.RS: Well, if it was anything real bad, believe that I would be like, we're gonna talk separate. When we are people who are attracted to the occult or people who love horror, it's because we too are trying to deal with our own. It's a way to provide comfort through that. MP: When you see entities, what does that look like physically? RS: They don't look like people at all. So deceased people and entities totally different. And I had a memoir come out and that kind of goes through like what the different entities are. That's, are they completely attached to that person or are they aware of your presence?RS: The answer is yes, but in weird ways. So when I go into public spaces, I try to block it out as much as possible. Because you have an entity and nobody wants to hear that can't just go up to people and be like, this horrible thing that happened to you. Let's discuss it, because there's a worst thing attached to you that I'd love to take out for you. DP: That'd be a hard conversation to have. The weirdest part is when you're watching a movie and you know, clearly, the actor has an attachment. MP: Wait, did you see attachments in Bring Her Back? BOTH: Oh, really attached to which character? MP: I was gonna say if you watch a film, and you see an actor, and they're on screen, and there's a and you see there's an MC attached, and it distracts you because it was captured in a moment of time.If that MC was removed later down the line, do you still see it in the film? RS: It's not there anymore, same with photographs actually, so I can see entities in pictures, and you wouldn't believe how many people are like, here are five pictures, can you tell me what's going on? It's like the full  he has gone So, it is true when they say that photos capture the soul! I mean, film would be the same thing? Dread Central's Mary Beth McAndrews recently awarded the film four stars in her review, writing Bring Her Back is a calculated risk to prove the filmmaking duo isn't afraid to go weirder and freakier while shattering a few more taboos along the way. It's that kind of risk-taking and original storytelling that keeps the genre feeling fresh and consistently relevant in popular culture.”Bring Her Back is now playing in theatres everywhere. With a powerhouse performance from Sally Hawkins and the Philippou brothers' signature mix of emotional horror and raw intensity, it's a chilling descent into the spiritual fallout of grief. If this interview taught me anything, it's that some stories … and some entities … don't stay buried for long.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New England is no stranger to the paranormal, with hundreds of preserved historical sites and accounts of hauntings stretching back centuries. For most, these stories are a source of frightening entertainment or morbid curiosity, but the Boston Paranormal Investigators, or BPI, see these cases as opportunities for discovery. BPI doesn't charge for private investigations and isn't promoting a radio or TV show; they are gathering research on the afterlife. Barry Corbett, a former BPI lead investigator, said that 80-90% of the spirits they encounter in their historic and private cases are “completely harmless, just stuck between two worlds,” unlike poltergeists and demons as depicted on TV and in movies. Corbett's lifelong fascination with the paranormal led him to write and publish “The Boston Paranormal Archives” in 2024, which highlights several haunted New England locations. In April, the group visited the Jeremiah Lee Mansion in Marblehead, Mass., a revolution-era estate that has been the scene of several otherworldly sightings and phenomena, according to Corbett's 2024 novel. “Unfortunately, he never got to see the revolution happen. He died right after the battle of Lexington and Concord of a cold he caught right as that battle was happening,” Zeman said. In some rooms, it pays homage to the later history of the building, like when it was a bank and family residence. BPI has been to the Lee Mansion three times before the April investigation, conducting research and doing public demonstrations. In his eight years with the group, Corbett has been to around 150 haunted sites. “We get a lot of voices, EVPs – electronic voice phenomena,” Corbett said. “We've heard knocking sounds; some of us in the group have seen physical manifestations before — I haven't, but a spirit did walk through me twice, and that's something to experience. It felt like electricity going through your body.” BPI uses a variety of gadgets to capture this ghostly evidence, including infrared camcorders, voice recorders, motion-activated trail cameras and regular iPhone cameras, trying to cover and monitor each room of a haunted site. They also employ REM pods, which detect changes in temperature and electromagnetic fields, as  well as laser grids — devices that highlight movements and disruptions — and movement-activated cat toys in an effort to give spirits as many avenues as possible for interworldly communication. In each ornately-decorated room, the group attempted to coax out a spirit. “We have cameras in quite a few of the rooms here, and we're hoping to catch an image of you. I can see why you might be camera shy, but we would sure love to see you,” Corbett said. “It's easy to communicate with us just by touching one of these, you don't have to touch it. The investigators made their way through the mansion and upstairs to a dark 19th-century nursery filled with antique baby rockers and eerie paintings of children. “This room is set up to represent bank families that lived in this house when it was a bank in the 19th century, and along the walls are what we call postmortem portraits,” Zeman said. These paintings were hung in a mourning family's parlor and often had ominous symbols indicating the child was dead or how they died. “It's like spinning a radio dial up and down. So it's sweeping so fast that it's going to be unusual for you to get a whole word or a sentence,” Corbett said. While BPI Investigator Brianne “Bree” Hantzis listens to the spirit box with over-ear headphones, other members of the group ask questions to try to break the ice with a lingering spirit. Hantzis sits on the floor, intently listening for any messages from beyond. “If we ask them something and she gives us an answer that makes sense, then we know it probably came from somewhere else,” Hantzis said. “Are there spirits in the room with us? Can you give me a name?” Corbett said. Hantzis said she also heard a male voice say “Go away,” to which Corbett assured that they would leave soon but had gotten permission to be there. “I just had a female voice say, ‘Hey Bree,'” Hantzis said. Corbett smiled as he scanned the room with his thermal camera. Corbett was originally brought into the group by founder Tom Elliott, who started BPI in 2006. Since Corbett stepped down as lead investigator in 2023, Laura Giuliano has been leading the crew of about a dozen investigators. Both sisters have a background in science – Hantzis has a degree in marine biology and works in biotechnology, and LaPorte is a biotechnology teacher at Essex North Shore Agricultural and Technical School. “From a science standpoint, how do we capture that? BPI returned to the Lee Mansion for a fourth time May 17 for a public event, where they showed a slideshow, took people around the mansion, trained them to use their ghost detection gadgets and raised funds for historical preservation. I didn't think ghosts were real,” Corbett said. “Now, I would say trust your senses, because we've got enough real evidence to convince me that they're certainly out there, and they're everywhere too.” In the final Estes session, Corbett asked, “Do you want us to come back again?” and with no answer heard, the BPI team packed up its gear.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Invisible radiation leaking out of private satellites, like SpaceX's Starlink spacecraft, is disrupting radio astronomers' ability to detect important signals from across the universe. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. If you look up at the sky on a clear night, shortly after one of SpaceX's many Falcon 9 rocket launches, you might see a bright string of lights zooming across the heavens. This phenomenon, known as a Starlink train, occurs when light reflects off a newly deployed batch of SpaceX satellites before they eventually fan out and become part of the wider Starlink network. But behind these lights lurks an invisible — and much more problematic — form of radiation: radio waves. If our eyes could also detect this hidden radiation, the sky would be full of bright spots and nonstop flashing that would obscure the distant signals from objects beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Some researchers are so worried about this invisible pollution that they think we could eventually reach an "inflection point," beyond which ground-based astronomy instruments could become radio-blind to the cosmos. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Radio astronomy allows us to see a host of hidden cosmic structures and phenomena that we can't detect through visual light alone. Radio telescopes are also constantly finding phenomena, such as fast radio bursts — millisecond pulses of ultra-energetic radiation, some of which repeat at regular intervals — that come from super-dense, highly magnetic objects such as neutron stars. Scientists scouring the skies for signs of alien life, such as those at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute, also favor hunting in radio waves because any advanced civilizations will likely use these wavelengths for communication, just as humans do. However, not all of these wavelengths are visible from Earth, and most astronomers hunt for signals somewhere between 1 megahertz and 100 GHz, according to the British Astronomical Association. Many of the world's biggest radio telescope arrays focus on even narrower ranges. For instance, the world's largest single telescope, China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, searches between 70 MHz to 3 GHz; while the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), the world's largest array of radio telescopes scattered across Australia and South Africa, scans between 50 MHz to 14 GHz. But increasingly, many of these frequencies are being bombarded by noise from Starlink and other satellites. While satellite messages deliberately beamed down to operators on Earth, known as intended downlinks, are problematic, the biggest risk to these projects is what's known as unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR), or the radio waves that inadvertently leak out of the spacecraft at all times. And UEMR is particularly prevalent among private satellite constellations, such as Starlink. When Di Vruno and colleagues used Europe's Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) to observe a group of Generation 1 Starlink satellites, they found that the satellites were leaking UEMR at a much higher rate than other orbiting spacecraft. In their results, published in 2023, they reported that this radiation had frequencies between 110 and 188 megahertz, representing a large portion of the operating range of LOFAR (10 to 240 MHz), which scans for signals from pulsars, solar wind, cosmic rays and galaxies from the Age of Reionization. "But we didn't anticipate that the level would be so high." And SpaceX will not be the only source of UEMR. Other companies, agencies and countries are also launching competing satellite constellations. These include Amazon's Project Kuiper, Eutelsat's OneWeb network (which is being launched by SpaceX), the European Union's IRIS² network, AST SpaceMobile's giant communication satellites, and China's Qianfan, or "Thousand Sails," constellation, Di Vruno noted. "We don't know [how much UEMR these spacecraft will emit] yet," Winkel said. "Every satellite will have UEMR, but it remains to be seen, at what level." As a result, many other frequencies could be affected, he added. In addition to overlapping with the frequencies of distant signals, UEMR is also much more intense, or brighter, than naturally occurring radio-emitting objects. Trying to detect signals from beyond one of these satellites is "like taking a photograph while someone points a flashlight in your direction," Winkel said. Some radio telescopes, such as LOFAR, will be hit harder than others, due to the frequencies they specialize in, but all radio telescopes will be affected "in different ways," Di Vruno said. Studies that require long-term datasets will be particularly susceptible to interference because there is a greater chance that leaky satellites will pass over them during the data collection period. "As some projects need to continuously record data over hours, days, months or years, even tiny interference signals can have a statistical impact on the results," Winkel said. Intended downlinks, which are sent in multiple frequencies over 1 GHz, are also extremely bright and often appear in tandem with UEMR, exaggerating these effects. As the problem gets worse, certain frequencies will become increasingly hard to study. "Some radio bands could be completely wiped out," Di Vruno said. More than 7,300 of those (over 60%) are Starlink satellites, which have all been launched since 2019, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has been tracking satellite launches and reentries since 1986. Well over 1 million satellites have been proposed by various organizations across the globe. And, while most of these may never be launched, many experts agree that we could eventually have up to 100,000 private satellites in LEO, potentially by as early as 2050. Related: What goes up must come down: How megaconstellations like SpaceX's Starlink network pose a grave safety threat to us on Earth If that maximum number is reached, there is "real possibility" that we could reach an inflection point, beyond which ground-based radio astronomy would become effectively impossible, Di Vruno said. However, the obscured wavelengths will likely be lost for good, and the unaffected frequencies are unlikely to yield as many meaningful discoveries, he added. At this point, we would no longer be able to "observe faint signals far out into the universe," which would be "a serious problem," Fionagh Thomson, a research fellow at Durham University in England who specializes in space ethics and was not involved in the LOFAR research, told Live Science. Some radio astronomy could also still be achievable from space on a smaller scale. For example, there are plans to build a radio telescope on the moon. But even if we avoid the "worst-case scenario," we risk severely limiting our astronomical capabilities unless satellite operators and researchers can find viable solutions to the problem, Thomson said. Satellite operators can limit the impacts of their spacecraft on radio astronomy in a few ways. For example, most intended downlink frequencies are kept separate from those used by radio astronomers. Some companies, including SpaceX, are also investigating the implementation of "boresight avoidance," in which the satellites temporarily halt signal sending as they pass over radio "quiet zones," or areas where radio telescopes are actively collecting data. However, for astronomers, it is also imperative that these companies minimize UEMR. We know that this is possible because spacecraft from NASA and other space agencies produce much less accidental radiation than private satellites do. But companies can only mitigate a satellite's UEMR before it is launched into space. "If satellite operators care about the UEMR, we will be OK," Di Vruno said. However, this "cleaning" may cause astronomers to miss crucial data that is masked by the interference. "We would, of course, be more relaxed if proper regulation was in place," Winkel said. At present, specific radio frequencies, like those used by LOFAR, are protected on behalf of astronomers by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) — a United Nations agency responsible for regulating global communications technologies. Most satellite operators do try to respect the ITU's guidelines when using intended downlinks — with limited degrees of success. But UEMR frequently overlaps with the protected wavelengths and remains perfectly legal. —Sci-fi inspired tractor beams are real, and could solve a major space junk problem Some experts also argue that the ITU's radio-quiet frequency bands are no longer wide enough to protect radio astronomy: "They were set in a different era and are arguably too narrow for modern radio astronomy," Thomson said. Therefore, it is important for researchers to closely monitor the radiation leaking from private satellite constellations over the next few years, so that any new rules can have an effective and long-standing impact, he added. However, even stricter guidelines might not be enough if organizations don't respect them. "There is an assumption that imposing laws will fix complex problems," Thomson said. "But not all viable solutions involve implementing binding legislation," she warned. He studied marine biology at the University of Exeter before training to become a journalist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is an easy, carefree pastime, but even at this young age, he knows that it will make him a better footballer; every touch and every shot strengthening his bond with the ball, sharpening his muscle memory. At Rennes and then Borussia Dortmund, he is the very epitome of footballing potential: a whirlwind of sidesteps and breezy dribbles, a broad smile forever stretched across his face, a trail of befuddled opponents forever floundering in his wake. At Barcelona, after a record-breaking €135million transfer, things get complicated: injuries, recurrent complaints about his time-keeping and professionalism, the fear that his potential is destined never to be truly fulfilled. But the planets have aligned at Paris Saint-Germain, where his abrupt transformation into a prolific goalscorer means that he approaches Saturday's Champions League final against Inter in Munich accompanied by a higher level of expectation than perhaps any other player. Should PSG prevail, the Ballon d'Or could well be his. As he stands on the brink of career-defining glory, this is his story so far. “We'd have kickabouts with friends at the foot of our building or we'd challenge a team from another neighbourhood to a game. He could already shoot with both feet and his dribbling was instinctive. A child of the 2000s, having been born in May 1997, Dembele grew up idolising players such as David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Lionel Messi. The dream of following in their gilded footsteps took root at an early age. Dembele was seven years old when he and Diatta joined local club ALM Evreux (later to become Evreux FC), whose pitches lay a 10-minute walk away across the Boulevard du 14 Juillet. The first time Evreux youth coach Gregory Badoche laid eyes on him, he could scarcely believe them. He was a little shrimp, you know, a very slender guy with legs like toothpicks, but his dribbling ability was insane.” Interest from major local clubs did not take long to arrive. “There was a recruiter from Rennes called Armand Djire who used to come and watch him regularly,” says Badoche. “When Ousmane was still only 12, Armand said to me: ‘If he doesn't become a professional, I'll end my career'.” Amid interest from Red Bull Salzburg, he downed tools in the summer of 2015, sitting out a two-week training camp in Germany, before eventually putting pen to paper on a three-year professional contract. After making his debut off the bench in a 2-0 win at Angers in October 2015, the 18-year-old became a fixture in the starting XI and finished his maiden campaign with an excellent return of 12 goals and five assists from 26 Ligue 1 games. “He was very collective-minded,” says former Rennes head coach Philippe Montanier. I remember the derby against Lorient (a 2-2 draw in January 2016). The unintentionally comical effect of that interview created an impression of a young player whose head was tethered to his shoulders with less than customary tightness. But those who know him insist that behind the impression of absent-mindedness lies a keen intelligence. “Sometimes he'll seem a bit in his own world, then the next second he'll seem very switched on,” says a source close to Dembele, speaking anonymously to protect relationships. So in a conversation, you might think he's a bit lost, but then he'll suddenly start talking to you about the Bolsheviks. Before his first season in senior football had reached its conclusion, Dembele had been announced as a Dortmund player, joining the club from the Ruhr valley on a five-year contract for a fee of €15million. “We had a pretty simple life there,” Diatta recalls. “It was our first experience overseas, so we were discovering life abroad. We were lucky to find French players there like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who really took Ousmane under his wing.” The kind of football career that Dembele had pictured for himself in those kickabouts in La Madeleine was suddenly upon him: a gigantic stadium, packed to the rafters with 80,000 wildly cheering fans; glamorous Champions League ties against Real Madrid, Sporting CP, Benfica and Monaco; taut domestic tussles with Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig. Initially taken aback by the intensity of Dortmund's training sessions, Dembele soon got up to speed and credited head coach Thomas Tuchel with giving him the liberty to play his natural game. “When I have the ball, it's total freedom,” he told L'Equipe. It's gratifying to feel this confidence in me, as if I was 25.” Before joining Barcelona, Dembele had never sustained a serious injury. Within two weeks of being unveiled at a sun-soaked Camp Nou in August 2017, he ruptured the tendon in the femoral bicep of his left thigh, which sidelined him for nearly four months. It created an unfortunate template for what was to follow. In Dembele's early years at Barca, his body continually betrayed him. Further problems with his left hamstring came in January 2018 and March 2019. A muscle tear in his left thigh the following August. A knee tendon issue in June 2021 that forced him out of Euro 2020. It did not help that, even when he was fit, he did not always seem entirely present, with repeated instances of lateness driving the club's decision-makers to distraction. Dembele was living with Diatta and his uncle in a luxurious house in Barcelona's upmarket Pedralbes neighbourhood and the fear within the club was that he was spending too much time playing video games and not enough time focused on football. “In his early days, he didn't have the professional mindset of a Barca player,” says a source who worked with Dembele during his time at the club. Sometimes he'd fall asleep at home and that was it. Diatta puts Dembele's teething problems at Barca down to inexperience. Encouraged by his agent, Moussa Sissoko, Dembele took on a full-time personal chef, Anthony Audebaud, in the summer of 2019. A year later he started working with a personal fitness coach, former elite sprinter Salah Ghaidi, and physiotherapist Jean-Baptiste Duault, who was taken on after impressing Dembele's entourage with his analysis of the player's injury problems in an interview with L'Equipe. The feeling in Dembele's camp was that Barcelona's focus on patient, possession-dependent football meant that their training sessions were not sufficiently dynamic for him from a physical perspective. Backed by his new personal support staff, Dembele took physical preparation and injury prevention into his own hands, constructing a daily fitness schedule designed to strengthen and protect the muscles that had previously been his undoing. With his injury problems finally behind him, Dembele's last three seasons at Barcelona were much happier as he became a key figure under first Ronald Koeman and then Xavi. Although his attacking statistics remained largely underwhelming, he bowed out as a Barca player with three La Liga titles and two Copa del Rey wins to his name. “He eventually became a sort of veteran in the dressing room and his team-mates understood him better in his last years,” says the Barcelona source. “Dembele ended up being loved for how he was.” The turnaround in Dembele's Barca fortunes also permitted him to resurrect his international career. He played only a peripheral role in France's triumph at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, having lost his place after their opening game, and then went 860 days without playing for Les Bleus between November 2018 and March 2021. But although injury curtailed his involvement at Euro 2020, he was a first-choice pick on the right flank at both the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024. “Some players understand things very quickly and are already mature at the age of 19 or 20, like Kylian,” says Ludovic Batelli, who coached both Dembele and Mbappe at under-19 level with France. “I think Ousmane needed a bit more time to understand that work, rigour and discipline would make him even more effective and successful. Having agreed to meet a €50million (£42.9m, $54.9m) release clause in Dembele's Barcelona contract, the PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi sold his club's project to the forward by vowing that he would be the homegrown figurehead of a young, hungry team with a strong French identity. Paris had been a 70-minute train ride from Evreux during Dembele's childhood and he had happy memories of going to watch games with his friends at the Parc des Princes. It helped, too, that Dembele already knew PSG's newly appointed coach. While coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique had enquired about the winger's availability following his breakthrough at Rennes, only for Dembele to inform him that he had already given his word to Dortmund. “Luis Enrique was fiercely protective of him, right from day one,” says a source close to the PSG coach. After claiming a league and Coupe de France double alongside Mbappe in his maiden PSG season, Dembele was one of the players expected to step up to the plate when his long-time friend left the French capital for Real Madrid last summer. Things did not get off to the best start when he was dropped on disciplinary grounds for PSG's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in the Champions League in October. Dembele had questioned Luis Enrique's possession-heavy tactics during a team briefing and subsequently reported late for a training session, although a source close to him suggests that he was primarily axed for the trip to the Emirates Stadium in order to send a message to the rest of the squad. Yet only two months later, Luis Enrique happened upon a tactical innovation that would reinvigorate PSG's season — and transform Dembele's career. The decision to deploy Dembele as a false nine for a 3-1 home win over Lyon in mid-December proved the spark for a stupendous run of goal-scoring form in which the France international racked up 27 goals in only 22 appearances. Amassed in the space of only three and a half months, it represented twice as many goals as he had ever previously mustered over the course of an entire season. Sources close to him additionally point to the hours of work he has spent on his finishing in training over the last 12 months, as well as input from a personal video analyst. As the deliberately elusive focal point of a deliberately loose-limbed starting XI, the super-fit Dembele also plays a pivotal role in PSG's build-up play and their formidable pressing game. Although grand speeches have never been his style (“a connector rather than a leader” is how one source describes him), he fulfils an important function in the club's youthful, multilingual changing room. “He speaks several languages, which facilitates links with his team-mates,” says a source close to the PSG squad. “He's also someone who's very jovial, who likes taking the mick, and that helps to create a good atmosphere and bind the squad together.” Dembele's performances have also benefited from the fact that, away from the pitch, he has moved into a more settled phase in his life. Though fatherhood and the demands of elite-level football have inevitably reduced the amount of free time on his hands, he remains a committed Football Manager player and watches as much live football as he can. “I watch practically every championship,” he confided to Le Parisien last year. But according to those who know him, until he has the Champions League trophy in his hands, thoughts of individual glory can wait. “For him, the most important thing is to win the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain, because it would be something historic,” says best friend Diatta. “And it'd be deserved, when you look at his journey. He's been through tough times, people have spoken ill of him, about the injuries and things like that, but he's never complained.</p>

The term Pallywood—a portmanteau of Palestine and Hollywood—stems from a long-standing claim that Palestinians fabricate their suffering for cameras, using actors, dolls, or staged scenes to smear Israel. It offers an all-purpose, ready-made excuse to dismiss even the most well-documented atrocities, sowing just enough doubt to ignore Palestinian suffering entirely. This conspiracy has been around for years, but mentions of Pallywood spiked dramatically after Oct. 7, 2023, far surpassing previous peaks for the term during past Israeli military offensives in Gaza and the West Bank. One of the most grotesque examples came in December 2023, when a wave of pro-Israel accounts—including the official @Israel handle, the Jerusalem Post, and influencers like Ben Shapiro—amplified the claim that a grieving Palestinian man, seen in a widely shared video cradling his killed baby grandson, was faking it. Others—including StopAntisemitism, Hen Mazzig, and Yoseph Haddad, echoed the claim to millions more. The supposed “doll” these accounts amused over was his body. When I met Richard Landes in New York, he had just arrived from Israel, where he also keeps a home. Dressed in a wide-brimmed hat and walking with a cane, he looked like an aging adventurer, eager to deliver to me his theory about media deception and how Palestinian propaganda had “evolved” into what he calls “Pallywood 3.0”—a supposedly industrialized version of the staging of tragedies he believes he uncovered decades ago. Few have done more to promote the Pallywood myth than Landes, a medievalist and historian of apocalyptic movements who coined the term. In his most recent book, 2022's Can “the Whole World” Be Wrong?, he argues that Western journalists are unwittingly reporting Palestinian propaganda as legitimate news (a phenomenon he calls “lethal journalism”), rendering them complicit in spreading antisemitic narratives under the guise of human-rights reporting. The book expands on the idea of Pallywood as an intricate, evolving system of staged deception designed to manipulate global opinion against Israel. Over coffee, Landes traced his convictions back to the case of Muhammad al-Durrah, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy shot and killed in 2000 at Netzarim Junction, in Gaza, an event caught on film and broadcast worldwide. Landes said he was immediately suspicious of the footage. He described to me his benevolent curiosity, watching hours of raw video from the scene and discovering what he believes were signs of staging—injured men getting up, ambulances whisking away seemingly unharmed people. He fixated on the final frames, when al-Durrah, moments from death, appears to move his arm. I don't think he was killed.” He remains convinced that Palestinian camera operators, medics, and bystanders were all in on a kind of elaborate theater. (What actually happened that day has been the subject of extensive revelations and questionable reversals for decades; al-Durrah's family, and the people who witnessed the events, maintain that he was killed by Israeli soldiers.) He argues that Palestinians are waging war with empathy. “They're manipulating the compassion of Westerners so that they can get a massive response of anger at Israel, force her to a ceasefire, and thereby spare Hamas so Hamas can once again start a round in which they draw Israeli fire onto their own civilians.” Landes told me that nearly every clip from Gaza and the West Bank contains clues. “Women weep openly, but is it common for men to do the same in grief? And yet, in these videos, you see men weeping dramatically.” He pointed to Gazawood, a crowdsourced website and X account that compiles what it claims are Pallywood slipups—supposed bad edits, recurring actors, makeup mistakes. The account frequently shares videos of dead Palestinian babies, speculating that they might be fake. Landes continues to monitor footage from Gaza closely. I pointed out that many so-called examples of Pallywood have been debunked—like videos supposedly showing Arab children having makeup applied to fake injuries, recordings that are actually behind-the-scenes footage from films or commercials. But Landes insisted that his broader point still stood: “I'm not saying that every claim of Pallywood is fairly accurate. Though he stops short of denying the destruction in Gaza outright, Landes believes that the world is slowly catching on. He cites past cases—like the 2004 Gaza beach bombing, in which four Palestinian children were targeted by Israeli naval strikes while playing soccer, and for which he claims that Hamas land mines were actually responsible—as examples of how initial narratives shape public perception long before facts are verified. Even when he concedes that Israeli forces may commit atrocities, he argues that Palestinian exaggerations, and the willingness of Western journalists to relay them, are what truly fuel the cycle of violence. As Israel bans foreign journalists from entering and reporting freely in Gaza, I asked Landes, what hope do we have to verify information in the way he seeks? Laila Al-Arian, an Emmy- and Peabody-winning investigative journalist and executive producer of Al Jazeera's Fault Lines, has spent the months since October 2023 reporting on Gaza. Her feed is flooded with footage of bombed homes, bloodied children, frantic rescue efforts—as well as accusations that it's all fake. “It's everywhere on my Twitter,” she told me. They're inventing stories to discredit what's right in front of them: suffering, atrocities, death,” she said. Al-Arian, who is Palestinian American, said the “Pallywood” label has followed her work for years but has intensified with the war in Gaza. The assertion that Palestinians are unreliable narrators of their own stories deeply frustrates her. It's all about delegitimizing Palestinian voices,” she said. “If you paint Palestinians as irrational, obsessed with martyrdom, you shift the conversation away from settler colonialism, land theft, ethnic cleansing.” In her work, she often has to contend with the effects of this doubt; while Israeli lives are consistently portrayed with sensitive compassion in Western media, Palestinians are often denied that. The world sees only a fraction of what's really happening, she told me: “Forget Pallywood. The real tragedy is how much we don't see. What makes it out is just a sliver of reality.” Even so, it wasn't hard to find journalists in the region who see things differently. For reporters like Al-Arian, there is a flood of raw footage: families pulling bodies from rubble, lifeless and bloodied children in the arms of dispirited parents. But in pro-Israel circles, those same platforms are filled with selective clips framed as evidence of Palestinian trickery—a “corpse” shifting under a shroud, civilians eating desserts amid a food shortage. “Do you know Mr. FAFO?” Ruthie Blum, an Israeli journalist, former Jerusalem Post editor, and former adviser at the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, asked me. She was referring to Saleh Aljafarawi, a Palestinian musician turned citizen journalist who now documents Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in real time. Aljafarawi was given the FAFO nickname—short for “Fuck Around and Find Out”—after pro-Israel accounts circulated footage of him early on in the war cheering on Hamas rockets, juxtaposed with videos of him weeping amid Gaza's devastation. He quickly became a central figure in the Pallywood conspiracy. His image is often used to suggest that Palestinians are staging their suffering—even when the videos shown aren't of him. “You'll see a row of dead bodies covered in sheets, and then one of them lifts his arm to check his phone. Or there's this other one, with a father weeping over his supposedly dead kid, and then the kid starts scratching his foot. And she insists that the images perpetuate a culture of violence within Palestinian society. “They say: ‘Look at this dead boy—you should aspire to that.' That's what makes it different from other kinds of propaganda. This is why Palestinian children are such victims of their society—because they are taught to idolize not only killers but killers who died in the process of killing.” Blum doesn't deny that real suffering is happening in Gaza. But she praised the Israeli army's rules of engagement and argued that even if any of the images are authentic, “every death in Gaza is on Hamas' hands.” Because it's an English term, most Palestinians in Gaza have never even heard of Pallywood. But Tom Divon, a researcher at Hebrew University specializing in digital culture, told me that the idea is much more powerful—and deeply ingrained—than the term itself. We wait for the injured girl to stand up, laugh, and reveal the lie, because we've been trained to see Gaza through a lens of suspicion,” he said. Since Oct. 7, Divon said, skepticism around Palestinian suffering has evolved. Where the term Pallywood was once invoked to suggest manipulation, many now simply look away: doubting death tolls, dismissing the scale of destruction, or otherwise accepting outright that mass civilian casualties are an acceptable cost of a just war. “Gaza's inhabitants are objectified, reduced to numbers or blurry concepts. The media rarely shows unfiltered images or personal stories, because doing so would be too confronting for most viewers,” he said. That distancing, he noted, predates the current war. These days, when Palestinians post TikToks documenting life in a locked-off war zone, many Israelis begin from a baseline of disbelief. has only deepened public skepticism, making it feel increasingly plausible that any image or video, no matter how realistic, could be fake. Within Israeli society, he said, it's easier to imagine Palestinian suffering as unserious or exaggerated than to grapple with what the Israeli military is inflicting. Because acknowledging it as truth would shatter us,” he said. “How long until we look back and recognize that our mechanisms of denial were too strong, that we ignored the truth?” Maytha Alhassen, a historian who studies media and national identity, sees Pallywood not as a uniquely Israeli phenomenon but as part of the mythmaking process in many nations. She points to the 2022 documentary Tantura, which reveals how, decades ago, Israel erased evidence of massacres while promoting the idea that Palestine was “empty land,” a narrative essential to its national origin story. The emotional investment in these beliefs, she argues, makes confronting the reality of Israel's founding—displacement and devastation for Palestinians—almost impossible for many. This, she believes, is why accusations of Pallywood gain traction. They're meant not just to discredit Palestinian suffering but to preserve the psychological comfort of those invested in the status quo: “When your identity is formed around a nation-state, it requires so many acrobatic maneuvers to maintain it.” For many, Alhassen said, facing the reality of what's happening in Gaza means facing something personal. While reporting this article, I spoke to many journalists and doctors on the ground in Gaza who told me that the horrors they'd witnessed were beyond question. Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care physician, described treating a child whose body had been mangled by an Israeli bulldozer that ran over her tent while she slept. Despite her best efforts, the girl died in agony. Though several relatives and neighbors sheltering with them were killed, Mhawish and his family were pulled out alive by neighbors, bloodied but breathing. He resumed reporting shortly after recovering from his injuries. Stories like these are so wrenching, so unbearable, that it becomes easier to understand why some would rather call them fake—“Pallywood”—than confront what they reveal. Combing through these examples, I thought back to my conversations with Landes. I wondered if he had any thoughts on No Other Land, filmed from 2019 to 2023 in the West Bank by, as it happens, a team of both Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers. “The ‘documentary' is a classic expression of Palestinian propaganda,” he told me. That the film could win an Academy Award, he said, was “testimony to the collapse of professional standards before the demands of political correctness.” Then he added: “If Palestinians expended a fraction of the energy and creativity they dedicate to maligning Israelis and playing victim on building a future for themselves, this would not be a forever war.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lone, battered shipping container that has washed up on the beach in Paravur, a small fishing hamlet between Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam, is the talk of the town. The reddish-brown container, like many more than have beached all along Kerala's coast following the recent sinking of a Liberia-registered ship, has piqued curiosity and, for now, taken a daily staple off the plates of most households in these parts – fish. On Sunday, May 25, MSC Elsa 3, an 184-metre-long container ship, sank while it was sailing from Vizhinjam port to Cochin port, triggering alarm in coastal hamlets all the way from Alappuzha in mid-north Kerala to Kollam further south. The ship was carrying an estimated 640 containers, including 13 with “hazardous cargo”, of which 12 are said to have contained calcium carbide. A solid compound, calcium carbide is not flammable by itself, but it reacts vigorously with water and moisture to produce highly flammable acetylene gas, posing a significant fire hazard. The ship also had 84 metric tonnes of diesel and 367 metric tonnes of furnace oil, the Coast Guard said Sunday. Around Paravur beach, men in khaki have been deployed to guard the container, lest some intrepid local falls prey to curiosity and tries to prise it open. A constable has been deputed to clear traffic as people slow down vehicles on the narrow beach road to check out the container. There are a bunch of people on the beach shooting reels and shorts with the container in the backdrop, as are children in uniform, who have taken a detour on their way home from school to witness the local spectacle. Valsala Srikumar, though, has a harried look. The same as Monday,” she says, standing metres away from the ice cream vendor, peddling a full stock of fish on a yard stool by the beach road. Today, Valsala's husband has ventured out “to the cleaner parts” seeking a catch, but it's pointless now. “This is just a phase,” he hopes. For a populace fed on a steady diet of politics and media, conspiracy theories come easy. “Is Liberia linked to Pakistan… like Turkey?” a person in the crowd asks, a query that's quickly dismissed by someone else who is more well-versed in these matters. A ship's flag state testifies to the country where it is registered, but much of this is determined by the tonnage tax advantages offered by jurisdictions such as Liberia or Cyprus. Teams of scientists from the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, are collecting water and sediment samples across locations on the Kerala coast. While the containers are being removed from the coastline, one by one, a clean-up of the beach waters could be a long way off. Until that happens, Valsala's fishing business could be in some trouble.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fighter pilots have reportedly experienced close encounters with UFOs, but they remain tight-lipped due to fear of repercussions. Filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee claims that after being approached by British RAF pilots with UFO sightings akin to those of their U.S. colleagues, he realized the stark absence of whistleblower protections in the U.K. that would enable them to speak out. Consequently, these incidents go unreported, and the public remains uninformed, unlike in America where pilots can disclose their experiences mostly without consequence. He went as far as reaching out to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in pursuit of legislation similar to that in the U.S. which would shield military members from backlash when recounting their unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) episodes. "We have military pilots who have had real life encounters with UAPs," Lee exclusively told the Daily Star, the Daily Express US's sister brand. These individuals are willing to share their accounts anonymously. However, the fear of what might happen if they come forward publicly hangs over them. It's not just pilots, other military staff and even police officers have stories to tell. Mark said, "We also have accounts from other military personnel and police who want to come forward. The consequences they dread are serious, from losing jobs to facing ridicule or demotion, and potentially even legal action. "Will they be fired, ridiculed, demoted - even prosecuted - for speaking out? And there's more at stake than their careers – family wellbeing is also a concern. DON'T MISS...Scientist warns eerie UFO could test humanity's limitsAmerica's mysterious 'UFO base' uncovered by CIA is new alien hotspotUFO hit military plane in mysterious incident near US Air Force training range "Information about extraordinary events is being withheld from them. These encounters could amount to threats to national security - certainly sightings of mystery craft near military bases and personnel must fall into that category. "But until pilots feel free to speak out without fearing they will be grounded the country is burying its head in the sand." David Grusch, a former Afghanistan combat veteran and U.S. Air Force intelligence officer, made a shocking unfounded claim in his statement to Congress, stating the U.S. government had recovered extraterrestrial entities and debris from ten UFO crashes. Grusch, without evidence, asserted that he had interviewed at least 40 witnesses involved in these covert operations In his letter to Starmer, Lee, whose documentary on the Royal Family's interest in UFOs has gained worldwide attention, he encouraged him to follow the US Government's disclosure process. "Decorated military pilots are giving testimony under oath that they have encountered craft of unknown origin beyond our current technological capabilities,'' he stated. "We have many people in the U.K. military and police service who want to come forward publicly but are afraid of the repercussions to themselves, their family and their careers."</p>
