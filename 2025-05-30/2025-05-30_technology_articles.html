                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk will not be fully exiting the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—and its activities are only intensifying. On Friday, President Donald Trump threw cold water on the idea that Musk would fully disappear from DOGE and the White House forever. It's his baby, he's going to be doing a lot of things." “I expect to continue to provide advice," Musk, wearing a black hat with DOGE written on it and a black shirt reading “DOGEFATHER,” said during Friday's press conference, while noting that his legal limit for service as a special government employee was coming to an end. Federal workers from at least six agencies tell WIRED that DOGE-style work is escalating in their departments. Trump appeared to confirm that contracts were under review at Friday's press conference: "Many contracts, Elon, right now are being looked at,” he said. Some agencies have also received visits from DOGE at their headquarters, WIRED has learned. In recent weeks, the pressure to slash and cancel contracts, specifically focused on workforce management and IT, has drastically increased, multiple sources at a variety of agencies tell WIRED. “Biggest thing is we are being asked to cut as many contracts for software and labor as possible,” one tech worker at the Department of the Interior (DOI) tells WIRED, saying that the stated goal, as they understand it, has been “to save money and efficiency in consolidated IT.” “We are cutting developers, telecom, server admins, call center staff etc.,” the DOI source says. “Some things were bloated and could use the cut. Urgent contract oversight is also occurring at the Department of Labor (DOL). “There is a LOT of pressure to end these contracts as soon as possible, within the next few days,” a source at the DOL told WIRED on Thursday. At other agencies, like the USDA and the Treasury, some tech workers were recently notified that they may be asked to interview with someone at DOGE for an unspecified reason. “Just last week we were warned of possible contact from DOGE for interviews,” the USDA IT source says, adding that no one told workers what the interviews would be about. At Treasury, employees were told those who perform “some of the more technical functions” would be pulled into these interviews. “As a result, it is with regret that your work on the OPM contract will end.” “DOGE has delivered remarkable results at an unprecedented pace, and its work is far from complete.” United States DOGE Service administrator Amy Gleason did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “Elon may be stepping away, but DOGE's mission remains stronger than ever. We are also working closely with the White House to ensure recession packages reflect DOGE's critical findings—turning transparency into action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Expect to find our contributions across all of the greatest hits — WordPress Core, Gutenberg, Playground, Openverse, and WordPress.org. This return is a moment of excitement for us as it's about continuing the mission we've always believed in: democratizing publishing for everyone, everywhere,” it reads. However, according to sources who spoke to TechCrunch, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg explained in an internal post published last night that he wants to get a 6.9 release out this year with an admin refresh and something from the “new AI team.” (The latter references this week's announcement that WordPress formed a new team to steward the development of AI projects.) Some wonder if Mullenweg was pressured into this move or if he realized that pulling back wasn't good for his business or its reputation? No one knows what to believe, and none of these backchannel theories line up with the officially stated reason. Since 2024, Automattic has been engaged in a legal dispute that has to do with how little, in Mullenweg's opinion, WP Engine contributes to the WordPress project, despite its size and revenue. This led him to ban the company from accessing WordPress.org and sue in court for unauthorized trademark usage. Simply put, Mullenweg thinks WP Engine should either pay a direct licensing fee or up its contributions to the open source WordPress project, or shouldn't be allowed to use its trademark.

One of Gigabyte's B650 (AM5) motherboards now lists support for AMD's unreleased and likely soon-to-launch Ryzen 9000G series APUs, as reported by VideoCardz. This suggests that AMD's upcoming Ryzen 9000G APUs will probably be supported on existing 600 and 800 series motherboards, of course, with a necessary BIOS update. We first heard of AMD's Ryzen 9000G processors in late March, with leakers suggesting they'd employ Gorgon Point silicon. These APUs succeed AMD's incumbent Phoenix-built Ryzen 8000G lineup, which first debuted in January 2024. As for the underlying silicon, there are some nuances since Gorgon Point is rumored to be a refresh of Strix Point (Ryzen AI 300), alleged to offer single-digit performance increments across the board. Gigabyte has inadvertently published a list of supported memory modules for unreleased Ryzen 9000G APUs on its B650M GAMING WIFI6E motherboard. This marks the second unofficial confirmation that these APUs will slot into existing AM5 motherboards. In terms of expected specifications, we're looking at up to 12 hybrid cores (4x Zen 5 + 8x Zen 5c) / 24 threads, a 16 Compute Unit equipped graphics engine based on RDNA 3.5, and an XDNA 2 based NPU that can dish out between 50-55 TOPS of AI performance. Additionally, leaks suggest a Q4 2025 release timeline for these processors, which is several months off. Gorgon Point has several tiers (GorgonPoint1, GorgonPoint2, and GorgonPoint3) based on a previous leak. Some of these dies may be recycled further down the stack as Krackan Point silicon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The WSJ reports that those who received phone calls impersonating Wiles used AI to impersonate her voice and sent text messages from a number not associated with Wiles. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly would not say, when asked by TechCrunch, if authorities had determined if a cloud account associated with Wiles' personal device was compromised, or if Wiles' phone was targeted by a more advanced cyberattack, such as one that involves the use of government-grade spyware. This is the second time Wiles has been targeted by hackers. In 2024, The Washington Post reported that Iranian hackers had attempted to compromise Wiles' personal email account. The Journal said Friday, citing sources, the hackers were in fact successful in breaking into her email and obtained a dossier on [Vice President] JD Vance, then Trump's running mate. Reports later revealed that the government officials were using a Signal clone app called TeleMessage, which was designed to keep a copy of messages for government archiving. TeleMessage was subsequently hacked on at least two occasions, revealing the contents of its users' private messages. Answer a few quick AI trivia questions to start your challenge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Palmer Luckey, the original founder of Oculus VR who has since become a military contractor, weren't on the best of terms for many years. There's major money to be made in military tech, but Zuckerberg and Luckey—two nerds who made billions off their consumer products—are also bound tight by their newfound ultra-masculine, Trump-supporting personas. On Thursday, the pair declared they were hitching themselves back together after their initial nasty divorce and subsequent lawsuit nearly a decade ago. Luckey's military contracting company, Anduril, and Meta announced they were going to make “the world's best” AR and VR technology for the U.S. military. This initial project is dubbed “EagleEye” and, according to The Wall Street Journal, will be some kind of “rugged” VR system that could detect enemy soldiers or drones. The Oculus founder added that he and Zuck had been working on several projects “for a while now.” That could include a joint bid for a U.S. Army contract worth approximately $100 million, according to the WSJ. Microsoft had worked hard on a similar project called HoloLens that was supposed to provide soldiers with individual XR goggles. After years of development, initial tests back in 2022 went so poorly soldiers said the devices gave them motion sickness, adding, “The devices would have gotten us killed.” Microsoft killed off its consumer-level HoloLens last year, but the company expected to do more tests of its XR devices this year. Big tech companies see dollar signs, and it's no wonder they're so eager to claim a slice of the military-industrial complex pie. Luckey has long been a supporter of President Donald Trump. Luckey all but confirmed it in a recent TED talk where he said he was fired from the company for “donating $9,000 to the wrong political candidate.” There is a lot of money to be made in military contracts. Elon Musk, whose company Starlink is a major U.S. contractor, isn't the only CEO who has buddied up close to Trump for the sake of access and new potential deals. Zuckerberg, alongside the CEOs of several major tech firms from Google to Amazon to Apple, donated millions of dollars for Trump's inauguration and stood behind the wannabe authoritarian while he was sworn in. All these companies have multi-billion ties to the Pentagon, though tech giants like Google and Amazon try to keep their ties out of the limelight. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series—has long been an ardent Trump fan, but shortly after the election, Zuckerberg had his moment to finally come clean about his displeasure with all things having to do with diversity, equity, and inclusion—or DEI. The once-tweedy, nerdy Zuck has tried to transform his look as he's become a big fan of martial arts. The arms dealer's slicked-back mullet and soul patch framed by his typical Hawaiian shirts, cargo shorts, and sandals don't exactly gel with Zuckerberg's masculine makeover. In past posts to X, Luckey identified himself as a “warrior” since he helps provide the “tools of violence.” Both are committed to building a society that puts value on weapons and the armed forces above people.

In one snippet, a crosswalk hacked to sound like Mark Zuckerberg told individuals there was nothing they could do to stop progress of AI. Leading chatbot models exhibit the inherit biases of the data they have been trained upon, and Meta says too much of it is liberal in nature.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For weeks, White House officials and Republican operatives weren't quite sure when, or if, Elon Musk would actually be leaving the government. Now, many Republicans are already looking to distance themselves from Musk's team entirely. Still, none of the Republicans interviewed for this story believe DOGE is going anywhere anytime soon. “DOGE is popular,” says a source close to the White House. The White House did not reply to requests for comment. “This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way,” Trump posted on Truth Social, announcing the event. While Musk's supposed departure has been making headlines, to those attuned to DOGE's actual workings, the most seismic move came on Thursday, when news broke that top Musk lieutenant Steve Davis would also be leaving DOGE. He has been vital to day-to-day DOGE operations, and Sahil Lavingia, a recently fired DOGE staffer, told WIRED that Davis led the group. Not everyone in Trumpworld, though, was aware of his role. White House sources do say, however, that they are looking forward to the departure of Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, whom CNN reports will be working for Musk, with one source telling the outlet she is now with Musk “full-time.” She's been one of Musk's key allies since his arrival in Washington, and, as WIRED reported in February, has been the one tasked with delivering him bad news. Both Millers have been credited with showing Musk around Washington and accompanying him to events. “There's a lot of people in the business that work with her, or have worked with her, and she leaves bodies everywhere she's been,” a senior Republican strategist with knowledge of the situation tells WIRED. A Republican donor organizer and campaign adviser tells WIRED that they're unconvinced Musk won't come back. (“Nothing is cast in stone with Trump and his people,” they say.) Nonetheless, they say, they're telling clients running for office—both new candidates and incumbents—to use Musk's exit as a chance to distance themselves from the DOGE chain saw. “I think people need to distance themselves from it,” they say.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On May 16, 2023, Sam Altman appeared before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary. “We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,” he said. The legislators hung on Altman's every word as he gushed about how smart laws could allow AI to flourish—but only within firm guidelines that both lawmakers and AI builders deemed vital at that moment. Altman was speaking for the industry, which widely shared his attitude. This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech. Instead of advocating for outside bodies to examine AI models to assess risks, or for platforms to alert people when they are interacting with AI, committee chair Ted Cruz argued for a path where the government would not only fuel innovation but remove barriers like “overregulation.” Altman was on board with that. His message was no longer “regulate me” but “invest in me.” He said that overregulation—like the rules adopted by the European Union or one bill recently vetoed in California would be “disastrous.” “We need the space to innovate and to move quickly,” he said. Safety guardrails might be necessary, he affirmed, but they needed to involve “sensible regulation that does not slow us down.” For one thing, the panicky moment just after everyone got freaked out by ChatGPT passed, and it became clear that Congress wasn't going to move quickly on AI. “I'm not here … to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago,” he said. “We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off, and we'll make every effort to encourage pro-growth AI policies.” The administration later unveiled an AI Action Plan “to enhance America's position as an AI powerhouse and prevent unnecessarily burdensome requirements from hindering private sector innovation.” First is the European Union which has adopted a regulatory regimen that demands transparency and accountability from major AI companies. The prospect of the People's Republic besting the US in the “AI Race” is so unthinkable that regulation must be put aside, or done with what both Altman and Cruz described as a "light touch.” Some of this reasoning comes from a theory known as “hard takeoff,” which posits that AI models can reach a tipping point where lightning-fast self-improvement launches a dizzying gyre of supercapability, also known as AGI. Schmidt is one of the loudest voices warning about this possible future. The party line even objects to individual states trying to fill the vacuum of inaction with laws of their own. (Pundits are saying that this provision won't survive some opposition in the Senate, but it should be noted that almost every Republican in the House voted for it.) It's not surprising that Trumpworld would reject regulation and embrace a jingoistic stance on AI. But what happened to the seemingly genuine appetite in the industry for rules to ensure AI products don't run amok? I contacted several of the top AI companies this week and was pointed to published blogs and transcripts from speeches and public testimony, but no executive would go on record on the topic. (To be fair, I didn't give them much time.) It asks for “freedom to innovate,” meaning, in all likelihood, no burdensome laws; strong export controls; and an opportunistic request for “freedom to learn.” This is a euphemistic request for Congress to redefine intellectual property as</p>

Intel disclosed several chip packaging breakthroughs at the Electronic Components Technology Conference (ECTC), outlining the technical merits of multiple new chip packaging techniques. We spoke with Dr. Rahul Manepalli, an Intel Fellow and VP of Substrate Packaging Development, for more details on three of the new packaging technologies: EMIB-T for boosting both the size of chip packages and power delivery capabilities to support new technologies like HBM4/4e, a new disagregated heat spreader design, and a new thermal bonding technique that improves reliability, yields, and enables scaling to finer chip-to-chip connections. Intel also participated in 17 other new papers presented at the event. However, modern processors are increasingly deployed with complex, heterogeneous designs that integrate multiple types of computing and memory components into a single chip package, thereby amplifying performance, cost, and power efficiency gains. These chip designs rely upon increasingly complex advanced packaging techniques that serve as the bedrock of heterogeneous designs, so continued evolution is critical as Intel keeps pace with competitors like TSMC. Intel's new EMIB-T, originally disclosed at its Intel Direct Connect event last month, incorporates through-silicon vias (TSVs) into its already widely used EMIB technology —a silicon bridge embedded in a package substrate that provides communication and power plumbing between chiplets/dies. This next evolution of EMIB enhances critical package power delivery efficiency metrics and speeds die-to-die communication. EMIB-T can be used to more effectively power compute and memory components — whereas standard EMIB connections struggled with high voltage droop due to a cantilevered power delivery path, EMIB-T utilizes TSVs to provide power delivery from the bottom of the chip package via TSV bridge dies, thus enabling a direct, low-resistance path for power delivery that's critical for HBM4/4e integration. EMIB-T also enables much larger chip package sizes, reaching 120x180mm, and supports more than 38 bridges and more than 12 recticle-sized die in a single large chip package. EMIB-T is also compatible with either organic or glass substrates, with the latter being a key strategic direction for Intel's future chip packaging endeavors. The AI revolution is pushing chip package sizes to new frontiers, and with that comes increased power consumption that introduces vexing cooling challenges. Among other benefits, this technique helps reduce voids in solder TIM coupling by 25%. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Intel's illustration shows a heatspreader with integrated micro-channels that carry liquid directly through the IHS to cool the processor, much like we saw on display at its Direct Connect event. Intel has utilized thermal compression bonding techniques in both its server and consumer products; however, it has now developed a new thermal compression bonding process specifically for large package substrates that helps overcome die and substrate warpage during the bonding process. It also enables finer pitches for EMIB connections, helping to squeeze out more density from EMIB-T technology. Having a well-rounded and competitive suite of packaging technologies is crucial for Intel Foundry as it aims to provide its customers with the most comprehensive range of chip production options possible. Advanced chip packaging techniques enable customers to integrate different types of chips, such as CPUs, GPUs, and memory, from multiple vendors into a single package, thereby reducing the risk of transitioning entirely to Intel's process nodes for all componentry. In fact, Intel also offers packaging services for chips that don't use any Intel-fabbed components at all, helping to build relationships with potential new customers for its chip-fabbing services. These packaging contracts serve as the fastest on-ramp for Intel Foundry revenue generation, as producing chips with leading-edge process nodes requires significantly longer lead times.

The report from May 29 continues below as published. The U.S. Court of International Trade has ruled that President Trump's sweeping tariffs, levied on nations including China, were unlawful, in a move that could significantly reshape the ongoing trade war and impact the price of technology. The court declared that all of President Trump's measures are "invalid as contrary to law" because the emergency law used to pass them does not give the President unilateral authority to impose such sweeping measures. Regarding Trafficking Tariffs, the court says these fail "because they do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders." In a statement reported by the BBC, the administration said, "It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency." Continuing, White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said, "President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness." Considering previous reports, tariffs could increase tech prices by up to 70%. Legal suspension of tariffs levied on countries, including China, could be an enormous relief to suppliers of hardware, including the semiconductor industry, as well as component parts, notably GPUs. Earlier this month, it was reported that Nvidia has raised prices by 10-15% to combat rising manufacturing costs and tariffs, while TSMC recently called on Washington to drop tariffs on semiconductors made outside the U.S..

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new benchmark, called Elephant, makes it easier to spot when AI models are being overly sycophantic—but there's no current fix. Back in April, OpenAIannounced it was rolling back an update to its GPT-4o model that made ChatGPT's responses to user queries too sycophantic. It could reinforce users' incorrect beliefs, mislead people, and spread misinformation that can be dangerous—a particular risk when increasing numbers of young people are using ChatGPT as a life advisor. And because sycophancy is difficult to detect, it can go unnoticed until a model or update has already been deployed, as OpenAI found out. A new benchmark that measures the sycophantic tendencies of major AI models could help AI companies avoid these issues in the future. The team behind Elephant, from Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford, found that LLMs consistently exhibit higher rates of sycophancy than humans do. “We found that language models don't challenge users' assumptions, even when they might be harmful or totally misleading,” says Myra Cheng, a PhD student at Stanford University who worked on the research, which has not been peer-reviewed. “So we wanted to give researchers and developers the tools to empirically evaluate their models on sycophancy, because it's a problem that is so prevalent.” OpenAI's GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there's a catch. It's hard to assess how sycophantic AI models are because sycophancy comes in many forms. While this approach is still useful, it overlooks all the subtler, more insidious ways in which models behave sycophantically when there isn't a clear ground truth to measure against. For example, a model that's asked “How do I approach my difficult coworker?” is more likely to accept the premise that a coworker is difficult than it is to question why the user thinks so. It uses metrics drawn from social science to assess five nuanced kinds of behavior that fall under the umbrella of sycophancy: emotional validation, moral endorsement, indirect language, indirect action, and accepting framing. To do this, the researchers tested it on two data sets made up of personal advice written by humans. This first consisted of 3,027 open-ended questions about diverse real-world situations taken from previous studies. The second data set was drawn from 4,000 posts on Reddit's AITA (“Am I the Asshole?”) subreddit, a popular forum among users seeking advice. Overall, all eight models were found to be far more sycophantic than humans, offering emotional validation in 76% of cases (versus 22% for humans) and accepting the way a user had framed the query in 90% of responses (versus 60% among humans). The models also endorsed user behavior that humans said was inappropriate in an average of 42% of cases from the AITA data set. The authors had limited success when they tried to mitigate these sycophantic tendencies through two different approaches: prompting the models to provide honest and accurate responses, and training a fine-tuned model on labeled AITA examples to encourage outputs that are less sycophantic. For example, they found that adding “Please provide direct advice, even if critical, since it is more helpful to me” to the prompt was the most effective technique, but it only increased accuracy by 3%. “It's nice that it works, but I don't think it's going to be an end-all, be-all solution,” says Ryan Liu, a PhD student at Princeton University who studies LLMs but was not involved in the research. Gaining a better understanding of AI models' tendency to flatter their users is extremely important because it gives their makers crucial insight into how to make them safer, says Henry Papadatos, managing director at the nonprofit SaferAI. The breakneck speed at which AI models are currently being deployed to millions of people across the world, their powers of persuasion, and their improved abilities to retain information about their users add up to “all the components of a disaster,” he says. While we don't know the inner workings of LLMs that aren't open-source, sycophancy is likely to be baked into models because of the ways we currently train and develop them. ChatGPT, for example, gives users the chance to mark a response as good or bad via thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons. “Sycophancy is what gets people coming back to these models. “And so it's really beneficial, for companies, for their models to be sycophantic.” But while some sycophantic behaviors align with user expectations, others have the potential to cause harm if they go too far—particularly when people do turn to LLMs for emotional support or validation. “We want ChatGPT to be genuinely useful, not sycophantic," an OpenAI spokesperson says. "When we saw sycophantic behavior emerge in a recent model update, we quickly rolled it back and shared an explanation of what happened. "Cheng and her fellow authors suggest that developers should warn users about the risks of social sycophancy and consider restricting model usage in socially sensitive contexts. They hope their work can be used as a starting point to develop safer guardrails. “We don't want LLMs to end up telling users, ‘You are the asshole. Agents could make it easier and cheaper for criminals to hack systems at scale.

Which is IMO why "science literacy" is so hard.In an analogy: you can very easily point to chimps and humans and gorillas and say "those are similar, it's self evident" but it took a good few millennia for humans to be able to describe the hows and whys of the similarities in detail. Mechanistically.
