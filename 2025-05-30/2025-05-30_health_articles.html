                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the realm of colorectal cancer treatments beyond surgery and radiation, one key question gained prominence in recent years: Is the tumor's DNA repair system defective, making it "microsatellite unstable"? Around 15 to 20 percent of all tumors have this trait, making them likely candidates for successful immunotherapy. So-called immuno-checkpoint inhibitors are often used in these cases to neutralize the tumor's "protective shield", which tricks the immune system into perceiving it as harmless tissue. The cause lies in the tumor's surrounding environment, explains Prof. Florian Greten, cancer researcher at Georg-Speyer-Haus and Goethe University Frankfurt, and TRR 417 spokesperson: "Tumors do not grow as foreign bodies within intestinal tissue. The tumor reprograms these cells and integrates them into a tumor microenvironment, which also closely interacts with gut bacteria and other microorganisms - the microbiome." Greten explains: "We are building on the experience we've gained since 2016 through our collaboration in DFG Research Unit 2438 on this topic. In that project, we not only gathered numerous scientific insights but also developed shared standards, models, and technologies." It is based on this foundation that the researchers will now develop novel therapeutic strategies. The success of TRR 417 is particularly gratifying because it shows how Prof. Greten and his colleagues have strategically brought together top-tier oncology experts from leading institutions - German Cancer Aid, the German Cancer Consortium for Translational Cancer Research, the Bavarian Cancer Research Center, and the National Center for Tumor Diseases - over many years. I look forward to the rich scientific output and the next generation of clinician scientists that will emerge out of this collaborative research center." The DFG will fund TRR 417 for an initial period of four years with around € 17.7 million. The funding may be renewed twice for additional four-year periods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Accurate monitoring of CD4+ T cell counts is vital for evaluating immune health and guiding treatment in people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Yet conventional tools like flow cytometry, while highly effective, are expensive, complex, and ill-suited for widespread use in remote or resource-limited areas. Many portable alternatives remain constrained by low sensitivity, intricate sample handling, or high operational costs. Due to these limitations, there is an urgent need for cost-effective, standalone diagnostic platforms that can be deployed directly at the point of care to ensure timely HIV monitoring. In a collaborative effort, researchers from the University of Bath and Nanyang Technological University have developed an integrated microfluidic electrochemical biosensor for detecting CD4+ T cells. Their findings (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00893-8), published on April 9, 2025, in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, showcase a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based chip with gold electrodes that uses impedance-based, label-free sensing. This breakthrough marks an important advance toward enabling real-time HIV diagnostics outside of conventional laboratories. Anti-CD4 antibodies are immobilized via self-assembled monolayers, ensuring specific binding of target cells. The sensor's wide dynamic range captures both immunocompromised and healthy CD4+ levels, with a detection limit that can identify advanced immunodeficiency. Compared to traditional bench-top systems, the microfluidic design significantly reduces variation and manual labor, improving reproducibility and making the device well-suited for automation. Specificity tests showed negligible interference from monocytes, neutrophils, and common serum proteins. Our goal was to develop a user-friendly, affordable diagnostic tool that could extend high-quality HIV monitoring beyond centralized labs. By combining electrochemical sensing with microfluidics, we've created a platform that is not only accurate and sensitive, but also scalable and compatible with point-of-care use. Looking ahead, this microfluidic biosensor could serve as a transformative tool for HIV management in underserved regions, replacing bulky laboratory instruments with portable, battery-powered alternatives. The next development stages will involve integrating the DFF chip for whole blood testing, clinical validation, and refining user interfaces for field deployment. Ultimately, this technology could lead to robust point-of-care platforms that support early diagnosis, strengthen treatment monitoring, and advance equitable healthcare delivery in global HIV control efforts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Children exposed to gestational diabetes in utero with a specific variation of a common gene are at a higher risk of becoming overweight or obese during childhood, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. "But it's not infallible," said the study's lead author Kylie Harrall, PhD, who did the research while at CU Anschutz but is now an assistant research professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. "Some children with in utero exposure to gestational diabetes never develop obesity." Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms or common variations of the gene were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories across childhood, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. "Our hypothesis was that there were mutations in this receptor that made kids prone to higher BMI," said the study's senior author Dana Dabelea, MD, PhD, associate dean of research at the Colorado School of Public Health and director of the Lifecourse Epidemiology of Adiposity & Diabetes Center (LEAD) on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus. Dabelea and Harrall found that children exposed to gestational diabetes with a polymorphism of the GLP-1R gene gained weight faster and had a higher than average BMI compared to other children. It also shows how children can become overweight. In the future, clinicians can possibly test kids exposed to gestational diabetes for these genetic polymorphisms. They could then be good candidates for pharmacological interventions." Harrall agreed and said the study results show that GLP-1R variations help explain why some children exposed to gestational diabetes are more prone to a higher BMI than others. "This knowledge could help clinicians identify children who are at the highest risk for rapid BMI growth, which would allow for earlier intervention and potentially decrease the risk for childhood development of type 2 diabetes," Harrall said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) fell during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Black and Hispanic patients experiencing larger decreases in survival, according to a study led by UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers published in Resuscitation. Before the pandemic began in March 2020, OHCA survival rates had been steadily improving due to increased public awareness, faster emergency response times, and broader access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs). In 2019, the average overall survival rate stood at 9.9%, though it was lower in majority Black and Hispanic communities. To assess OHCA trends after the pandemic began, Dr. Girotra and his colleagues analyzed data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) - the largest national database tracking out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes, with full data from 30 states and selected communities in 16 additional states. "Our expectation was that survival after cardiac arrest had likely bounced back by 2022 to pre-pandemic levels," said lead author Eric Hall, M.D., a clinical fellow in the Division of Cardiology at UT Southwestern. "What we found instead is that it remained 8%-10% lower, which suggests there were still some lingering effects of the pandemic on emergency cardiac care." The study cohort included 506,419 OHCA patients served by 1,313 emergency medical service (EMS) agencies. Not only were pre-pandemic survival rates lower in majority Black/Hispanic (7.9%) and integrated (10.7%) communities versus predominantly white communities (11.1%), they also fell more, with Black/Hispanic survival rates decreasing 16.5% in 2020, compared with the drop in white (8.1%) and integrated (6.5%) communities. "These findings highlight the urgent need to address long-standing racial and ethnic differences in cardiac arrest outcomes," Dr. Girotra said. "Our team is continuing to study how EMS agencies provide OHCA care in their communities to identify and share best practices." One factor in the rise of OHCA during the pandemic was an increase in cases related to drug overdoses. "The pandemic phase of COVID-19 may be over, but many of the health impacts remain," Dr. Girotra said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When these glands are irreversibly damaged—by radiotherapy or autoimmune attacks—patients often face chronic discomfort, difficulty eating, and increased risk of infection. Most existing culture systems rely on animal-derived scaffolds or chemically fixed matrices that fail to sustain human acinar cell identity over time. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) environments that support long-term survival and function of salivary gland cells. In a new study (DOI: 10.1038/s41368-025-00368-6) published on May 9, 2025, in the International Journal of Oral Science, researchers from McGill University unveiled a next-generation hydrogel that supports the regeneration of salivary gland-like tissue. These 3D cell clusters maintained high expression of key salivary proteins and responded dynamically to chemical stimulation, offering a powerful tool for modeling diseases and testing potential therapies for xerostomia. The researchers compared three hydrogel types: a basic alginate-gelatin (AG), a collagen-supplemented version (AGC), and hyaluronic acid-containing AG (AGHA), which incorporates hyaluronic acid. While all demonstrated mechanical properties similar to native tissue, AGHA emerged as the superior scaffold. The gel's reversibility, achieved through simple ion removal, allowed for non-destructive retrieval of intact spheroids—an essential feature for downstream clinical or experimental use. The hydrogel also successfully supported the expansion of primary human salivary cells for up to 15 days, demonstrating its versatility as a culture platform. This study demonstrates that by fine-tuning hydrogel composition, we can closely replicate the native environment of salivary acinar cells. Our AGHA-based platform not only supports long-term viability and function, but also enables easy recovery of spheroids without enzymatic damage. This is a significant step forward in developing in vitro models for salivary gland disorders and potential regenerative therapies for patients suffering from chronic dry mouth." The implications of this hydrogel system extend beyond xerostomia. By enabling the growth of functional salivary tissue in a lab-friendly, reversible matrix, this platform could accelerate the development of disease models, high-throughput drug screening tools, and even implantable grafts. Its compatibility with both immortalized cell lines and primary human cells makes it a versatile foundation for future regenerative applications. Moreover, eliminating animal-derived materials improves reproducibility and clinical relevance. With this innovation, researchers are one step closer to restoring natural salivary function for patients who need it most.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is linked to a fourfold increased risk for early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD), results from the largest, population-based cohort study of its kind to date showed. The findings indicated “that there can be shared biological drivers behind ASD and Parkinson's disease,” study investigator, Weiyao Yin, MD, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, said in a release. “One hypothesis is that the brain's dopamine system is affected in both cases, since the neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important part in social behavior and motion control,” Yin added. The study was published online on May 27 in JAMA Neurology. Recent research pointed to a plausible biological link between ASD and PD. “Our study is the first population-based study, to our knowledge, using prospectively collected data, longitudinal design, and life-course approach to strengthen the inference,” they wrote. To investigate they used national registry data from more than 2 million individuals born in Sweden between 1974 and 1999 and followed them from age 20 years up to the end of 2022. PD, defined as a first-ever diagnosis of PD or other idiopathic or degenerative parkinsonian disorders, was identified in 438 individuals without ASD (0.02%; 1.3 cases per 100,000 person-years) and in 24 individuals with ASD (0.05%; 3.9 cases per 100,000 person-years), corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of 4.43. Independent of ASD diagnosis, a history of depression and exposure to antipsychotics were linked to a significantly higher risk for PD (RR, 2.01 and RR, 6.34, respectively). Preterm or early-term birth is a known risk factor for ASD, prompting an examination of its potential association with PD. However, no increased risk for PD was found compared with individuals born at full term. After adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, and parental mental illness or PD, the investigators found ASD remained consistently associated with an increased risk for PD. There are potential biological explanations for the link, Yin told Medscape Medical News. “One hypothesis suggests that the brain's dopamine system is impacted in both conditions, as the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a crucial role in social behavior and motor control,” Yin said. There may be a genetic correlation between the two conditions, she added noting that the PARK2 gene may be associated between ASD and early-onset PD. Healthcare services need to provide long-term monitoring for individuals with ASD — a vulnerable group with high comorbidity and a high use of psychotropic medications,” Yin said. The study is clinically relevant “mainly because it shows that neurodevelopmental conditions, like ASD, may be associated with clinical signs and diagnoses that may manifest at different ages, and we as clinicians should be aware of that,” Christos Ganos, MD, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who was not involved with the study, told Medscape Medical News. “Although neurodevelopmental disorders are diagnosed early in life, there is a need to assess for neurological symptoms and signs also later in life, including to monitor the effects of prescribed medications on neuromotor control,” added Ganos, who is the wolf chair in neurodevelopmental psychiatry, and associate professor of neurology at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. However, he urged caution in linking the specific diagnoses of ASD and PD, as there is a more general link between neurodevelopmental disorders and motor dysfunction. However, she noted that investigators did not include smoking in the models, which “may result in an overestimation of the association between ASD and PD,” she added. “Smoking is less common among individuals with ASD and may constitute a confounder. Once we do have such treatments, then monitoring would be justified,” she said. However, the finding “could have significant clinical and policy-related implications as these individuals age,” Gregory Wallace, PhD, an autism expert and associate professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences at The George Washington University, Washington, DC, who was not part of the study, told Medscape Medical News. “Given increased rates of autism diagnoses in younger cohorts, if autistic people are at increased risk for developing parkinsonism as they age, the healthcare system and clinicians who provide care for autistic adults need to be prepared,” said Wallace. Wallace recently published research showing that co-occurring parkinsonism in adults with autism is linked with lower subjective quality of life, more memory problems, lower sleep quality, and greater depression symptoms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have identified a new biomarker, TTF-1, that was predictive of survival outcomes for patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), following treatment with the KRAS targeted therapy sotorasib. Results from the study, published today in Nature Medicine, found patients with lung tumors that express low TTF-1 levels responded poorly to sotorasib – with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 2.8 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 4.5 months – whereas patients with tumors expressing high TTF-1 levels had a median PFS of 8.1 months and a median OS of 16 months. Since TTF-1 testing is routinely performed in lung cancer diagnosis, it gives physicians an immediate tool to help identify those patients who may benefit from sotorasib and those who may need an alternative or intensified treatment approach. Our findings support the use of biomarkers to personalize care and could guide the precise application of combination strategies with KRAS inhibitors." Ferdinandos Skoulidis, M.D., Ph.D., lead author, associate professor of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology Sotorasib is a targeted therapy designed to block the KRAS G12C mutant protein, which is found in roughly 13% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common type of NSCLC. It was the first direct KRAS inhibitor to earn regulatory approval. This study looked at 317 biomarker-evaluable patients with previously treated advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who had been involved in the CodeBreaK 200 clinical trial and 112 biomarker-evaluable patients treated in the CodeBreaK 100 clinical trial. In addition, researchers found that the tumor microenvironment – the immune landscape surrounding cancer cells – may also play a role in how well sotorasib works. One subgroup of patients had "immune cold" tumors that lacked expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1, but they responded better to sotorasib than to chemotherapy. "This finding is encouraging because it suggests that even patients who don't respond to immunotherapy might still benefit from sotorasib," Skoulidis said. "It also opens the door to exploring combination treatments, like pairing sotorasib with chemotherapy to improve outcomes for even more patients." Researchers also were able to demonstrate that rapid clearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) – small fragments of DNA from the tumor found in the blood – following initiation of sotorasib was linked with much better outcomes. In some patients, ctDNA levels dropped as soon as eight days into treatment, suggesting that a simple blood test could help doctors quickly identify who is benefiting from the therapy. This work significantly advances precision medicine for patients with KRAS G12C-mutant NSCLC. Future studies will focus on further refining response prediction to RAS inhibitors for patients with TTF-1 expressing tumors and on identifying the most promising combination strategies for those with a poor prognosis who lack TTF-1 expression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a significant advancement for hand rehabilitation, researchers from Zhengzhou University have introduced a non-hand-worn, load-free VR hand rehabilitation system that could boost therapy development for patients recovering from conditions like stroke and osteoarthritis. The system, developed by a team led by Yanchao Mao, integrates deep learning with ionic hydrogel electrodes to recognize hand gestures based on electromyographic (EMG) signals. The conventional hand rehabilitation therapy often relies on bulky mechanical gloves that require weight-bearing and increase the strain on a patient's hand. These devices are also complex to operate and often require specialized medical facilities. Patients can engage in rehabilitation exercises anywhere and anytime, without the burden of wearing cumbersome devices. The key to this system's innovation lies in its ionic hydrogel electrodes, which are wet-adhesive, self-healing, and conductive. These electrodes, applied directly to the forearm, collect EMG signals generated by hand movements. Deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), then process these signals to recognize a range of hand gestures. This recognition is linked to a Virtual Reality (VR) platform where patients can interact with virtual environments, enhancing the therapeutic experience through immersive training. Patients can now perform immersive VR rehabilitation exercises in their homes, without the limitations of specialized equipment or facilities." This system has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for patients undergoing hand rehabilitation, particularly those with mobility challenges. By offering load-free, immersive, and personalized training, the system offers a home-based VR therapy solution, opening the door for greater flexibility in rehabilitation. Moreover, this deep learning-assisted VR rehabilitation system can potentially be adapted to other areas of physical therapy in the future. The system holds promise not only for hand rehabilitation but also for broader applications in fields like stroke recovery, musculoskeletal injuries, and geriatric rehabilitation. The researchers are particularly excited about the home-based application, which could vastly increase access to physical therapy, particularly for individuals in remote areas or with limited mobility. In addition to its clinical applications, the research highlights the emerging role of ionic hydrogels in biomedical technologies, with the potential to create more effective, flexible, and comfortable rehabilitation solutions for a wide range of medical conditions. The development of non-hand-worn interfaces such as this one could become integral in future rehabilitation systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Due to the sudden rupture of the aortic wall, aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention, as it can lead to vascular collapse. Individuals with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are particularly at risk, often developing the condition at a young age. This highlights the urgent need for effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. In a recent study, an international research team led by the University of Tsukuba created a mouse model that spontaneously develops aortic dissection by introducing a missense variant, originally identified in a patient with familial aortic dissection, into the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. This single nucleotide change results in the production of an abnormal fibrillin-1 protein. The mutant mice showed intimal-medial tears in the ascending aorta, with dissection progressing alongside significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. Histological and gene expression analyses revealed that abnormalities in vascular endothelial cells precede the onset of dissection. Further investigation indicated that the FBN1 missense variant disrupts the binding of fibrillin-1 to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-binding proteins, leading to reduced TGFβ signaling, a pathway essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis. These findings suggest that the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and macrophages, along with decreased TGFβ signaling, forms a critical molecular basis for the pathogenesis of aortic dissection. The mouse model developed in this study can serve as a valuable tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of aortic dissection and advancing the development of new therapeutic strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health journal suggests that parental or caregiver intuition may outperform some traditional early warning systems in identifying children at risk of deterioration. The new analysis found that caregiver concern for worsening condition of pediatric patients was strongly associated with critical illness in pediatric patients admitted to the hospital, even after accounting for abnormal vital signs (abnormal heart rate or abnormal respiratory rate). Delayed recognition of deterioration is one of the most common contributing factors to preventable deaths in hospitalized children, and parents or caregivers are often well positioned to detect early and subtle signs of deterioration, but the relationship between their concerns and patient outcomes is unknown, and many healthcare systems are not currently structured to support their involvement in clinical care. It was conducted over 26 months (November 2020 to December 2022) and analyzed 73,845 eligible emergency department presentations of pediatric patients in Australia, with 24,239 having at least one documented response for parent or caregiver concern. In total, 8,937 (4·7%) respondents out of 189,708 indicated concern for the child's worsening condition. Compared to patients with caregivers without documented concerns, those with a caregiver reporting concern for clinical deterioration were more likely to experience critical illness requiring admission to ICU (6·9% vs 1·8%) or the need for mechanical ventilation (1·1% vs 0·2%), suggesting that the diagnostic accuracy of the parent's gut feeling outperformed physiological data. The authors say that their results suggest parents and caregivers are a resource that can assist clinicians to monitor for deterioration, and they may perform better than some current systems reliant on vital signs alone. They say this data suggests that parent or caregiver concerns should be proactively sought, and research which incorporates this into hospital systems used to detect deterioration in pediatric patients should be prioritized.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cairns and Townsville residents who want to give up smoking can access free nicotine replacement therapies and potentially life-saving lung cancer screening by participating in a research study. A University of Queensland-led trial started late last year across areas of southern Queensland to help smokers aged between 50 and 80 who wanted to quit smoking. Associate Professor Henry Marshall from UQ's Thoracic Research Centre said more than 120 people had so far participated in the trial, and the project was now expanding to North and Far North Queensland. This is an important step because it means people who want to quit smoking can now participate in the trial and get scanned and access nicotine replacement therapies in Cairns or Townsville. Our aim is to screen 1000 people across Queensland, and the trial will continue until we reach that goal." Dr. Marshall said research from the United States showed combining smoking cessation and screening reduced the risk of dying from lung cancer by 38 per cent. "A CT scan can pick up small, curable lung cancers that are otherwise undetected because they're not causing any symptoms,'' he said. "It only takes a few minutes and does not require any needles. "Lung cancer grows silently and secretly, and generally only causes symptoms in an advanced stage, when a cure is difficult so a CT scan finding the cancer earlier gives people the chance for effective treatment." Queenslanders who phone Quitline on 13 7848 (13 QUIT) or self-refer through Quit HQ can join the study to access free nicotine patches, gum or lozenges, as well as a free CT scan of their lungs, if eligible. "We want to make sure lung cancer screening reaches the target population and is integrated in the best possible way with support to help people quit smoking," he said. Dr Marshall said lung cancer is one of more than 40 diseases and conditions that smoking is known to cause, so quitting has very broad health benefits. "We know that quitting smoking can take time, effort, and sometimes multiple attempts," he said. "We've got the door open ready for people to keep coming back, engaging with Quitline's programs and counsellors and keep getting free nicotine replacement therapy."
