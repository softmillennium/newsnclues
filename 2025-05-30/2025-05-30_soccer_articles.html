                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich could inject some revenue into its coffers this summer... Bayern Munich supervisory board member Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was asked about club CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen's recent statements that winning the Club World Cup is a goal for the team and reiterated that is exactly what the squad is intending to do. If we just take it easy because everyone wants to go on vacation as quickly as possible, nothing will come of it. Jan is right to set the bar so high, and our team has to jump over the bar,” Rummenigge told Sport Bild (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). When asked that the $30 million award for participating would do for the club, Rummenigge almost scoffed at the notion that it could make a big impact. However, when talking about the €100 million overall prize for winning, the executive sounded at least a little more enthused before pushing for football to have a salary cap. “With just under €30 million, you can't really show off on the transfer market these days,” Rummenigge said with a laugh. “But even with over €100 million as tournament winner in the best case scenario, spread over four years, you can't be a ‘big player' on the transfer market. On the contrary: We should introduce a kind of salary cap in all leagues that would lead to clubs operating more healthily.” Looking for some final thoughts on the Florian Wirtz saga?

England have confirmed that Manchester City's James McAtee will join up with Lee Carsley's Under-21 squad this weekend ahead of the EUROs this summer.

The announcement from the national side comes after a period of uncertainty and talks between all parties as to which direction would be most suitable for McAtee this summer, given a clash of competitions for the player.

While Manchester City will be jetting off for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, McAtee and his teammates within England's Under-21 set-up will have a European Championship tournament ongoing at the same time.

     

As such, all relevant parties have held discussions which have seemingly led to the highly-rated attacking midfielder being released to represent his country for a crucial summer both personally and collectively.

A statement from England confirmed on Friday afternoon, “James McAtee has been added to England MU21s' pre-EURO training squad.

“The Manchester City player, with 18 caps and seven goals to his name for the age group, will link up with Lee Carsley's extended group at St. George's Park this weekend.”

The pre-EURO training squad will precede a finalised list to be decided and announced by manager Carsley ahead of next month's UEFA U21 EURO in Slovakia on Friday 6 June, England have also reaffirmed.

The decision taken and approved by Manchester City will also raise further doubts over James McAtee‘s future at the Etihad Stadium, with transfer interest in the Salford-born playmaker growing throughout the game.

Among the clubs to have taken a keen interest in his performances and continuing to monitor his situation leading up to the summer transfer window are German giants Bayer Leverkusen, as well as numerous sides in the Premier League.

Recent reports have pointed towards Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur as potential candidates for his signature, while the former may prove to be an interesting proposition given City's interest in Morgan Gibbs-White.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since taking over as head coach of the U.S. Women's National Team, Emma Hayes has placed a high priority on reshaping women's soccer through a female lens. And two new appointments have her particularly excited. What's more, the Chelsea legend has repeatedly emphasized the importance of creating a clearer and more effective pathway for talented young players to progress through the youth teams and work their way towards the senior team in such a way that allows them to develop and grow at their own pace. Reflecting on her first year in charge, ahead of the USWNT's upcoming friendlies against China and Jamaica, Hayes elaborated on her excitement about the direction the program as a whole is heading in. “Anything from mental skill development to female health, menstrual cycle support, whatever it might be, I'm so, so excited about it.” But while Hayes is excited about the steps that have already been taken, there is still plenty of work to be done - work which she believes could have a positive impact on generations of players down the line. “And there's a huge amount of work that's going on in the background, developing insights that for years to come, I hope will influence everything from coach education to ensuring we've got female health insights in each and every one of our camps and longer term across the whole ecosystem. “America's always produced players, but I think what we are putting together is a system so that it goes beyond just a pipeline of players, that it's a support system around girls and women that I think will take our game up a notch.” Taking the women's game “up a notch” is no mean feat, given the USWNT's remarkable success over the past few decades, including four World Cup wins, five Olympic gold medals (one under Hayes), and nine CONCACAF W Championships, among numerous other accolades. That being said, Hayes' arrival followed a relatively rough patch for the USWNT, which failed to get past the Round of 16 at the 2023 World Cup and, prior to her arrival, hadn't won an Olympic gold since 2012. However, given her incredible level of success during her 12-year tenure at Chelsea, where she turned the London side into a dominant force in the WSL, it would be unwise to doubt her vision.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA is still “far away” from resolving the row with Europe's domestic leagues and global players' union FIFPro over the international match calendar, according to the Premier League's director of international football relations Mathieu Moreuil. Last October, European Leagues, the body that represents leagues in 30 countries across the continent, teamed up with FIFPro to file a formal complaint against world football's governing body at the European Commission. The dispute over who controls football's congested calendar has been simmering for years but FIFA's critics believe its decisions to expand the World Cup to 48 teams and create a new 32-team Club World Cup are an abuse of a dominant market position, which is contrary to European Union competition law. Speaking to journalists in Munich on Thursday, Moreuil said European Leagues and FIFPro made their complaint because FIFA was not listening to them, something that has started to change. “We've had meetings, at least, and FIFA is now engaging with us,” said Moreuil, who is also European Leagues' vice-president. “Both organisations have had meetings with the FIFA president (Gianni Infantino), which is good, but we're still far away from an agreement, therefore we'll keep our legal action in the system. It's not going to be easy but that's what we do. FIFA's international match calendar is an agreement with the game's six continental confederations, the European Club Association and FIFPro that sets out when international games can be played, including all the major tournaments. The current calendar runs from this summer until the end of 2030 and, as FIFA insists that international football takes priority over domestic games, national competitions must fit into FIFA's schedule. The revamped Club World Cup, which starts in Miami on June 14, does not have a ring-fenced space on the calendar but FIFA is still demanding that the 32 participating clubs field their strongest squads and has created a bespoke transfer window to allow them to bring in new players between 1-10 June. And with the tournament not finishing until 13 July, teams that go deep in the tournament will only have five weeks off before their domestic seasons start again in mid-August. Maheta Molango, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, was also in Munich ahead of Saturday's Champions League final and the English players' union boss told reporters that his members have been very clear about the consequences of fixture congestion. “(Manchester City's) Rodri, the Ballon d'Or, said it was too much, and many others. “That's why we need to come together and work on solutions, otherwise people will get injured or they'll make choices to protect themselves. FIFA has not responded to a request for comment. Based in North West England, Matt Slater is a senior football news reporter for The Athletic UK.

COMMERCE CITY, Colo – Colorado Rapids forward Bryce Jamison has been called up to the U.S. U-19 Men's National Team for an upcoming training camp and a pair of international friendlies in Albir, Spain, from June 2–11, 2025, U.S. Soccer announced today.

The U.S. will take on host nation Spain on June 7, followed by a second match on June 10 against an opponent to be announced. The squad will be led by U-19 MYNT Head Coach Rob Valentino.

Jamison, 19, signed with the Rapids on April 4, 2025, to a three-year contract through 2027 with club options for 2028 and 2029. Currently, Jamison is on loan to USL Championship club Orange County SC, where he has made 77 professional appearances since 2022, tallying eight goals and six assists.

A native of Atlanta, Georgia, Jamison rose through the youth ranks at the Barcelona Residency Academy in Arizona. He helped lead the academy's U-19 team to an MLS NEXT Southwest Division title and was named to the inaugural MLS NEXT All-Star Team in 2022.

On the international stage, Jamison made his U.S. Youth National Team debut in 2023 and represented the United States at the FIFA U-17 World Cup later that year, appearing in all four of the team's matches, including a Round of 16 clash against Germany.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOAL goes over everything fans need to know about the unique transfer window opening from June 1-10 ahead of the Club World Cup FIFA has opened a special transfer window from June 1-10, allowing teams to make roster additions ahead of the 2025 Club World Cup. Likewise, U.S. Soccer has reportedly sanctioned a window to run during the same timeline, but has limited it to the MLS teams competing in the tournament - Inter Miami, Seattle Sounders, and potentially, LAFC. The Black and Gold face Liga MX side Club America Saturday evening in a Club World Cup playoff game, with the winner clinching a berth in the competition. FIFA and U.S. Soccer have introduced new rules and amended existing ones ahead of this summer's competition, aimed at facilitating player movement. As a result, clubs participating in the tournament have additional flexibility in the transfer window - though some of the changes may not be widely known or understood by fans. Some players have an opportunity to sign a short-term contract to compete, strictly in the competition, before entering free agency this summer. Then, there's a unique case like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Real Madrid, as Los Blancos have now paid the Reds $11.3 million(€10 million) to secure his services ahead of the competition despite his contract ending on June 30.

FRISCO, Texas (May 30, 2025) – FC Dallas Homegrown midfielder Diego Garcia has been called up to the U.S. U19 Men's National Team for its first camp of 2025 from June 2-10 in Marbella, Spain. The USA will play host Spain on Saturday, June 7, and Ukraine on Tuesday, June 10. Both matches will be played at Estadio Guillermo Amor in Benidorm, Spain.  

Garcia made his FC Dallas debut on May 7 in Dallas' U.S. Lamar Hunt Round of 16 matchup versus AV ALTA FC after entering the match in the 75th minute. Garcia signed as the 38th FC Dallas Homegrown player on Nov. 16, 2022.  

García comes off a historic season with 2024 MLS NEXT Pro champion North Texas SC, registering eight goals and seven assists through the regular season and playoffs, including two game-winning goals and two game-winning assists. García set a club record as the youngest player to reach 50 appearances (18 years, 4 days).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leeds United will be hoping they can get on the FIFA Club World Cup stage one day themselves. It will take time, but first of all, Daniel Farke needs to keep Leeds in the Premier League after a successful season. Now, a major target is seemingly available as his absence from the Club World Cup speaks volumes. Well, now a new update suggests that McAtee's time under Pep Guardiola is firmly over, and it involves the Club World Cup. With City partaking in the exciting competition this summer, McAtee will instead be playing for the England under-21s, indicating his time with City is at an end. Probably signals the end of his time at Man City. READ MORE: How the 49ers takeover of Rangers will affect Leeds United as announcement confirmed Farke will know that to succeed in the top flight next season, they need players who will be comfortable in the Premier League. McAtee is certainly one of those and brings reason why so many clubs are after his signature. To have a performance like this with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne around you is some feat and proves exactly why Leeds need to pay £35m for him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's as true with the U.S. national team as it is with her club, Arsenal, one of the biggest in England and all of Europe. But there are some matchups where the Gunners are the underdogs, and last Saturday's Champions League final was one of them. Barcelona had beaten England's top team, Chelsea, 8-2, on aggregate in the two-game semifinals, a bigger feat than Arsenal's 5-3 topping of French power Lyon. So it was really quite an upset when Arsenal prevailed, 1-0, to win the tournament for the first time in 18 years. Fox had a huge game at right back, with three interceptions, three clearances, two blocks, and eight defensive recoveries. Fox knew from experience, but not just in England. The Americans won most of those games, but that doesn't mean they were easy — especially against teams like Brazil and Japan that keep the ball as much as Barcelona likes to. So when Fox arrived at U.S. camp to prepare for an upcoming slate of friendlies and sat down for a news conference online, it was natural to ask: did those games help prepare her for what the Champions League final might bring? “We did talk about, before the game, being able to suffer and being OK with it because of the talent that Barça has,” Fox said. In fact, she said, “I tried to avoid it at all costs” until Stina Blackstenius' goal in the 74th minute. That was one of only three Arsenal shots on target in a game where Barcelona had a 20-8 overall shots advantage and 68% of the possession. “I think you don't realize how well the team is playing, and you're playing, especially in a game like that where no matter who you're up against, they're the best of the best,” Fox said. “So you just have to stay in the moment and stay present because the minute you switch off, they create an amazing opportunity.” The Gunners held a title celebration in their North London neighborhood on Monday, and thousands of fans filled the streets. That big crowd was part of a trend this past season. “I'd use the word ‘surreal,' and just honored,” Fox said. But then again, when you have that time to connect with the fans, and the entire season being able to play at the Emirates … I just think it's been an unreal experience.” Fox traveled from London to the U.S. team's camp in the Minneapolis area on Tuesday, and was greeted by a silly string shower from her teammates. Then she got right back to work at Wednesday's practice. The U.S. women will play China on Saturday in St. Paul, Minn. (5:30 p.m., TBS, Universo), then Jamaica on Tuesday in St. Louis (8 p.m., TNT, Universo).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEATTLE — Lumen Field is set to receive a grass pitch and millions of dollars in upgrades ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, using $19.4 million in state funding. RELATED: Seattle's SEA Airport expands international links ahead of 2026 World Cup Much of that funding will go to Lumen Field, which is managed by the Washington State Public Stadium Authority. The funds will be used to install a FIFA-required grass surface, enhance security in the stadium's north parking lot, and upgrade seating in bleacher sections, according to a Lumen Field spokesperson. The planned parking improvements include new lighting, surveillance cameras, turnstiles and traffic barriers. An additional $100,000 will be used to support practice facilities at Gonzaga University. Seattle is one of 11 U.S. cities selected to host matches during the 2026 World Cup. Lumen Field will host six games, including one featuring Team USA during the group stage and two knockout-round matches. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place from June 11 to July 19.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. The United States Men's National Team is headed to camp next week and among the newcomers is 1.FC Köln striker Damion Downs. We're joined by Jake Payne of 50 Plus Döner as we do a deep dive on the young German-American and what he brings to the table. Jake does content that focuses on Köln and German soccer as a whole, and he gives us some incredible insight on Downs and what he's done well at the club level. He also discusses what Downs will have to improve as he prepares for his time with the USMNT and helping Köln as they return to the Bundesliga next season. It's a great interview that also expands to why German soccer is normally so beneficial for American players to develop and how the wave can shift back to players thriving in the Bundesliga. Here's an excerpt from the interview with Jake Payne as we discuss Damion Downs and his elevation to the USMNT. USA Soccercast: I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who have not seen Damion Downs play at all so just in a nutshell, can you describe his overall game? 50 Plus Döner: Oh, he is the quintessential striker. He's not fast, but his positioning is insane. Like, if you go and watch some of the goals that he scored, he's not particularly outpacing anyone but he's just in [the right spot]. There's a song called “He's always where he needs to be,” and that is his game. needs...I feel like you guys have been looking for that for a while, just a striker that's there to set people up but mostly score goals. USAS: At 6'4, Downs is going to tower over everybody. Because of that, there's the obvious question: is he an aerial threat that can kind of serve as that target forward, or is he going to be more of a guy that's a poacher who uses his feet? 50: Yeah, so I don't think he has a lot of header goals, but that's not due to lack of trying. I just think Köln isn't really a crossing team per se, but [Downs] is an aerial threat. He does have very good header goals and a few goals where he muscles someone off. I do think sometimes, just with him being younger and him starting to get his opportunity now, that he sometimes makes a bad shot when he's open, but that's not due to lack of ability. I just think he's now getting his shot. So he's got some learning to do, but now he has a chance to do it on national team level. USAS: [Downs] grew up in the American system of sports and mainly [played] American football before he started playing soccer when he moved back to Germany, which is unlike some of the other dual nationals that we see. A lot of them learned soccer first and then maybe applied to other sports. Do we see a little bit of American football in his game as he has been developing? What if our best athletes played soccer and now we're finally seeing it? Like with football, I feel like you have to know where everybody is at all times, even if it's across the field. And when you look at the way that he understands space and how people move to react to space, like he knows, “Okay, I'm tall...so someone's going to play me a little bit closer. I'm going to kind of like back off a little bit and give me some more space to work with.” He's obviously very physical too, even though I think he hasn't gotten that chance to be physical a lot. But with the American football mindset, I wouldn't be able to point out like, “Oh, that's a football player.”But I think when you're a multi-sport athlete like that, positioning and understanding physicality...that's definitely present in his game. Was there something about his game that elevates to where he was able to find success? So I will have to point out his first ever goal for the team was against Köln's biggest rival. And like in the Bundesliga season, he kind of got his opportunity at the end of the season and he scored some very key goals. So I think like already the thought going into this last season was like, “Okay, we got to get we got to let him cook a little bit.” They weren't really sure [about Downs]. They were getting production from this striker and then they kind of fell down Damian Downs got a hand injury, which kind of stopped his momentum of starting and whatnot. But now that there is that open hole, I do think he's going to get more of a chance and like he had 10 goals and I think four assists on the season. And even though he's on the slower side, as I said, his positioning is just phenomenal. So we really got to see that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAFC has won an MLS Cup and played in two CONCACAF Champions League finals. Next up for LAFC is the $10-Million Game, in which it will play Mexico's Club América on Saturday at Banc of California to determine the final entrant in the Club World Cup. The 32-team tournament, which will be staged across the United States from mid-June to mid-July, has a record-breaking billion-dollar prize pool. By simply qualifying for the event and playing in three group-stage matches, LAFC would be entitled to a participation fee of $9.55 million. That might not be considered a significant prize for the Dodgers or Lakers, but it's a major bounty for LAFC, which had a payroll of about $20 million last season. Carlos Vela, the first designated player LAFC signed, announced his retirement and will become an ambassador for club. “We know what's at stake,” LAFC co-president John Thorrington said. That's money that could go toward covering the transfer fee or salary of the team's next signature player, as one of LAFC's three designated-player slots could open this summer. Thorrington preferred to emphasize the symbolic importance of LAFC reaching the Club World Cup, how it would move the team one step closer to its long-stated ambition of becoming a global brand. If LAFC advances to the Club World Cup, its opening game will be against Chelsea of the English Premier League. “I think it would be something special,” defender Eddie Segura said in Spanish. The league has a salary cap, as well as paint-by-numbers roster compliance rules that permit minimal flexibility on how its teams can spend money. Soccer is a sport in which teams are only as good as their weakest links, but the regulations force clubs to construct top-heavy rosters. LAFC rallies from a two-goal deficit behind goals from Olivier Giroud and Mark Delgado in a 2-2 draw with Montreal. As it was, the financial restrictions were already handicapping MLS teams in its competitions against its Mexican counterparts, with LAFC relying on its smarts instead of the economic might of its deep-pocketed owners to reach two Champions League finals. Now, MLS teams will be taking on opponents with virtually unlimited budgets. Just two years ago, Chelsea spent more than a billion dollars buying players in a single transfer window. The Club World Cup's cash prizes offer MLS a powerful incentive to loosen its rules. Teams will be paid $7.5 million for reaching the round of 16. The champion will take home more than $100 million. The payouts could also force MLS to make changes to its collective bargaining agreement, which was signed when the Club World Cup was still a seven-team tournament. Segura said the players are engaged in talks over their compensation. “The club would benefit a lot, but I hope that we as players, as the ones who are there giving everything, will also have a chance to benefit,” Segura said. The upcoming game has also offered LAFC a firsthand view of FIFA's operations. Rather than award León's place to LAFC, FIFA basically invented a play-in game out of thin air, calling on LAFC to take on Club América, which was the region's highest-ranked team that wasn't already in the tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool have secured a mega £10million fee from Real Madrid for Trent Alexander-Arnold to join them early. But despite already playing his last game for Liverpool and effectively being on holiday now, the Premier League champions will get £10m. Liverpool will bank £10million from Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving for Real Madrid Alexander-Arnold has already updated his Instagram bio to include Real Madrid's name Xabi Alonso, who has been confirmed as Carlo Ancelotti's successor on a three-year deal, wanted Alexander-Arnold through the door early. Alexander-Arnold has already updated his Instagram bio to include Real Madrid and he shared a post from the club welcoming him. He has enjoyed a wholesome goodbye to the club he has served for 20 years, despite facing boos and criticism in recent times. He was given also given a warm reception at Anfield on Sunday and described celbrating the title in front of fans as the 'best day of his life'. Supporters welcomed him with widespread cheer and applause as he replaced Conor Bradley at half-time and gave him similar adoration as he did a lap of the crowd at the finale. He described Liverpool's trophy parade as the 'perfect send-off' after 20 years of service Alexander-Arnold cut an emotional figure at Anfield after playing his final game for the club 'I hope that one day the fans and supporters of this club are able to recognise the hard work I put in for this team. I have loved every second of it, it has been an honour and a privilege to be a part of this club. 'I'll remember these moments for the rest of my life. This day will go down as the best in my life.' It looked as if Alexander-Arnold would exit Anfield under a cloud after he was booed by fans during Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Arsenal earlier this month. Real Madrid have announced that Alexander-Arnold, 26, will join them on a six-year deal Alexander-Arnold will link-up with England team-mate Jude Bellingham (right) at Real Madrid Alexander-Arnold could opt to follow Bellingham and live in La Finca, which is known as Madrid's Beverly Hills The gated VIP neighbourhood promises an exclusive combination of luxury and security But a rousing speech last week by Jurgen Klopp - who watched from the stands like a proud father on Sunday - appears to have swung the mood. If he turns to Bellingham for advice, Alexander-Arnold could find himself living in what has been dubbed as the 'Beverly Hills' of Madrid. Bellingham is understood to have been renting there and sharing with his mum who aids him in the handling of his schedule and other affairs. The England midfielder's home reportedly has six-bedrooms, a home theatre, as well as a sauna, gym and pool in the garden. Alexander-Arnold would likely follow the likes of Bellingham in being gifted new luxury BMW cars as part of a partnership between the manufacturer and Real Madrid He has previously credited his success down to parents Dianne and Michael Pictured with brothers Marcell (left) and Tyler (middle) after winning the Champions League Alexander-Arnold would join a host of Real Madrid stars to have called La Finca home, with club legends Iker Casillas, Raul and Zinedine Zidane having resided there during their spells at the club. One of La Finca's most recent residents is another of Real Madrid's marquee free transfers, with Kylian Mbappe reported to have paid €10.5m (£8.8m) to buy a luxury mansion formerly owned by Gareth Bale. An alternative location for Alexander-Arnold could be the La Moraleja neighbourhood, which is located close to Real Madrid's Valdebebas training ground. Vinicius Jr and Luka Modric are among the more recent Real Madrid stars to have opted to live in the La Moraleja neighbourhood. La Moraleja has long been one of the favourite residences for star footballers and other major names in Spain. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manager Pep Guardiola said he would "quit" City if he wasn't given a smaller squad after he had to leave out several key players in the final games of the season. Despite this, the Cityzens have been linked with the likes of Morgan Gibbs-White of Nottingham Forest, Tijjani Reijnders of AC Milan and Lyon's Rayan Cherki, which suggests that the club are preparing to offload a number of players in the coming months in what will be a significant squad overhaul. City have qualified for next season's UEFA Champions League but failed to lift any silverware last season, unless you count the Community Shield, which Guardiola defended in one of his final press conferences. Al Mubarak has spoken to the club website about the team's ambition heading into the transfer market and how they want to conduct their business early before the start of the Club World Cup so they may build a squad that can improve next season. "I can tell you today, we have clearly identified who exactly are the targets, in what positions, and we have our clear number one option, our clear number two option," he explained. Our objective is to try to be ready with the new squad for the Club World Cup." Al Mubarak says he can sense a hunger in the squad to once again fight for the Premier League title as well as another Champions League trophy after what has been a poor season by City's standards. He sent a message to fans, stating that lessons will be learnt and that next season is a new beginning. We start working and preparing for next season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Howard portrayed a bleak situation ahead of the Concacaf Gold Cup for the U.S. men's national team and head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Names like Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Antonee Robinson, Giovanni Reyna, Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah won't participate in the competition for different reasons, but the pressure to build confidence in this USMNT project still remains after a disheartening performance in the Concacaf Nations League. Speaking on his Unfiltered Soccer podcast with fellow USMNT legend Landon Donovan, the goalkeeper painted a worrying picture for the team. My hope would be that there was this plan in place that says, 'This is last chance saloon to get all of my guys together to see what I have,'” Howard said in regards to multiple players including Christian Pulisic asking to be left off the Gold Cup squad. “Hear me out, I'm going on record as fact. He will not know what his best team is made of in the most difficult moments... think about that for a second.” Knowing his best team on paper might be easy given the crop of talent, but Howard is more concerned about what happens when push comes to shove on the biggest stage on home soil. Pochettino's had four opportunities to see his squad since taking over in late 2024: two friendly camps and two gatherings for the Concacaf Nations League. His debut was a mixed bag given USMNT were embarrassed by Mexico, the other friendly camp was primarily for Major League Soccer players given players abroad were with their clubs. Defeating Jamaica in the Nations League quarterfinals wasn't anything to write home about, but their showings against Panama and Canada underwhelmed and worried fans. If the Argentine can pull it off, while also endearing fans to other players in the squad, it'll be a win-win. If not, the pressure is going to be turned up a notch.
