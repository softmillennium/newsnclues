                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Tesla CEO has acknowledged this week that he sometimes finds himself at odds with administration decisions. In a statement provided to CNN, Leo said “I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved.” “There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy,” Leo said. Leo did not respond directly to Trump's attacks, including calling him “a bad person” who brags about controlling judges Instead, Leo highlighted how he and the Federalist Society shaped much of Trump's judicial legacy in his first term. Trump's attacks and Leo's response came after a three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade ruled against Trump's tariffs. One of those judges, Timothy Reif, was appointed by Trump. The ruling was later paused by an appeals court. Instead, this person, who worked during Trump's first term, said he was not and that members of Trump's trade team back then actually advocated for Reif. Reif was previously a political appointee in the Trump administration, who served as a senior adviser under then-US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer before his nomination to the federal trade court, CNN has reported. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. President Donald Trump said today he was “surprised” and “disappointed” by recent Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, but stopped short of labeling President Vladimir Putin a “bad guy” when pressed by a reporter in the Oval Office. When asked how his administration is managing “a very stubborn Vladimir Putin,” Trump was quick to interject and include Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in the characterization. President Donald Trump said today he wants to get rid of the debt limit and emphasized the dangers of default — a turnaround from his stance on the topic when President Joe Biden was still in office. In a May 2023 town hall with CNN, then-candidate Trump said he believed the US should default if the Biden White House didn't agree to spending cuts. “It's psychological,” Trump said of a default at the time. In a 2016 interview on CNBC, the then-presumptive Republican nominee seemed to suggest that rather than pay its outstanding national debt in full, the country could renegotiate. Trump made it clear he wanted the debt ceiling raised under Biden, rather than having to deal with it once he was president. Ultimately, the spending legislation passed Congress without a debt ceiling provision. Now, the GOP is trying to raise the limit under Trump's “one big, beautiful bill,” which is currently moving through Congress. Today, Trump brought up Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's calls to get rid of the debt ceiling and said, “I always agreed with her.” Most Republicans adamantly oppose that idea, believing it would lead to more spending. “But that's one of the things it gets taken care of in this bill — that automatically gets extended for a four-year period.” Elon Musk dodged a question in the Oval Office today about a New York Times report that said the tech billionaire used drugs more extensively than previously known. What you need to know about the report: The New York Times on Friday reported Musk — who's been a ubiquitous presence at the White House as part of a broad mandate to slash federal funding under the Department of Government Efficiency — was “using drugs far more intensely than previously known,” as he rose to prominence in Trump's inner circle in 2024, citing people familiar with his activities. The Times noted that it wasn't clear whether that drug use extended to his time at Trump's side at the White House this year. But the Times reports Musk was “using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to people familiar. President Donald Trump said Elon Musk is “really not leaving” and that he believes the tech billionaire will still be “back and forth” during remarks from the Oval Office on Musk's final day as a special government employee. I think, I have a feeling — it's his baby, and I think he's going to be doing a lot of things,” Trump said as he praised the Tesla CEO's work in the Department of Government Efficiency. “But Elon's service to America has been without comparison in modern history. “Many of the DOGE people, Elon, are staying behind, too, so they're not leaving,” Trump continued. During their joint appearance in the Oval Office, Trump presented Musk with a gift as part of his official send-off from federal service. Take care of yourself,” Trump said as he handed Musk a ceremonial key. Some background: Trump's praise for Musk comes amid recent tension following an interview in which the tech billionaire said he has some “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration but feels “a little stuck in a bind” when disagreements arise, not wanting to publicly speak out against them. Musk oversaw a massive transformation in the size and scope of the federal government through DOGE, with at least 121,000 federal workers laid off or targeted for layoffs in Trump's first 100 days and thousands more taking buyout offers. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in the Oval Office today that he still expects “over time” to achieve his promise that the Department of Government Efficiency will deliver a trillion dollars in cuts to the federal government. During his time as a “special government employee,” Musk oversaw DOGE's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce as part of efforts to vastly reduce federal spending. While he initially boasted that he could cut $2 trillion from the nation's roughly $6.8 trillion federal budget, he eventually walked that back to $1 trillion — and reportedly seemed to lower the total to $150 billion for the coming fiscal year at a Cabinet meeting last month. Reflecting on his time heading DOGE, the billionaire said identifying cuts takes “a lot of hard work.” “It's just a lot of work going through the vast expenses of the federal government and just really asking questions,” he said. Continuing role: During his appearance alongside President Donald Trump today, Musk said he still intends to give the president advice even as he closes out his time in the administration. “I expect to remain a friend and an adviser and certainly, if there's anything the president wants me to do, I'm at the president's service,” Musk added. President Donald Trump weighed in Friday on a video that appeared to capture French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte, pushing his face as he was about to disembark a plane in Hanoi, Vietnam. I spoke to him and he's fine, they're fine, they're two really good people,” Trump said of the Macrons, with whom he and first lady Melania Trump have spent significant time. Macron dismissed the situation, telling reporters, “There's a video showing me joking and teasing my wife and somehow that becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe, with people even coming up with theories to explain it.” “I haven't seen him, I haven't spoken to him in years,” Trump said about Combs, whom he had called a good friend on his show “The Apprentice.” “He used to really like me a lot, but I think when I ran for politics, he sort of, that relationship busted up,” Trump said. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are appearing together at an event in the Oval Office. Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday that today is Musk's “last day.” Musk told “CBS Sunday Morning” in a clip of an interview that's set to air on Sunday that he has “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration and doesn't “entirely agree” with some of its actions. President Donald Trump announced today that he is removing Kim Sajet as director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing his concerns over her political leanings and support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. Trump's statement did not cite specific incidents or provide evidence of partisanship. CNN has reached out to Portrait Gallery for comment. The new US ceasefire proposal for an end to hostiles between Israel and Hamas calls for negotiations on a permanent end to the war beginning on day one — and promises President Donald Trump's support in the process. The proposal, viewed by CNN, includes Hamas releasing 10 Israeli hostages and 18 deceased hostages in exchange for 125 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,111 Gazans detained since the war began. Instead, the proposal says that Trump is “committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.” The proposal also appears to stipulate that Trump would take credit for a deal. “President Trump will personally announce the ceasefire agreement,” it says. President Donald Trump pushed back against a preliminary report from the Congressional Budget Office that his administration's massive spending bill would add trillions to the deficit, taking to Truth Social to blast the agency today. “The Democrat inspired and ‘controlled' Congressional Budget Office (CBO) purposefully gave us an EXTREMELY LOW level of Growth, 1.8% over 10 years. “They did the same thing to us in 2017, and we DOUBLED their numbers. The information they recently released is even more absurd and indefensible. I predict we will do 3, 4, or even 5 times the amount they purposefully ‘allotted' to us (1.8%) and, with just our minimum expected 3% Growth, we will more than offset our Tax Cuts (which will, in actuality, cost us no money! The Trump administration and Chinese officials are discussing setting up a call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, two senior White House officials told CNN, adding that the White House believes a call is the necessary next step to revive trade negotiations. Trump blasted China in a Truth Social post this morning, saying the country “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said today that the White House will not use the conservative Federalist Society to make judicial picks moving forward, blasting what he called “rogue judges” who've blocked the administration's domestic policies. “You heard President Trump himself say that the Federalist Society and Leonard Leo have created a broken system for judicial vetting,” Miller told CNN's Pamela Brown. “What it means is simply this, and nothing more: We're not going to be using the Federalist Society to make judicial nominations at all going forward.” He added: “I am so disappointed in The Federalist Society because of the bad advice they gave me on numerous Judicial Nominations.” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CNN Friday he has no concerns over a New York Times report that Elon Musk used drugs more extensively than previously known. “I don't have any concerns, but also I believe there's a press conference today with Elon Musk, so everyone will be having an opportunity to ask these questions themselves,” Miller told CNN's Pamela Brown in an interview. “All I can say is that DOGE has done an extraordinary job rooting out systemic waste, graft, grift, and corruption from the federal government, and you're going to hear from the President today, his thanks to Elon Musk for leading that effort to save taxpayers billions of dollars,” Miller added. The New York Times on Friday reported that Musk – who's been a ubiquitous presence at the White House as part of a broad mandate to slash federal funding – was “using drugs far more intensely than previously known,” as he rose to prominence in Trump's inner circle in 2024, citing people familiar with his activities. The Times noted that it wasn't clear whether that drug use extended to his time at Trump's side at the White House this year. But the Times reported that Musk was “using ketamine often, sometimes daily, and mixing it with other drugs,” according to people familiar. On Friday, Miller – whose wife Katie Miller, a top adviser and spokesperson for DOGE, also left her position and is now working with Musk – wouldn't say if drug testing was required for Musk during his tenure as special government employee. President Donald Trump will travel to Pennsylvania today to tout a partnership between US Steel and the Japan-based Nippon Steel that he says will keep the company's headquarters in Pittsburgh. Trump announced the deal last week on Truth Social, saying it will draw $14 billion in investment toward the US economy and create at least 70,000 jobs. But Trump's post included few details about what's included in the deal, such as whether this is truly a partnership instead of an acquisition and how much control would remain with US Steel. Some background: Former President Joe Biden blocked the $14.3 billion acquisition during his last week in office. The deal has been controversial since it was first announced in December 2023, with both sides of the political aisle opposing foreign control of a once-key component of US industrial might that has fallen on hard times. Trump found rare convergence with Biden when he also began his term opposed to an outright deal. But in March, the Trump administration signaled it may allow the deal to go through after it filed a motion to extend two deadlines in a lawsuit US Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks. Nippon raised its investment pledge in US Steel's operations to $14 billion, which would include a new $4 billion steel mill in the US, if its bid was greenlit, according to Reuters. The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to suspend a Biden-era parole program that allowed a half million immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to temporarily live and work in the United States. It was the second time this month that the high court sided with Trump's efforts to revoke temporary legal status for immigrants. Two liberal justices – Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson – dissented from the decision. Elon Musk said he has “differences of opinion” with the Trump administration and doesn't “entirely agree” with some of its actions – his latest comments as he exits the administration. “It's not like I agree with everything the administration does,” Musk told “CBS Sunday Morning” in a clip of an interview that's set to air on Sunday. He continued, “There are things I don't entirely agree with. Musk also raised concerns about President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package, saying he believes it would raise the US budget deficit and undercut efforts by DOGE. President Donald Trump lashed out against conservative legal activist Leonard Leo yesterday, lambasting the former head of the Federalist Society as “a real ‘sleazebag'” and “a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates America,” in a post to his Truth Social platform. The post followed a three-judge panel – including a judge he appointed to the bench – blocking enforcement of his administration's tariffs Wednesday night. “[Leo] openly brags how he controls Judges, and even Justices of the United States Supreme Court – I hope that is not so, and don't believe it is!” Trump wrote. “In any event, Leo left The Federalist Society to do his own ‘thing.' White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a CNN interview this morning that “we're not going to be using the Federalist Society to make judicial nominations at all going forward.” Leo and the Federalist Society were instrumental during Trump's first term in assembling a list of conservative judges for judicial appointments. And in 2019 remarks marking his administration's judicial confirmations, Trump offered effusive praise for Leo's work with the administration on confirming conservative judges. In a statement responding to Trump's post, Leo wrote: “I'm very grateful for President Trump transforming the Federal Courts, and it was a privilege being involved. There's more work to be done, for sure, but the Federal Judiciary is better than it's ever been in modern history, and that will be President Trump's most important legacy.” Of the six judicial nominees he announced Wednesday, two – Ed Artau and Jordan Pratt – are Federalist Society members. United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Friday he's going to speak with his European Union counterpart next week to discuss an EU trade deal. “I would say that when it comes to the trade deficit, China is the biggest problem but the EU is right behind them, and when it comes to non-tariff barriers, certainly we have that in China, but we also have that in the EU with respect to their standards on industrial goods and ag (agriculture), where they effectively block a lot of our products,” Greer told CNBC. “Obviously, with China, you have a geopolitical layer on top of that, where their geopolitical goals are different and at odds with ours, and so that's its own challenge when it comes to the pure economics. Greer said President Donald Trump's call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last week “went very well,” adding that the EU was “responsive” to trade talks, but criticized the EU for an ongoing trade deficit. … These are things that have gone on for a really long time, and that's why the EU, you know, it's one reason why the EU has a $240 billion surplus with us.”</p>

Nick Wright shares his dream roster for Team USA's debut in Olympic flag football at the 2028 Games. After NFL owners approved players to play flag football at the Los Angeles Summer Olympics in 2028 earlier this month, players and fans alike have been dreaming about the potential squad the United States could have. However, U.S. men's flag football national team quarterback, Darrell Doucette III, has been firm in his belief that flag football players should not be put aside just because NFL players are now allowed to participate. Former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce proposed an idea that would help determine which players, flag football or NFL, would represent Team USA in the Olympics. "Let's just have these (flag football) guys play an NFL team that's picked and may the best team win and represent the USA," Kelce said during a recent episode of "New Heights." "I think a coach that is familiar with flag football should select an NFL-represented team. That team should just play this flag football team that's been playing for a long time and feels like they are the best at it, and they don't need other guys. Then whoever wins (goes to the Olympics)." Former Philadelphia Eagle Jason Kelce reacts before the game between the Philadelphia Phillies and Atlanta Braves at Citizens Bank Park. Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce wondered whether Doucette is "afraid" of NFL competition. He's just boxing out other people from joining the sport because they haven't played the specific style of football?" Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce after making a catch during warm-ups before an NFL football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Nov. 4, 2024, in Kansas City, Mo. The United States, led by Doucette, sat on top of the world flag football rankings last year. Regardless of their rankings, Jason is "really confident" that NFL players would be better. "If these guys are the best, they should represent (Team) USA," Jason said. "I don't know anything about flag football, but I feel really confident they're not the best."

A woman walks past an artwork by street artist Banksy, Friday, May 30, 2025 in Marseille, southern France. MARSEILLE, France (AP) — The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: “I want to be what you saw in me.” On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account — without caption or coordinates. Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look. A man makes a selfie by an artwork by street artist Banksy, Friday, May 30, 2025 in Marseille, southern France. There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable — a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Marseille's mayor, Benoît Payan, was quick to react online. “Marseille x Banksy,” he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond. Though often political, Banksy's art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality. The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, “Laugh now, but one day I'll be in charge.” His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters. Police later arrested two men on suspicion of theft and criminal damage. In March 2024, an environmentally themed work on a wall beside a tree in north London was splashed with paint, covered with plastic sheeting and fenced off within days of being created. A man rides his scooter by an artwork by street artist Banksy, Friday, May 30, 2025 in Marseille, southern France. Despite the fame — or infamy — at least in Marseille, not everyone walking past noticed it. Some didn't even know who Banksy was, according to the local press. On Instagram observers say this Marseille piece feels quieter. And yet, it is no less global. The work arrives just ahead of a major Banksy retrospective opening June 14 at the Museum of Art in nearby Toulon featuring 80 works, including rare originals. But the Marseille mural wasn't meant for a museum. It lives in the street, exposed to weather, footsteps and time. As of Friday evening, no barriers had been erected.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US. Although the full Court did not explain why it reached this decision, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson penned a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. As Jackson explains, the case involves “nearly half a million Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan noncitizens” who are in the United States “after fleeing their home countries.” Shortly after Trump entered office, DHS issued a blanket order stripping these immigrants of their parole status, putting them at risk for removal. But, a federal district court blocked that order — ruling that DHS must decide whether each individual immigrant should lose their status on a case-by-case basis, rather than through an en masse order. Realistically, this district court order was unlikely to remain in effect indefinitely. In its brief to the justices, the Trump administration makes a strong argument that its decision to terminate these immigrants' status is legal, or, at least, that the courts cannot second-guess that decision. Among other things, the brief points to a federal law which provides that “no court shall have jurisdiction to review” certain immigration-related decisions by the secretary of Homeland Security. And it argues that the secretary has the power to grant or deny parole because federal law gives them “discretion” over who receives parole. Instead, she argues that her Court's decision to effectively strip these immigrants of their status is premature. The shadow docket is a mix of emergency motions and other expedited matters that the justices decide without full briefing and oral argument. The Court typically only spends days or maybe a few weeks weighing whether to grant shadow docket relief, while it spends months or longer deciding cases on its ordinary docket. As Jackson correctly notes in her Doe dissent, the Supreme Court has long said that a party seeking a shadow docket order blocking a lower court's decision must do more than demonstrate that they are likely to prevail. Jackson criticizes her colleagues in the majority for abandoning these requirements. As she argues, the Trump administration has not shown an “urgent need to effectuate blanket…parole terminations now.” She also argues that DHS “does not identify any specific national-security threat or foreign-policy problem that will result” if these immigrants remain in the country for a few more months. Although the Court has never formally repudiated the requirement that parties seeking to stay a lower court order must prove irreparable harm, it often hands down shadow docket decisions that don't explicitly consider this requirement. Concurring in Labrador v. Poe (2024), Justice Brett Kavanaugh argued that, in many shadow docket cases, “this Court has little choice but to decide the emergency application by assessing likelihood of success on the merits.” So Kavanaugh, at least, has stated openly that there are some cases where he will rule solely based on which side he thinks should win, regardless of whether that side has proven irreparable harm. Kavanaugh's concurring opinion was joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. No justice contested that the Trump administration is eventually likely to prevail in this case. The upshot of this abandonment is that right-leaning litigants like Trump are likely to receive relief very quickly from the justices, because most of the justices are Republicans, while left-leaning litigants will remain bound by lower court orders. If this decision stands on appeal, it's a big loss for Trump that will make it difficult for his trade war to continue. One of the GOP justices must have defected in a case about religious schools, but the Court didn't reveal who it was.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with his Australian counterpart Richard Marles in Singapore on Friday. In this photo released by Singapore's Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI), French President Emmanuel Macron, left, shakes hand with Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during a joint press conference after ministers from both countries signed multiple bilateral agreements in Singapore, Friday, May 30, 2025. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth holds a joint press conference with and Philippine Secretary of Defense Gilberto Teodoro at the Armed Forces of the Philippines Headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City, Philippines, Friday, March 28, 2025. French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech during the 22nd Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore, Friday, May 30, 2025. SINGAPORE (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron warned the United States and a large audience of Indo-Pacific nations on Friday night that they risk a dangerous double standard as they concentrate on a potential conflict with China, if that shift comes at the cost of abandoning Ukraine. He warned that abandoning Ukraine would eventually erode U.S. credibility in deterring any potential conflict with China over Taiwan. In a speech that emphasized France's tight ties to the Indo-Pacific, Macron said that any shifts to developing a more hard-line deterrent stance in the region is still tied to how the world — and particularly the West — treats other critical issues, including climate change and Israel's ongoing military operations in Gaza. “If you consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction, without any constraint, without any reaction of the global order, how would you phrase what would happen in Taiwan, what would you do the day something happened in” the Philippines? The speech was notable in that Macron delivered it with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the audience and as not only France, but countries around the globe are dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff threats. Both Europe and those same Indo-Pacific nations also find themselves increasingly pulled between the competing interests of Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. But we don't want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,” Macron said, in an apparent jab at Trump. China claims the self-governing democracy as its own, and Xi hasn't ruled out taking it by force. China, which usually sends its defense minister to the Shangri-La forum, sent a much lower-level delegation instead, led by Maj. Gen. Hu Gangfeng, the vice president of the People's Liberation Army National Defense University. The delegation was expected to speak Saturday on a panel on “cooperative maritime security” alongside representatives from Japan, Vietnam, Chile and the U.K. — notable in that China's aggressive global fisheries tactics have been a regular topic of concern not only in the Indo-Pacific but as far away as Latin America and the Arctic. “We can't account for whether China engages or not. And we will be here,” Hegseth said as he met with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro. Hegseth's trip to Singapore is his second to the region since becoming defense secretary, following a March visit to the Philippines, which has seen escalating confrontations with China over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. That trip, which also included a stop in Japan, brought a degree of relief over growing concerns from the Philippines and others in the region about U.S. support from a president who has taken more of a transactional approach to diplomacy and seems wary of foreign engagements. The U.S. has been pursuing a “free and open Indo-Pacific” policy, which includes regularly sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea, which is claimed almost in its entirety by China. The European Union has adopted a more economics-driven approach, but several European nations have also regularly taken part in the freedom of navigation exercises, including France, which sent a carrier strike group on a five-month mission through the Indo-Pacific that concluded in April. In its published Indo-Pacific strategy, France has underscored the need to “preserve a rules-based international order” in the face of “China's increasing power and territorial claims” and its global competition with the United States. France's own ties to the Indo-Pacific are strong, with more than 1.6 million of its citizens living in the region in French overseas territories. Following a meeting Friday with Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Macron told reporters there was room in the region for more than just the two superpowers. Wong underscored Macron's point, saying that Singapore and the greater region weren't looking for exclusive arrangements with any single power. In his speech later, he said it was wrong to think of the war in Ukraine as simply a European war, and chided China for its support of Russia and for not doing anything to prevent North Korea from sending weapons and troops to aid Russia's fight. Macron said that he had always been against NATO taking a role in Asia — something China routinely accuses the U.S. of trying to engineer - but suggested that the presence of North Korean soldiers on the front lines in Ukraine might cause him to reconsider. “If China doesn't want NATO being involved in Southeast Asia or Asia, they should prevent, clearly, DPRK to be engaged on the European soil,” he said, referring to North Korea by its formal name. The conference comes as civil war continues to rage in Myanmar, creating a massive humanitarian crisis that has only been compounded by the effects of a devastating earthquake that hit in March. Thailand and Cambodia have a long history of land disputes, though Thailand said after the short skirmish that the situation had been resolved. Of greater concern, nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan came to the brink of war earlier this month in their most serious military confrontation in decades. The two armies exchanged gunfire, artillery strikes, missiles and drones that killed dozens of people, and Pakistan shot down several Indian planes before a truce was declared.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 111 people were confirmed dead in central Nigeria on Friday after floods submerged the market town of Mokwa in the country's Niger State following torrential rains, officials said. The heavy rains lasted for several hours Thursday, and media reports quoting local government officials said a dam collapse in a nearby town had worsened the situation. Rescuers continued to find more bodies into the afternoon Friday. Earlier reports said 88 people had died, but then at least 23 more bodies were found, Niger State emergency agency spokesman IIbrahim Audu Husseinit told The Associated Press in the afternoon. That brought the toll to 111, but that could go higher as the search continued. “More bodies have just been brought and are yet to be counted, but we have at least 111 confirmed already,” Husseini told AP by telephone. Mokwa, about 220 kilometers (140 miles) west of Abuja, is a major meeting point where traders from the south buy food from growers in the north. In a similar occurrence last September, torrential rains and a dam collapse in Nigeria's northeastern Maiduguri caused severe flooding, leaving at least 30 people dead and displacing millions, worsening the humanitarian crisis caused by the Boko Haram insurgency. Nigeria often faces seasonal floods, particularly impacting communities such as Mokwa along the banks of the Niger and Benue Rivers. Communities in the far north of the country, which experience prolonged dry spells worsened by climate change, also see excessive rainfall that leads to severe flooding during their brief wet season. In videos and photos shared on social media platforms, floodwaters cover neighborhoods where homes are fully or partially submerged, with rooftops barely visible above the brown currents. Residents are also seen waist-deep in water, appearing to salvage what they can carry or rescue others. He appealed to the government to start “long overdue” construction of waterways in Mokwa under a climate resilience project.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end a Biden-era mass parole program for thousands of migrants, pausing on Friday a lower court's ruling that had prevented President Donald Trump from doing so. The high court granted a stay of U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani's April order, which had blocked the revocation of work permits and legal status for over 530,000 migrants flown into the United States under a Biden administration program. And it undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending,” Jackson said. “I would have denied the Government's application because its harm-related showing is patently insufficient.” Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in his emergency application to the high court that not allowing the program to be ended would lead to time-consuming individual removal proceedings for each of the migrants. “When lower courts have disregarded Congress's commands in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and usurped the Executive Branch's control over immigration policy, this Court has not hesitated to intervene,” Sauer said in the emergency application earlier this month. The coalition of groups suing to keep the program in place has contended that the mass parole offered humanitarian relief, while the Trump administration has viewed it as a mechanism Biden used to bring in scores of migrants by executive fiat. Talwani's April order in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration unlawfully acted when it planned to revoke legal status en masse and not give each migrant individual review. She said migrants faced “two unfavorable options: continue following the law and leave the country on their own, or await removal proceedings.” Earlier this week, Talwani, who was appointed to the court by former President Barack Obama, ordered the Trump administration to resume processing applications for migrants seeking to renew their work permits and status.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deal to have a Japanese company purchase US Steel has drawn bipartisan opposition. President Joe Biden blocked the deal on national security grounds shortly before he left office. When asked Sunday about the deal, he told reporters “It's an investment, and it'll be a partial ownership (by Nippon. Trump is set to appear at a US Steel plant just outside of Pittsburgh Friday evening. Trump is threatening increased tariffs on US imports from Japan and has already imposed tariffs on all steel imports. From the outside, it appears that Nippon will still purchase all outstanding shares of US Steel for $55 a share, or about $12.5 billion, under terms of a deal first announced in December 2023. Trump said it has also agreed to invest $14 billion in US Steel's American operations. But the United Steelworkers, which represents US Steel's hourly workers in Pennsylvania and Indiana, said it is not dropping its opposition, because it believes the deal still represents a complete purchase by Nippon. We've seen nothing in the reporting to indicate that position has changed. We also have no confirmation if or how much of the stated $14 billion would go to our union-represented sites, or how much would be for new capital improvements versus routine repair & maintenance.” Even if Nippon does own all the shares, it apparently will be with restrictions. The “control” Trump is referring to will likely come from the federal government holding so-called “golden shares” in US Steel as a condition of approval. That allows the government to approve a majority of the company's board members, who will all be American, Pennsylvania Senator David McCormick told CNBC. “That will allow the United States to ensure that production levels aren't cut,” McCormick, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, said Tuesday. A week after the announcement, neither company has yet said how much of US Steel Nippon will own. “US Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,” the company said in a statement last Friday following Trump's announcement. In March, the administration filed a motion to extend two deadlines in a lawsuit U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks. Trump then ordered a new review of the acquisition in April. Trump said Sunday that members of Congress had been pushing for approval of the deal as had local unions that represent hourly workers at US Steel. US Steel has threatened that it would be forced to close some of its older, unionized mills unless the deal is completed and it gets the investment dollars needed to modernize. But the USW has said its worried Nippon's long-term goal is to shift production to its non-union operations in Texas or import steel from Japan to be finished in the United States, ending integrated steel production at the company. Nippon Steel has promised, however, to honor the union's contract with US Steel and to invest billions in integrated mills in Pennsylvania and Indiana. US Steel was once a symbol of American industrial dominance. It was also crucial to the US economy throughout much of the 20th century providing the steel needed to build cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers, as well as weapons that helped win War War II. But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the USW. But it is still not a company that politicians who enjoy talking about American greatness want to see fall into foreign hands — particularly in the politically significant state of Pennsylvania.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US ports have been seeing pandemic-level declines in imports, so good news on tariffs was just what port officials were hoping for. For awhile on Wednesday, it looked like retailers and ports got exactly that, with a court blocking many of President Donald Trump's tariffs. But a federal appeals court on Thursday quickly paused that ruling. That kind of whiplash underscores why, even when there's news of tariffs easing, goods  don't start flowing into US ports right away. And that could mean fewer goods on store shelves in the coming months, cutting into available choices and raising prices for everyday Americans. Indeed, last month, imports declined by a whopping $68.4 billion, according to advanced trade data released by the Census Bureau on Friday. This came after retailers stocked up on goods in March, aiming to get ahead of tariffs. But the stunning decline in imports could mean retailers have less of an inventory buffer, leaving them less able to avoid paying future tariffs — and that could lead to price increases for US consumers. “I think there was an expectation that all of a sudden everything would start coming in again. I don't think you've seen that huge rush to bring everything in again because I think folks are still being cautious on how this is going to proceed,” said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. Even after Trump lowered tariffs on China from 145% to 30% earlier this month, America's largest ports have yet to see a rebound. Then Wednesday evening's decision by a US court in Manhattan injected new chaos into the trade picture. The ruling blocked a swath of Trump's tariffs, including a 10% tariff on most imports and the higher duties on China, Mexico and Canada. The White House filed an appeal, and by Thursday afternoon a federal appeals court restored the tariffs until both sides provide written arguments by early next month. The back and forth is confusing enough for any retailer trying to do business, especially when they have to plan weeks or even months in advance. “It's kind of a ping pong back and forth. So it's very difficult for retailers to try and plan ahead,” said Gold. As retailers sit confused, fewer containers are headed for America's ports. The 30% tariff on China was already proving too costly for many retailers to bring more inventory into the United States, according to Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. Those that can afford the cost are shipping already-manufactured products, but no new factory orders are being placed, he said. “With the whipsaw effect of information that continues to come out on trade policy and tariffs – many continue to take the wait-and-see approach,” Seroka told CNBC on Thursday. Things are improving for the Port of LA, albeit slowly. In the first week of June, 96,000 large cargo containers are expected to arrive, up from 69,000 in the final week of May. By the second week of June, 106,000 containers are expected. We still have 10 cancelled sailings of scheduled vessel arrivals for June – half of those are in the first week,” Seroka said. “So we are not seeing an uptick like some observers had called for or a big surge. It's not just cost – businesses are also facing a time crunch. “Ninety days of this reprieve is a short time in our business. Still, some experts say a surge may manifest, but what it looks like is hard to predict. “There's probably not going to be an issue with empty shelves, but I think there will be additional costs being potentially passed on to consumers, because what we're seeing is all this uncertainty has a cost,” said Daniel Hackett, a partner at Hackett Associates, a maritime strategy and trade logistics company. A number of large retailers, such as Walmart, Home Depot and Target, have already said they will increase prices to mitigate the impact of tariffs. “It's just that uncertainty is adding costs, if nothing else.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Republicans will hold the first full congressional hearing next month to investigate what they say was a coordinated effort to conceal the cognitive decline of former President Joe Biden and whether anyone else was pulling the strings behind his presidency. “For four years, when the American people saw Joe Biden, they saw someone who was clearly not capable of making major decisions for the nation,” Schmitt said in a statement. The lawmakers said they are still finalizing a witness list for Congress's first formal committee inquiry into Biden's health and mental fitness. Their inquiry comes as House Republicans ramp up a parallel investigation into the Biden administration's alleged concealment of the former president's condition. Buddy Carter (R-GA) introduced legislation Thursday to create a select committee that would explore “the potential concealment of information from the American public” about Biden's health. That investigation has also prompted broader concerns about who was making key decisions during Biden's presidency and whether he remained fully engaged. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) is pursuing interviews with several high-ranking Biden staffers over their alleged roles in masking the president's decline. Those targeted include Neera Tanden, former Domestic Policy Council director; Annie Tomasini, deputy chief of staff; Anthony Bernal, longtime aide to Jill Biden; Ashley Williams, deputy director of Oval Office operations; and Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor. “We expect all witnesses to fully comply with the Committee's investigation. Comer teased on Wednesday that there could be additional subpoenas for the former president and his spouse in the separate House investigation. The senators made no mention of Biden's autopen in their press release on Thursday. Cornyn and Schmitt's announcement came just hours after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called for the former first lady to “speak up” about her husband's health condition ahead of his Oval Office departure. “I think anybody looking at the videos and photo evidence of [former President] Joe Biden with your own eyes and a little bit of common sense can see this was a clear cover-up,” Leavitt said during a press briefing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During his testimony on Capitol Hill earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio took a swipe at Senator Chris Van Hollen, falsely accusing him of having had “a margarita” with Kilmar Abrego Garcia—one of the Maryland Democrat's constituents, who was mistakenly sent to an El Salvador megaprison more than two months ago and who remains there despite the Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to facilitate his release. Van Hollen's frustration centered on the frequent gap between what the Trump administration says about its mass-deportation campaign in court, where it is required to tell the truth, and what officials say in public as they attempt to blunt criticism of their immigration crackdown. Department of Justice attorneys insist that the administration is following judicial orders in good faith. Trump and his top officials have dispensed with the usual conventions regarding public comment on pending cases. The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended that strategy. “We are confident in the legality of our actions and do not apologize for acting to protect the American people,” she told me in a statement. But the approach has at times left Department of Justice lawyers stuck between what Trump officials say publicly and their professional and legal obligations to make truthful statements in court. When a senior ICE official said in sworn testimony in March that Abrego Garcia had been deported to El Salvador because of an “administrative error,” the Justice Department attorney who initially represented the Trump administration, Erez Reuveni, relayed that characterization to the court. When asked why the administration hadn't taken steps to correct the error and bring Abrego Garcia back, Reuveni said his client—the Trump administration—hadn't provided him with answers. The top Trump aide Stephen Miller soon began insisting publicly that Abrego Garcia's deportation was not, in fact, an error—the opposite of what the government admitted in court. Vice President J. D. Vance claimed that Abrego Garcia is a “convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here,” even though he has no criminal convictions in the United States or El Salvador. Attorney General Pam Bondi cast the error as missing “an extra step in paperwork” and said that Abrego Garcia should not be returned. Bondi said he had failed to “zealously advocate” for the government. “Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,” she told reporters. Trump and his top aides have made statements outside court that have undermined the legal positions staked out by government attorneys—at times with more candor than his lawyers. The president acknowledged during an interview last month with ABC News, for instance, that he could bring Abrego Garcia back by placing a phone call to the Salvadoran president. Read: How the Trump administration flipped on Kilmar Abrego Garcia Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, told me Trump and his top aides “really are saying whatever they want to say in public, and then after the fact, trying to figure out what that means for their litigation, instead of the other way around, which is where they figure out what they want to do in their litigation and then they mold their public statements to that.” U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who presides over the Abrego Garcia case, said during a recent hearing that Trump's claim was clearly at odds with his attorneys' contention that they could not compel a foreign government to release Abrego Garcia. Xinis also noted social-media statements by Department of Homeland Security officials saying Abrego Garcia will never be allowed to return to the United States. The judge said it sounded like an “admission of your client that your client will not take steps to facilitate the return.” Jonathan Guynn, the government's attorney, said Trump's statement needed to be read with “the appropriate nuance” and it was not “inconsistent with our good-faith compliance.” Another Justice Department attorney similarly argued that the statement lacked sufficient “nuance.” “Is that another way of saying these statements just aren't true?” Boasberg said. The government attorneys have “to sort of post hoc rationalize what they're doing,” Joseph said, “but they're running afoul of the fact that it's actually against the law, and they just can't explain it.” It's based on the idea that federal officers and attorneys are operating in good faith, and not trying to achieve political goals through acts of subterfuge. As judges see the administration saying one thing in public and another in court, they have started to treat the government's claims with more skepticism and, sometimes, with outright suspicion of criminal contempt. The White House is focused on political wins, and it has pushed back even harder at judicial oversight as the losses pile up. Despite the order, Trump officials tried last week to deport a group of men from Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, and other nations to South Sudan. Adam Cox, a constitutional law professor at NYU, told me that the Trump administration's approach marks “a sweeping transformation of past practices.” But he said it has also affirmed the importance of the lower courts to function as a powerful fact-finding body at a time when other oversight mechanisms are weakened or under attack. “A lot of the focus of public debate around courts and politics has been (understandably) focused on the Supreme Court and big legal rulings,” Cox wrote to me.</p>
