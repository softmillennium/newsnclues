The AI Race:

Builder.ai, the artificial intelligence startup that recently announced plans to declare bankruptcy, faked business with the Indian social-media startup VerSe Innovation for years to falsely inflate its sales, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg and people with direct knowledge of the practice.The two companies routinely billed one another for roughly the same amounts between 2021 and 2024, documents reviewed by Bloomberg show, as part of an alleged practice known as "round-tripping" that the people said Builder.ai used to inflate revenue figures it presented to investors. In many cases, products and services weren't actually provided to either company for these payments, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Umang Bedi, a VerSe co-founder, said it was “absolutely baseless and false” that his company would have recorded expenses or billed services that it didn't receive or provide. “We're not the kind of company that is in the business of inflating revenues,” he said in an interview.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday will host a press event to celebrate Elon Musk as the Tesla CEO concludes his official government service after four turbulent months leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk's scheduled departure comes at a precarious moment, both for DOGE and for his relationship with the president. Multiple top staffers at DOGE have either recently left or are on their way out of the federal workforce-slashing group. They include Steve Davis, the president of Musk's Boring Company, and DOGE spokeswoman Katie Miller, White House officials told NBC News. Attorney James Burnham is also reportedly leaving the group. Musk worked for Trump temporarily as a powerful and highly visible "special government employee" after spending over $250 million helping to get the president elected. Trump has regularly praised Musk throughout his tenure, up to and including his announcement of Friday's Oval Office "press conference." "This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way," Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social, adding, "Elon is terrific!" But Musk, the world's richest man, has publicly broken with Trump and clashed with Cabinet members on multiple occasions. He expressed support for lower tariffs, undermining Trump's "tariff man" persona. He also slammed White House trade advisor Peter Navarro as "truly a moron" and "dumber than a sack of bricks." This week, Musk broke with Trump over the "one big, beautiful bill" that the president is pushing congressional Republicans to approve. The "Department of Government Efficiency," which Musk once predicted would cut trillions of dollars in government spending, has come nowhere close to that level, according to its own numbers, which also have come under question. But Musk said DOGE isn't done yet. "The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government," Musk wrote Wednesday in an X post thanking Trump. Musk recently signaled he plans to back away from politics, including by pulling back on future campaign contributions, and focus more on his many businesses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets. European stock markets closed narrowly in the green on Friday, with sectors spread between losses and gains. The Stoxx 600 index finished 0.1% higher after two sessions of declines. Investment manager M&G was the top performer, up 5% following news that Japan's Dai-ichi Life has taken a 15% stake in the business as part of a strategic partnership. For global investors, it's been yet another week dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump and tariffs. Among the biggest developments have been a federal trade court's blocking of Trump's universal reciprocal tariff policy late on Wednesday, which itself was then temporarily overturned on Thursday; Trump's accusation that China violated its preliminary trade agreement with the U.S., reigniting trade war fears; and market concerns over sweeping changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S. Items on the agenda next week include figures for euro zone inflation, the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting, and Europe's largest gathering of the private equity sector at SuperReturn in Berlin. U.S. stocks are off to a rocky start Friday. President Donald Trump's accusation that China violated its preliminary trade agreement has brought fears of a prolonged trade war between the world's biggest economies back to the fore. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said that China had "totally violated" a preliminary trade agreement with America, adding that the alleged wavering from the deal "has to be addressed." Under the agreement reached earlier this month, both countries said they would pause punitive tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days. The personal consumption expenditures price index was expected to show a 2.2% annual rate in April, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast. Excluding food and energy, the core reading that tends to get even greater focus from Fed policymakers showed readings of 0.1% and 2.5%, against respective estimates of 0.1% and 2.6%. Germany's annual inflation hit 2.1% in May approaching the European Central Bank's 2% target but coming in slightly hotter than analyst estimates, preliminary data from statistics office Destatis showed Friday. Germany's consumer price index has been closing in on the European Central Bank's 2% target over recent months, in a positive signal amid ongoing uncertainty about the economic outlook for Europe's largest economy. London-listed shares of investment manager M&G had popped 5.7% by 12:22 p.m. U.K. time on Friday. The stock rose after the company announced an "ambitious long-term strategic partnership" with Japanese insurer Dai-ichi Life, under which the latter would acquire a 15% stake in M&G. The deal will also see M&G become Dai-ichi Life's preferred asset management partner in Europe. M&G said on Friday that over the next five years, the agreement is expected to generate at least $6 billion of new business flows for M&G, and $2 billion of new business flows for Dai-ichi Life. Oil and gas, healthcare and utilities stocks are leading gains, with the regional indexes representing those sectors each up by around 0.9%. Looking at major regional bourses, Germany's DAX is seeing the biggest upward swing, with a gain of 0.9%. That puts the index, which hit a record high earlier this week, on track to end its two-day losing streak. The dollar is the world's most commonly held reserve currency, accounting for almost 60% of global foreign exchange reserves and playing an important role in the trade of assets like oil and gold. It also acts as a peg for currencies including the Hong Kong dollar and the Saudi Riyal. In second place, trailing far behind the greenback, is the euro, which makes up around 20% of international FX reserves. This week, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said the shifting geopolitical landscape that was driving those moves gave European policymakers an opportunity to raise the euro's status. What happens if Section 899 in President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" becomes law? Jordon Rochester, head of fixed income and currency strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Asia at Mizuho, says that foreign investors will likely move assets and investments out of the U.S. Read more about Section 899 and why the U.S. foreign tax bill is sending jitters across Wall Street. The latest court rulings on the legality of U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs add "another layer of uncertainty," Valdis Dombrovskis, European Union commissioner for economy, told CNBC's Karen Tso on Friday. "We are already negotiating in [a] quite uncertain environment, with things changing quite rapidly," he said. European stock markets broadly moved higher despite U.S. tariffs being re-imposed by U.S. courts. The Stoxx Europe 600 index is up 0.1%, the FTSE 100 added 0.4% and Germany's DAX is higher by 0.3%. Meanwhile, France's CAC 40 bucked the trend by declining 0.2% in early trade. European stock markets are expected to open in positive territory on Friday. Meanwhile, the U.K.'s FTSE 100, is set to open 0.2% higher, France's CAC 40 could add 0.1% and Germany's DAX is seen opening flat at the start of the trading day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's week three of the Sean "Diddy" Combs sex-trafficking and racketeering trial. A federal jury in Manhattan has heard R&B singer Cassie Ventura — Combs' ex-girlfriend and the catalyst for his public downfall — tearfully testify about the humiliating "freak offs" she says she endured throughout their 11-year relationship. A second sex-assault accuser, testifying as "Mia," has described four times she said Combs attacked her during her nine years working as his personal assistant and film executive. Along the way, there have been numerous celebrity mentions, including pop icon Britney Spears, actor Michael B. Jordan, rapper Kid Cudi, and late music legend Prince. The music tycoon is arguing through his defense team that all sexual encounters were consensual, including the alleged drug-fueled freak offs. The defense also argues that any violence fell far short of sex trafficking and that his accusers have a financial motive to implicate him. One of Combs' former personal assistants testified under the pseudonym "Mia," telling jurors he sexually attacked her four times between 2009 and 2017, when she was in her mid-20s and early 30s.She said that two of the attacks were at the sprawling glass and concrete mansion he rented in Beverly Hills, including a rape in the staff bedroom. She described waking to feeling Combs on top of her. "I knew his power and I knew his control over me," she told the jury, her voice hushed and halting. Combs once attacked Ventura during a party thrown by music icon Prince, the former personal assistant also testified. Mia said that as he played music, they danced atop his backyard pool, which was backlit and covered in purple plexiglas. "I saw his bucket hat come through the entrance and then made eye contact with him," Mia said of Combs. They ran through Prince's house and into the woods out front, where "Puff caught Cass," and started beating her, Mia said, until Prince's security intervened. Capricorn Clark, another former personal assistant and one who became one of his top marketing executives, kicked off week three of the trial by telling jurors that he once kidnapped her at gunpoint. It was December 2011, after Combs learned of rapper Kid Cudi's brief relationship with Ventura, Clark testified on May 27. Combs was "furious" with Clark for keeping him in the dark about Ventura's romance with the "Pursuit of Happiness" rapper, she said. Clark told the jury that Combs, armed with a gun, went to her house in a rage and banged on the door. Combs then took Clark to Kid Cudi's Los Angeles home, she told the jury, describing it as being "kidnapped." "The way he was acting, I just felt like anything could happen," a tearful Clark testified. In the first week of trial testimony, Ventura told jurors that starting in late 2008, she was coerced by Combs into a decade's worth of near-weekly "freak offs" — dayslong sex performances, usually at luxury hotels, involving male escorts, Glade candles, and numerous bottles of baby oil. Clark told jurors that in the years she was Combs personal assistant, from 2004 until 2006, she would set up and clean up the hotel rooms where Combs took another longterm girlfriend, model Kim Porter, the mother of four of Combs' children. During those years, Combs and Porter would stay for days at luxury hotels in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York. Clark said, as a personal assistant, she made sure Combs' suite was stocked with ecstasy, baby oil, and pricey Diptyque candles. Cleanup was tricky, Clark told jurors, who mentioned "handprints left in oil on the, like, ultra-suede wall" as a particular problem. "It was just a lot of baby oil. These were not "freak offs," Porter's former family attorney, Suzanne Kimberly Bracker, told Business Insider. "He was madly in love with Kim," said Bracker, who helped negotiate Combs' child support settlement and who said that Porter had two children with Combs at the time. "There is absolutely no way that he would share her with another man," she said. "He would tell her 'I'm not gonna pay for an apartment with my kids in one room while you're with another guy in the other bedroom.'" Kid Cudi took the witness stand in Combs' trial on May 22, telling jurors that in December 2011, the music tycoon broke into his Hollywood Hills home, enraged after finding out about the rival rapper's short-lived romance with Ventura. Kid Cudi, given name Scott Mescudi, told the jury that he returned home after the break-in to find the Christmas gifts he'd planned to give his family unwrapped and opened. His dog, he said, had been shut in the bathroom. Mescudi recalled telling Combs over the phone as he raced home to confront him. Combs was gone by the time he arrived, Mescudi said. Prosecutors alleged in court papers that Combs ordered his underlings to torch a vehicle "by slicing open the car's convertible top and dropping a Molotov cocktail inside the interior." Regina Ventura corroborated her daughter's testimony, telling jurors she witnessed the aftermath of two of Combs' violent, jealous rages over romantic rivals. The mom said Cassie Ventura came home to Connecticut for the Christmas holidays with a large bruise on her back. Combs had swiped her cellphone, Cassie Ventura testified, after learning about her affair with an unnamed professional NFL player. "He did give it back," she told jurors of the missing phone. A former Combs personal assistant described watching — and doing nothing — as his boss brutally attacked a cowering Ventura in the bedroom of the rapper's private jet. He said he turned to see Combs standing over Ventura with a "whiskey rock glass" in his hand, as she cowered on the bed. "After the glass crashed, Ventura screamed, 'Isn't anybody seeing this?'" asked a federal prosecutor, Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey. No one, he said, went back to check on Ventura after Combs left the bedroom to rejoin his employees. "I was 23 years old," Kaplan said in explanation of his own inaction. "All I wanted to do was have a great job in the entertainment industry." Ultimately, he told the jury, this and similar domestic violence incidents drove him to quit. Combs' former personal assistant spent two days on the witness stand, and in his most dramatic testimony, described how a 2008 run for cheeseburgers at an all-night diner nearly escalated the East Coast-West Coast rap wars. It started at 4 a.m. in the parking lot at Mel's Drive-In in Los Angeles, the ex-assistant, David James, testified. Combs' trusted security guard, Damian "D-Roc" Butler, noticed that Suge Knight, cofounder of rival recording studio Death Row Records, was sitting in an Escalade just a few parking spots away. James, Combs' personal assistant from 2007 to 2009, testified that he was at the wheel of Combs' silver Lincoln Navigator when Knight and D-Roc faced off. James, according to his testimony, remembered hearing Knight asking Combs' security guard, who had introduced himself as "D-Roc, Biggie's boy," a reference to the rapper Notorious B.I.G. Within moments, James and the bodyguard saw someone pass a gun to Knight and watched as four SUVs pulled up into different corners of the parking lot, he told jurors. There was no mention of whether they drove back with or without the cheeseburgers. Once back home, and as Ventura protested in tears, Combs grabbed three guns for the ten-minute drive with D-Roc back to Mel's, testified James, who said he was still the driver. Knight was nowhere to be found upon their return, James said. "It was the first time I realized my life was in danger," the former PA testified, telling jurors that he sent in his resignation soon after. Danity Kane singer Dawn Richard was the fifth prosecution witness, and her testimony on May 16 alleged that in 2009, Combs brutally beat Ventura after she took too long to cook him dinner. Richard recounted to the jury Combs shouting in 2009, as he stormed into the kitchen of his rented Los Angeles mansion. Then he dragged her upstairs by her hair, she said, adding that she then heard the sound of screaming and breaking glass from the third floor. "He said that what we saw was passion, and it was what lovers in a relationship do," Richard said. She said Combs told the two women that "he was trying to take us to the top, and that, where he comes from, people go missing if they say things like that, like, if people talk. While back on the stand on May 19, Richard re-emphasized that she felt this was a threat to her life. The details in the testimony came as a surprise to Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, who called it prejudicial and "just a drop dead lie." "And the reason we know it didn't happen is that Ms. Ventura didn't talk about it" during her four days on the witness stand. On cross-examination on May 19, Richard agreed that she only recalled the alleged death threat in speaking with prosecutors earlier this month. It had gone unmentioned, she agreed, during a half-dozen prior interviews with prosecutors. Ventura was beaten by Combs for the most minor of perceived infractions, including taking too long in the bathroom, prosecutor Emily Johnson said in her opening statement. He beat her when she left a freak off without his permission," Johnson said. Ventura's ex-best friend, Kerry Morgan, was called to the witness stand on May 19 and told jurors about two attacks on Ventura she witnessed, including one while on vacation in Jamaica in 2013. Morgan said Ventura at one point went to the bathroom at the residence where they were staying, and Combs said, "She's taking too long." "A few minutes later, I heard her screaming — like guttural. Morgan told jurors that she saw Combs push Ventura to the ground, causing her to hit her head on the paving bricks. Ventura, too, had testified that arguments with Combs would regularly result in physical abuse. Ventura —who dated Combs on and off from 2007 to 2018 — described six separate times when Combs' attacks left her with injuries, with the most severe beating occurring in Los Angeles in 2009 following a party Combs had hosted at a club called Ace of Diamonds. Combs retaliated in the back seat of a chauffeured luxury vehicle by punching and kicking Ventura throughout a ten-minute ride to the rapper's rented mansion, she said. Combs demanded she stay hidden in a hotel for a week so her bruises could heal, she said. The prosecution's fourth witness took the witness stand briefly on May 16 to detail what she and other Homeland Security investigators say they found inside Combs' suite at Manhattan's Park Hyatt New York after his September arrest. Combs had checked into the luxury Midtown hotel, his lawyers have said, in case federal prosecutors in Manhattan had asked him to surrender voluntarily. On the living room floor was a large blue party light of the kind Ventura testified were used to illuminate freak offs. Similar bags of pink powder have previously been seized from Combs and tested positive for ecstasy and other drugs, a prosecutor had said in court the day after Combs was arrested. "I think it was $10 million," Ventura said of the settlement, hesitating when asked for the total amount agreed to. The InterContinental is where security cameras captured Combs beating Ventura in a hallway in 2016, as she tried to flee what prosecutors say was one of Combs' freak offs. It was the second big-money settlement revealed in Ventura's testimony. Pop icon Britney Spears and actor Michael B. Jordan were both name-dropped on May 15, on Ventura's third day of testimony. During a cross-examination, Ventura was asked to tell the jury about the 21st birthday party Combs threw for her in 2007, at a club in Las Vegas. Ventura testified that Combs, who recently signed her to his record label, gave her an uninvited kiss in a bathroom, sparking their relationship. defense attorney Anna Estevao asked Ventura, who answered yes, there were. "Sean was there, and he brought Dallas Austin, he brought Britney Spears," Ventura said, referring to the "Oops!… I Did It Again" singer and the record producer. "I think those were the two people that stand out to me," Ventura added. Asked how a 21-year-old of limited fame was able to attract such big names to her party, Ventura credited Combs, saying, "That was all him." Jordan's name came up as the cross-examination focused on 2015, when Combs became suspicious that she was having an affair with the actor. "I would say so," Ventura answered, sounding surprised. Ventura testified on May 13 that she was initially nervous, but felt a sense of responsibility to participate in Combs' freak offs. "I was just in love and wanted to make him happy," Ventura told the jury. Ventura testified that in 2007, Combs first proposed "this sexual encounter that he called voyeurism, where he would watch me have a sexual encounter with a third man, specifically another man."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump can terminate the protected status of around 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is still pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a scathing dissent joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said the majority of the Supreme Court "has plainly botched" its assessment in granting a stay of a lower court ruling that had blocked the terminations ordered by Trump on his first day back in the White House. Until that order, the group of immigrants who had left their home countries because of conflicts there, or unsafe living or working conditions, were allowed to remain in the United States for up to two years. "I suppose, that it is in the public's interest to have the lives of half a million migrants unravel all around us before the courts decide their legal claims," Jackson wrote sarcastically in her dissent. "While it is apparent that the Government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize — not maximize — harm to litigating parties," Jackson wrote. Friday's ruling by the high court related to an executive order by Trump on Jan. 20 that instructed the Department of Homeland Security to terminate all so-called "categorical parole programs," or CHNV parole, which allowed certain immigrants to live in the United States for up to two years, and for some to legally work in the U.S. A group of plaintiffs challenged the DHS's revocation of the programs in federal court in Massachusetts, where a judge stayed the department's action after finding that federal law "requires that parole terminations occur on a case-by-case basis, rather than en masse," Jackson's dissent noted. The 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that decision. Jackson, in her dissent, wrote that the immigrants affected by Friday's decision "now face two unbearable options." "On the one hand, they could elect to leave the United States and, thereby, confront 'dangers in their native countries,' experience destructive 'family separation,' and possibly "forfei[t] any opportunity to obtain a remedy based on their . claims,' as the District Court found," Jackson wrote. "On the other, they could remain in the United States after parole termination and risk imminent removal at the hands of Government agents, along with its serious attendant consequences." "Either choice creates significant problems for respondents that far exceed any harm to the Government, should this Court decline the stay request," she wrote. We want to hear from you.

OPEC+ is considering accelerating its production increases by discussing a potential hike of more than 411,000 barrels a day for July, according to people familiar with the matter.

Eight key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners are due to hold a video conference on Saturday to discuss output policy. Their last two calls resulted in super-sized production increases that drove down prices, and the Saudi-led cartel may go even further this time, the people said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk said he had "differences of opinion" with the Trump administration during his time in government. "It's not like I agree with everything the administration does," Musk said in a forthcoming interview with "CBS Sunday Morning," a clip of which was released on Thursday. There are things I don't entirely agree with," Musk added, though he did not elaborate on what those disagreements were. On Wednesday, Musk said he was departing from the White House DOGE office. Musk's interview with CBS took place a day before he made his announcement. The full interview is set to air on Sunday. But I also don't wanna take responsibility for everything the administration's doing," he continued. Musk said in the same interview that he was "disappointed to see the massive spending bill" that House Republicans passed on May 22. I don't know if it could be both," Musk told CBS in a clip released on Tuesday. In November, Trump announced that Musk would co-lead DOGE with Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump said the cost-cutting outfit would conclude its work by July 4, 2026. Ramaswamy left DOGE in January, leaving Musk as its sole leader. But Musk's work at DOGE sparked boycotts and protests against his EV company, Tesla. Musk also faced increased calls from investors to spend more time on Tesla instead of DOGE. "My rough plan on the White House is to be there for a couple days every few weeks. Musk and the White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Behind closed doors, it's a very different conversation, said two software investors on an episode of the "Twenty Minute VC" podcast published Thursday. "Public companies are trying to prepare their teams for it, but the backlash was too strong," said Jason Lemkin, an investor in software startups. Instead, CEOs fall back on the safer line: "In fact, we're hiring." "That seems to take the edge off," Lemkin said. There's only so much honesty you can get from a CEO," he said. Rory O'Driscoll, a longtime general partner at Scale Venture Partners, said CEOs can't talk about job loss because employees will "lose their shit." He said what ends up getting shared publicly is a "very bland statement" full of "standard corporate speak for how you talk about AI." You're just going to do more interesting things," O'Driscoll said. Klarna' CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said in December that AI "can already do all of the jobs" humans do, and that the company has stopped hiring for over a year. But earlier this month, he walked it back, saying his pursuit of AI-driven job cuts may have gone too far. Duolingo's CEO, Luis von Ahn, also faced criticism after posting a memo on LinkedIn last month describing plans to make the company "AI-first." He later said on LinkedIn that he does not see AI replacing what his employees do and that Duolingo is "continuing to hire at the same speed as before." Lemkin and O'Driscoll did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Lemkin said mass layoffs could hit in the next two years as companies come to terms with a new reality. There will be "efficiencies" and also "jobs that would have existed in the absence of this product that won't exist now," said O'Driscoll. Tech companies, in particular, will see "significantly reduced hiring", he added. Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, said on Thursday that AI could soon eliminate 50% of entry-level office jobs. AI companies and the government need to stop "sugarcoating" the risks of mass job elimination in fields including technology, finance, law, and consulting, Amodei said.
